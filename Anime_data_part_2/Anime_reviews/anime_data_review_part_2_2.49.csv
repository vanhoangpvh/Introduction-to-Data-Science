Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24029/Shijou_Saikyou_no_Deshi_Kenichi_Specials,"[""As a whole this is is just a simple set of bonuses from the DVD set and is not really a need to watch, if you are bored or just a really big fan go ahead. Even then, I wouldn't particularly recommend it.The first thing that needs to be adressed is, two of the episodes are pretty much the same thing. As well you only get a small amount of screen time for 4 characters and it's ussually just a bit of fan service (not hating, just stating).Finally the last important thing to note is the final episodes has nothing to do with Kenichi...and the rest of the cast. To be honest I have no idea why it was even made or put in the DVD set. and the rest of the cast. To be honest I have no idea why it was even made or put in the DVD set.""]"
Tsuki ga Kirei Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36539/Tsuki_ga_Kirei_Special,"[""Here's my TLDR of this Tsuki ga Kirei Special:If you recall those funny shorts that were screened at the end of the episode (not all episodes had this, but most did) there are an additional 15 minutes worth of new and different shorts. Nothing special like a new OVA or continuation after the main events, but extra shorts that weren't able to be included in the aired season.All of them gave me good laughs, unfortunately none of the shorts contained a certain couple together that we love the most.Great shorts Feels Studio. I would hope someday that with the BD sales that were racked...up, we could see a potential OVA in the near future :) up, we could see a potential OVA in the near future :)"", ""15 minutes of bonus Tsuki ga Kirei comedy shorts - who would say no? I loved this almost as much as I adored the anime, which is saying something. The feels, the laughs, the butterfly feeling - it's all there in compact size!! I laughed so much, the comedy is honestly so perfect. If you enjoyed the anime, you MUST watch this too. :) Also we get a little bit more depth to all the supporting characters, which I love!! Please, Studio Feel, make more of these clips!!I would describe every short in great detail but you'd be better off watching it lol. No spoilers...but be prepared to laugh A LOT! but be prepared to laugh A LOT!"", ""Tsuki Ga Kirei Special SummaryBy: Seiji KishiThis Special Episode is a compilation of short clips about every characters of the story. Funny scenarios which is totally not suitavle on the main story. I think, that is why this was created. It is cute, and adorable to watch. It will only take 15 minutes of your time and believe me, some of those clips will make you burst into laughter.Overall: 9Plot: 10This series has been residing on my phone for almost a year now, I guess. I tried watching it previously and giving episode one a shot. This story is super light hearted and pure that...I did not find myself continuing watching it. Might be because I've watch too many love stories and this kind of thing is very rare to me. The relationship of the main characters are slow pace, innocent, and young. It will make you miss how simple minded you are when you are young and how little thinga can flutter your heart. The story don't have any complex plot, or tragic lives, or something unique to show. It is just a simple but real romance that people nowadays forgotten. It was a love at first sight, a young love, a teenage love, a love of a lifetime.Characters: 9Not all characters are supposed to be popular, beautiful as a goddess, genius, prodigy. And that is what this series will show you. Every characters don't need to stand on the spotlight, some just need to make their own story on their own way. There's nothing amazing on both of the main characters. They are just an ordinary schoolers, studying in a average school, living the life they have. The way they struggle to get their feelings expressed on one another is just too cute. It is genuine. There's just one character on the story that I kind of dislike. She and her so so innocent act is really irritating. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't like her.Art and Animation: 9I love the songs in this series. It is fleeting in the heart, and calm. It feels like you are standing in the middle of the forest full of flowers, with fresh air and a sound of water flowing near you. It is refreshing. The animation of the story is somewhat alike with Kimi no Nawa. Or maybe the main character only? She looks like Mitsuha. It is not my type of art, honestly. But I think that it perfectly fit the story. The calmness on the face of every character, the gracefulness of their movements, the voice they utter, it really matches the theme of the story and how cool is that, really.Enjoyment: 8You have to get used to it. You have to absorv that this story is not your typical shoujo anime with a lot of cliches. It won't show the character getting sick bed and is visited by their partner. It won't show something like a popular guy falling for a timid girl or vice versa. In short, you will have to prepare that it is a love story that might be boring for some, but refreshing for most. Well honestly, I got bored of it at first. But then, I realized it is a good watch. And then, I find myself close to the ending.Ending: 9I expected the ending. Well, the part where the ending show they did end up together, married with a son or daughter is really great. I love that kind of ending, in a love story that is. But before that, the thing that will make their relationship waiver. I knew it will end up that way. I just don't like how the main character of the story based his decision on the pulse of his heart, literally. That's just how young ones are, maybe. Most of the time, they just don't think at all. They grab onto something, hoping, wanting, without even thinking about each and every details of whys. I'm glad that it end up the way I want it. I did not find myself continuing watching it.

As said in my review of the full anime, all the side characters/couples are the typical tropes we see in most romance anime, and that's why I love them.You have a couple where the male teases a lot and is openly romantic, while the female is a tsundere and blushes a lot.Another couple where the guy is dependent (in a funny way), class clown, popular and the female SOMEHOW puts up with all of that and wears the pants in the relationship.A more down-to-earth couple where the guy...is a perfect boyfriend and gentleman and yet the female jokingly (I think and hope) doesn't acknowledge that they're together and is very chill and casual about everything (yet unsurprisingly makes a big deal out of things, ideal bi-polarity). (Though by how they spend their time together and some scenes, it's blatantly obvious they're in a relationship).AND SAKURA. I would LOVE to see Sakura as a main character in an anime (if there's a character like her in one PLEASE recommend it to me) because she'd be the PERFECT MC in both a romance and comedy anime.In other words, the specials are 100% worth watching and are also part of the main anime, right after the credits. I wish it was longer, but oh well.

The skits don't add anything to the plot so anyone can watch it while also watching the main series; I watched this after I finished the main episodes just to seal off my journey watching this series.The skits are pretty hilarious, especially the ones that focus on Kotarou's parents. If there is something I hope the special could have focused more on, it would be Ryokou-sensei and Roman's relationship because the main series already introduced them as what we already know but...failed to capitalize it.There is nothing else I can say about Tsuki ga Kirei Special other than it's short and supplementary though I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who just picked up the series.

Slayers: The Motion Picture,https://myanimelist.net/anime/536/Slayers__The_Motion_Picture,"['I was planning on reviewing the Valkyria Chronicles anime this week, but things have been rather hectic and I wasn\'t able to finish it. I\'ll just have to take care of that one next week. In the meantime, let\'s talk about the Slayers. The Slayers is pretty well known to anime fans. It has over fifty light novels, five anime series, five films, two OVAs, video game adaptations and several manga. It\'s by far Kanzaka Hajime\'s best known and most influential work. When I initially saw the original anime, I hated it. See, my brother got several VHS\'s of the English dubbed version, since all...of us speak English and, supposedly, they were cheaper that way. The voice acting was terrible and hurt my head. I had to use ear plugs whenever he played the tapes since he\'s an inconsiderate clod who put the volume up far too high. It wasn\'t until later, when I tried the anime subtitled that I came to appreciate it and now I\'ve got a Lina Inverse plush sitting on my shelf between Edward Elric and Sailor Neptune. Now, I obviously didn\'t have time to rewatch the whole franchise or even just the first anime series. I did, however, rewatch the first film. So let\'s take a look at Slayers: The Motion Picture.The story is a prequel to the first anime series, and it\'s competently written so it can stand on its own. As such, I won\'t be going into any details about the backstory. The story follows the sorceress Lina Inverse and her friendly rival/sidekick, Naga the Serpent. They get discount tickets to a strange island famous for its hot spring. While there they embark on a quest to unravel the truth about the island and the unusual power affecting it. It\'s what you would expect from the Slayers. The story is full of absurdity played up for laughs, action, some intrigue and absurd action. The plot is pretty straight forward, but it works pretty well. The only real issue with the film is that it should have been longer. It\'s barely an hour and the story rushes through the important points as a result. It\'s still hilarious, but it could\'ve used more time to flesh things out.The characters in this are a bunch of strange, silly people. They aren\'t particularly deep, but they work exceedingly well for a comedic work. And their motivations and actions do make sense, which is better than some supposedly serious anime manage. Still, don\'t expect deep characters with fascinating psychological aspects.The art in this looks rushed. It\'s in the general style of the rest of the series, but the colours look duller and the animation looks sloppier. It still looks okay, but not nearly as good as the regular series. I would criticise Naga\'s outfit, but it\'s clearly meant to be a parody of the ""battle bikini"" convention you frequently see in fantasy works rather than being designed for fan-service. Frankly, the satire works pretty well since it\'s actual done in a deliberate and aware fashion rather than fan-service which attempts to excuse itself as a parody.the vocal cast in this is excellent. Takayama Minami, Kawamura Maria, Genda Tessyo and, especially, Hayashibara Megumi all do really well in their roles. There is some exaggeration which can get tiring, but it\'s used for comedic effect and, generally, works. The music is really amazing. the film is certainly an auditory treat.The yuri factor is a 1/10. This doesn\'t have yuri.So, how does the first Slayers movie hold up? The humour works really well. The characters, though not deep, are fun. The acting and music are excellent. That being said, the art is only okay and the story is pretty rushed. It\'s a quick, fun watch. My final rating is a 7/10. Check it out if you need a good laugh. If you want something with depth, look elsewhere.

The movie itself was released in July of 1995, after approximately half the television series had run its course. Do you remember that I mentioned wanting to see Slayers since I saw a trailer for one of the movies? This is the movie I was talking about.After a misunderstanding regarding some bandits, Lina Inverse runs into Naga the Serpent, a rival of hers, and they end up going to a famous hot spring together. The hot spring itself is...located on a mysterious island, shrouded in mist, that only seems to open for visitors once a year. Soon, Lina finds out that something terrible happened on this island many years before, and it's up to her to right the wrongs committed by the evil being that still lurks.Hot springs? Sounds like an excuse for some fan service! Well, say what you want, but there's an amazingly small amount of “ecchi” in this film. The bulk of it is provided by Naga's outfit merely existing. It's basically a bikini, and more or less a reference to how female warriors are pretty much nude in a lot of fantasy comics and games. The outfit itself is handled quite tastefully, and there isn't much in the way of perverse camera angles obviously meant to monopolize her skin-tight threads.As for the story itself, Slayers Perfect starts off comedic, dabbles in a bit of mystery, and ends off with a short battle and some celebrations. You can even find a bit of a moral in the last five minutes of the movie if you squint. Slayers: The Motion Picture may not have a bad idea for a plot (far from it), but it does suffer from being a bit rushed. Some scenes have awkward transitioning and the movie's pacing alternates from being too slow or too fast at varying points during its runtime of about sixty-five minutes. It really ought to have been more competently planned out, or been longer (by, say, at least thirty more minutes perhaps).Speaking of competence, the movie is written well enough that at the very least, you don't need to be familiar with the television series to watch it. It could even serve as a window to help deciding whether you want to give the original anime a go. Aspects that are explained or referenced in the television series are also explained or referenced in the movie where pertinent, and the film doesn't treat you as if you are already familiar with Lina or Naga (the latter of whom doesn't appear in the first season of the anime anyway).The primary protagonists of Slayers Perfect are, of course, Lina and Naga. Both are proficient sorceresses. Lina acts much the same as she did in the television series – for the uninitiated, a gluttonous and money-loving teenager. We don't get much out of Naga this time around, but at least she is amusing with her arrogance and manages to be quite intriguing. Rowdy Gabriev joins Lina and Naga as a hero, although he mostly passes on advice and cryptic messages and his role as a whole can't truly be explored in a review without digging up some spoilers. The side characters exist and serve their purpose, but unlike the first season of Slayers, none are particularly memorable or striking. Character development is nonexistent in this film. There isn't much to say about the subject other than that.The animation of this film was handled by J.C. Staff as opposed to SoftX, so we can see some subtle character design differences and a general change in art style. The colours are a bit darker and muted, and the movie has an overall grungy, dirty look despite its material. The animation is nothing to sneeze about, though. It's pretty well-done and good quality for a film; however, it would have certainly benefited from using the same sort of palette as the television series.Hayashibara Megumi shines again with her song Midnight Blue, which serves as the movie's ending theme and has got to be my favourite track I've heard from her yet. It is haunting albeit melodic and I love listening to it. The rest of Slayers Perfect's soundtrack could use some work. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not something to really write home about. Hayashibara does a good job as Lina Inverse as per usual, and the rest of the Japanese VAs are adequate. Kawamura Maria deserves special mention for her role as Naga, and that amazing laugh that almost rivals Sumeragi Hokuto's (Tokyo Babylon).Slayers Perfect wasn't necessarily a letdown, but it certainly wasn't anything to write home about, either. It's a nice little stand alone addition to the Slayers franchise, and it gives us some curiosity to deal with regarding Naga and her relationship with Lina, but that's pretty much it. Don't expect to be blown away by it; it's just a little taste of what the first season brought us. located on a mysterious island, shrouded in mist, that only seems to open for visitors once a year.

I\'ve got one thing to say to start this review off: Where\'ve I been these past 16 years!!This movie is on the same ENJOYMENT RATE as Slayers NEXT. Except for different reasons, of course.This movie had elements of Ranma, Dragon Half, and Magic Knight Rayearth in it! This was probably the biggest lure since whip creamed waffles! Seriously though, we had three Hot Spring girls in there with names that went with other classics! One of them went by the name Shampoo even!Lina\'s scene-time back in her hometown of Zil... .. something other? XD was that of Ranma Girl-Type! And...as we already know, the Japanese voice for Ran-Chan in Ranma 1/2 is the same as Lina\'s Japanese voice. So it makes sense! :DIt was this movie that made me finally Dial In to the idea that Lina\'s flying spell (Raywing) is a combined name of both Hikaru\'s Rayeath Rune God and Fuu\'s Windam Rune God! :D Those are also my two favorite characters in Magic Knight Rayearth! ... Except Wing and Wind are not necessarily the same name... but... they are both Ariel names, right? XDI have no idea who the blue-haired Gourry is, but am assuming he\'s a descendant of his? It was easy to call that he possessed the Sword of Light when he was holding it as just a hilt! :)Basically with this Movie, I continued to make calls in it left, right and center. Another reason why it was a Masterpiece to me. I am not in sync like this with just any anime haha! Another time was when the Sage dude was telling Lina about the Fountain of Growth. ... Keyword, ""Growth!"" XDOh, and speaking of the Fountain of Growth that shape shifts the person who plunges into it, anyone know what this sounds like? XDLina\'s spells looked great in this series. She had a lot more ways of casting the Fire Ball, spells like the Dragon Slayer (Slave) had a different spell casting chant, which was also really catchy! Lina\'s apparel looked great, too! More like the manga!Naga (Pronounced Nahga) was like the Kodachi Kuno of the series haha. She was great! I knew Slayers had been missing the spark of a good rival character in the three seasons of the original series. she seems to have an interesting type of magic, too!I think there were two or three moments in total that made me go into critiquing mode though lol. One was when the Sage dude was talking to Lina in the house... the scene kind of repeated itself there, and it wasn\'t because it was the half way point or anything lol. Kinda made me think that I accidentally clicked on the computer screen and made the episode skip back or something lol. Another time was when the Sword of Light from blue-haired Gourry fell right in front of him. The animation there kind of felt off to me a bit haha. There were also moments where the Reptilian Boss grabbed the Sword of Light BY ITS LIGHT-BLADE with his hand! That\'s like reaching out and grabbing a Light-saber by its blade! IMPOSSIBLE!But ya! :3  It got an Overall 10! Because it was Super-Great! :D as we already know, the Japanese voice for Ran-Chan in Ranma 1/2 is the same as Lina\'s Japanese voice. So it makes sense! :DIt was this movie that made me finally Dial In to the idea that Lina\'s flying spell (Raywing) is a combined name of both Hikaru\'s Rayeath Rune God and Fuu\'s Windam Rune God! :D Those are also my two favorite characters in Magic Knight Rayearth! ...

Because it was Super-Great! :D', 'The Slayers Motion Picure felt like a quick after-thought from the outstanding orignal ""The Slayers"" TV series.Though the plot was pretty straight forward and even somewhat thought out, I felt as if everything was rushed.  I have never been one who overly cares if a series spends hours developing the characters within, but if I hadn\'t already seen the TV series I would have no idea who these people are and why they are doing what they are doing.The art throughout also seems a little less vibrant, using darker shades of all previous colors.  Even Lina herself was less imaculate then before....She still looked the same, but different, if you catch my drift.One of the great things about the original series was the interaction between Lina and her cohorts.  This time she was travelling with someone completely new, and though certainly easy on the eyes, she was given no time to develop as a main character.  She was passed off as Lina\'s closest rival, yet with what was seen in the movie, most half wit wizards could wipe their ass with her skimpy wardrobe without breaking a sweat.  It just seemed forced.The music was sub standard, but not dreadful.  Basically the type of music you would hear from an 80\'s video arcade game.  Lots of keyboard smashing and no layering.  The voice acting on the other hand I liked.  Lina was as perfect as usually, Nana (her companion)(I think that was her name) had even a higher pitched voice and a laugh that most would find annoying, but I was really into, and the supporting casts did their jobs well.The main villian was given a complex that screamed evil and with a short flash-back and a breif moment of actual story development, you learn to hate the bastard.  I\'m into hating the ""bad guys"" so I guess that was another plus.All in all, I can\'t say that I hated the motion picture, but don\'t go into this movie with the same expections as the TV series.

That said, it falls flat in nearly every way and doesn’t entertain as thoroughly as the series did.In this film Lina runs into Naga, a dark mage and Lina’s biggest rival, and the two decide to run off to a hot spring island that was once populated by elves. When they get there they face off against a myriad of mostly hilarious enemies, eventually getting to the rip-off...hot spring. Later on, Lina takes on a demon and goes back in time to save the lost elves and return the hot spring to its former glory.This film is a prequel to the television series meaning we’re not spending time with the characters we’ve come to love; all we have is Lina (who is, again, a selfish, loud, and pretty annoying girl). Naga joins the fray here, a character who doesn’t add much of anything to the series as a whole and isn’t unique enough to be interesting. She’s a moronic bimbo mage who laughs at everything and has huge tits.In any other context this character would be bad but especially in the context of having seen The Slayers before this movie it’s rather painful. If anything Naga is the fapbait character who would make sense if she were part of a larger group but doesn’t need to be spotlighted as heavily as she is in this film. It just brings the movie down.Regardless, the humor is still here and just as entertaining as ever, especially the owner of the hot spring. The world itself is a lot livelier than the TV series as well, adding in unique and interesting creatures as well as having more to offer in visual splendor. This film looks fantastic, even by today’s standards.The film is sixty minutes long though you can tell the filmmakers had a lot more planned due to the very abrupt ending. The movie spends a lot of time building up to the meeting between Lina and the demon (in fact, about half the movie has very little to do with the actual plot) and around the last ten minutes the film quickly cuts to the final battle without any real explanation or bridge between the previous scene and the action. Then the film is over, you’re left scratching your head, and you forget you ever saw it.It’s not that Slayers: The Motion Picture is bad, it’s that it lost a lot of what made the TV series work. Without the likable cast of idiots and the empathetic bad guys, the movie really can’t use Lina and Naga’s tits as the two crutches to hold it up. Naga doesn’t even need to exist. Despit    e being with Lina through the entire adventure when our heroine is transported back in time for the final battle, Naga is nowhere to be scene, leading me to wonder just what the hell the point of having Naga tag along was.Alas, if you’re a hardcore fan of the series you’ll probably want to watch the movie for curiosities sake, but I can’t otherwise suggest it. It doesn’t offer much and there’s really no reward for getting through it. It’s just a pointless sixty minute exercise in mediocrity. hot spring.

It was alright. It was reluctant to watch it, because to me, Slayers ain't Slayers without Lina's familiar companions (Gourry, Zelgadis, Amelia, etc.), but I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try anyway, and I was positively surprised. It was alright. Not as outstandingly amazing as the anime show, but neither particularly bad.If you want to get into Slayers, maybe start with this instead of the anime show, because this is a prequel to the anime show.Animation is good (peak 90s animation), voice acting is good, the story is okay, but...overall, it's nothing to write home about. overall, it's nothing to write home about."", 'This is quite an interesting show basically going along the lines of the OVA rather then the TV show. You know the one with the really scantily clad Naga the Serpent. Now though I really don’t like Naga, I do like the movies plot. This story has Lina heading to an elf town and defeating a demon. It would be no different then any other episode except this is when she is first introduced to the sword of light.Naga is a really stupid woman who couldn’t even tell when someone is actually a bandit. Sometimes I think the only reason they brought her in...is to make a reason for Lina to go the island where the story takes place. The bandits are extremely stupid, and I have to say they didn’t show any thought in creating them. All the teams seem to be families. Other enemies seem to do long winded explanations on what there diabolical plans are before they even fight Lina (Of course, I don’t understand how everyone knows her on the island as well but that’s another story). Other characters seem as though they were quickly put together and given stupid names.Sadly, most of the show does have a rather ‘filler’ feeling about it. The ending was rather anti-climatic, only about 10 minutes of the long movie so it feels bland in that aspect. I may have loved the journey, but the finish line felt like it was lacking.The artwork shows its age rather nicely actually. It means that the show might look rather old but it to me, it’s almost a classic. The style while slightly rough has a lot of detail in the backgrounds and even in some characters that move around. The monsters are a little generic but extremely detailed in how they move and attack. They must have put a decent amount of money into this when it was made.The English voices are sometimes ok, though a couple of the girls voices sound like they are straining there voice, but it doesn’t get to bad. Lina really sounds whinny, Cynthia Martinez makes her sound like she is on the verge of losing her voice most of the time for how high pitched she is. Phil Ross on the other hand makes a great Rowdy and David Bell does do a really good of Young Rowdy, making them seem like they really could have been the same voice.  Again, I wasn’t keen on Naga’s stupid laugh. I can give props to Kelly Manison for doing a pretty good job on the voice though, for playing a rather annoying character to begin with anyway. The script though is sometimes cheesy and sometimes rather cleaver with the jokes. It made the show stand out in that fashion. I do have some problems with the dub in that once in a while they throw a curve ball into the mix like having the demon cry out Sylvester’s saying from Looney Toons or some other parody. It may work in some extent for American watchers but for those that look for a closer dubbing, this is not one. I’m also not into the change that they did to the signature spells that Lina has.It’s sad whenever I have to review a show that I like and it falls short. Sadly, I can’t give this a 5 star rating but it is worth watching if you like a bit of comedy or the normal TV and OVA shows of slayers. Plus, as said in the description, this does actually link to Gourry Gabriev from the TV show so its kind of funny seeing the link. is to make a reason for Lina to go the island where the story takes place.

Lina bumbles around for most of the movie until she stumbles upon plot but by then movie is almost over. I think pacing like this would be fine if it was in TV series, but it doesn't fit standalone movie.Nevertheless, if you are fan of Slayers, it's a serviceable prequel that is kinda fun. If you are new to the series, please start with TV series, manga or light novels. And even if you are fan, there is better Slayers Movies and OVA's. "", ""I've been a big fan of Slayers since discovering the TV series in the late '90s, which I've seen the first 3 seasons of. I always enjoyed it for how entertaining and humorous it was, a sort of diametrically opposed companion to The Record of Lodoss War, another favorite of mine growing up. Oddly enough, I have never seen any of the films or OVAs, so having decided to go back and revisit the TV series for a blast of nostalgia, I figured now was the time to check them out. First off, the animation here of the first film is just great. Anyone that...is familiar with the original 3 seasons of the TV series knows for whatever reason, the quality of releases over the years in regards to PQ isn't the best (why I couldn't say), making the show look far older than it actually is and sort of paling in comparison to the preservation of other anime series released around the same time. So seeing Lina and her universe in such clear, nice quality was a joy. Just like the series, the story is a light affair, with copious amounts of comedy, oddball villains, and a quick pace. I will say that I thought the story being told came off a bit on the unimportant side overall, for some reason. Sure, as I've said, the series is definitely light-hearted, but this comes off even less weighty than the TV series. It's certainly still a fun little romp, though.The biggest thing to mention here though is the introduction of Naga, Lina's sidekick/rival/tag-along, or whatever you'd like to call her. As all of the movies and OVAs take place before the start of the series, this was my first introduction to her, and boy is she a ton of fun. She's a great companion for Lina on her travels, their interactions with one another are well-done, and their relationship dynamic feels different than that of Line and her travelling buddies in the TV series. And then there's Naga's laugh, which is over-the-top, borderline annoying, but kept making me grin like an idiot. It fits the tone of the Slayers universe perfectly. If I was subjected to that cackle in any other form of media, I'd probably have a whole different take on the subject.So yeah, I'm glad I'm finally getting a chance to see this side of the Slayers franchise that I never have before. And hey, if you've never seen ANY of this series, this is actually a perfect place to start. As a prequel, you don't need to know anything going in, and could probably just stick with the movies and OVAs if 100+ episodes of a TV series looks a little too daunting. But trust me, if you end up enjoying this, you'll want to check out the TV series, as it's just as zany and as much of a blast as this. Slayers is sorta like a bag of super sugary candy; sure, it's bad for you and you'll probably get a cavity or two, but it's hard to say no to just one more piece. is familiar with the original 3 seasons of the TV series knows for whatever reason, the quality of releases over the years in regards to PQ isn't the best (why I couldn't say), making the show look far older than it actually is and sort of paling in comparison to the preservation of other anime series released around the same time.

Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor,https://myanimelist.net/anime/75/Soukyuu_no_Fafner__Dead_Aggressor,"['This review is based on 4 rewatches of the anime in 2 years. So I hope this will be as unbiased as possible. As a long time Xebec fan, I must say this is by FAR the best mecha anime they\'ve produced to date. Now I shall try to break it down to different components.Story: The story began with a paradise-like environment, but it quickly turned into a scene of chaotic desperateness. With tons of downhill battles to begin the story, it certainly illustrates how desperate the situation is for the protagonists (and the small group of humans living on that remote island). For a...mecha anime, it is not very common to start the story the way Fafner did.Art: The animation is directed by the same guy whose responsible for Gundam SEED and Destiny. So it is only natural that people see similarities between characters (for example, I find Kazuki very much like Shinn). With that being said, I find it a bit lacking in originality so minus 1!Sound: Absolutely stunning. The battle music is very unique and alive! I especially love the drum beat. The OP and ED are by Angela (who sang FFXII\'s opening).Character: Most character development occurred during the 2nd half of the anime (when things become less gloomy), which was a good thing because there was no room in the first half to fit those in with all the intense battles and basic background storying telling. Again minus -1 for some unoriginal character design.Enjoyment + Overall: Although it was hardly advertised (ie. lack of media attention), Fafner\'s success was undeniable. Just ask yourself this, how many anime (or how many anime done by Xebec to be more precise) actually got a prequel/sequel to further expand on the story? Well Fafner is one of those! With a touching story that can make even the toughest man cry a river, this anime is definitely one of the ""emo-est"" show ever! mecha anime, it is not very common to start the story the way Fafner did.Art: The animation is directed by the same guy whose responsible for Gundam SEED and Destiny.

It is underrated as a series. I've watch this anime 1 year ago but I'll do my best to write the review about it.Story:The story has a nice flow. Like all mecha series, it got fantastic mechas with specialized specification for each mechas, skills training and conflict between characters, powerful enemies and realiable reason(s) for fighting. Not to mention 'best friend theme' where we can find alot in other anime is also included.The start of this anime which shows peaceful school days for main characters, Kazuki and his friend make a nice twist...when the secret of the island and the reason the island is the last line of defense is exposed. As we goes more into the episodes, more secret/mystery will be reveal. I guess that was attracted me the most. The anticipation of 'what's more' and hard to guess 'what next'.Art and Sound:I have no comment on the arts and sound due to my limited knowledge. But I would say, the arts and sound is good, really helping in making you enjoying the stories.Character:All the characters are well made. The relations between the characters are well explained and there's nice development of characters along the series. What interested me the most is, how fair development of characters is given to all cast, not only focusing on the main characters. You will also noticed the variation of attitudes and issues between the casts is brought up in the series.Overall , I enjoy the series. It's one of the series where I can't put down until I finished it. And I would love to have a rewatch of this anime *if only my sis will return it to me rite nw*. The only reason the anime didn't get a full 10 from me is due to ending which left me a little unsatisfied/sad. But it's the matter of opinion. But really, it's only the last part that I'll leave it to your opinon, the rest of the anime is great!!. when the secret of the island and the reason the island is the last line of defense is exposed.

Whether or not it does it well is hard to say however; it has its strengts but also its distinct weaknesses.The series start off quite calmly on your average tropical Japanese island, where a group of kids are attending school as if life was nothing unusual. However, soon a Festum (the series\' supernatural/extraterrestrial race) attacks the island,...and it is not long before it is revealed that the island is in fact a moving fortress, and the last remnants of a Japan annihalated in the human-Festum war. Also, these kids, with Makabe Kazuki as the lead acre, are revealed to be the only characters capable of piloting a series of robots known as the Fafner - and thus mankind\'s main hope for survival.From here the plot accelerates, slowly, but steadily. It tends to stumble at points, and it, like many mecha series of its kind, has all these weird concepts and technologies, many of which are hardly, if even, explained. A pill you have to learn to swallow, I guess. The pacing is generally good, though, taking time to relax and develop the characters inbetween the more action-filled sequences.Unfortunately, it suffers from the ""frequently not making sense"" syndrome, and from time to time characters say absolutely nonsensical things, or explain concepts in such a manner; I can only assume this is an attmept to be deep and mysterious gone slightly awry.Its charcaters are a mixed bunch; your average cast of mentally depraved teenagers; most of them having troubles with depressing pasts, extreme self-confidence issues or other such negatively laden emotions and experiences. They\'re handled respectably, for the most part, and some of their stories are quite fresh and almost touching. Some, however, fall short of the stereotype treshold both in concept and execution, while others are victims of the ""repetitive gag"" syndrome, and one or two at least are victims of ""not making sense"" syndrome.As a whole however, both the characters\' conflicts and the plot made me want to keep watching, made me wonder how it would end up in the end. Was I satisfied? Yes, and no. There\'s no top marks, but it certainly wasn\'t bad.The series\' soundtrack is very often absent, or quiet - which can be efficacious at times, but at other times I feel it works against it purpose. When there is music, it\'s generally good; a few outstanding tracks and a lot of generic ones; especially towards the end of the series there are a few very good themes that are used. The opening and ending themes are performed by angela, a band whose msuic I love more and more by the minute. Their vocalist has an amazing voice, making the themes are a true pleasure to listen to! Voice acting is generally solid, with a few outliers in both directions - as with the rest of the show, it is generalyl not mad, but not outstanding either.Animation-wise, the series tend to be, at times, quite iffy, especially when it comes to character designs and facial reactions. The mecha are animated well and the battles are entertaining to watch. The colouring is a bit bland, but is remedied by good work in the lighting and shading departments.Thematically it touches upon many subjects that its genre brethren touches upon. Death, and existence. Individuality, and life. The Festum have a habit of asking the seemingly insignificant question ""are you there?"" - a question with a more metaphysical implication than one would think at first. Can you truly be said to live, to be here, if you have no reason for living? If life holds no intrinsical value for you?Summarized, I\'d say that Fafner is a solid series. It\'s nothing outstanding, nothing extremely great, and there are mecha series of its kind that are better - but it was enjoyable. The series finale was good. The soundtrack was as dramatic as it needed to be. It had its distinct detracting elements, but nothing you can\'t swallow and see past, resulting in a fairly enjoyable experience. and it is not long before it is revealed that the island is in fact a moving fortress, and the last remnants of a Japan annihalated in the human-Festum war.

The mecha are animated well and the battles are entertaining to watch. The colouring is a bit bland, but is remedied by good work in the lighting and shading departments.Thematically it touches upon many subjects that its genre brethren touches upon. Death, and existence. Individuality, and life. The Festum have a habit of asking the seemingly insignificant question ""are you there?"" - a question with a more metaphysical implication than one would think at first. Can you truly be said to live, to be here, if you have no reason for living? If life holds no intrinsical value for you?Summarized, I\'d say that Fafner is a solid series. It\'s nothing outstanding, nothing extremely great, and there are mecha series of its kind that are better - but it was enjoyable. The series finale was good. The soundtrack was as dramatic as it needed to be. It had its distinct detracting elements, but nothing you can\'t swallow and see past, resulting in a fairly enjoyable experience.', 'The beginning of Fafner was quite confusing as it went straight to the action.  Going straight into the action is often never a good idea since it&rsquo;ll leave the viewers confused.  Now if this were only the first episode and the second episode takes place a few months earlier then it would work.  Gungrave, Berserk, and the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya used this technique.  Haruhi used it quite effectively as it made more viewers come back for the 2nd episode to figure out what was going on.  I guess my biggest problem is the fact that the action was relentless...for around 9 episodes and they tried to create drama in that time frame.  This is simply not possible with out proper character development/knowing the characters.  For example, a certain character dies and they make it quite a big event and extremely dramatic.  However, this character was only a step above some random faceless character.  If this series were 50 episodes then I can under stand the pacing but it was only 25 episodes.  It&rsquo;s as if the creators realized that Fafner wasn&rsquo;t popular enough to make into 50 episodes and cut their losses.Around half way through the series, Fafner starts to slow down.  Here things got better as there was proper character building and story progression.  Now when drama hits it can actually affect the viewer.  Sadly this happened way too late in a 25 episode series as there was quite a bit of potential in the Fafner universe.  Thankfully, Fafner does save itself by creating a satisfying conclusion, albeit a bit rushed.  I also felt that Fafner could have improved its ending by providing some kind of epilogue.Music was one of Fafner&rsquo;s better qualities, especially the OP/ED.  Also, the character designs were the same as Gundam SEED so it quite hard not to make comparisons.  However, in terms of animation quality Fafner compares quite favorably.  So while the beginning went straight to the action and was a bit confusing it was nevertheless pretty.  If you&rsquo;re a mecha fan then its almost worth watching just for the action scenes.  As far as I recall Fafner doesn&rsquo;t use repeated animation sequences, one of my pet peeves.Fafner is a fairly entertaining mecha anime, especially for mecha fans.  It features good animation and very good music.  However, Fafner didn&rsquo;t provide anything exceptional and doesn&rsquo;t rise above the pack of mecha anime.  In addition, it was severally hurt by inappropriate pacing for a 25 episode series.  It is quite sad to see so much wasted potential.  Finally a proper epilogue would have greatly benefited the series. for around 9 episodes and they tried to create drama in that time frame.

As a french person it\'s not always very easy for me.It\'s been awhile since I didn\'t not rewatch this serie and I should do so. This anime is one of my favorite anime of all time for now and I doubt that one day it will dropped from my top ten. I\'m doing this review by trying to covince the more people to watch this awesome serie.Story: Incredible!! It was so well built that when I watch it I was like: EH!!It could happen one day in a not so far future. There\'s no cliché except for the first episode...when Kazuki became the pilot of the Fafner Mark Elf because, currently, is the only one who can do this. Wait... this isn\'t even a cliché... it\'s an anime law come to think of it. At the beginning, you may look at this and say: well... it\'s like kira yamato. He will fight to protect his friends.  Fortunately, this is not what will happen, since all of Kazuki\'s friends will fight one day. People sometime made comparison between Fafner and Evangelion. Yeah... maybe sometime... but I like Faner more than Evangelion (the anime of Evagelion is a little bit disappointing, but the manga is really good). Also some people complain that the show is slow and the battles are boring. Do not forget, there\'s a lot of character development in that show and I disagree for the battles, there\'s no stock animation like *cough*Seed Destiny*cough* and they are very thrilling. And the final, just completely amazing and outstanding!!So for the story: 10/10 (just awesome).Art: Again, you have Hisashi Hirai doing a lot of characters that we might have seen in his others series. For example: Kazuki is a mix of Shinn Asuka and Athrun Zala in my opinion (not in personnality fortunately). My point is, if you like Hisashi\'s design like me, you\'re gonna fall in love with the characters. The mecha are also really special. Like Code Geass, there are really different from the other shows you might have seen. By the way they look, they seem to have no ""face"". A head but no face. You know what... there a really cool and I can\'t understand people saying they look like EVA. They are really different.Art: 9/10Sound: This is one of the best soundtrack I ever heard. The choice of instruments are excellent. It fits perfectly with the action and the calm moments. Also, I\'m a big fan of Angela\'s opening and I will say that it\'s probably my favorite opening of all show that I watched until now.Sound: 9/10Character: This is where Fafner gets, in my opinion, 12/10. The characters are very enjoyable and interresting, but they put also some ""cliché"" in their personality. Do you need to care about this cliché, NO!! By the way it\'s handle, there\'s no problem with the characters personnality, because there just to lovable. You have your main character who is really calm and happy with is life at the beginning, but want to end all the terror once he gets into the fight. You have the girl who seem not worthy enough to pilot a mecha, but at the end, is one of the best pilot they could get. You have the guy who hate to fight and doesn\'t want to be involved. The guy who is scare about the battle, the guy who doesn\'t give a crap about the pilot, but cares about the Fafner, the little girl who is sick and can\'t do anything, the girl who wants to become a pilot to avenge her father\'s death and the guy who wants to fight with a giant robot. But all of them will change during this serie (some of them will die during the show) and this is what is really the best about this anime.Character: 12/10 (I don\'t care if the limite is ten).Enjoyment: In 2 episodes, I became impossible to stop. I watched the serie in 3 days and was really amaze by this show that handle the story and the characters like no one does.Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: I won\'t say it\'s the best show of all time, since I didn\'t watch necessarily a lot of anime, but I know how to determine what is a really good show. Watch it, you won\'t be deceived!!Overall: 10/10 OUTSTANDING!!!!!! when Kazuki became the pilot of the Fafner Mark Elf because, currently, is the only one who can do this.

The drama is filled with cheesy lines and other additions such as forced tears and little to no sufficient character development to ensure viewers would feel anything during these emotional or dramatic scenes.  During fights pilots often scream like maniacs and it can carry on a bit too long when they do.  Only a few characters have any...development or capacity to draw viewers in enough for form a connection.  Most enemy characters have no sense of connection or development that result in enemies a bit too flat.  The flow of the story draws little to no distinction who the enemies are and yet the islanders end up feeling like abused victims though they never appear to blame any of the enemies or have the will to resist or retaliate once they are face to face.  Nothing really stands out as unique so about the series from other mecha or other anime.Positives:*Untapped potential to be a much better anime*A theme of resolution other than violence*Though few, there are some likable and somewhat developed characters*Imaginative look at an apocalypse futuristic setting in an alternate world*Humans with unique gifted qualities perfect for facing the crisisNegatives:*Most characters totally lack any development or connection to viewers*Dramatic and emotional moments are cheesy, fake, and forced*Lousy non universal views of morals and ethics though done in a confusing conflicting way.*No sense of consequences for bad decisions such as betrayal*Poor story logic (mostly to do with poor emotional scenes, betrayals and behaviors of those betrayed, and non sensical lines that do not line up with previous dialogue, actions, or results. development or capacity to draw viewers in enough for form a connection.

It has a wonderful animation, music and the best characters.It made me laugh, made me cry, and sometimes it was to exiting I couldn't breath.The characters are wonderful, and I think they make this anime so great!The story was a little complicated for me, but still it was good.I loved the one-hour-last-episode. I remembered I was squeesing...my pillow extra hard during that time. my pillow extra hard during that time."", 'A good story played out by unconvincing characters.I have been hearing this title for quite some time now and expected something decent at the very least. I had almost dropped it after 9 episodes due to execution and characters but I found myself thinking about the plot after a while and came back to it.The show greets you with a great song by angela, and ever since Stellvia of the Universe I have been a fan of angela and the singer\'s voice. The opening sequence is one of highlights of this series.However, the first 10 episodes is very difficult to get through. Instead of throwing...some action at me to get me hooked and then slow down to explain things, it just kept at it. When it did slow down, it was only to point out things that were very hard to accept. Let me state a few questions that I could not find answer to:* Why does the commander of the whole base goes out to pilot a fighter jet as any other grunt and gets killed right away?* Why bother with having (not one but two) shields when they are hardly able to stop the enemy for whole 2 seconds?* Why is the first pilot so good?* Why is everyone around so influenced/infatuated by him?* How did they manage to remain hidden for so long and then suddenly all hell breaks loose?* How come you have guns that Fafners handle that are able to hurt the enemy but you have no stationary, more powerful versions of these?* Why does the enemy wipe automatic defence systems right away but does not attack Fafners in the same way?I also could not get over how the writers of the show had a MESSAGE to convey and how characters did everything to validate it. It was not people\'s natural behaviour that pushed the story forward here, it was the MESSAGE. There were many instances where someone acted like a completely different person because that suited the story. There were many cases of sudden, unexplainable change in behaviour that, again, were there only to point the viewer at a particular idea. I felt I was watching characters being jerked sideways by invisible strings to make them behave as it was required of them.This series also miserably fails at creating drama in first 10 episodes. Attempts to force me to see something as very sad were so blatantly obvious that I could not help but reject them. Sometimes less is more.Warning: mild spoilers starting here.The case of commander dying so quickly (and then we get obligatory “grieving by a loved one” scene) is repeated on much grander scale very soon. Second pilot is designated, enemy attack follows and the she self-destructs to take out the threat. The problem is: she was hardly given any screen time for me to get to know, care about her and understand her motivation. All we know as she decides on a flight to her death is that she was a gentle girl of very weak health, as if the show is telling me: “look, a frail girl is flying to her death! This is sad! Cry!). And I thought pulling FMA or Steins;Gate on cute characters was obvious (who watched – knows).Another gripe I have is with the way it portrays the ""evil"" characters. They are introduced in much the same way as the Big Bad Wolf from Red Riding Hood: rotten to the core and ugly to boot. A pair, foster parents, badmouths their adopted son pretty much from the get go. You have to be pretty screwed to do that to someone you\'ve seen growing and whom you cared for for about 16 years of your life, and it\'s not just one parent, it\'s both of them! It\'s even more difficult to swallow since their son seems to have grown up all-right. And when we see how bad are they? It turns out they are spies and it gives even more ground to expel them from the island. Talk about fortuitous development.The good:* Story* Premise* Music* Animation* Second halfThe bad:* Execution* Characters* Weak start some action at me to get me hooked and then slow down to explain things, it just kept at it.

In fact most of this anime reminded me of Evangelion, down to the music and most of the mood of this show, except the one thing that separates it from Evangelion is the fact that it manages to stay optimistic throughout most of the series.Story:It takes a couple episodes to get off the ground but I think Episode 6 is when the series really changes things up, you will see a lot of characters perish throughout the course of this series, but in this episode...there is an emotional shock that really changes the tone of the series and from there you start to realize what kind of a world this place is. In fact what is most interesting is that for many of the battles the pilots are almost helpless against the Festum and they only barely manage to escape with their lives.Art:The Animation for this show for it\'s time is great, now granted it is only 5 years old, it\'s pretty standard animation, The Battle Scenes are the biggest key in this series and for the most part they succeed.Sound:The Music in this series is it\'s biggest strength, Tsuneyoshi Saito and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra do a beautiful job on the music, of note is the main battle theme ""Opening of Nightmare\'s Gate"" which really gets you into the moment the second it starts. As for the Opening and Closing, they are handled by the great Japanese Pop Duo of angela, atsuko (the lead singer) does a phenomenal job on the vocals for both the opening and closing, the closing theme song of this show not to mention the ending animation that accompanies it are among the highlights. I cannot say enough good things about the music for this series, it is definitely within the Top 10 of anime television series scores.Character:Tow Ubukata who wrote this series and has written Heroic Age, Le Chevalier d\'Eon, Mardock Scramble always manages to make his characters written very realistically, he tries his hardest to ensure that the characters are not predictable and frankly there are not many stereotypical anime characters in this show. But I think Ubukata\'s greatest character writing comes in the creation of the enemy force known as the Festum, Ubukata manages to give you bits and pieces of information about what the Festum are really about, you eventually come to see that the Festum are not exactly evil in nature but basically are shaped by another reason entirely, one that I cannot give away for risk of spoiling it.Enjoyment:This is not a series that is enjoyable per-say, like I enjoy the story-line and learning about the characters through-each episodes but in some ways, this series is bitter-sweet, it\'s not a happy and not a sad series, you feel somewhat unsatisfied after the ending of it, as of this writing, I have not seen the Fafner Movie but i will probably get around to it and the maybe my feeling of the overall Franchise will change.Overall:Fafner is in someways a different kind of a Mecha series, but it does fall within the range of what I call an Emotional Mecha series, it has melodrama, ethical questions and an enemy that does not understand humanity. there is an emotional shock that really changes the tone of the series and from there you start to realize what kind of a world this place is.

The story was alright with some similarity to Evangelion and Raxephon. I would recommend Fafner to anyone who enjoyed either of those. I thought the art style was pretty well done, and found some of the plot points and characterization was pretty unique and interesting. ', 'After reading a few reviews I thought ""heck people seem to like this and it has a sequel running, could be interesting right?"". Well right of the bat in the first episode I had a more or less ""wtf"" moment and it wasn\'t a good one. We go from cliche school setting to super powerful next to impossible to kill boss fight in a instance. Oh in classic mecha style all defenses are useless and we have a professional scrub force that gets instawhiped, like why even bother. Out goes our hero, badabing badaboom boss fight is over.The good stuff about the show...is sound and art, sound in particular is great.The bad stuff: well the story is non-existent the first six episodes, characters are just background material as we don\'t get to know a thing about them. While it wasn\'t a Suzaku Kururugi (code geass, I was baffled that he didn\'t die like 500 times in that shows first ten episodes) for me but the ""main"" duo are presented so badly and story forced into stupidity that I just lost interest. A cake covered in poop is still a poop cake no matter how nice the filling is and this show something like that.That turned into a ramble.In short: great music, colourful and for the most part good art, really badly presented story, character presentation is borderline criminally bad and finally lots and lots and lots of stupid cliches.If you are looking for action fiesta there are better options and if you are looking for a good story there are better options too. Your mileage may vary but to me its a no go. is sound and art, sound in particular is great.The bad stuff: well the story is non-existent the first six episodes, characters are just background material as we don\'t get to know a thing about them.

Your mileage may vary but to me its a no go.', 'Let me make one thing clear with Fafner in that the series isn\'t gonna win any awards in originality considering the number of cliches and plot setups in the mecha genre it pulls from teens forced into fighting an alien threat to the mental anguish faced by said teens as they are faced with the reality of war. If you\'re approaching the series to expect anything different from the mecha genre, don\'t waste your time watching this as going with this mentality led me to drop Fafner two years ago due to my disappointment with its unoriginality. But if you\'re approaching the series for an...engaging plot while knowing it\'s not gonna be offering much new, then Fafner offers up solid, yet flawed, engagement to look forward to in its 26-episode run.The main draw to the series comes in the form of the teens involved in the battle with the Festum alien threat. The series slowly builds up in revealing the major elements of its plot and how they come to affect the teens who get forced into the conflict with the Festum. Some shocking secrets regarding the true nature of the island home that Kazuki and his friends live on and the purpose of their upbringing on said island come to affect Kazuki and several of his friends throughout the course of the series. Each of the characters have their differing levels of growth and development that come about as a result of these revelations throughout the course of the series. They are also impacted by the realities of war and the nature of their upbringing as the series isn\'t afraid to make its major characters go through large amounts of suffering or even kill them off. This does result in the series dipping into melodramatics with the characters at a number of points as they angst over their situation. But the series knows when to show a level of restraint with pushing its drama in most instances where it doesn\'t get too overbearing.Other elements of the series are a bit of a mixed bag. There\'s an element to the series focused around tensions between the islanders and the Neo U.N. resistance faction, which the series tries to play up for drama to show their different mentalities of approaching the Festum threat and treatment of those in their factions. But other than Canon\'s developments, this story element is a bit subpar and didn\'t feel too significant for me due to the lack of focus on the Neo U.N. The show also gets a bit too heavy at points with dipping into its Norse mythology nods and techno-jargon where the former has no symbolic relevance other than ""rule of cool"" and the latter can get convoluted to keep up with. While the Festum do get their focus with exploring their motivations, the series never does bother exploring their origins nor much of the past history of how events in Fafner had started thanks to the Festum threat. Also, this series may get too overwhelming with its serious mood for some folks as there aren\'t many breathers in the drama for one to get a break from the show\'s serious developments.On the visual end, Fafner is standard in its quality for a mid-2000s title featuring subdued color tones to accompany its serious mood and a decent amount of detail added to the designs of characters, mecha and scenery. Scenery shots are great on the eyes featuring different parts of the island in gorgeous detail, but character designs are typical for an anime series and the Fafner units aren\'t too pleasing on the eyes compared to the various Festum they fight. The show has its moments of great battle sequences when the Festum threat begins to intensify in later episodes and multiple Fafner units get dragged into the fight, but doesn\'t stick out too greatly compared to other shows airing at the time like Gungrave and Hell Girl.Overall, Fafner does deliver a somewhat solid story with its focus on Kazuki and others as they struggle with learning shocking secrets and making life-or-death decisions as they become further immersed in the war with the Festum. While having its issues and not really breaking the mold for the mecha genre, it is still a decent watch if you can look past the cliches and frequent melodrama that are packed into Fafner. engaging plot while knowing it\'s not gonna be offering much new, then Fafner offers up solid, yet flawed, engagement to look forward to in its 26-episode run.The main draw to the series comes in the form of the teens involved in the battle with the Festum alien threat. The series slowly builds up in revealing the major elements of its plot and how they come to affect the teens who get forced into the conflict with the Festum. Some shocking secrets regarding the true nature of the island home that Kazuki and his friends live on and the purpose of their upbringing on said island come to affect Kazuki and several of his friends throughout the course of the series. Each of the characters have their differing levels of growth and development that come about as a result of these revelations throughout the course of the series. They are also impacted by the realities of war and the nature of their upbringing as the series isn\'t afraid to make its major characters go through large amounts of suffering or even kill them off. This does result in the series dipping into melodramatics with the characters at a number of points as they angst over their situation.

Shades of Huxley\'s ""Brave New World"" can be seen in the too-idyllic Tatsumiyajima setting, and the characters themselves spend a lot of time absorbed in philosophical thoughts and arguments. Unfortunately, the plot isn\'t quite as unique as the setting, and it\'s a little slow to develop -  but in the second half...of the series, the plot picks up and the revelations and mecha action come fast and furious.Artwork and sound are fine, neither excellent nor terrible. The Fafner mecha, with their twisted torsoes and lanky limbs, are a little strange to look at (and we don\'t get enough good looks at them), but at least the artists dared to be different. I think Hisashi Hirai\'s character designs are fine, but I\'m not sure that everyone feels the same way.The characters are where Fafner falls a little flat. The supporting cast, though large, is quirky and likeable, but most of them are doomed to die, and only one of their deaths (very early on) really made me feel anything. That particular death, however, is handled very well and brings up another strength - the chemistry among the entire cast is very good, and it\'s easy to believe that these people are friends, family, and comrades who mean something to each other. However, the main characters - Kazuki and Soushi - come off as bland and unmotivated to me, and Commander Makabe may be the most unqualified and uninspiring commander in all of mecha anime.That said, Fafner is more than the sum of its parts. The final episodes of the series that tie everything together really deliver, and made me feel like it was worth it to watch that far. If the main characters had shown more personality, and some information that was necessary for understanding the world the characters lived in had been shared earlier, I think Fafner would have been even more engaging. If you need a less-mainstream anime to satisfy your mecha cravings, or if you\'re feeling a little philosophical, then try Fafner - you\'ll probably enjoy it. of the series, the plot picks up and the revelations and mecha action come fast and furious.Artwork and sound are fine, neither excellent nor terrible.

With the help of the island's teenagers who are able to pilot the Fafners, the military send them out to fight the Festum.My thoughts:I truly enjoyed watching Fafner.  The animation is superb, the music is engaging (doesn't put you to sleep) and the storyline is very good. I like mecha type anime and this one had it all. Hints of romance, action, friendships, sorrow, acceptance...So many emotions in this anime and well worth watching.  I certainly recommend...it for all the mecha lovers out there. it for all the mecha lovers out there."", ""Soukyuu no Fafner, the Evangelion clone that found its own identity.This isn't an easy show to recommend. The first few episodes are some of the most generic, melodramatic, convoluted and poorly paced mecha I've ever witnessed. You are thrown right into the deep end with no real context. None of the characters are properly introduced and it tries to introduce all of them at the same time. The first 2/3 episodes are also incredibly heavy with elements lifted from Evangelion. There's invading aliens with cores that explode when damaged, there's mechas that are designed specifically to sync to certain pilots, there's an island with...a shadowy organisation that fights the aliens. There's a main protagonist that doesn't wanna pilot the mecha. But as time goes on the show starts to develop an identity of its own.That said the show remains melodramatic for much of the early episodes. Small emotional moments are treated with the same gravitas as heartrending scenes, and so when emotionally significant things do happen it just doesn't feel as impactful. The show is ridiculous, nonsensical, and constantly throwing technobabble that you can't comprehend. Adding layer upon layer of new information onto the nonsense that you're already hung up on.However it makes a turnaround in episode 13. Finally the general premise is fully explained. The mysterious island's origin and the nature of the main villains are made clear. Characters start dying and the remaining cast is properly fleshed out. The characters grow and evolve with compelling arcs that make them likeable and interesting. The rest of the show past ep 13 is a blast. It's just a decent and unique mecha.For this reason I would say that if you are willing to sit through 12 episodes of cringe to get to a good show, then this is worth it. But if you want just to watch a good mecha, then it's probably worth looking elsewhere. The highs of Fafner aren't high enough to justify the long slog through it.There are some really good themes explored in Fafner as well. The theme of empathy and learning to understand other people through the perspective of an alien race that doesn't comprehend concepts like life and death or individuality was fascinating. The show also explores the impact of child soldiers in a unique and interesting way. There are many other fascinating themes, in fact I'd say there might actually be too many.The art is pretty dated at this point. It was never particularly impressive even when it came out. The character designs are awful and the entire teenage cast is almost impossible to distinguish from one another earlier on. There are around 3 brunettes throughout the show who I consistently got mixed up because they all look identical but with different hairstyles. The Festum are all the same gold colour and they get a bit visually bland after a while. Evangelion had a unique Angel design for every single new encounter, and I think Fafner could have definitely used some more variety for their festums.The sound design is ok. The intro really channels that obnoxious melodrama from the earlier episodes but I liked the outro. This show also uses that stock imovie dramatic sound effect before that got licensed and gained its reputation as a staple in $0 budget filmmaking. Suffice to say it didn't age well.Overall the later parts of the story are an 8/10 but the earlier stuff is well below 5/10 material. If you're thinking of watching, keep this in mind. This show has spawned a small franchise from it - several movies and successive seasons. So if the rest of it is as good as this last half, then it might be worth going through the slog to get to the 17 years worth of quality sequels. a shadowy organisation that fights the aliens.

evangelion not only on themes but many elements presents on this series resemble on more or less degree to the aformentioned though still is his own thing as a whole.With more than 20 years on his back since aired soukyu no fafner is a anime of mechas, drama and sci-fi that touches a lot of existencial themes with a pacing that is falling to the side of being slow (at least that is what most poeple are gonna feel watching it although wasnt a problem to me) accompained of LOT of drama, it takes his time...developing the characters and their respective struggles but still manage to allow the action to happen more than enough.Like i said it puts a lot of enfasis on the characters and all the background story revolving about the world which is one of the reason why the begining might feel it like its drag down if you are not used to this kind of pacing and anime of this nature, is very dark, gloomy and oppresive the atmosphere after just the firts episodes, the way how portray the situations and show to the spectator how desperly situation humanity is facing are very good executed, of course that i feel the drama by itseflt also helps a lot when so many dialogs and conversations take place along the series with heavy-tone themes.Around the second half of the series is where things puts on motion and things start to move faster, most of the story happen on this island-fortress and even if the plot overall is not overly complicated it can result kinda confusing or you might not undertand everything, having to rewatch some moments on certain episodes because has this terminology and somekind of intricate way to narrate some lore of the plot which is not bad at all but also some dialogs like when this scientific (Akane Makabe) talks the shit starts to get serious XD with all this theories and logic explanations.The only criticism would be one on the early moments of the series with Shouko Hazama which the event wasnt a problem but i feel was handle kinda mehh and the weight although had a huge impact on the rest of the cast also was delivered in a questionable way.I cant not mention the ost of this series which is GOLD, all the tracks are lit with many cclasical pieces that are beautiful and melancolics and others are so epic it just makes all the experience so much better and the op and end also are freaking good with our dear angela for the vocals that when you reach the last episodes hits you really hard when starts to sound that ending.Animation wise was okay not bad neither really good, on design i really like how the characters looked having the vibe of that era (early 2000).Its a shame that most poeple dont know about this anime even after all this years, i hope that those interested on this kind of genere give it a try having on mind all the aformentioned because is a good series to say the least and deserves much more recognition.Also there is a precuel and secuel to this series that i havent seen yet but glad to

Fafner is a masterpiece.Well, not maybe for the first season. When I say that I speak about the whole serie which includes 3 seasons and 2 movies.Soukyuu no Fafner begins with a classic mecha-anime guideline -that looks a lot like Evangelion-, with pretty poor art quality in general, the animation is the bare necessities, the main caracters are rather basics and the story takes quite some time to become enjoyable. In the first half of Soukyuu I can only concratulate the precision of the shots and the timing, a very good 3D (used...only for a few things but still remains well integrated), and the OSTs.If you begin to watch Soukyuu no Fafner, I beg you to watch end get through the first 10 episodes. The serious shit begin in the second half of the season. Every character begin to evolve in their own way, you begin to understand some scenes that happened before you coudn't understand yet, and the story gets away from it's Evangelion-like synopsis to become something unique.Fafner is a combination of intense feelings, an excellent story, excellent OSTs, excellent characters developpement, excellent shots, and an incredible amount of details you cannot see in the first viewing.The last thing I have to say is that the first season leaves quite a lot of questions not anwsered that why I am not only recommanding the first season, but the entire series.Thanks for reading.

For anyone who has finished watching Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangelion, SnF will immediately make you feel at home. Consider SnF as sort of a spiritual successor to NGE. Where NGE ends nearly in despair and hopelessness, SnF takes you towards joy and hope of what the future may bring.SnF is supposedly steeped in Norse mythology, so make of that what you will. It...doesn't shy away from religious themes and tackles existentialist issues much better than NGE did. Whereas NGE is a psychological assessment, SnF is more mythological in its approach.This is certainly not an anime newcomers should jump into directly. Right of the bat, you are introduced to a host of mostly unnamed characters (unless you check the end credits) that would be featured in subsequent episodes. It is not designed to be self-contained within 26 episodes. Even after you're finished with the whole thing, you will not find all the answers to satisfy your unending curiosity.If you want to fully enjoy SnF, you will have to watch the whole series at least twice, not just SnF: Dead Aggressor, but also Right of Left, Heaven and Earth, and Exodus.The available subtitles aren't that great, and the dub has taken way too many creative licenses. There are only two choices, the official Funimation subs or the only fansub from the extinct Anime-Empire group. Both subs are not perfect, but the fansubs are generally more faithful, save for a few critical mistranslations that the Funimation subs thankfully avoided. doesn't shy away from religious themes and tackles existentialist issues much better than NGE did.

Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30901/Utawarerumono__Itsuwari_no_Kamen,"['2022 Edit: minor fixing. And surprisingly my opinion after a new rewatch hasn\'t changed.Second Season > First Season.No, it\'s not a joke.I guess if you\'re here is because you watched more than first 12 chapters, right? Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen, something that seemed to be a spin-off, was actually a sequel of Utawarerumono, hence why many people expected something very similar to its predecessor and, in that sense, they were disappointed, but... What so special is the first Utawarerumono?...Both series are pretty much the same in the basis: a ""medieval fantasy world"" where peace is apparent, although there are frictions between various kingdoms, and then, a person appeared, without a name or any idea of who he is, but whose fate will influence in many people, and the fate of one or more nations, while trying to find out who he actually is. The first Utawarerumono serie handled this in a more ""serious"" approach, war after war, almost without any break or slowdown throughout its 26 chapters. However, we must not forget this is also a ""fantasy"" serie, and as such, it also has elements of comedy, slice of life and stillness; basically the necessary calm moments of worldbuilding. In that sense, these were the major flaws in the first season: everything was moving in a frenetic speed, while time to introduce all the cast in an acceptable way was not properly given. 26 chapters of pure war and conflicts is not entirely productive, since there was almost no character development, to the point that only a few characters were important and the rest were forgettable. Even worse, after dedicating all its chapters to move the plot forward, this ended up being not well developed at all; it was notorious that a lot of content was left aside, everything was so rushed that certain topics were not properly handled (especially the one about MC\'s past memories), which resulted in several plot holes, and an ending that leaves more questions than answers (and it\'s not exactly a cliffhanger), plus the aforementioned lacking of character development. The first season was not bad, in fact its story is interesting and with a good potential, but its development left much to be desired.Now, talking more about Itsuwari no Kamen, which started in a much slower pace than its predecessor. In this case, they decided to do something more ""faithful"" to its original concept, and dedicate its first chapters to characters introduction and early worldbuilding, so the viewer would had time to decide if take a like on them or not.We can agree that expend 12 episodes on it was too much (I\'d have given between 6 and 8 episodes), but it was in order to set the new setting, characters and their interactions, while showing us a good dose of comedy and slice of life moments (admittedly a hit & miss) as we get to know more about them. The second cour was where the real story began: The wars are unleashed again, with several clashes among these new kingdoms, but in this case we get to see them from the perspective of people who do not fight directly in them. We see Haku, our protagonist, who is not used to the horror of seeing people die in front of his eyes, and he has to deal with this situation, while trying to help his friends. We must not forget one of the main points that makes this franquice very interesting: the mystery behind our protagonist, which in this case, it\'s closely related to the origin of this new society, which in this season is admittedly less addressed, but more latent than it was in the first season; this was one of the many plot holes that I previously mentioned, although Itsuwari no Kamen couldn\'t avoid having its own plot holes especially on the final stretch. Even so, in these 13 chapters, Itsuwari no Kamen built a decent story that moves at a good pace, with serious, intense, intriguing and dramatic moments, the latter especially in the final chapter, with a great atmosphere that makes you reflect about the events that led to that conclusion, supported by a decent direction and an OST carefully adequate for every moment. Too sad the first cour of the serie, while not entirely bad, wasn\'t as interesting, and it felt very slow in contrast with the second cour. No surprise some people find this as a big issue for the serie.The characters are not the most interesting ones in the world, but they work just fine. Haku is someone with a very apathetic attitude, constantly complaing about every activity he\'s gotten into, something that kinda work for both comedy situations, and for those moments where the character is getting into unexpected situations; those are actually the moments where Haku shines, since he has to show a change in his mindset if he wants to achieve his goal. Kuon is a fun character, but she knows how to be serious when the situation requires; she\'s actually a very solid character, acting as Haku\'s mentor and voice of reason, while knowing when to be rude and quite cute. Ukon is basically the one who moves the plot forward, knowing the most about Haku\'s potential while putting a lot of trust (and labors) on him, which motivate Haku to support him, although at his peculiar way. There is not much to say about the rest of the cast, they are all quite different in personality, but they fulfill their roles just fine; watching them interact is kinda fun, but not much else about then is told so they got little to no development, sadly.At the end of the day, Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen has nothing to envy to its predecessor. With a different way to develop the plot, inconsistent pacing but satisfying in the end, a decent direction and pretty fitting OST, and acceptable and charismatic cast. Although it could improve in some ways, still handled to achieve its goal. The final cliffhanger showed that the series has potential. Both series are pretty much the same in the basis: a ""medieval fantasy world"" where peace is apparent, although there are frictions between various kingdoms, and then, a person appeared, without a name or any idea of who he is, but whose fate will influence in many people, and the fate of one or more nations, while trying to find out who he actually is.

Even worse, after dedicating all its chapters to move the plot forward, this ended up being not well developed at all; it was notorious that a lot of content was left aside, everything was so rushed that certain topics were not properly handled (especially the one about MC\'s past memories), which resulted in several plot holes, and an ending that leaves more questions than answers (and it\'s not exactly a cliffhanger), plus the aforementioned lacking of character development. The first season was not bad, in fact its story is interesting and with a good potential, but its development left much to be desired.Now, talking more about Itsuwari no Kamen, which started in a much slower pace than its predecessor. In this case, they decided to do something more ""faithful"" to its original concept, and dedicate its first chapters to characters introduction and early worldbuilding, so the viewer would had time to decide if take a like on them or not.We can agree that expend 12 episodes on it was too much (I\'d have given between 6 and 8 episodes), but it was in order to set the new setting, characters and their interactions, while showing us a good dose of comedy and slice of life moments (admittedly a hit & miss) as we get to know more about them. The second cour was where the real story began: The wars are unleashed again, with several clashes among these new kingdoms, but in this case we get to see them from the perspective of people who do not fight directly in them. We see Haku, our protagonist, who is not used to the horror of seeing people die in front of his eyes, and he has to deal with this situation, while trying to help his friends. We must not forget one of the main points that makes this franquice very interesting: the mystery behind our protagonist, which in this case, it\'s closely related to the origin of this new society, which in this season is admittedly less addressed, but more latent than it was in the first season; this was one of the many plot holes that I previously mentioned, although Itsuwari no Kamen couldn\'t avoid having its own plot holes especially on the final stretch. Even so, in these 13 chapters, Itsuwari no Kamen built a decent story that moves at a good pace, with serious, intense, intriguing and dramatic moments, the latter especially in the final chapter, with a great atmosphere that makes you reflect about the events that led to that conclusion, supported by a decent direction and an OST carefully adequate for every moment. Too sad the first cour of the serie, while not entirely bad, wasn\'t as interesting, and it felt very slow in contrast with the second cour. No surprise some people find this as a big issue for the serie.The characters are not the most interesting ones in the world, but they work just fine. Haku is someone with a very apathetic attitude, constantly complaing about every activity he\'s gotten into, something that kinda work for both comedy situations, and for those moments where the character is getting into unexpected situations; those are actually the moments where Haku shines, since he has to show a change in his mindset if he wants to achieve his goal. Kuon is a fun character, but she knows how to be serious when the situation requires; she\'s actually a very solid character, acting as Haku\'s mentor and voice of reason, while knowing when to be rude and quite cute. Ukon is basically the one who moves the plot forward, knowing the most about Haku\'s potential while putting a lot of trust (and labors) on him, which motivate Haku to support him, although at his peculiar way. There is not much to say about the rest of the cast, they are all quite different in personality, but they fulfill their roles just fine; watching them interact is kinda fun, but not much else about then is told so they got little to no development, sadly.At the end of the day, Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen has nothing to envy to its predecessor. With a different way to develop the plot, inconsistent pacing but satisfying in the end, a decent direction and pretty fitting OST, and acceptable and charismatic cast. Although it could improve in some ways, still handled to achieve its goal. The final cliffhanger showed that the series has potential.', 'This is a review written after I saw it entirely. So, it\'ll diverge a lot in relation to those which had been written around the beginning. Is my first review, mainly cause of the controversial feeling about this anime.Story: People may say that it hasn\'t a story, I say the otherwise. The first half can be a low-development kind. For those who compared directly with the first Utawarerumono, it really is slow and without a outter story development. Though, the second half goes on a exponential curve of ""Give me the next episode!"". So, we have character and environment presentation and later the rampage of...the story. For those who searched about the anime, now that it is based on a 2-part visual novel, so, be warned that we have a ""half"" series, even so, I consider this season as a preparation to ""I hope there will be a"" next one.Art: Well, the art is nice. The ambience is well made, and although there\'s a difference from the first one, in a few episodes you accustom to it. Well, the furry part is well made, as are the battles and ""special effects"". Some parts, considering the year of release, are lot better than the first one, which is expected.Sound: I really liked the previous Utawarerumono opening (I love that one). They keep Suara\'s songs for the two openings (prefer the first one - really nice - but the second is really nice too). The endings are those slow-motion zen-kind songs, nice if you want to hear it (worst from all aspects). The general soundtrack is really good, mainly the last episode\'s ones; They match very well to the situations and ambience.Character: Well, we have a half season for that, if it was bad the overall would be to. We have a whole set of cliches to not cliches characters. I, particularly, really liked the MC - because he is really different from the normal-MC-way, and has a great development -. Aside from that, the whole set (older Utawarerumono characters, ""allies"" characters and enemies alike) are well made, be the visual, the actions, reasons, thinking, whatever. Even the lesser things cab be see as a potential character development fuel.Enjoyment: The fantasy slice-of-life that is the first part is, if nothing else, fun. I found it to be relaxing too. They have a equilibrium between fun and serious, a bit of overall development, new characters, being to know more of the world, etc. The second part is fun, cool, tense and all around some feels and emotions in some aspects (I\'ll refrain from spoilers, but mainly one part about the MC, and the finale). Basically, I watched one episode every week and waited for the next one from the first to the last episode.So, the overall note is kind a mean between all of it. I\'m bad with rating, never know exactly what I think, Thus, pay more attention to what I wrote than tho the rating. the story.

I started watching it without having seen the first season (I probably should have done that, but in the end I felt like I was able to understand the story without it) and had some mixed feelings while watching it. Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen is an anime that starts out as a slice of life and fantasy type of anime and ends as an action and drama type. I'm having a hard time deciding if that was a good thing since it made it good in some areas, but bad in others. As stated before...I have mixed feelings about this anime, and I will now try to share those with you.Utawarerumono starts out with an extremely slow pace, extremely slow. Almost nothing happens for more than 10 episodes. The slow pacing is good in the sense that it introduces us to the characters and the world of Utawarerumono. The first few episodes are extremely relaxing to watch and easy to understand. As time goes on we gets introduced to character after character, that all gather around the main character. I can see why they all gather around him, I think he's a likeable guy with his casual lazy-type of personality. The characters around him get a fair bit of development considering how many there are. Too many for me to be able to count, and maybe not even remember. They each have some unique traits which make them avoid getting absolutely forgotten. But the side characters are too many to be able to genuinely contribute to the story, which is a shame since they also were likeable. All in all, the anime does a good job at introducing us to all these different characters, and sets us up for a promising ride.After the characters have all been introduced you would think that the story would start progressing, but that is not the case. After the characters have been introduced and developed, either nothing happens, or even more characters get introduced to even more characters. The middle of the anime, after the characters have been introduced and before the all the action, the anime turns stale and a bit boring. Maybe it was to fill more episodes, but it doesn't work out very well. These episodes are just a composition of random events that does not progress the story at all. The episodes contain some sort of action, but it's badly executed with the characters fighting armies by taking on usually 1, rarely 2 or 3, opponents at a time. The different action segments are boring and meaningless since it does not progress the story nor offer very much to the viewer. It's a shame that the good build up was ruined by this sudden stop of progress.Since the story of the anime stopped progressing, I had little hope that it would turn out good, or even decent. But at the end of the anime something finally happens, and it's actually something good and exciting. Since we get to spend so much time with the characters doing nothing, we are very likely to sympathise with them. When the story starts to unfold, we get to follow developed characters trough their adventures. This is great because we actually have feelings for these characters. Maybe not only good feelings, but we actually know these characters. The political twist (maybe not a twist if you've seen the first season) was nicely presented and executed. The power struggle was both fun and exciting to watch. The ending to this anime is great. It's bittersweet and definitely leaves an impact.The animation of this anime is pretty good. It has a nice natural style which fits in nicely with the medieval type of universe. The background is detailed but at the same time it doesn't stand out too much. A fault with the animation is that it sometimes comes of as being lazily done. Mainly action scenes have too little going on. For example when armies are fighting, only a few people are fighting at a time. This makes the fights come of as unrealistic and genuinely bad.The sound is not something that really stood out to me, all the openings and ending where decent, but not great. The soundtrack was also nothing that really stood out to me. Most voice actors where pretty good and the majority of the characters did a good job at impersonating their character.I enjoyed some parts of Utawarerumono, especially the start and end to it. But the middle of the anime just felt stale and boring. All in all Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen is an okay anime. Would I recommend it? I would if you like slow build up, a medieval type of universe and animation and/ or political disputes.

Characters lack any real depth, they don\'t grow, bond or build a real relationship, we can...see characters lounging around for the better part of the series, 12+ episodes until anything happens isn\'t ""slow pacing"", it\'s poor writing and lack of actual content, and having a hack of a director in charge. The action feels forced and unnecessarily over-the-top compared to the first season when it does happen.We\'re presented with Haku, an extremely unremarkable and outright idiotic main character with no redeeming qualities, who finds himself in the wilderness and is rescued by Kuon, an inferior and bland version of a character we had in the first season.This second season regurgitates and reuses some narrative elements such as amnesia, a character rising to become a leader, and inheriting a weapon that belonged to someone else,  in very cheap ways.From the moment Haku shows up, he pretty much just receives everything, and everyone falls in love with him for no reason at all. He\'s lazy, ill-mannered, untalented and amnesiac. He is quick to form a harem of literal princesses from different countries through no effort of his own, there is no real development or storytelling to speak of. The first half of the series takes place in an inn where all the characters converge as if it were a cheap run-off-the-mill slice of life, the series tries to entertain with the ""yaoi fangirls"" trope every single episode which quickly gets old, even though it\'s not funny the first time, it definitely wasn\'t funny the 20th time.By the time anything happens in the series, it\'s hard to take it seriously at all. Haku fails to care about anything other than drifting by and doesn\'t have any meaningful bonding with any of the other bland characters nor any noteworthy character development, he literally just lazily strolls through a war-zone while accompanied by the rest of the group who seem to think that going to war is a game, and after witnessing a single particularly gruesome event he pretends to be highly hurt by this for two episodes even though he has no reason to be. After 80% or so of the series has passed by, we\'re introduced to the cheap twist of ""this guy is actually amazing"" for Haku, he\'s supposed to be related to the late emperor! At this point the plot is trying to rapidly move forward in a rushed way, the empire is about to fall and the princess is rescued by Haku and his comrades, one of them dying along the way and entrusting the lazy good-for-nothing with the future of the empire, with absolutely no emotion or build-up at all. With basically no reason to do care or do anything, Haku accepts and pretends to be his fallen comrade and tries to rally his supporters to march towards the empire, and the series ends there. Astounding isn\'t it?As far as the ""action"" goes, there\'s a clear exaggeration when it comes how strong and capable the characters are, as fights that were akin to medieval fantasy with some mild magic gets twisted into literally splitting mountains with a single slash, yet these people are unable to win fights against the old season 1 characters. This felt like an unnecessarily big narrative gap created by mindless shounen power-leveling and ""flashy"" fights.

Contrary to the high scores that most people give to this anime, I would have to say that this anime is one giant mess, whether it\'s because of the original material or the director, there is nothing great about the sequel to great series of Utawarerumono.The main issue with this anime is its story which I really dislike, especially with how the anime starts and ends. In my...opinion, the first cour of the anime from Fall 2015 is nothing but a giant filler. Why? It\'s because unlike its prequel, the first cour is a slice of life anime that has very little purpose other than introducing the characters and providing service to fans of Utawarerumono, especially when they re-introduce characters from S1. It must have been painful to watch this anime weekly, especially if you are a fan of the Utawarerumono series. Based on the first cour only, there is little direction of where the anime will go. Will any of the characters have any used to the story? Will there any plot at all? Is this the best that they could do? These are the questioned that I keep on having as I watched the first cour of the anime.The second cour of the anime is where a real storyline starts to come to light as the Barbaric arc and the Invasion arc are introduced. This is where our characters are introduced to one of the struggle that they must face during those time, war. Something they must win if they want to survive during those time.  This is also when our characters from S1 and their country are introduced into the sequel, a way to remind us that they are still there, living among the characters from this anime. Furthermore, we are shown in the past as they bring back story from S1 like Iceman, the scientists, and the test subjects. We are shown here that the scientists are not evil, but they are the “necessary evil” as they have to deal with the curse and the mess that they bring to humanity. Just like the people of Yamato and Tuskuru, our scientists are there to survive and the only way to do so is to research the test subjects and Iceman to improve their genes. Finally, there\'s the ending that left a giant hole among the viewers heart as there is no sense of closure to the ending at all. The ending is a giant ""Fuck you!"" to the viewers as the relationship between the characters breaks apart and there’s no information if they will come back together again or it’s the end of their relationship. The ending makes all of the slice of life part from the first cour to be completely pointless.Then there\'s the characters of this anime which could be considered as the weakest point of this anime. The characters have common traits just like many other anime, they have a bishoujo, fujoshi, tsundere, and the list goes on. There is nothing special with the characters (maybe except for Haku), and with the little to no character development from the first cour, I can\'t really feel attached to the characters. Not just that, some of the supporting characters like Maroro and Kiuru have very little purpose to the anime and if we are to take out these characters, the anime could still continue.The second cour of the anime is where our characters begin to develop, although only a little. From here, we can see that despite how happy-go-lucky Hakku is, he is dislike and afraid to the idea of change. He couldn’t bear the fact that the people that he spent with all this time could easily go to war and kill people like it’s nothing. We could also see the extent of their relationship as it was quite fragile, especially when the characters didn\'t know how to act towards Haku after the war with the Barbarians ended. We also started to see the development of relationship between Haku and Kuon as Kuon is starting to have a romantic feelings towards Haku. Despite all this, there\'s very little to no development to the side characters of the anime as we see that they have a problem here and there that serve to develop the characters, but that’s the extent of their development.Despite all the faults I provide previously, the art and the sound are likely to be the only strong point of the anime. There is a massive improvement with the art from S1 as almost a decade has passed by because every aspect of the design of this anime is great, especially the design for Akuruturuka for Vurai and Oshutoru. There is a great amount of details being put towards the characters and the world they live in. The Op, Ed, and Ost are great as well as they fit right into the theme of the anime, especially the vocals and lyrics of the music. I find myself not skipping the Op and Ed every time I watch the episode which just shows how lovely they are.Overall, I can\'t really find myself enjoying this anime, especially as the ending was too open ended and with no information about any sequel, I feel disappointed with this anime (although there\'s a sequel for the VN). Watching the first cour of the anime was quite painful and I find myself wanting to drop this anime if not for the characters from S1. This anime really have lots of potential and it could have done better with how the story develops. For example, they could have shorten the slice of life part of the anime into 3-4 episodes and use the remaining episodes to show the Rebellion arc. I really want to like this anime, but I just can\'t with the amount of faults that it has. opinion, the first cour of the anime from Fall 2015 is nothing but a giant filler. Why?

Despite all this, there\'s very little to no development to the side characters of the anime as we see that they have a problem here and there that serve to develop the characters, but that’s the extent of their development.Despite all the faults I provide previously, the art and the sound are likely to be the only strong point of the anime. There is a massive improvement with the art from S1 as almost a decade has passed by because every aspect of the design of this anime is great, especially the design for Akuruturuka for Vurai and Oshutoru. There is a great amount of details being put towards the characters and the world they live in. The Op, Ed, and Ost are great as well as they fit right into the theme of the anime, especially the vocals and lyrics of the music. I find myself not skipping the Op and Ed every time I watch the episode which just shows how lovely they are.Overall, I can\'t really find myself enjoying this anime, especially as the ending was too open ended and with no information about any sequel, I feel disappointed with this anime (although there\'s a sequel for the VN). Watching the first cour of the anime was quite painful and I find myself wanting to drop this anime if not for the characters from S1. This anime really have lots of potential and it could have done better with how the story develops. For example, they could have shorten the slice of life part of the anime into 3-4 episodes and use the remaining episodes to show the Rebellion arc. I really want to like this anime, but I just can\'t with the amount of faults that it has.', ""*I'd say there might be mild spoilers, but then again, there is almost nothing to spoil :'(*Before I start my rant I will state that I have enjoyed the art and soundtrack in this series (my reaction to the piano track was overwhelmingly positive) . Let us start with the fact, that I have liked the first Utawarerumono series quite a lot. That was mostly because of the narrative, character development and the relation between Hakuoro, Eruru and the rest of the gang. That being said,  Itsuwari no Kamen tried to draw some obvious parallels and teased us in a couple of scenes,...but failed. At the end of the day, it has very little in common with its predecessor. The elation between the main two protagonists: Haku and Kuon, is cut short in favor of overly introducing the rest of the characters. This is a product that one gets when the makers try to put too much in and leaving single components half baked. It feels unfinished, leaving many plot holes. Some of them are obvious, others explainable by logic. The last episode made me cringe.-> [SPOILER] I knew that Haku would take Oshutorus place before watching the anime, but the build up to this event was non existent. It was way too  sudden. He changes from a slacker into a responsible leader withing hours - really?! A+ on the character development #sarcasm. But the most irritating part was when Kuon cried over Hakus death. As if they were that close. That was so forced by the script that I stopped watching for a couple of moments. Why was she crying? There was no progression in terms of any kind of a relationship between them. No romantic scenes, e.g. holding hands, hugging, kissing... And now she weeps because she thinks he is dead. Give me a break. I was waiting the whole darn series for them to become a couple and all I've got was that? Was there another episode they have forgotten to air? The last episode was just insulting and infuriating. Had to rewatch the last episode of the original series to get my calm back[SPOILER]TLDR; You could make a 5 episode OVA and it would contain a more complex  narrative. As a fan of the original series, I got lured by the cheap trick called nostalgia. It has provided a very shallow story. It felt like a combination of a mediocre harem with some random fujoshi fanservice more often than I would appreciate for this title. Out of the whole series I'd probably recommend watching 6-7 episodes. A wasted potential of what turned out to be more of a filler than anything else. but failed.

So i turned to Itsuwari no Kamen. Luckily i didn't watch the original show when it aired now 10 years ago because the wait and disappointment would have crushed me even harder than it just recently did.Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen starts off with setting identical to the original, but quickly changes to your typical slice of life fantasy setting. MC starts building harem of sorts and nothing reminiscent of plot or traces to first season is to be seen...until first few episodes in.There are few major plotholes (just like in the original) that might someday get covered in future seasons but i wouldn't bet my money on that.Just a little warning for those who loved first season; Itsuwari no Kamen is going to make you hate/feel angry towards the main cast at some point of story for some time. And you really wish you could see the original characters more often.Luckily after slow start the story develops to better every episode towards the ending and after its over you're wanting for next season. Just hope it doesn't take 9 years again.Characters compared to the 2006 original feel just empty (yes, there were some bad characters on the original, not denying that). Every girl is shoehorned to fill in cliche roles that make all harems so dull to watch. They act weak except in 2-3 episodes about battles where they're suddenly smart and powerful only to fall back to your sheepish little harem after the battle ends.Male characters bonding with MC are all boring, empty wallflowers with the exception of 2nd MC. Boylove is everywhere (not that i mind, but it gets old fast).After first season this was a big letdown, but its slightly above average.Well worth the watch if another world/fantasy setting is close to your heart. until first few episodes in.There are few major plotholes (just like in the original) that might someday get covered in future seasons but i wouldn't bet my money on that.Just a little warning for those who loved first season; Itsuwari no Kamen is going to make you hate/feel angry towards the main cast at some point of story for some time.

You know, that getting to know character to build more emotion to the characters. After the first half, then...it started getting to the story, as i see other reviews on here, they only watched like 12 episodes or below, and that is not so helpful.Art-9, I love the art they use in this, really great, just simply love it.  had no problems with it whatsoever.sound 7- i do not love, i do not hate, it just simply enjoy it.  i like the first and 2nd op as well.  The sound are pretty good, not gonna lie.Character 8- As i said before, the character introductions, and such, its good.  Hence at the last episode almost made me tear up, and so i got kinda attached to characters, well im the type of person to get attach to characters.Enjoyment 10- there were funny scenes and action scene that got my hyped, including the ending which makes me want to know what going to happen next.  each epison was good enough for me, got my attention and my ""wanting"" of more episodes of this.Overall 10- i wished others would also watch this anime, i highly reccomend it, it is great to me.

This series has it's share of service, but the story is deeper than it seems, just like the first series it has mystery and a strange beautiful world that confuses and mystifies the MC. Sure this one could've been better, but all in all it is nothing more than a big build up to the next part. It has your suspense, wonder, fantasy, fighting and more, give it a shot before you judge it based on screen caps. The art and sound are one of my...favorite parts as it reminds me of the first series, some of the characters don't feel as though they contribute much so that could've been better, but all in all it was enjoyable.

At best, the plot is mediocre. It again wasted the rich foundation the prequel built and the very detailed world already built. The show also failed to take advantage of a crucial plot event that should have made momentous changes to the story.Overall, very disappointing story but another element truly dragged it down.Art: 8Fluid animation and nothing hurts the eye, though nothing to give you wow factor either. Characters designs receive thumbs up and in my opinion it is superior compared...to its predecessor and source material.Music: 7Those tracks from the game (I haven’t watched the prequel anime but played the VN) just kills you with nostalgia. Aside from this and the decently timed tracks, nothing is truly noteworthy.Character: 1When the supporting cast interests you more than the protagonist, you know you failed to write a credible lead to your story. Our dear main character showed no real development, even after the “big revelation” nor any progress in his relationship with the heroine, who’s been dragging him along for 25 episodes. But no matter how well written our Kuon is, Haku is simply doing a great job dragging the whole cast and the show itself down.Enjoyment: 6Utawarerumono is one of my favorite visual novel of all time and have a special place in my memory hence no matter how I dislike the protagonist I still found ways to enjoy this show with its lighthearted comedy and the cameos of old characters. Sadly it didn’t leave any sort of emotional crater of course all thanks to a terribly written protagonist.Overall: 4Overall this show’s stale plot and disappointing main character is the main reason of its downfall. to its predecessor and source material.Music: 7Those tracks from the game (I haven’t watched the prequel anime but played the VN) just kills you with nostalgia.

He's constantly extolled as a character that gets things done, but what the story shows him really being able to do is fix a mill and teach the princess a lesson and even those weren't that great because with the mill he simply removes the stopper and with...the princess he coat tails off of ushutoru's words.It would have been an amazing anime if it simply showed him actually doing things to later pull back to when they praise him instead of just saying he can do things with nothing to refer to. the princess he coat tails off of ushutoru's words.It would have been an amazing anime if it simply showed him actually doing things to later pull back to when they praise him instead of just saying he can do things with nothing to refer to."", 'So first of all if you have not watched the original Utawarerumono anime you probably need to do that first or else there will be points in this story that you will definitely find yourself lost because this is a continuation of the original Utawarerumono story line.I found this anime quite a bit more enjoyable than the first.  You get more in depth with the characters and the tone is much lighter that in the original anime.  I do like how well the story progressed through each and every character ultimately building to the conclusion which in itself is another beginning.Most...of the anime has a light feel to it, although it doesn\'t skip a more serious tone hear and there the largest of which comes at the conclusion.  The animation is nice and clean and the sound and everything else is crisp.  Overall it is an anime that I would definitely purchase should it be released here.The one thing that did bug me about this anime is the ending of which there was none.  I\'m not going to spoil anything for you but in case you didn\'t know the entire Utawarerumono series is based off of a popular game franchise in Japan and so the anime ends right where the game ends essencially.  So see no spoiler if you\'ve played the game because you already know what is going to happen.This anime seems to have been made as a tool to boost interest and promote the new game coming out this September which if I\'m not mistaken is ""Utawarerumono: The Two Hakuro"".  Now here is the rub, will there be a concrete ending this time or will this ultimately lead us into another game after a third anime release.  The thing is I have no idea and I don\'t think anyone else does either.  The only thing that I do know from the preview of the new game is that it will seem to have a far more serious tone as Tusukuru and Yamato seem to be headed towards full scale war.So with that said hopefully there will be a third anime sometime in 2017 that will lead us further down the rabbit hole into the world Utawarerumono.  At least I hope that there is because it sure has been fun so far. of the anime has a light feel to it, although it doesn\'t skip a more serious tone hear and there the largest of which comes at the conclusion.

At least I hope that there is because it sure has been fun so far.', ""NOTE: This is a VERY minor spoiler review. As a huge Utawarerumono fan, I had great expectations for the anime and will be comparing it to the visual novel (og source) from time to time (with context too for the people that haven't read the VN). Though I'll start by saying that the visual novel is so much better than the anime - I would give the rating such a higher rating if it were the visual novel.Context:This anime is an adaption of the visual novel called Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (for English releases). There are two parts to this visual novel represented...by two games. The first part is Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception and is what this anime covers. The second part is the continuation of Mask of Deception and the anime hasn't come out for it yet.Story 6/10:The story from the VN is more like a 9/10 imo and is an essential part in building into the second game, Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth. However, the anime falls short in retelling the story. One thing to note though, I saw many people complain on Crunchyroll that there isn't much of a story in the anime. That is also kind of the case for the VN and that's because the first game is more focused on building the world, character and relationships (let's abbreviate that to WCR building) rather than the story. Doesn't mean the story doesn't progress but it's kinda like a slice-of-life type (somewhat reminds me of Konosuba). The second game is where the story, in a sense, truly takes place.But anyway, the reason why the anime falls short in retelling the story is that they skip out on so many important aspects of WCR building. For example, they cut out an entire arc about Haku and the Tatari that is essentially for WCR building. They rather focus on the funny moments rather than setting the background for a grand story told in the second part. I get that it's impossible to fit a ~30 hour-long VN into a 25 episode anime but they should have focused more on the WCR aspect than the funny moments - or at least a better balance of it. Though surprisingly, the anime didn't feel too rushed but regardless, the anime doesn't do the VN justice with 25 episodes.One last thing about the story is that the anime doesn't faithfully adapt to the VN. The overall conclusion of the story is pretty much the same so it's most likely a time constraint thing. I don't mind such changes but the anime makes certain parts considerably worse than the VN. Like in the introduction of certain characters is much well handled in the VN.Art 8/10:The art and animation are overall fine. The animation is pretty average but the art makes up for it. All the characters are very well drawn and adapted. Some scenes are especially beautiful. One thing, the anime makes the Akuruturukas into absolute BEASTS. IMO it's depicted better and more monstrous than in the VN. So, I'll give the overall art a high 8.Sound 10/10:Well, if the VN is known for anything it's that the music by Suara and the OST is really fucking good. Since the anime makes use of the same music, it naturally sounds as epic as the VNs. Other than the music, the voice actors once again show how cracked they are. The voices of the characters are so good and really bring out their personality (despite the anime not developing personalities very well). Every character has a unique voice that you'll know who's talking the second they talk regardless of if you're watching or not. Also, the anime chooses unique sound effects for certain things. They certainly sound all really fair - especially for the final battle. The sounds for that fight were crazy good, really captures the essence of destruction going on.Character 7/10:I think the characters were decently adapted. Many things disappointed me about the adaption but it wasn't all too bad. As I mentioned in the story, the anime skipped many WRC building plots. The VN had many plots (both minor and major) that were dedicated to each character throughout the story. The anime skipped so much on these aspects that I have to give a 7 for character. The source material had so much potential yet the anime delivers only lightly. In a sense, the characters felt a bit empty sometimes (like lacking personality), even without the context of the VN. Also, some characters in the anime also seemed a bit uncharacteristic too. Though, if I haven't read the VN already, there is a chance I would have given character a higher rating or even a lower one, I think?Enjoyment 8/10:Again, as a big Utawarerumono fan, even if the anime was garage tier (which I don't think it is), I probably would have still enjoyed it. The only thing keeping me from enjoying it more than an 8/10 is I was a bit disappointed in the adaptation aka my high expectations. What can I say, I really love the Utawarerumono VNs and so can only expect high quality.Overall 7/10:I think all Utawarerumono fan should give the anime a chance. It's pretty exciting to see the VN characters animated, it's a similar feeling to when I played Utawarerumono Zan. Might be a bit disappointing at times but not horribly shabby.I also think people interested in Utawarerumono should give the anime a shot. It's an easy brief way to be introduced to the series so that you can be blown away by the quality of the VN if you get to that point. by two games.

""A bunch of girls in a bathtub"" would be another name for this anime. The anime is about random girls who just decide to move in with the MC for no reason at all take baths about twice per episode, talk about boys all night long, and meet new girls to take baths with. The MC has 0 skills there is nothing special about him he barely even shows up since the story just kinda focused the entire...time on the girls in the bathtub but don\'t worry because you get to see some of the characters from the first season show up take a bath and never show up again. The girls are as cliche as they can possibly be there is nothing interesting about them and they all look the same. Okay so enough talk about the first 20 episodes in the last episodes a war just kinda happens for no reason some guy comes out of nowhere does some behind the scene shit and there was some fighting and what not the anime ended on a cliffhanger so there is probably gonna be another season but you can skip this one if you want because you will probably understand everything that happened in this season within the first episode of the next one. You dont really have to watch the first season to understand this one since, well nothing actually happen but you probably are going need to watch it for the third season if you are planning on watching it. Overall this season is an average harem anime with some yaoi jokes thrown in it. time on the girls in the bathtub but don\'t worry because you get to see some of the characters from the first season show up take a bath and never show up again.

Overall this season is an average harem anime with some yaoi jokes thrown in it.', 'In 2006, the world was graced with a fantasy world of animal themed people surrounded by mystery and war.  The series known as Utawarerumono has since then become a bit of a cult classic with its mix of fantasy and science to formulate the world\'s backstory, in conjunction with the present day story with what is essentially a completely new world.  And so, 9-10 years later after the first Utawarerumono, we have Itsuwari no Kamen, the false faces, the second installment of the Utawarerumono trilogy.Story:  Twenty years after the end of the first Utawarerumono ended, the world has been relatively...tame.  It is here where we find ourselves in a different, larger country to the newborn state of Tuskuru, where we follow the story of a woman by the name of Kuon and the man that she found that she names...Haku.The story of Itsu, as I shall be referring this series as, is split into two parts, corresponding to the two cours that make up its entire runtime.  Contrary to its predecessor, Itsu is a more character-based story, focusing more on the development and characteristics of each and every main character that they introduce to some extent.  The entire first cour is virtually plotless, as it spends its time more on the development and building of its main cast, involving Haku, Kuon, and several other characters that each receive their own quirks and traits that make feel more like characters than pieces that follow a plot-based story.  The issue that arises from this is the fact that the plot itself during this section of the anime really doesn\'t have much going on about it.  By devoting itself to defining its cast, the show sacrifices any sort of plot development and doesn\'t feel exactly like what we were presented with back in 2006.The second half of Itsu on the other hand is what would be considered more as \'Utawarerumono\'.  As the series was originally a tactical RPG game, the series dives into its traditional style of war and conflict, which really only benefits the series.  Due to the fact that the series sort of slogs on with its first 12 episodes, only to give us a plot based story with more defined characters, the story overall in that sense just feels more well written and makes more sense overall.  Character motivation during this second half is more defined, the different viewpoints of war and rule, what is best for the people of a nation; all of these are tackled with much more value to them.Another thing that this series does, and is just a positive for the entire Utawarerumono series as a whole, is the idea of world building.  Because we\'re in a completely different country to the one we see from the original series, the structure, culture, and overall feel of the place is completely different.  Yamato is a very powerful country that has a lot of land and power over the rest of the world.  And you get a sense of that with the way the country is set up, the daily lives of the citizens there, and the impacts when that powerful pyramid crumbles down.  All in all, we get such great world building that there really isn\'t much for me to complain about.All in all, while there were some bumps in the storytelling on account of the fact that there was virtually no plot in the first half and JUST plot in the second half, personally, I think that the story only benefitted from this, as the actions and events were more personal and impacted the characters in a way that would\'ve otherwise been null if they didn\'t spend that time.  The end is definitely a more open end, as the story is more or less setting up for hopefully, the third game\'s anime adaptation some time down the line.  (White Fox, PLEASE get on this.)Overview:+  World Building+  Good second half+/-  Good first half (This is dependent on whether you would appreciate the time spent on the characters or hate just the sheer lack of anything and the randomness of some of the stuff that happens.)+/-  Open end.  (Does well for setup and is bittersweet, but doesn\'t REALLY finish the story.)Characters:  Itsu does a complete clean sweep in its character department, as the series focuses on an entirely different group to the characters that we knew before.Up first is Haku, the \'new\' Hakouro of the series.  After waking up without any memory as to who he was (Gee, that sounds familiar), he is found by Kuon and is dubbed \'Haku\' by her, now under her responsibility as she is his \'guardian\' of sorts.  (Ka na.)  However, that\'s where the similarities between these two men ends.  Haku is more or less the opposite of Hakuoro, being less willing to do physical tasks and has a very negative outlook on war and the kind of destruction that comes with it.  As the series progresses along, Haku becomes a hardened character that grows out of his innate inability to do anything.  He\'s a realistic character that has an odd charisma of always having a ""I\'m so done with this shit"" expression everywhere he goes.  All in all, Haku\'s growth as a character makes him a much better character overall as you can see his ascent of willpower and growing into the ideals and wishes that he wants to fulfill as the events of the series impacts him.  We also get a backstory to him that ties into the events of the continuity, adding in his hand into the ordeal that created the world of Uta.Then we have Kuon, the \'new\' Eruruu character of the series.  Aside from having the ability to heal, Kuon doesn\'t really have any traits that the previous female protagonist had with her.  She\'s a much more mischievous, hot tempered girl who loves to eat, play, and acts as a sort of \'mom\' character in a sense.  The main issue that arises from Kuon is the fact that her motives or backstory are more or less shrouded in mystery.  The series does give clues and facts as to how she came to be, but towards the near end of the series, there\'re hints to show that there is more to her, and that she has an underlying motive for finding and caring for Haku, which really doesn\'t get explained.  Maybe we\'ll get information in third adaptation, but at the time of this review, there really isn\'t any information currently to explain that.For the rest of the cast, we have a variety of players in the game.  We have the two noble princesses from different provinces in Yamato, Rurutie and Atui, the general of the right, Ukon and his sister Nekone, the novice archer, Kiuru, and the entire government and military structure of Yamato, including the emperor, his daughter, and the Eight Pillar Generals, powerful leaders who command their own army that obey the will of the emperor to ensure that the country of Yamato will continue and prosper, and the best girl of them all, Kokopo the giant bird.  (Seriously though, this bird is an AMAZING character.)  While mostly side characters, these members of the cast, most of these side characters don\'t really feel it.  They add to the atmosphere of this new country, as their values, culture, and ideals largely differ to those from the cast in Tuskuru.  The majority of them are defined and mesh very well with the story, creating a genuine feeling world.  Several in particular, Oshtoru and the emperor, play bigger parts and act as both plot devices and characters that add more to the story.  Overall, this side cast is much better crafted and really only added to the story (Except Ponpo of course.  Hate that bastard).  Plus...there might be a couple...return appearances here and there.Overview:+  Characters that have both plot importance and development+  Defined cast+  Characters mesh very well with the story-   Some missing and/or incomplete motives for some charactersArt:  Produced by White Fox, an offshoot of the company Oriental Light and Magic who made the original Uta, Itsu returns back with a fresh coat of paint from the olden style of the original Uta series.  With a much more refined look to it, the true beauty of the asian inspired world of Utawarerumono comes back full force with wonderfully produced backgrounds and fluid animation.The overall look of Itsu took what was good about the original Uta\'s art, and just sort of elevated it.  While some moments were taken into liberty with CGI in order to animate certain scenes, there wasn\'t particularly anything messy or bad about it.  In fact, it still looked rather fluent even with CGI employed.  (The curses looked a bit off.  I\'ll say that much.)  What does bother me about the art is how everything has this slight tint of beige to it.  The colors of Uta have never particularly been bright, but everything just looks a bit too dull in terms of color.Another thing that Itsu has is fanservice.  It doesn\'t have it in spades, but in certain scenes, most prominently in the first half of the series, there are scenes that detail more risque moments in the bath.  (Because Kuon is apparently a cat that likes to take a bath.)  It\'s not that much, but I just thought that a little warning was a good idea.Overview:+  Consistent, good quality art  (Oh White Fox, you do spoil me)+  CGI that was used was more or less fluent-   Colors look slightly dullSound:  I think one of the more defining parts of the Utawarerumono series.  As the entire OST is more or less based around an oriental style of music, the tracks sound more unique than your traditional anime OP, ED, or OST in general because of that.  Taking her reign back as the singer for the Uta series, Suara makes a comeback to sing every OP and ED song that the OST has, just like what she did back in 2006 with the original Uta.This time, the OPs have a more serious tone to them while the EDs have a very relaxing and mystical tone to them.  All four of these tracks are very memorable and evoke the feeling of the oriental and mystical war anime that Utawarerumono is.  Personally, I think that Suara\'s style of music perfectly represents Utawarerumono, so much that it\'s just difficult to think about Utawarerumono WITHOUT these tracks.Overview:+ Perfect OST  (There are NO complaints or bad parts about this.)Personal Enjoyment:  Utawarerumono was a series that intrigued me for a good long while.  After I took it out of the backburner, I found myself enjoying a series that was actually more deep in its lore than I originally thought.  I love stories that have lore to them, and when I found that Utawarerumono was having a sequel, I was excited.Did I like this anime?Oh, far more than I should\'ve.  I love stories that just add to the continuity, and really there wasn\'t anything about this show that I didn\'t like.  The characters were enjoyable, the story over time transitioned to what the original Uta was structured like, and we got a look into the aftermath (sort of) into what happened after the events of the original Uta.  Plus, the soundtrack, my god, it\'s heavenly.  (And the cameos!!!!)What didn\'t I like about this anime?To get into specifics, Ponpo.  The character Dekonponpo is the saddest excuse for a living being and I hope that waste of life and space dies very soon.  Such an irritating and terrifyingly designed character.Would I recommend this anime?If you saw the original Uta, you should watch this.  It continues the story and adds another layer of depth to the world of Utawarerumono.  It is the second part to a trilogy, so more or less, this is the \'lead-in\' part of the series that moves the series to its final conclusion, so it doesn\'t exactly end cleanly, but nonetheless, it is a fitting end.  If you\'re new to Utawarerumono or you\'re interested in a fantasy series with war and some relatively deep lore, I would strongly suggest you watch the original first.  Despite what people think, this is a story that happens AFTER what happens in the original series, and there will be continuity mistakes if Itsu is watched without any prerequisite.  Until then, it\'s time to slumber and wait another decade until they release the third and final installment.  And boy, a day that will be. tame.

And boy, a day that will be.', ""I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fanboy of the Utawarerumono series. I've watched the original anime series and it was so good that it made me play the Visual Novel version. (Which brought me into the Visual Novel world - this was a few years ago) So it's natural that I was overjoyed when I heard Itsuwari no kamen was getting animated. I also came in with some expectations.With that said, here's my slightly biased review of Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen.Story:6The first few episodes were beautiful, it allowed first time viewers to get used to the world and the people in it....Then the plots slowly starts to go south. The biggest thing that bugged me was combat. We see characters that laze around doing nothing, suddenly become proficient at using their weapon. We are told, but not shown how they've gotten stronger. It is most likely due to the fact that this anime was based off a SRPG, where the player trains the characters. At the end, a lot of things were left unexplained and plot points left hanging, but I will talk about this more at the end of this review.Art: 8I'm no expert at spotting errors in animation so I can only give you my impressions as viewer who focuses mostly on the plot. The scenery in the first few episodes blew me away, it really gave you a sense of being in the world. The large scale battles featured cookie cutter soldiers, but I'm fine with this as it is pretty expensive and a waste of money to try and anime each solder individually in a large battle. All in all, character movement felt smooth and the colors used in the anime felt natural.Sound: 9Nothing to say but great. If you enjoyed the type of music in the first series, you'll love the ones here.Character: 6Except for a few, most of the characters in this anime felt flat and their actions felt mechanical. I will explain more about this at the end of my review.Enjoyment: 8Utsuwari no Kamen will feel nostalgic to those who've watched this first series and just seeing the world and characters is enjoyable. Somethings will bug you like inconsistent plot and characters, but that is due to it's SRPG nature and a fact that I will discuss right below.RantFor those of you that don't know. Next we'll mostly likely get the next season during the Fall 2016 lineup. Why you ask? It's because the last visual novel of this series will be released that day. Why am I talking about next season on a review for this season? This is because you'll find that everything in this season is a buildup for next season.What essentially happened was that they made the visual novel too large, so they split the story into two games. (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen and Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) Which forced the anime to follow the same pattern and the viewer is left with lots of unexplained and hanging plot at the end. For those of you that have watched the first season, all of Itsuwari no Kamen is basically like the world building in the first few episodes of the first season. Now this wouldn't be a bad thing if the director could create some anime original scenes to smooth the transition from a SRPG visual novel to an anime, but due to the fact that there's already a sequel in plan, the director is not given much leeway. The anime is sticking so close to the source material that some plot points feel extremely awkward/doesn't make sense due to the SRPG elements.Overall: 7Tl;Dr Don't expect too much from this season as it is just world building for the next season.

Both are 25-episodes anime and both are set in the same setting.First and foremost, I would advise you watch the first season before attempting to watch this one. Otherwise, you will not understand half of what happens in the second half of the anime. You might think this is obvious since this is a second season but you\'d be surprised how many people dived straight in that anime without watching the original first...To start off with a side note, I am baffled by the amount of people who claim this anime is...basically a Slice of Life anime and has no direction whatsoever and decided to drop it halfway.It\'s not that nothing is happening, the anime is simply taking its time to properly do a good job at adapting a story that deserves that much time put into its world creation. I personally wanted to wait at least 20 episodes and surprise ! Things are actually happened !But back to the review.Story-wise, it is true that the anime starts off slow. That\'s a good thing. It takes its time to properly remind us of the world we were left in with season 1 while making A LOT of obvious references to it (and this is important, due to how many years it has been since it was released). In fact there are so many references that some people mistakenly thought at first that this wasn\'t a season 2 but rather a rework of the first season. But what we have is indeed the continuation of an epic tale of fantasy, sci-fi and war but with a whole new cast of characters... at the beginning at least. Not much to add, the story at first is mainly character-focused and later on links back to what we have left from season 1 to create tension and drama.In my opinion, while the original Utawarerumono was focused more on its plot than characters, this season takes a different approach by giving each character its own arc in a way that makes us attached to them as the events go on. This however does not mean the story is neglected.In fact, one could even divide Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen into two parts: the first half that is meant to introduce each new character to us and the second part which introduces climax, tension, drama, plot twists and allows the previously showcased characters to each shine in their own way through meaningful character development.The artwork is one that is close to one commonly found in ""moe"" Slice of Life anime. While it works in the first half of the anime, it feels a bit out of place as the second half reunites us with characters from the first season who look younger due to the upgraded art-style even though story-wise they should be older. While the visual update is generally appreciated, I still can\'t help but feel like it contradicts with the image I kept from back when I watched the first season which has an art-style befitting of the 2006 anime era.Animation-wise, it feels smooth and fluid, so I have to give props to the animators for that.In terms of music, well just like the original, the soundtrack merges perfectly with the tone of the scenes, using traditional instruments to give that kind of historical/fantasy feeling. I also really liked the first OP, not so much the second one but both of these are personal tastes.All in all,  I consider this series to be just as great as its predecessor and a must watch if you were a fan of the first season. basically a Slice of Life anime and has no direction whatsoever and decided to drop it halfway.It\'s not that nothing is happening, the anime is simply taking its time to properly do a good job at adapting a story that deserves that much time put into its world creation. I personally wanted to wait at least 20 episodes and surprise ! Things are actually happened !But back to the review.Story-wise, it is true that the anime starts off slow. That\'s a good thing. It takes its time to properly remind us of the world we were left in with season 1 while making A LOT of obvious references to it (and this is important, due to how many years it has been since it was released). In fact there are so many references that some people mistakenly thought at first that this wasn\'t a season 2 but rather a rework of the first season. But what we have is indeed the continuation of an epic tale of fantasy, sci-fi and war but with a whole new cast of characters... at the beginning at least. Not much to add, the story at first is mainly character-focused and later on links back to what we have left from season 1 to create tension and drama.In my opinion, while the original Utawarerumono was focused more on its plot than characters, this season takes a different approach by giving each character its own arc in a way that makes us attached to them as the events go on. This however does not mean the story is neglected.In fact, one could even divide Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen into two parts: the first half that is meant to introduce each new character to us and the second part which introduces climax, tension, drama, plot twists and allows the previously showcased characters to each shine in their own way through meaningful character development.The artwork is one that is close to one commonly found in ""moe"" Slice of Life anime. While it works in the first half of the anime, it feels a bit out of place as the second half reunites us with characters from the first season who look younger due to the upgraded art-style even though story-wise they should be older.

After seeing the last episode, and thinking through a bit, ""GO BACK TO THE FIRST SEASON: UTAWARERUMONO"". Its really important  (unless you\'re a genius at putting puzzles togethers, in which case, this one is still incomplete with the third game coming next year.)But I\'ll just make my review on this anime series and this series alone.Story: Unless you\'ve seen the first season\'s 26 episodes of amnesia, war, friendship, haunting past and man................(Not gonna spoil it), you wouldn\'t...give this show atleast a 7. This show is literally tied, though not quite nicely, back to the first season, answering a few questions (and giving me a bigger map of the continent to look at. Seriously, their world functions just like agar.io) For me, I enjoyed this, more after seeing the first season. The first cour was all fanservice and introducing new characters (and the returning characters that are still alive and kicking ass) while the second season gets straight to the point of why its called ""Itsuwari no Kamen"" and how this season is the build up of the third season (Yes, we have a third coming.). Without spoiling here, there\'s a war going on for reasons that date back into the past, and things get hectic, with people dying, and a country breaking apart due to internal problems.I just say this here, the second cour sucks like shit. Period. The battles were lame, and its all about ""HAKU, SOLVE THIS FOR US. YOU""RE A HUMAN"". The fanservice died out, and character development on the guy you never wanted to ""grow up"" beings here. Haku becomes (and I\'m spoiling it). If you\'re deciding whether to watch this or not, give it a shot. The first 3 episodes are misleading of what this shows about (but it does hint what might happen in the end, and what\'s to come in the NEXT SEASON).TL;DR, Shit. (But if you watched the first season, bearable.)The visuals were nice, as with all modern anime of 2010+. Comparing to the 2006 anime adaption of the first season, at least I won\'t have nightmares of all the CG they used (seriously, the battles were done with ugly polygons like Counter Strike or Lara Croft before 21st century came around).The OST was nicely woven into this series, just like the first season. A soothing, well-paced soundtrack with unique, interesting instruments playing to give to the feel of a ""fantasy"" or ""aboriginal/native"" atmosphere. Sadly, no  very face-paced soundtrack for a few scenes that were...out of placed (The old man\'s secret rooms. yeah, talking about that). The OP and ED (and their 2nd cour ones) were also nice, especially the OP2.Other than great songs, I loved seeing past characters returning, grown up, stronger, and laughing (WHERE IS ERURUU!)As for enjoyment. I guess it\'s rewatchable (as I had just finished the first season, want to see this go through properly) but really, the joy of this show isn\'t much. Its to build up and have everything in place for the next game/anime (I mean, the first season\'s anime could have actually been made with 10 more episodes making it 36.) Its a good series, but because I\'ve kept my rule of S2 < S1, I\'ll say a 6 for this show. 7 if I have mercy and 5 if you\'re a real cruel critic or one who doesn\'t want to watch the 2006 anime.So there you have it. Utawarerumono fans are like FSN fans, just milder or less left wing/Weab/obsessive otaku, but this show is still worth watching, if you\'re willing to go through the troubles of watching its first season, and waiting *cough* 10 *cough* years *cough*. Otherwise, I guess there are other great anime to watch instead. If you\'re looking for more battles in asian style manners, go watch those sengoku anime, else play the game. All in all, this anime is not as bad, but pretty bad.Verdict: 7/10P.S. Fanservice aimed at both Harem lovers, BL lovers and Fujoshi(s) give this show atleast a 7.

Fanservice aimed at both Harem lovers, BL lovers and Fujoshi(s)', 'Dispar as it might appears to be on my rating of this anime, I choose Overall 6 as well as Story 6 due the simple fact that, although being  sequel to a good Science Fiction / Strategy and Drama series, it failed to convey the richness of the first season, exchanging it for too much comedy relief in the first half of the series, and then rushing out things so badly that they just tossed ideas and revelations from one thing to another, explaining nothing at all and forgetting elements, hints and ideas laid during the series which were great if developed, throwing everything...to the wind in a finale that lacked sence and went to a very unecessary and plainly out of place drama path, totally unnecessary and senseless. I will not spoil things for those who have not seen the series, but they lost a chance to really carry on a great story, and clearly lost the hand of it all at the end. So much was hinted, so much was shown, so much was put in some episodes, but in the end they just forgot everything as just sidekicks (and all the elements forgotten were trully important ones for the whole story! Those elements were crucial, for instance the  the relationship of the Emperor and Haku...damn that alone would make the whole story different than what was done...I could not understand what happened there....no sense at all the path they choose) And the end being just a cliffhanger is a bit unfair after 25 eps, but as a prequel to the Final Installment of this series, we cannot ask much of it.  As the third istallment is scheduled for september 2016 (Utawarerumono: The Two White Emperors ~ Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro) we should consider this 25 eps as just a very looong introduction to the real story to unfold in the final installment of this trilogy. So lets see what comes ahead, as they have a lot to develop from all laid down during this 25 episodes.

This alone probably gives you a decent idea of how much I enjoyed it.What initally drew me to the original was the combat and how it was relatively realistic, at lwast by anime standards sure it had super human strenght (karula) and super speed. some people could jump 20 feet in the air (although realistically that would have gotten them killed) and there was magic and mechs. The mechs although overpowered were meant to be and i could accept them. The magic was also not over used and was not as overpowered. As for military...tactics i could list out a whole lot of issues but thats for another time. I still want to leave that cavalry cant charge through spearmen like that but thats what anime isI also appreciated the fact that the main character was level headed and very capable. He might have been too lenient at times, but that's japanese influence there, not much the creators could have done there.Now enough about the original.On the topic of combat theyve completely thrown out realism for the more popular one man army general idea thats so common in asian movies and stories.I mean seriously if one woman (munechika) could basically wall crush an entire army why does she even have an army with her. Same for that blondie human nuke. Theyre as big a threat to their own men and they dont even use them except for the clean up. While on the topic of combat i really cant agree with women just running up and beating the crap out of trained soldiers. I mean yeah in the original there were women in the army but they were extremely special cases. Karula belonged to a tribe that had natural super strength and touka was part of some miliatary order that served justice or something. In this we were given absolutely no explanation as to why they could fight. Anyways even if there was 5 people charging an entire army is completely useless, they should have been speared to death at a distance.As for the charactersHaku with his retorts were probably the saving grace of the animeThere was also a bit too much gay with the princesses and all for my taste. Sure i get that they might have wanted a bit of comedy but episode after episode of it got annoyingAs for the rest it didnt feel rushed (not too much at least) the art and sound was good so i dont have much else to complain about tactics i could list out a whole lot of issues but thats for another time.

Then it took a massive plunge like an obese man flopping off a 30 metre high diving board.At least 10 episodes have no, or completely unrelated content in regards to the main storyline. The...progression is slow, nothing even happens, save for a few harem-esque moments and the mc whining like a baby.The choices characters make have no sensible logic behind them, the mc can't do anything without a kick up the backside, all the female characters seem to adopt the good old BL book adoration and turning red at the sight of any men.The villain is unclear throughout most of the series which results in no sense if tension or foreboding.I don't know how I managed to get through this season; the ending wasn't even very fulfilling at all...It is not even worth watching it for a sense of completion, the only thing you'll be completing is your suicide note and the knot in the length of rope you will hang yourself with.The only redeeming factors of this anime is the world (which was set up by the original series anyway), the art (which is high quality and consistent) and a few decent fight scenes. progression is slow, nothing even happens, save for a few harem-esque moments and the mc whining like a baby.The choices characters make have no sensible logic behind them, the mc can't do anything without a kick up the backside, all the female characters seem to adopt the good old BL book adoration and turning red at the sight of any men.The villain is unclear throughout most of the series which results in no sense if tension or foreboding.I don't know how I managed to get through this season; the ending wasn't even very fulfilling at all...It is not even worth watching it for a sense of completion, the only thing you'll be completing is your suicide note and the knot in the length of rope you will hang yourself with.The only redeeming factors of this anime is the world (which was set up by the original series anyway), the art (which is high quality and consistent) and a few decent fight scenes."", ""The first Utawarerumono is vastly superior to this one. What made the show very enjoyable were its characters. In the first series we have Hakuoro, who is much more mature and intelligent than the protagonist, Haku, of Itsuwari no Kamen. Haku is in possession of a middle schooler's brain while Hakuoro has a mature one. This goes for the other main characters to a large degree as well. I realize that some of them aren't that old, but the sheer stupidity of some of the things they do is unfitting of someone with slightly above average intelligence. Average and below average intelligence are not enjoyable...to watch. Keep in mind that i write this review considering someone with average intelligence to be frighteningly stupid. There are times and places for characters that are stupid, but this show is not one of them, especially not in the places of the main characters.This show is very character reliant, and as such is very disappointing after having seen the first Utawarerumono. That being said, it's still much better than the average anime show. to watch. Keep in mind that i write this review considering someone with average intelligence to be frighteningly stupid.

But also as the story started to unfold it really went into a nice story telling direction. The OST was really great and suited the settings perfectly.BUT and if you haven\'t watched...the last episode please stop here.BUT what were they thinking? I mean the ruined a whole series with just one and in this case the last episode. This show would have received a much higher rank in my case if they hadn\'t done what they in fact did.The whole ""I can\'t tell her it\'s me""-thing is just crap. I mean his sister knows and also the two priestesses but he can\'t tell Kuon? Where is the sense about such a stupid story twist. I mean isn\'t she able to keep it a secret all of the sudden? I am really to upset to write any further because it all feels like if I have wasted watching a whole series for nothing. This season finale was beyond anything satisfying. It is a shame what they did. the last episode please stop here.BUT what were they thinking? I mean the ruined a whole series with just one and in this case the last episode.

It does everything it needs to do, establishes a hero's journey, creates tension, and arrives at a climax before ending it.  It would be a 7/10 for execution.  Now that I'm done talking game, let's move onto the anime.Your hero is an everyday hacker, who is surrounded by anime animal girls, one of which has a fetish for hot springs.  We get to see their everyday life before we...see something happen.  What you say?   A general killing it's civilians as casualties of war.  You know, you generally don't want to kill off your productivity if you want to prosper as a nation.  Seriously, where are the key supporters and the businesses who were located in that city?  Anyways, the show starts to fall into a slump where the cast is depressed over the death of random people.  Does it make them better people? No, not really.Soon there is a war with a neighboring nation who had another uprising which had their own set of one dimensional antagonists.  Sadly, it ends like I would've expected.  Nothing really changes.  No real stakes involved.  We just move into the next story arc.  Here we get to see a main character die by becoming  bubbles.So how is the story in the anime and the game?  It's bare bones. It's the same problem with their first game.  It sounds cool, a hero rising up and getting their people to overthrow their oppressive ruler.  But the characters aren't that interesting and there is no consequence for their actions.  Why is the bandit village stealing?  Is that productive?  Why are they not farming?  Why are they not doing literally anything else?  Yeah, it's that situation.  In many cases for banditry such as what happens in China, it is done not as an occupation, but to oppose the government or when people are experiencing extreme poverty.  But these characters just seem to exist as bandits with no real oppressive rule or extreme poverty.Does it end well?  No, not really.  It ends in the same way as the first game.  Best girl is ditched just like her mom by the protagonist when they decide to become god.  Both are doing it to be sealed away.  Seriously, has no one solved a problem without killing people, annoying the populous, or getting sealed away for religious/safety reasons?So, is it enjoyable then? Sure, if you like to see how they made the anime from an objective point of view and discussing the guidelines to righting a story.  But if you want to enjoy it as entertainment, it is subjective.  The main character doesn't exactly fit the series, the helpful male character looks too similar to the MC, so it's obvious what will happen, the antagonists are idiots, the key supporters are morons, the main cast are lounging around without a purpose, and nothing is really resolved at the end of the 2nd game or next season if it ever has one.  To stop the civil war, he unmasks the plan to, of course, blow up the city with a giant space laser!  Which apparently, still blows up the city.So, how was this 5 minute review?

Sure, if you like to see how they made the anime from an objective point of view and discussing the guidelines to righting a story.  But if you want to enjoy it as entertainment, it is subjective.  The main character doesn't exactly fit the series, the helpful male character looks too similar to the MC, so it's obvious what will happen, the antagonists are idiots, the key supporters are morons, the main cast are lounging around without a purpose, and nothing is really resolved at the end of the 2nd game or next season if it ever has one.  To stop the civil war, he unmasks the plan to, of course, blow up the city with a giant space laser!  Which apparently, still blows up the city.So, how was this 5 minute review?  Like and subscribe for more reviews on anime."", 'This review is written by someone who has watched the prequel first, then read the visual novel, and then watched this anime without reading the novel for this anime. Spoilers will be present and announced later in the review.The prequel was fun enough for me to want to read the VN and watch the sequel. The VN was a nice addition but the anime itself was a good one. However I can only say I\'m very dissapointed in this sequel anime. I\'ve seen people claim Fate/Stay Night is the kiddy version of Fate/Zero because the cast in F/SN mostly consists out of kids. I heavily...disagree since plotwise Stay Night is just more complex than Zero. However this sequel does seem to be the kiddy version of the prequel.The original Utawarerumono was written for 18+ (and the anime 17+) and I think that reflects in the story and characters. The sequel was originally written for 15+ and the anime itself is 13+. As such, we got a lot of bathing scenes to start with for horny young boys and yaoi jokes for fujoshis? It\'s not just these details, it just reflects in about everything.Anyway since this is the sequel of the anime from 2006 I expect you to have seen it or atleast plan to watch it before you watch this. As such I will make comparisons since I don\'t think this anime should be watched as stand alone.Before I start to point out all the things I\'m not satisfied with or just want to adress, I have to admit, the anime is well animated and does looks good.The points I want to adress are:Structure of the storyFanserviceHumourPlotCharacterizationInconsistenciesThe structure is as follows. You do not get an introduction to your main character, it\'s pretty much like how the prequel started, guy with no memories is found. Someone takes care of him. They then travel around and meet people. The first 2-3 episodes are somewhat about fighting, survival and introduction to the setting of the world we\'re going to be seeing. Then a part which people like to call the slice of life part follows, in which a lot of characters are introduced episode by episode. Some of these characters will join the main cast actively. This isn\'t actually slice of life as it actively seeks out events to introduce more people. As such, you will have no idea how much time has passed as this is aslo never mention. Then action happens and doesn\'t stop till the end. You may or may not like the slow 9 episodes after the first 3, but that\'s pretty much what it has to offer.The fanservice is is mostly at the start and in the early stages of the slice of life parts. There are tons of bathing scenes where they\'re basically showing everything except for genetalia and nipples. My personal opinion is that it felt like they had to put these in to keep the attention of people who can\'t keep focused unless stimulated.The humour is pretty decent half of the time, other times it\'s repetitive or misplaced. One of the most recurring themes for humour is yaoi. Now it\'s not wrong to try to entertain people with yaoi, it is however getting old fast if you use the existence of yaoi and embarrassment of being associated or reading yaoi repeatedly.The plot is a pretty meagre one. A guy with no past basically gets a girl to help him out. Then for no reason girls start flocking to him. The MC spends some time in the capitol before he finaly gets caught up in battle (by choice). For some strange reason great things are expected of Haku, our MC.The characterization is also pretty meagre at best.Haku is the MC, he\'s lazy and somewhat smart. Since he tries to actively avoid doing anything you don\'t learn much about him except his fondness of being lazy. Oh and he does like his friends.Kuon is traveling around she claims she sees Haku as someone she has to take care of and acts motherly around him. She has a lot of family who she respects or so it seems at first.Ukon is a strong man who likes to help people out, he\'s also very devoted to his emporer and for some reason very fond of Haku.Nekone is obsessed with her brother and basically looks down on everything silly.Rurutie is a princess that likes yaoi, cooking and is perhaps a bit jealous. Oh and she\'s not very fond of fighting and has a bird that\'s combat capable.Atui is a princess whom is combat capable, she\'s pretty easy going and I think she (or else it was Rurutie (this is how important this detail was regarding the story)) was looking for love.Maroro (cowaredly)/Kiuru very fond of Haku for some reason.Some inconsistencies are that Yamato, the region where this anime seems to take place, doesn\'t seem to exist at all in the prequel. If it existed, then the Avu Kamu arc would probably have gone drastically different. Also powerlevels seem higher here and technology a lot more advanced. Magic also plays a much greater role. Also I cannot imagine Dii or however you wish to spell his name not having interfered in Yamato. Also there\'s a huge tamed bird that\'s combat capable, if so many combat capable creatures were out there, where were they in the prequel? Also for some reason Onvitaikayans or however you want to call them and ultra strong bugs are now roaming the earth freely.Anyway my conclusion is that the art and animation are pretty good, the story is told in such a way that there are gaps here in and there which makes events harder to explain and timespans aren\'t clear. Humour is good at times and at others it could have better been left out. If you liked the setting of the prequel and only look for something like it, this anime can be ok. It\'s just important not to expect to see any characters from the prequel or any dept in story or characters.====Spoilers/in dept start here====Yaoi is ok, you can make jokes about it, but when you send Yaoi to your general out at war to raise her morale and the General actually goes ahead and read it... That\'s just forcing the humour out. Also there were lots of moments in serious epsiodes which were about fighting and surviving where predictable humour was added. Not only do these things ruin the atmosphere they also ruin the pacing and what not.The plot in my eyes is very very bad. Kuon saves Haku, that\'s ok. Haku saves Maroro, that\'s ok. Ukon saves everyone, that\'s ok. Then they get to the capital. About 9 episodes where nothing plotwise happens is OK. But these episodes are not used to establish bonds, to make characters flourish which basically bites back later when things speed up. Haku goes to war to join Ukon. This is still OK. Haku sees Vurai\'s mass destruction and is scarred for life. That\'s OK. Then Tusukuru war happens, which is very sudden and unexpected. Haku then accepts the mission. That\'s where it all goes wrong. There\'s no reason for Haku to join the war. He dislikes war, he doesn\'t want to see innocent people die. He also, isn\'t attached to Yamato so there\'s no reason for him to serve. Also there\'s no reason for HIM to serve in the first place, it could have been ANYone. Then they go search for Kuon. My logical reaction would be, Kuon has gone home to her homeland to defend it. Instead they go around looking for Kuon at food stalls. Then the most surprising thing of all, Kuon decides to help Yamato. Fighting Tusukuru to her, means possibly facing Karura, Touka, Aruru, Kamyu, etc etc. People who she calls mother/sister. At war, Aruru then leads them to their generals camp. For reasons unknown ofcourse. Haku then decides to do what Hakuoro did too, recycling tactics is fine. Eventually they succeed in destroying the provisions and go home empty handed. War with Tusukuru never happened. Then plot and betrayal which is OK.The characterization is one of the worst things of the anime.Kuon mothers over Haku and is secretly very fond of her family. She respects them deeply. She said she wanted to explore the world, which is fine. But that also means she doesn\'t have a real connection to Yamato, thus no reason to help Yamato wage war. And her reason to join the war was to end it swiftly, I\'m not sure how she though she was going to end it swiftly but it was never shown in any way that it would end swiftly. It feels like Kuons reason to wage war against her homeland was ungrounded and therefore a bad decision to make her do so.Haku is lazy, not combat capable and does want to help his friends. His first ""fight"" would be against the giant bug. He was useless. His second fight was when he was in the capitol. If I had to make a good estimation, a couple of weeks upto a month had passed. Ukon fought him and told him he had improved. WHAT? Improved how? How did he change from 100% useless to combat capable? Surely he wasn\'t practising, atleast we were never shown any of it. Time passes again and he defeats guards, people trained for combat over a prlonged period of time. Later he blocks a blow from Vurai. Yeah that\'s pretty ok to do, Vurai isn\'t even strong.... Anyway for some reason he got ultra strong and combat capable without any reason.Harem girls:Nekone, just dislikes everything except her brother, more, we don\'t know of her. She is supposedly smart and educated beyond her years. Her role is nonexistent.Rurutie, we don\'t know anything about her except that she likes yaoi, cooking and dislikes war. Her little act at the end pointing a dagger at Kuon is first of all out of character (as she just agreed with Atui she wanted to help them).Atui, is easy going and combat capable. That\'s basicaly her whole role. It\'s unknown to me why any of these girls flock to Haku.Miko girls: Fanservice/humour device/deus ex-machina magic, but usually useless because of magical barriers they then just shield.Prequel characters:Karura, hates to be called mother/drinks/investigates?Touka, servant of Karura?Aruruu/Kamyu like Kuon, want to look after Kuon. And about Aruruu, it\'s still a mystery why she helped Kuon/Haku to the camp.I mean it\'s all great and fun if you want to add characters from the sequel, but atleast give them some character or part to play. Touka for instance made an appearance, but if she didn\'t NOTHING would have changed, the same goes for Kamyu. Karura and Aruruu atleast played a small role.The characters are just poor. Atui plays a bigger role in the sequel than Touka did in the prequel. But yet I can tell you a lot more about Touka than I can tell you about Atui. Touka for instance is a Evenkurga or however you wish to spell it. She was devoted to help good defeat evil. She has high morals and would only do what she thought was right. She\'s combat capable because she grew up in a clan where that would be normal. She decided to serve Hakuoro because she wanted to repay her debt. She feels a strong sense of duty to bring back the body of that other king home and play as a body guard for Hakuoro leaving him pretty much guarded most of the time even to an extent that it could become seem as a burden.Also it makes sense that people flock around Hakuoro, he helped Yamamura, solved the Mutikapa problem helped around with other stuff. Got accepted as one of their own, got appointed head of the village. Lead a rebellion, defended his people against enemies, rebuilds what\'s lost. Haku doesn\'t do anything to deserve people gathering around him. So it\'s not logical that they do.Also told why Mutikapa was combat capable, and thus it\'s logical why Mukkuru is too. But there\'s not explanation or anything about the giant bird. This is just another thing that shows the prequel clearly put more effort into details.The inconsistensies are mostly that things exist and are present in the sequel that would probably have altered the course of the prequel if they were there as well. The world was about lost when the Avu Kamu were roaming the world. But as far as I can tell, those things wouldn\'t have gotten very far invading Yamato. Tusukuru used to be a small country with a relative small army. A decade or 2 later they became so strong Yamato couldn\'t even defeat them. Oh and Tusukuru warships with magic cannon like shooting... Then there\'s the wildlife that I mentioned before, the technology to make cages go up and down for bug fighting with lighting that all ignite at the same time almost like lighting. The story about the mask and people being wiped out was also different. In the prequel people were living in the underground because because above they couldn\'t survive. In the sequel it was shown that people turned into those blobs and then some kind of ultra laser shooting down destroying everything. (including a city which seemed like the city it was taking place in). But it would make more sense to me, if something like that would happen before people would grow close to extinct rather than afterwards. The prequel clearly showed that Iceman was released, conceived a child, then imprisoned again. He then changed people into blobs. Laser beam then destroyed a lot. This suggests that Iceman and furry eared people had been roaming the earth where people cannot follow for a year or so. A huge city above ground suggests otherwise. disagree since plotwise Stay Night is just more complex than Zero. However this sequel does seem to be the kiddy version of the prequel.The original Utawarerumono was written for 18+ (and the anime 17+) and I think that reflects in the story and characters.

Spoilers ahead!)I’ve never had amnesia.The closest I have ever come to memory loss was the few hours following the removal of my wisdom teeth. While I wish to save the actual wisdom-teeth anecdote for later, suffice it to say that I do not remember anything that happened once the anesthesia kicked in. My parents tell me that I blubbered like a buffoon, though. Which, in all honesty, I could see myself doing.Unfortunately for Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen, it ends up as a forgetful experience, too.STORYUtawarerumono starts off with mystery in mind. Kuon, a wandering woman, discovers...a man seemingly lost in the woods. He has no knowledge of who he is, and he cannot seem to recall his memories. Kuon decides to name the man Haku, and thus the anime begins.The show definitely starts off on the right foot (or perhaps the right paw). Kuon and Haku form a nice duo. Their silly antics and their potential connection creates a relationship that has a lot of room for growth. The quaint, woodsy setting plays on the mystical, easing the audience into the concepts of animal people, technological deficiency, and otherworldliness. Extra characters bring both fun and purpose. A carefree yet commanding leader, an important princess, and a giant, cooing bird add variety to the show without taking away from its current feeling.Event-wise, the anime takes a combined approach. The majority of the scenes are slice-of-life-oriented, such as Kuon spying on Haku or Haku doing his best at manual labor. Simultaneously, some of the scenes are action-oriented, such as a battle against a massive centipede or a kerfuffle with some thieves.To put it differently, Utawarerumono does well in establishing its premise and direction and scope.Then the anime slows everything down. Really slows it down. For approximately nine episodes, the anime chooses to focus on just slice-of-life material. The first couple of these episodes are acceptable since they help to transition from the old setting and into the new one. But once the show continually goes with this direction, the events themselves start to feel largely inconsequential.For example, some of the group members sneak onto a ship that gets overrun with giant bugs. Anju, the princess, tries to understand what love means. Kamunagi of the Chains, two daughters of the high priestess, are given to Haku as a reward, leading to an episode with a disproportionate number of sexual acts and innuendo.Slowing down the anime so much leads to stagnation. Indirectly, it keeps the cast in single spot for a long while: the capital of Yamato. Consequently, where the first few episodes made progress in terms of world-building and providing motivation for the characters, this stretch of nine or so episodes where very little actually happens feels unfocused.Especially so when the remainder of the season – thirteen episodes – is dedicated to obscene amounts of action. While the fight at Maruruha is pertinent for the masks and Haku’s character, much of this action simply feels pointless. The attacking Usuurussha, bandits basically seeking food, lacks a place in the narrative following their retreat (and despite the big showing the anime made with the daughter of one of their generals). And the entire invasion of Tousukuru, Kuon’s home country, ends up as worthless in the long run.The majority of episode seventeen deserves a special (negative) callout. This episode is dedicated to unveiling a huge revelation: that the Emperor and Haku are the only humans on the planet. In short, the animal-esque people of the world were created by the Emperor after people destroyed themselves, and, also, the Emperor is Haku’s older brother.First, this reveal comes out of nowhere. After those snowy mountains, the stretch of slice-of-life events, and a hefty amount of battling, the anime drops this information on the audience without discretion. And second, and arguably worse, the anime does almost nothing with this information. Haku somewhat gets inspiration from the news when he destroys a provisions storehouse later on, but these relatively gargantuan details have next to no impact on the narrative.But Utawarerumono does not stop there. It also falls prey to other narrative snags. For some reason, the show chooses to kill off the Emperor off screen and without warning. One of the final plotlines, the attempted murder of Anju, does not receive a resolution. Ukon gives up his mask to demonstrate his loyalty to the princess, but it serves no purpose once out of his hands and is even given back to him some time later, making the entire exchange unnecessary.The show runs into thematic trouble as well. It tries to emphasize the necessity of war in order to fight for resources and display dominance. But the majority of the season is not dedicated to war – the first half is (to reiterate) slice-of-life whereas part of the second half is more centralized in its conflicts. In essence, the whole war angle, while appropriate for certain circumstances, does not fit within the anime’s other material.Overall, the narrative begins and means well, but, the further along it proceeds, the more issues it brings upon itself.ANIMATIONUtawarerumono’s artistic direction does well in certain areas but not-so-well in others.For example, the background art is more unfortunate than fortunate. Similar to the story, the backgrounds are supported by the more mystical environment. A mountain village and snowcapped hills purport that differentiation of the land exists (as do the visuals of the first ED). Yet, once the anime constrains its setting to just the capital of Yamato, the anime unfortunately hits a lack of creativity. This misfortune continues into the latter half of the show as well: open fields, some forests, and random towns are not exactly immersive.To be fair, the show does place care in the details. The capital is very cultural with food stalls, stone castles, and minor amenities. Lighting as well. Many moonlit nights, delicate sunsets, and daytime outings blanket the show in various forms of light.Actual animation is somewhere around average. Action sequences, while not the most choreographed, are filled with lots of sword swinging, jumping, and (sometimes) giant fireballs. Downtime is similar in that sequences can see a nice amount of movement – dancing, searching, and joking – but nothing outright dazzling.The character designs are quite nice, though. Mostly because of the extensive variety. While they all derive from (more or less) the same cultural influences, they tout different colors, different animal characteristics, and different styles.For example, Kuon’s long hair, warm colors (light purple, orange, and yellow), and plain tail paint her as a kind and mature woman. Rurutie’s black-and-white garb with pink-colored additions coincide with her princess-yet-lewd and sweet personality. And Munechika’s white-and-blue garb, curled hair, and short tail depict her as the wise commander she is known to be.CHARACTERSUtawarerumono has a singular problem with its cast: Too many characters for its own good.Granted, having a big cast is not an inherent problem. It all comes down to their use. Their purpose. Their execution.In Utawarerumono’s case, the execution fails to be present. Mostly because it continually adds more and more and more characters to the pool without stopping to explore them to any large depth. The show has Haku. And Kuon. And Rurutie and Atui. And Ukon and his little sister. And the samurai and his daughter. And the princess, the emperor, the emperor’s assistant, her two daughters, and…The show rarely explores anyone that is not either Haku or Kuon. They do have their particular characteristics – Rurutie loves boys-love material, Atui is very particular about men, and so on – but these traits get tiresome when they are used over and over without major deviations from their respective formulae.Arguably, they do not need to have development. They do not need any extensive change to their character. Which, to some extent, is true. They are not wholly important to the plot, and there are just way too many of them to adequately divvy up necessary attention.But the show has twenty-five episodes to work with. That’s a lot of time. Presumably enough for everyone involved.Even if these side characters are given exemption, Haku and Kuon’s development is not.Haku started off in a rather interesting spot. Without memories, he had no way of understanding who he was, where he was going, or even why he was there in the first place. But he did know what he wanted to do: nothing. He was lazy. Whenever possible, he would prefer to sit around the campfire rather than subject himself to more work.Yet he was surprisingly good at the jobs he was given. Mostly because he would seek out a way to perform the task efficiently. I.e., he would devise a way to get the job done with as little work out of him as possible.And while he was not an amazing fighter like Ukon, he was courageous and could hold his own. Plus, he learned how to read and write, treated others with respect, and did his best with the craziness that happened around him.Unfortunately, these traits are as much as his character gets. Roughly halfway through the season, Haku does have a small situation when he becomes terrified of the prospect of war. His friends cheer him up, letting him know that war and its outcome is natural. At least, natural for their world. But one miniscule development over twenty-five episodes seems dismally disproportionate.In fact, Haku is arguably a very bland character. Furthermore, this blandness makes it strange to get behind Ukon’s constant reliance on the dude. Haku is not exceedingly strong, and he is not exactly a genius. In other words, he doesn’t stand out.The idea is that Haku is simply charming. As the only human (besides the emperor; almost nobody knows that either of them are human), as this lazy yet strangely productive person, he attracts others to his circle.And, arguing in his character’s favor, that may be the point. That is, one does not have to be an “amazing” person to influence the world. Yet, even taking this mindset into consideration, the evolution of his character does not support this idea. Haku never really affects those around him, let alone the direction of the plot, going with the flow of events for nearly the entire season. And when the audience finally does see him gain a position of power, the show ends.Not that gaining power and numerous friends changes him for the better. Indeed, besides Ukon, he does not seem to strengthen his relationship with anyone – including Kuon.Kuon’s relationship with Haku is alarming for this very reason: not having a strong foundation. In the beginning, when it was just the two of them (and maybe a couple of other characters), one could easily see where their relationship stood. She teased him, shared meals with him, and traveled with him to take care of different happenings.Following their trek to the capital, however, Kuon’s relationship with Haku almost stagnates. As more characters are added, Kuon gets less and less time to spend with Haku. The story’s action-heavy direction also forces their separation. And while she does get angry with Haku after their initial time together, their moments on-screen get reduced to a pitiable amount.The result is a weak relationship between the two. Subsequently, Kuon’s later (presumed) romantic feelings for the man and distress over his death come off as empty. It’s unfortunate. They are the main duo of Utawarerumono, but, because the anime spent almost no time on building their relationship, Kuon and Haku are not strong together.Again, for all of the cast members, if the show were shorter in length, it would be somewhat more acceptable to not have as much care given to each of them individually. But given how much time the anime had to work with, it’s almost inexcusable for the anime to have characters so weak writing-wise.SOUNDThe first OP incites wonder, a feeling of mysticism that fits well with the anime (at least the first quarter or so). The cultural instruments, the nice vocal work, and the build-up into the fast-paced portion come together to create a somewhat intricate track that is both catchy and fun.The second OP tries to follow in its brethren’s footsteps. Mysticism reappears, and cultural sounds – like the background chants and the wood tapping – return, too. Most of the piece contains skipping singing and unobtrusive instruments, but the final stretch twists the tone. As the vocalist picks up emotion and the instruments start to resound, the tone moves from normal to almost harrowing, mirroring the shift in tone of the anime itself.The first ED slows down the festivities (in similar fashion to the story). While not serene, the piece is peaceful, the soft piano accompanying the thoughtful singing. The second ED is similar but slightly more mystical. The track gradually builds into strong drums, passionate singing, and cultural sounds that match the sadness the show concludes with.While neither of the EDs are particularly gripping, they are at the minimum nice additions to Utawarerumono.The rest of the original soundtrack continues with the foreign feel. From the slice-of-life escapades to the countryside brawls, Asian ambiance fills the atmosphere. This music turns their hotel, the capital of Yamato, and the surrounding world into a place teeming with intrigue and cultural influence.Voice acting performances are well done as well – if only thanks to the various vocal tics that some of the different cast members use. As such, some shout-outs are deserved. Risa Taneda as Kuon and her “I think.” Chinatsu Akasaki as Anju and her “Indeed!” And Madoka Yonezawa as Kokopo and her constant cooing.ENJOYMENTTo be honest, I am disappointed in this one.It felt as though it had a lot of potential. Especially in terms of the characters and their interactions together. Haku actually ended up being a rather boring person to follow. Kuon seemed to get the brunt end of the stick in terms of focus once the cast size became unwieldy. And the rest of the cast were just not interesting – mostly because the anime never cared enough about them.Yet easily the worst character in the entire anime was Dekoponpo. He was so aggravatingly annoying. His dumb-and-arrogant-yet-he-still-gets-away-with-it persona had me shaking my head. And then my eyebrow would raise when the anime continually relied on him. Be it for comedic relief or for some small plot point, he soured the experience completely.It’s fair to say that I would have liked this one more if I had seen the prequel first. This sentiment is apparent in the (obvious even to me) cameos. They didn’t resonate with me. Yes, they were nice for the sake of Kuon and her character, but they lacked the emotion, the nostalgia that such reappearances would garner.A lot of the action was not that gripping, too. Going from smaller, cultural conflicts – gigiri and weird slimes (that are actually the original humans) – and interpersonal, slice-of-life events to countrywide war and massive, mystical beasts was too much of a contrast. I would have preferred the show stick with its more grounded, comedic material despite its slowness.The ending also irked me. I could have maybe forgiven the show for having Haku literally let Kuon go if his maids and Ukon’s little sister did not already know the secret. But, since they did, it made not telling at least Kuon as well – given how distraught and emotional it made her – such a lame conclusion.Even so, not everything was dismal. Kuon getting playfully angry with Haku had me smiling. Rurutie’s constant fantasizing had me chuckling. Ougi’s strange devotion to his sister got laughs out of me. Anju’s childlike crush on Oshutoru had me cheering for the little girl. And Saarana and Uruuru brought a sexual edge that I welcomed.Unfortunately, these positives were unable to overcome this overabundance of negatives.Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen starts off strong but slowly falls down the mountain. While the art and the sound-work deserve some praise, many other areas do not. The narrative has a slew of issues. The characters are unexplored. And various annoyances only serve to hurt the anime. Getting amnesia would be a better alternative.SUMMARYStory: Bad, mystical beginnings give way to inconsequential events, unimportant action, and multiple narrative snagsAnimation: Fine, okay artistic direction, about average actual animation, and nice character designsCharacters: Terrible, too many characters overshadow both Haku and Kuon, preventing any worthwhile developmentSound: Good, good first OP, good second OP, okay first ED, okay second ED, nice OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, while some fun can be found, boring action, a lame ending, and especially Dekoponpo are too ruinous to ignoreFinal Score: 3/10 a man seemingly lost in the woods. He has no knowledge of who he is, and he cannot seem to recall his memories. Kuon decides to name the man Haku, and thus the anime begins.The show definitely starts off on the right foot (or perhaps the right paw). Kuon and Haku form a nice duo. Their silly antics and their potential connection creates a relationship that has a lot of room for growth. The quaint, woodsy setting plays on the mystical, easing the audience into the concepts of animal people, technological deficiency, and otherworldliness. Extra characters bring both fun and purpose. A carefree yet commanding leader, an important princess, and a giant, cooing bird add variety to the show without taking away from its current feeling.Event-wise, the anime takes a combined approach. The majority of the scenes are slice-of-life-oriented, such as Kuon spying on Haku or Haku doing his best at manual labor. Simultaneously, some of the scenes are action-oriented, such as a battle against a massive centipede or a kerfuffle with some thieves.To put it differently, Utawarerumono does well in establishing its premise and direction and scope.Then the anime slows everything down. Really slows it down. For approximately nine episodes, the anime chooses to focus on just slice-of-life material. The first couple of these episodes are acceptable since they help to transition from the old setting and into the new one. But once the show continually goes with this direction, the events themselves start to feel largely inconsequential.For example, some of the group members sneak onto a ship that gets overrun with giant bugs. Anju, the princess, tries to understand what love means. Kamunagi of the Chains, two daughters of the high priestess, are given to Haku as a reward, leading to an episode with a disproportionate number of sexual acts and innuendo.Slowing down the anime so much leads to stagnation. Indirectly, it keeps the cast in single spot for a long while: the capital of Yamato. Consequently, where the first few episodes made progress in terms of world-building and providing motivation for the characters, this stretch of nine or so episodes where very little actually happens feels unfocused.Especially so when the remainder of the season – thirteen episodes – is dedicated to obscene amounts of action. While the fight at Maruruha is pertinent for the masks and Haku’s character, much of this action simply feels pointless. The attacking Usuurussha, bandits basically seeking food, lacks a place in the narrative following their retreat (and despite the big showing the anime made with the daughter of one of their generals). And the entire invasion of Tousukuru, Kuon’s home country, ends up as worthless in the long run.The majority of episode seventeen deserves a special (negative) callout. This episode is dedicated to unveiling a huge revelation: that the Emperor and Haku are the only humans on the planet. In short, the animal-esque people of the world were created by the Emperor after people destroyed themselves, and, also, the Emperor is Haku’s older brother.First, this reveal comes out of nowhere. After those snowy mountains, the stretch of slice-of-life events, and a hefty amount of battling, the anime drops this information on the audience without discretion. And second, and arguably worse, the anime does almost nothing with this information. Haku somewhat gets inspiration from the news when he destroys a provisions storehouse later on, but these relatively gargantuan details have next to no impact on the narrative.But Utawarerumono does not stop there. It also falls prey to other narrative snags. For some reason, the show chooses to kill off the Emperor off screen and without warning. One of the final plotlines, the attempted murder of Anju, does not receive a resolution. Ukon gives up his mask to demonstrate his loyalty to the princess, but it serves no purpose once out of his hands and is even given back to him some time later, making the entire exchange unnecessary.The show runs into thematic trouble as well. It tries to emphasize the necessity of war in order to fight for resources and display dominance. But the majority of the season is not dedicated to war – the first half is (to reiterate) slice-of-life whereas part of the second half is more centralized in its conflicts. In essence, the whole war angle, while appropriate for certain circumstances, does not fit within the anime’s other material.Overall, the narrative begins and means well, but, the further along it proceeds, the more issues it brings upon itself.ANIMATIONUtawarerumono’s artistic direction does well in certain areas but not-so-well in others.For example, the background art is more unfortunate than fortunate. Similar to the story, the backgrounds are supported by the more mystical environment. A mountain village and snowcapped hills purport that differentiation of the land exists (as do the visuals of the first ED). Yet, once the anime constrains its setting to just the capital of Yamato, the anime unfortunately hits a lack of creativity. This misfortune continues into the latter half of the show as well: open fields, some forests, and random towns are not exactly immersive.To be fair, the show does place care in the details. The capital is very cultural with food stalls, stone castles, and minor amenities. Lighting as well. Many moonlit nights, delicate sunsets, and daytime outings blanket the show in various forms of light.Actual animation is somewhere around average. Action sequences, while not the most choreographed, are filled with lots of sword swinging, jumping, and (sometimes) giant fireballs. Downtime is similar in that sequences can see a nice amount of movement – dancing, searching, and joking – but nothing outright dazzling.The character designs are quite nice, though. Mostly because of the extensive variety. While they all derive from (more or less) the same cultural influences, they tout different colors, different animal characteristics, and different styles.For example, Kuon’s long hair, warm colors (light purple, orange, and yellow), and plain tail paint her as a kind and mature woman. Rurutie’s black-and-white garb with pink-colored additions coincide with her princess-yet-lewd and sweet personality. And Munechika’s white-and-blue garb, curled hair, and short tail depict her as the wise commander she is known to be.CHARACTERSUtawarerumono has a singular problem with its cast: Too many characters for its own good.Granted, having a big cast is not an inherent problem. It all comes down to their use. Their purpose. Their execution.In Utawarerumono’s case, the execution fails to be present. Mostly because it continually adds more and more and more characters to the pool without stopping to explore them to any large depth. The show has Haku. And Kuon. And Rurutie and Atui. And Ukon and his little sister. And the samurai and his daughter. And the princess, the emperor, the emperor’s assistant, her two daughters, and…The show rarely explores anyone that is not either Haku or Kuon. They do have their particular characteristics – Rurutie loves boys-love material, Atui is very particular about men, and so on – but these traits get tiresome when they are used over and over without major deviations from their respective formulae.Arguably, they do not need to have development. They do not need any extensive change to their character. Which, to some extent, is true. They are not wholly important to the plot, and there are just way too many of them to adequately divvy up necessary attention.But the show has twenty-five episodes to work with. That’s a lot of time. Presumably enough for everyone involved.Even if these side characters are given exemption, Haku and Kuon’s development is not.Haku started off in a rather interesting spot. Without memories, he had no way of understanding who he was, where he was going, or even why he was there in the first place. But he did know what he wanted to do: nothing. He was lazy.

A man with no memories finds himself in a sword and sorcery world populated by people with animal ears and tails. After being saved from a monster by a cat-girl named Kuon, she declares that from now on she is his guardian and the two begin their journey together.This anime is set several years after season one and includes a few cameo appearances from characters in the first season, but this anime is set in a different country and...you really don\'t need to watch season one before watching this anime.One thing you may be wondering is why this anime is ranked so much lower than season one. Well, that\'s because none of things that made season one good (like strong characters, a great story, cool fight scenes) are  in this anime.Story 3/10While season one was more of an action-adventure story, this anime is mostly a slice-of-life story with most of the anime just being about Haku and the others goofing around in the capital. I like slice-of-life anime, but my problem is that the action and fighting was what I liked the most about season one. Furthermore, usually in a slice-of-life anime there\'s a lot of focus on the characters and their development, but this anime keeps adding new characters and changing focus that we don\'t get the time to develop their personalities.However, this anime does have some action in it with some of the large-scale warfare that was present in season one and some one-on-one fights, too. However, we only get a quick taste of action, though, because in the middle of the battle the focus has to change from the war to whatever Haku is doing leaving me saying ""Can we go back to the fighting?"".Furthermore, season one left me with some questions I was hoping season two would answer, but no such luck. In fact, Hakuoro\'s name never comes up once and we don\'t learn anything that wasn\'t already explained in season one.Finally, I really don\'t understand the beginning of this story. So Kuon saves Haku\'s life and declares that from now on she\'s his guardian...why? I mean Haku and Kuon are complete strangers, but Kuon just randomly decides to be his guardian. What? Usually there\'s a reason the main characters are traveling together like in InuYasha Inuyasha and Kagome are traveling together to find the shards of the sacred jewel, but what sparks Kuon and Haku\'s relationship?Characters 7/10First, I want to clarify that I hate Haku and it\'s all the other characters that got this anime a 7/10.The reason I hate Haku is simply because he is the main character; this anime would be at least ten times better if any other character like Kuon or Ukon were the lead. Haku is lazy, cowardly, and there just isn\'t anything interesting about him at all, but for some reason Ukon and the other characters keep treating him like he\'s some kind of hero. For example, Haku will get captured by bandits, another character rescues him with Haku doing nothing, and later Ukon will be saying something like ""I was impressed by how you defeated those bandits"", even though he did nothing.The one good thing about Haku is that he\'s smart and can find solutions to problems. However, everyone else does the hard work while he just watches or complains. Why is he the main character!!!Kuon, Uknon, Nosuri, and Kokopo (the giant bird that doesn\'t talk, but is somehow still more interesting than Haku) are all far better characters than Haku and I wish there was more focus on them. However, because Haku has to be the center of every episode and this anime keeps adding more characters we don\'t get the chance learn much about them.This anime is like if in Dragon Ball Z Krillin was the main character instead of Goku.Overall 5/10My recommendation is to not watch this anime. It doesn\'t advance the story of season one, Haku may be the worst main character ever, and this anime has none of the things I liked about season one. you really don\'t need to watch season one before watching this anime.One thing you may be wondering is why this anime is ranked so much lower than season one.

The characters and story were superb, the art is solid, but it has one major flaw, an absolute terrible, copout of an ending.Story: 9/10Overall the story was well written and flowed very smoothly, there was action, comedy, general slice of life. There were a few points where things were played up a little much for my liking, but that's pretty subjective. The major flaw with both this and its predecessor are the very horrible endings. They both fell flat on the final episode, like they were written by HBO.Art: 8/10Most of the art in the series...was well done, however, it suffers the same fate as any other anime that tries to rely on 3DCG, it always seems unnatural and breaks the immersion of the show a bit, what makes this one particularly bad though is they try and soften the 3D and make it appear brushstroke which makes it look very unappealing.Sound: 10/10I have zero complaints in the sound department, the voice acting was very well done and fit the characters well. The soundtrack was enjoyable and the sound effects were good.Characters: 9/10As people have stated before me about both this and the previous iteration of this show, the characters are very trope characters, but written well. There is a lack of character development for certain characters which is understandable considering it is only 25 episodes rather than several seasons spanning over years. All of the likeable characters were that as with the unlikeable characters. You could tell right off the bat whether they fell into either category.Enjoyment: 8/10I gave this an 8/10 for 2 simple reasons. First, the ending, it felt very unsatisfying especially after seeing the characters interacting the way that they did. Second, there were a few times where pacing was an issue for me as it either rushed through a situation or dragged something out far too long (i.e. last episode dragged)Overall: 8/10This show is truly enjoyable, I decided to pick it up as the third season is airing soon and I plan to watch it. Despite some nitpicking and minor flaws I do recommend giving it a watch was well done, however, it suffers the same fate as any other anime that tries to rely on 3DCG, it always seems unnatural and breaks the immersion of the show a bit, what makes this one particularly bad though is they try and soften the 3D and make it appear brushstroke which makes it look very unappealing.Sound: 10/10I have zero complaints in the sound department, the voice acting was very well done and fit the characters well. The soundtrack was enjoyable and the sound effects were good.Characters: 9/10As people have stated before me about both this and the previous iteration of this show, the characters are very trope characters, but written well. There is a lack of character development for certain characters which is understandable considering it is only 25 episodes rather than several seasons spanning over years. All of the likeable characters were that as with the unlikeable characters. You could tell right off the bat whether they fell into either category.Enjoyment: 8/10I gave this an 8/10 for 2 simple reasons.

The games compared to the adaptation are so much more fleshed out and ""complete"" feeling. Though I still recommend the anime from season 1-3, if you truly want the Utawarerumono experience then please go play the games. Many reviewers are not wrong when they say that the anime can be a mess/rushed because it is true. There is simply too much material to be adapted into an anime that is limited by 20 minute episodes which makes many fans of the games undervalue the effort put into...the anime. I myself believe that in conjunction with the games, the anime serves as a great portrayer due to the game\'s style as a visual novel, it at times cannot create a scene as beautifully as an anime can (I believe the anime portrays some scenes/moments much better than the games). So once again, I recommend watching the anime, but if you want the best experience then play the games. the anime.

Slayers Revolution,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4028/Slayers_Revolution,"['Continuity is sometimes the most elusive aspect of any long running story, especially where multiple seasons, new storylines and characters, and real world breaks of several years are involved. Thankfully the studios behind the majority of anime titles try not to make more work for themselves (although some do take this ethos to the extreme - you know who you are), and these days the majority of shows that run for more than one season tend to have an average gap of about one year between each series..If ever there was a truth in anime though, it\'s that you can always rely on Lina Inverse...and her gang (including everyone involved with the making of anything to do with Slayers), to complicate matters.Having had a rest period of seven years following the end of Slayers Premium (the fifth movie), anime\'s flagship fantasy comedy roared back into life in 2008 with the release of Slayers Revolution, and to the legions of fans around the world the news that a new series of medieval mischief making was on the horizon was met with huge amounts of expectation.The only question was, could the franchise go toe-to-toe with the post millennium big guns.Slayers Revolution begins with Lina and Gourry doing what they do best - wreaking havoc. Having made bandits an endangered species on land the pair have taken to the high seas to hunt pirates (until the bandit population recovers that is). Meanwhile, Amelia and Zelgadis are escorting someone who wishes to meet with Lina ...The first thing that one can say about the story is that it is Slayers through and through. The plot is pretty straight forward for the most part, although there are a few detours over the course of the 13 episodes. The storyline is predictable in a number of areas, and the somewhat simplistic approach to storytelling can sometimes be a little childish.Probably the biggest criticism though, is that the formula used for both the plot and storyline is relatively unchanged from that used in the first three series. During the seven year absence of Lina and her friends the medium of anime has become more mature in many aspects, and given this fact one has to question the reasoning behind using the old formula, even if it is tried and tested.That said, probably the biggest surprise is that there\'s still life in the method and approach adopted by director Watanabe Takashi, and it\'s his experience as the director of the original three seasons of Slayers that really shows in Revolution. The old tricks, plot devices and techniques used by the production team, especially the writers, are all on display, and while there are perfectly valid criticisms that can be levelled at the series, fans of the franchise will find the story not only understandable, but very, very familiar.It\'s not only the storyline that is pure Slayers. Everything from the characters to the scenery follow the designs from the original three series, and while Revolution may not look as appealing as many modern shows, what it lacks in style it more than makes up for in attention to detail.Now some may consider the design principle in Slayers to be dated, and to be honest, it is. It should be noted though, that while Revolution is open to new viewers of the franchise, it\'s not actually geared towards them. Slayers has always resisted the common urge to reinvent itself in order to appeal to a younger audience, and it\'s this dedication to the spirit and ethos of the franchise that really stands out with Revolution, especially after a gap of so many years.The big plus for fans is that while the overall look of the show is exactly what one would expect from Slayers, the character designs are ever so subtly sharper and more detailed. In addition to this the series really benefits from the use of modern animation techniques, and it\'s to the credit of J.C. staff that they continue to maintain the standards they set in the first three series.The other major bonus for fans is that the gang really are all here. Any fan of Slayers will immediately recognise the seiyuu in the roles of Lina, Gourry, Amelia, Zelgadis, and even Xellos and Sylphie. The production team have spared no effort in their attempts to maintain continuity, even going so far as to have the same actors and actresses reprise their roles from the original three series. It\'s this attention to detail that sets Slayers apart from most other shows, especially as the franchise could very easily have gone down the path of Sakura Taisen (i.e. each series had a different studio, cast and director).The music is a bit strange though, but not in a bad way. There are some very good pieces that are suitably over the top when necessary, and many of the other tracks are well chosen, although the timing is sometimes a little off in certain scenes. The OP is a fairly typical beats-per-minute dance track by Hayashibara Megumi (the actress who plays Lina Inverse), called ""Plenty of Grit"" that seems a bit of an odd choice for the beginning of a fantasy anime. The ED, ""Revolution"", is your common or garden J-Pop song that is also by the same artist. The weird thing is that both tracks seem to work, but also seem a little out of place where the franchise is concerned.Maybe it\'s just me though ...Moving on, one of the things that has long been a hallmark of Slayers are the strong characterisations associated with each of the lead roles, and Revolution is no exception to this. Unfortunately, because this is only a 13 episode series there\'s not as much room for the characters to breathe and grow, especially when the show detours from the main storyline for one reason or another.The upside though, is that the characters are exactly what those familiar with the franchise would expect. Lina is still as bad tempered as ever, Gourry is still as dumb as a brick, Zelgadis continues to be the cleverest member of the gang, and Amelia remains a justice freak. The new characters are a pretty mixed bunch, with Pokota leading the field when it comes to weird. Probably the most interesting addition is Wizer Freion, who at first appears to be a typical bumbling detective, but may or may not be almost as smart as Xellos - the series is never quite clear on that point.As I said before, Slayers Revolution is mainly geared towards fans of the franchise, and as a card carrying member it\'s pretty obvious that I\'d have high expectations of the series, and I wasn\'t disappointed ... much. The series is fun, sometimes inventive and original (Pokota, for example), and as action packed and humourous as the original three seasons, but there\'s something ... not quite right about it.Prior to the seven year break Lina, as a character, had a degree of charm about her that prevented her from becoming annoying. The problem is that Watanabe tries to apply some of anime\'s current maturity to Revolution\'s characters, and the results are a bit of a mixed bag. Everyone is as goofy, charming, secretive, and downright bad tempered as ever, but there\'s an edge to them now that wasn\'t there before, and while it does give the viewer a new perspective on the characters, it also takes away a little bit of what made Slayers great in the first place.This series may not sit well with some people but the majority of fans might generally be pleased with this addition to the franchise. From the character designs and rather simple plot, to the combative relationships and over the top hi-jinks, Slayers Revolution does a surprisingly decent job of living up to the standards set by the first three seasons. While it may have lost a little something along the way, it may have also gained something as rather than changing everything about the show in one fell swoop, it looks as though Watanabe and J.C. Staff are taking a more subtle approach to bringing the franchise into the 21st century.We shall have to wait and see ... and her gang (including everyone involved with the making of anything to do with Slayers), to complicate matters.Having had a rest period of seven years following the end of Slayers Premium (the fifth movie), anime\'s flagship fantasy comedy roared back into life in 2008 with the release of Slayers Revolution, and to the legions of fans around the world the news that a new series of medieval mischief making was on the horizon was met with huge amounts of expectation.The only question was, could the franchise go toe-to-toe with the post millennium big guns.Slayers Revolution begins with Lina and Gourry doing what they do best - wreaking havoc.

It just gets way too predictable because none of the main characters do any training whatsoever so it\'s pretty much always the same spells. When will they learn that Fireball doesn\'t do anything to other magic users? The end is lame because of the cliche method used to win. If you read the series description, it says that Gourry needs a new sword, he doesn\'t really get one for keeps even though that was what they were doing in the first place. Along with...filler, I give the story a 5. It just seemed very dry to me and it left a lot of things not taken care of. I have to give credit to episode 8 though. The fight was great and was the highlight of the series.Art: I gave a 10 because I loved seeing these characters animated in a clean and consistent way. Despite that the old animation is dated, it was nothing amazing even for its time so it was nice.Sound: Same cast doing the voices. I didn\'t mind that, no one should. It was great to hear Megumi Hayashibara doing voice acting again after such a long time. Ost didn\'t really stand out to me. The opening and ending songs were okay but to me, just not as good as the classic songs from the older Slayers series.Character: I loved seeing Xellos again. He was in the opening and the ending making me think there\'d finally be a main character in this series who actually knows what he\'s doing. I thought ""Oh, man. This is gonna be great."" Sadly, he hardly did anything and it took him a while to show up. He was totally ineffectual at the end too... he gets a less than one minute cameo in the last episode. While this section seems biased, Xellos was the main reason I watched this at all because the other characters are lame and very weak for a series like this. As mentioned in the story section, none of them are any stronger and they think junk like Fireball can take out a major enemy. Amelia and Zelgadis don\'t seem to be needed because they don\'t do anything. They aren\'t even good backup. For example...In the previous Slayers series, Xellos would get weakened by positive statements. Say ""The world is a happy place."" and he\'ll kind of topple over and get weak. In episode 8 that I mentioned in the story section, Xellos fights Lina and friends (I know, awesome right?) but none of the characters thought to use positive thinking as a weapon. No, instead Lina and Zelgadis use Fireball... I guess after so many years the characters and writers have forgotten everything and threw continuity out the window.The writers need to step up on these characters because this show is more than comedy, there\'s fighting so... the mains need to figure out how to do that and not be terrible at it. I know a huge part of what draws people in are the interactions between our main cast but seriously, Fireball gets old...Now for the new guys. We have Pokota who is the Terriermon-looking thing who pretty much only argues with Lina. EVERYBODY argues with Lina so this was nothing new and it looks like Pokota\'s here to stay. He didn\'t stick to me either like Xellos did, as soon as I saw Xellos I knew he was good people. As for the villains, I didn\'t care for them. They even integrate Rezo back into the story which seemed lame to me.Enjoyment: Episode 8, that is all I needed to see. The rest was pretty hard to sit through. Had to force myself to finish it, it was a pain waiting each week for a new episode only to be sadly disappointed. I did not enjoy watching this series.Overall: They set us up for another season since a lot of the enemies need more development. One has a beef with Lina that went unexplained, one\'s name is Rezo spelled backward which has to mean something and one is now half horse and half tiger living in the forest. Trust me, those aren\'t really spoilers. I know I\'ll go and watch it despite my complaints if one comes out but I hope it\'s better than Revolution. I don\'t care that the averages of my scores don\'t add up to 6 but it\'s really that bad.Thank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Hope this helped.', 'As a huge fan of the original 3 series I was excited when a new series of slayers came out, although not too expectant since inevitably it was much more likely to be an amusing expansion to the franchise rather than a hugely epic series. Still I expected I’d get some giggles and nostalgia and that would be fine.Instead we got this hideous example of how to simultaneously milk your franchise while destroying it instead. It’s difficult to describe how sad this series made me after the ‘plot’ starts to take hold in the 3rd episode, and it only got worse until it finally...hit rock bottom with the promise of going further downhill in time for the next series. There will be some mild spoilers in my ranting but nothing too serious.This series did occasionally have some slayers –like moments but the vast majority of it suffered from a seeming disconnect I wasn’t able to always look past. All the spells seem to have been converted from the previous series in bland CG which by itself is nothing to complain about but somehow they all seemed to render ugly and often have effects wildly different then how the pervious series handled them. Somehow I also feel like they somehow managed to derail Linas character but making her less egomaniacal and more homicidal maniac (one episode she apparently seems to be willfully trying to kill Amelia, a person she would probably have taken a bullet for in previous series). I’m not usually a person to notice or care about these things but this seriously bothered me while I was watching.The worst and most offensive part of this series is how it shamelessly steals it villains and plotlines from the original series, needlessly resurrecting perfectly resolved plot threads from 3 series ago. This is not only makes for heinously lazy story writing but also undermines events that happened way back in the original story. This is the sort of thing I expect from amateur fan fiction not a supposedly serious animated sequel. They even resurrected the rather badass eldritch abomination Zanaffer from the original series, gave him a completely needless origin story, and then reintroduced him as the kind of super villain character I would expect to get beaten up in an episode of captain planet, seriously who wrote this stuff and thought this was a good idea, and we haven’t even started on the new Rezo plotline.  As if killing him twice in the original series wasn’t already enough they are apparently so stuck for ideas they felt the need to bring him back AGAIN 3 seasons later to facilitate their pathetic writing.So in summery this is series is disappointing garbage without much in it to make up for that fact. It’s not funny enough or well presented enough to make up for its atrocious plot which seems bent on destroying its own franchise. I can’t recommend this to anybody. hit rock bottom with the promise of going further downhill in time for the next series.

I have fond memories of watching it in high school, and although it's nowhere near the best show I've watched, I have a lot of fun with it.

It actually demonstrated a growth in the quality of this show, and proved that Slayers...can come out of the 90s and bring itself to the 21st century ;).Speaking about the storyline, that’s the point where they actually lost me… i just didn’t get a lot of things and that kinda upset me: [SPOILERS] why was Pokota destroying those tanks in the first place [the reason Lina got involved in this story]; what was the deal with Wizer that he couldn’t even do his job as a cop [inspector, actually] without Lina’s help; why was the first episode the same as in TRY [Lina on a ship, robbing some bandits, and Amelia turning up on official business on the nearest coast town]; what was Duclis’ motivation anyway for summoning Zanafar [ya should know i just spent half an hour trying to remember the tiger’s name] and WHY was the monster so lame after all in the end? Slayers never really stood out for its great storyline, but i just think the writers could have handled this half-season a bit differently and at least bring the illusion that the story is heading somewhere or makes any sense at all. The second-half of the season was better, but besides killing Zanafar, the story proves it is not complete since a lot of questions remain unanswered.I really enjoyed seeing Xellos in the series and Sylphiel too, but the Pokota guy…he was just awkward: he was like a Bleachy stuffed-animal mixed with a Pokemon determination and motivation to save the world. He seemed interesting at first, being able to use the Dragon Slave just like Lina, but he became useless as the story developed. Wizer was kind of a mysterious man and, at some point, i was just struck by the resemblance between him and Xellos, both being men who seem to always have their own agenda.Overall, what i think i enjoyed the most was the feeling of watching Slayers again after 3 years of absence. I know this particular season isn’t exactly the best one, but if you’re an old fan of Slayers and you’ve watched the prequels, you should try and get through this one just for the sake of old times. What you do need to know is that Evolution-R makes almost no sense if you haven’t watched Revolution.Let me know if you’ve found my review helpful or not^^! can come out of the 90s and bring itself to the 21st century ;).Speaking about the storyline, that’s the point where they actually lost me… i just didn’t get a lot of things and that kinda upset me: [SPOILERS] why was Pokota destroying those tanks in the first place [the reason Lina got involved in this story]; what was the deal with Wizer that he couldn’t even do his job as a cop [inspector, actually] without Lina’s help; why was the first episode the same as in TRY [Lina on a ship, robbing some bandits, and Amelia turning up on official business on the nearest coast town]; what was Duclis’ motivation anyway for summoning Zanafar [ya should know i just spent half an hour trying to remember the tiger’s name] and WHY was the monster so lame after all in the end?

The animation changes, and makes the characters much more ""cutesy"" than they should be.Next and Try were amazing, and Revolution/Evolution-R just didn\'t cut it.The story is weak, and as opposed to creating a new villain, they once again fight Zanafarr. He was already killed once! So, for that matter, was Rezo.While it was funny the first time the chief inspector shows up to arrest Lina, it gets old VERY fast. And the first episode is just terrible. At least it seems that the people of their...world gained cannons from the outer world. Either that, or they forgot that they used Sorcerers for that.The best part of the season was when Zelgadis used pieces of his hair as throwing-daggers, and the opening theme, ""plenty of grit""Xellos is also my favourite character of the series, and while it was fun to see him fight the others, he seemed to have little purpose outside of being the series\' most popular character. At least in Try, he had a very good reason to be there!So overall, I\'d rather pretend that this arc didn\'t exist. world gained cannons from the outer world.

Even the seyuu\'s (voice actors) were exactly the same as I remembered them.Considering that this particular title was one of my childhood-favourites, I can safely say that Justice has been done to the Series, as ""Slayers - Rvolution"" follows the show\'s recepy of 3-parts Comedy, 2-parts Mayham and Destruction...almost to-the-letter, which tastes GREAT btw ^_^...trust me on that.That is not to say that the series has no plot-line however. Far from it, ""Evolution-R"" again honures it\'s predecessor by implementing it\'s usual style whacky, almost incoherent antics (Lina blows-up another town for no-good-reason),Incohensible arcane Misteries (no one yet knows what Xellos\'s DEAL is! ""...it\'s a Secret *wink*""),And of course a healthy dosage of slapstick Comedy (Goury trips on his cape ...again)That baing said, Slayers Revolution & Evolution-R are the best sequels a Show of this calliber could have been blessed with,...Zelgadis is still an Insensitive prick however :( almost to-the-letter, which tastes GREAT btw ^_^...trust me on that.That is not to say that the series has no plot-line however.

Not that this one was horrible it just seemed like it was too short and they could have gone more in depth with it then the short , quick , and easy way. Like how the...heck did Rezo randomly come into this again and why is he back. I'm really starting to think that this guy will just never leave which is starting to irritate me a lot and I'm pretty sure that it's irritating everyone else too. But it was interesting how they added the new characters with their own stories. Like with Pokota and Duclis. I have no idea if anyone else noticed , but with what happened to their town was like long long ago in England with the plague and all. Which seemed kinda interesting because they made their own version of the plague , and yet of course Rezo came in to save the day , which wasn't really all that surprising.Art , I gave a 10 / 10 . The art is better I admit from the old seasons of Slayers , but only because the computer art stuff has progressed over the years , and then the series was taken over by a new company also. But the art has improved which I give cheers for.Sound I gave 8 / 10. The music . . . is different now , but still kind of the same but I prefer the old music from the old seasons then the new one. But the sound affects were great along with all the blasts from the magic and sword fighting jazz stuff.For characters I gave 9 / 10. I give them props for adding new characters , but the only thing that annoys me is Pokota. When he was in his original form before he got transferred to that weird doll thing , he looked WAY too much like a girl. He looked like a tom boy girl with long pink hair , and that large hoop earring on the left ear annoyed me , A LOT. Then theres also Zuuma , we barely got to know anything about him which bothered me. They should have gone more in depth with Zuuma other then announcing he's some big all time ' assassin ' that always gets the job done. Then they left a completely HUGE thing about him becoming an assassin because of Lina , they never explained that which entirely bothers me too and I want to know the reason in that. But then I'm also glad to see that they haven't changed any of the main characters personalities besides just making Lina more violent and more quicker to blast people with a dragon slave. But other than that , I'm content with all the characters in the anime.For enjoyment I gave 9 / 10 , I'm pretty sure everyone will enjoy this anime if your into these kind of animes , but for those who are fans of the old seasons of Slayers you may be a little disappointed with some things but still be content. There is some flaws in this season of Slayers , but all in all it's very enjoyable.And my overall score for this season of Slayers is 8 / 10.Despite all the flaws of the season and how different it is from the old seasons , I'm pretty sure Slayer fans and people who are new to Slayers will enjoy it. You will be basically laughing all the time from the goofiness , silliness , and all the stupid parts. You can never be bored when Lina Inverse is there because she always makes things entertaining.I hope my review helped you guys out and make all those who haven't seen Slayers yet , take a chance and decide to watch it. heck did Rezo randomly come into this again and why is he back.

Solty Rei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/152/Solty_Rei,"['The series aired some 9 years ago, and writing this right now in early 2015, I guess it\'s safe for me to personally call this series the ""Guilty Crown"" of 2005/06.[STORY: 8/10]Just like GC, this was a wonderfully crafted original story. Looking around I see people giving this series up because the front few episodes were too boring or sub-standard. All I can say is that, they\'ve missed out on the bigger picture altogether. Indeed, at the start it may seem as though the series was episodic, but trust me all that served as a build-up right till the finale. A suitable build-up too, if...I may add. All in all, I felt the story had a good flow to it and, on top of that, a really good ending (unlike certain series today).[ART: 7/10]Yes, yes... I know it\'s 2015 now. We\'re in the midst of the era of bishoujo appearing in every series we click on. But let\'s cut them some slack, shall we? For a series airing in 2005, the characters actually looked pretty decent. The action scenes were pretty well animated too. The thing about Original series is that the animation is usually consistent throughout the entire course, and that\'s what happened here.[SOUND: 9/10]Created in the period of time when Seiyuus (voice actors) were less celebrated than now, it was only natural that they fit the roles for the characters. Besides the cast, the background music and OST are magnificent. Nearly every scene had a BGM on it, and I\'d have to say that each piece of music really fit the scenario, both in happy or sad times. I\'ve already got the OST and it\'s pretty incredible, trust me.[CHARACTER: 9/10]This is where you\'ll have to watch through the entire series to understand. Through the 24 episodes, there is significant character development, especially to the two main characters (namely Solty and Roy). Of course, each character did have their own flaws, but they learnt from it through really heart-warming personal experiences. I pretty much liked every character in this series, but I kinda get annoyed when girls cry... and this series happen to have quite a few so... yeap but that aside, I was alright with everyone.[ENJOYMENT: 10/10]No qualms in this section from me. From start to finish, I\'ve thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this. The comical scenes made me smile, the emotional scenes (nearly) made me tear up and the action scenes got me captivated. It may be just me, but I wasn\'t bored in any point of watching this series.[OVERALL: 10/10]So, why not? This is my favourite anime series by some margin, and though it sticks in my mind as a 9 or 9.5, I\'ll give them credit and overrate a little on my part to give a 10. I really hope you guys will check it out. Even though it\'s a series which aired a long time ago, I believe it deserves some form of recognition.That\'s all from me, and thanks so much for your time! (:Cheers. I may add. All in all, I felt the story had a good flow to it and, on top of that, a really good ending (unlike certain series today).[ART: 7/10]Yes, yes... I know it\'s 2015 now.

I just hope my review doesn't stop people from watching this, because you might enjoy it. ^_^In a world where the sky is filled with some kind of Aurora Shell , which holds the atmosphere together, has caused a devastating incident known as the Blast Fall. 12 years later this anime follows the story of an ex-cop now bounty hunter Roy Revant, who's been searching for his missing daughter since the Blast Fall.This basically sets out the story for the rest of this of this anime however it's...mostly compiled of a bunch of adventures that make up a story. This was done well to begin with but then the story just gets out of control halfway into it. The main focus is on Roy's search for his missing daughter but it often loses focus and goes unto something completely different, especially during the latter half of the series.The main thing I noticed about this anime was how much it borrowed of other animes or shows, which is the main reason why it didn't standout at all. Even the characters personalities felt boring and unoriginal especially Solty, who's voice got so incredibly annoying I just wanted mute it at times. I also felt that when it got to the sadder moments of the show the characters were really over dramatic, another little annoyance. But the main thing I didn't like was what happened to half the main characters, which I won't spoil for anyone.The animation of this anime was decent nevertheless one noticeable thing was the CGI. There are animes that were able to implement it well (Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Trinity Blood) but this isn't one of them. The CGI just made things feel weaker than it already did and left little to be amazed by. Although, it was no where near as bad as the music. The opening and ending theme songs were alright but the soundtrack was terrible. What made it worse was that the music never blended well with the situation, it just felt like some &quot;emo&quot; kid wanted to put in his favourite track whenever he possibly could and that's what he got. XDTo summarize, even though this anime borrowed a lot of ideas, it could have used them better. The plot was good but the second storyline spoilt it, with all its random events occurring, which tried to tie it in with the first storyline. The ending was OK but it still was too crazy and left little to the imagination. I really did expect more this anime but maybe that was the problem, because my high expectations is what left me completely and utterly displeased with what I got.I recommend this decent show it anyone who's open-minded but there are much better anime series out there to choose from.^_^ mostly compiled of a bunch of adventures that make up a story.

It ran from late 2005 to early 2006. Hiraike Yoshimasa took charge of the direction. The series was designed as a sci-fi drama. Since it wasn't based on anything, it's difficult to predict how well it does with that combination. The worst sci-fi work I've reviewed from AIC was just mediocre. I have looked at some really horrendous works from Gonzo, including the sci-fi western Sunabouzu, but I've also seen some strong offerings from both of them. So, will this collaboration be one of those higher quality works?Story:In...a far off future, society is run by a mega company called the RUC. Laws are largely enforced by bounty hunters, with the regular police being really ineffectual. One such hunter is Roy Revant, a grizzled veteran who's spent twelve years searching for his daughter, who was lost in an event called the Blast fall. One day while he's on a case, a strange, amnesiac green-haired girl falls from the sky. Because plot convenience amnesia helps build mystery. It's not lazy writing at all. She takes a liking to Roy and begins following him around. He resists at first, telling her to go home but takes pity on her and gives her the name “Solty,” taking her in. Roy and Solty aren't in for an easy time, though. There's something decidedly unkosher happening with the RUC and a trio of unregistered residents are certain to complicate matters further.The biggest problem with the series is the ending. We get a lot of mystery surrounding various events that I can't go into without major spoilers and the ultimate answers that we get are pretty weak. The last couple episodes rush out multiple climaxes and only one of them is even semi-well handled. Really, the series tries to do too much in the span of two or three episodes and it fails to properly set a lot of it up so you get plot lines that feel like they're coming out of nowhere. The series also suffers from dumb villain plots. There are three antagonistic figures working separately, or against each other, who all have stupid, nonsensical plans. I think they learned how to develop cunning plans from Baldrick.On the positive side, the world building is pretty interesting and the series, in spite of going off the rails at the end, does have a lot of genuinely good moments. If it had focused on a single antagonist and fleshed out their plan better, this could have been a great series. There are some good ideas behind the main narrative as well and most of them aren't executed badly. The series is also good at balancing serious and more light-hearted moments and managing its tone really well.Characters:The biggest weakness in terms of characters are the major antagonists. Since their motivations don't make sense and their plans are idiotic. The major protagonists and supporting characters, on the other hand, are a really strong group of characters. They're fleshed out. They develop over the course of the series and they get a lot of good character moments that develop them and their relationships with one another. The series is particularly good with familial bonding moments and some of its best scenes by far are focused on that dynamic.Art:The artwork is mostly nicely done. The characters look good and the various futuristic elements have visual appeal. The Aurora wave that keeps people from going too high up in the atmosphere is really nice looking. The action sequences are a bit hit or miss. In some of them, the use of CG really detracts from the sequence. Since the CG can be really awkward. Others are quite good. Some of the futuristic clothes the characters wear can be just ridiculous too. Solty's outfit, for example, has a random triangle right over her bum and another right over her bosom. Why are there random triangles and why are they positioned so that they could be easily construed as downwards arrows? That's just a bad idea. At best you look clueless at worst you look like you're trying to draw attention to those areas in a decidedly unclassy way.Sound:There are some good actors in this. Nakata Jouji, Asano Masumi, Noto Mamiko, Hirohashi Ryou, Itou Shizuka, Tamura Yukari & Saitou Momoko all give strong performances. There really aren't any bad performances. The music is pretty good as well.Ho-yay:There are some scenes between Solty and Rose early on that get a bit homo-erotic, but the series eases off on that for reasons that become quite apparent. There are also the girls in the RUC. Celica and Accela seem to be into each other. Integra also has moments where she seems to be interested in other women.Final Thoughts:In spite of its problems, Solty Rei is a good anime. Aside from the antagonists, it has strong characters and there are some compelling facets to the story. If you can tolerate the stupid villain plans, it is worth watching. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week we'll finish the month with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. a far off future, society is run by a mega company called the RUC.

My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week we'll finish the month with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom."", ""I will start by saying that if you are not sure if to watch it or not, I recomend to try and watch it. It might be worth it :)Story:The story is a little hard to understand when the show starts (aside from the 'oh it's a homeless girl, why shoulden't we bring her home?'), and though that even as the show goes on it really dosen't get any clearer, at some point the REAL story would unfold, so hang in there :)Once you understand the whole story, it's kinda nice. Not the BEST story, but one that isen't really f#$$ed up like some animes.Art:The...art is OUTSTANDING. I think we need more animes with such art.Sound:Sound is cool. Can't think of a reason I shoulden't give it 9.Character:Some characters are somewhat lacking (story, background, and mostly development), but the characters themselves are avarage+.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show alot.

Keep in mind that though it starts as a 'Take-the-homeless-girl-home-and-make-her-a-part-of-your-family' kind of story that we see alot in animes, it WILL change soon enough to something more like 'Kick-the-s@#t-out-of-them-super-humans'.

Please don\'t Read unless You\'ve already watched this anime or you really want my attention to certain ""spoils"" on the anime. I Really enjoy watching Solty Rei cause it tells a tail of a robotic girl who was sent to Earth but at first for only for her sisters reasoning towards humans and their cultural. Her biggest sister is a huge ship that hates humans and demands to destroy mankind everywhere in her path. She reads data not emotions awhile Solty can read emotions but not data. This is better to put to you when you think about it,...only live with emotions, data is suppose to be used for something more criminalized or adventures of some sort. I\'m glad Solty beat her because if she destroys the planet, how are you going to watch the anime with the characters? You\'ll be blown when you watch the anime so I highly recommend watching it. Yes its mecha,comedy and drama. You can watch it in English,Japanese,and I think other languages as well.The girl named Solty is completely robotic and is suppose to know how to have emotions. She hit her head as well, it even hurts for someone who isn\'t human at all. She saved humans everyday in the anime.Bullets won\'t affect her at all either. Miranda is her friend and a really close friend of Roy\'s Wife. The accident was devastating to bare all at once.I have watched them but on Fumination and the scenes are great for watching. Its has great action towards the characters.Solty loves protecting everyone. I\'m really happy she knocks out every other bad person that tries to kill people. Solty has an amazing vibe, she\'ll even kill you if she sees someone get hurt because of what you did to that person. Her voice actress is Carrie Savage and I love her forever. You can see Solty voice from Carrie\'s favorite line of Solty ""I hate bad people"" over YouTube. Her voice blows you away.Rose Anderson, her new sister and really good friend at heart used to be a thug but learned to live life to the fullest and Solty made her through it. Solty Influenced almost everyone to do their best and not fail once. Rose only steeled because she and her brothers didn\'t have enough money. They became wanted criminals and unregistered citizens.I love the Art because I have never seen a girl with green curly hair and big light punches before that could punch a pole everywhere she went. By punch I mean,her punches are dramatic way of saying \'get out of my way\', ""I have protect everyone"". Even her outfit changed from the beginning to the end of the anime. Shes great in every way possible. If you see a bad person in this world, pretend your Solty and of course of your punches are strong like hers.The sound is great, especially the tune of the blues CD Solty\'s dad played for the whole family. Its on the soundtrack to.Every character lived from life to death, half of the main characters are still living awhile the others have died. I wish not any character would die, its very burden to see someone die in a story.Overall, plus my enjoyment is just down right flawless to watch. Don\'t let life bring you down ever.

For the most part it\'s a fairly predictable anime, but there are parts of it that make it stand out.The story is fairly average but adequate, being mostly a homage to THE MATRIX: rebels fighting an oppressive authority (two characters are even named Larry and Andy) within a confined system, a villain whose ulterior motive is to break free of that system, and a heroine who develops her own identity and ultimately becomes a hero to save her family. The story also has an uneven pace at times, sliding between an...epic battle for the fate of a world and an intimate look at the protagonists\' day-to-day experiences. Still, for the most part it tells its story competently enough.But the real heart of the tale is the bond between the bounty hunter Roy and the amnesiac Solty, and for me is the most satisfying part. All the other plot angles form a backdrop to this angle, about two lost souls who become a family. Gruff loner Roy Revant is a widower, while Solty is a lost waif who doesn\'t even have a memory. The way the two grow closer together across the series \x96 defending each other, helping and relying on each other, and even hurting each other but making amends later (this one is fairly one-sided, on Roy\'s part naturally) \x96 is maturely and carefully handled, and comes to a heartwarming payoff.The English voice cast is very well done, in my opinion Christopher Sabat (Roy) and Carrie Savage (Solty) did some of their best performances in this anime. And the artwork, while the blend of hand-drawn and computer-generated animation is a little awkward, wonderfully shows off the steampunk setting. The soundtrack is atmospheric and jazzy, with some great tracks that fit the mood of whichever scene it\'s being used for (the closing track ""Float Beyond the Sky"" is a favourite of mine).On the whole, it\'s a nice story, with a touching family angle.

The plot is great as well as the twist of the story, frankly I really thought that Solty is the missing daughter of Roy but sudden shock that its Rose. I totally understand their techie talk about the Aurora and the nanomachines and...etc., unlike other science based Animes.Emotion-wise its really great, because never thought of an anime that a cold bounty hunter like Roy could burst an emotion like that. I ended goosebumps and actually cried in the end of the series.Its been years since I cried on the end of an Anime series.

The one main thing that kept me at bay for a while was the poor art and animation...and, not gonna lie, throughout the show, it doesn\'t get much better either. Infact, I\'d say the art and animation downright sucked in this show. But the thing that makes this show amazing deals with everything else.One way I...liked to refer to it as, is a JK Rowling level story, made with a Hentai\'s production value........I have no idea why THAT was the comparison that came to my mind at the time, but I decided to roll with it.In short, the story was one of the best aspects of this show. It takes a while to get going, but once it did, It sucked me in right away. I\'m not gonna lie that the pacing could get a little wonky, and it felt super choppy at points, but all In all I\'d say it held up nicely. The climax was well handled, and I actually didn\'t see it coming. The ending took a pretty intense turn and got...pretty difficult to follow along with, not gonna lie. However, that\'s not the shows fault, that\'s me being kinda dumb with all that technical stuff. I was able to understand the gist of it, and I honestly found it all fascinating. Everything came full circle, and I believed it.The next best aspect of the show is definitely the characters. All of them were really interesting, and I cared about them. Whenever the characters were going through something, I believed their struggle and I sympathised with them. When one of the characters would die, It actually made me legitimately upset. Like, I\'m pretty sure I cried about 5 times during this show...not something that happens often. As well, alot of the characters were given really good development. While, there are some characters I would of liked to have been explored more, I was satisfied with what I got. I even empathized with the antagonist at the end. I was sure I\'d royally despise him throughout the show, but I actually believed his struggle and felt sorry for him.One of my main issues with the show deal with what I said at the start. The art and animation...are not that good. I know it\'s an older anime, but I\'ve seen better looking shows from the 90s. Which makes me upset that a story as good as this was given such poor animation. It deserved so much more than what it was given.

This is one of the earliest anime I have watched.  And until now, none of the recent anime challenge your emotions as hard as this one.  It is one anime that none will forget.Story:  A well rounded story.Unlike many anime that have a great start and a F***ed up ending, this is one of the few that kept it interesting till the end.  Many twist made the audience go awed, but I hate to admit, extremely confusing...in some part (that is later revealed).

However, if you compare that kind of graphic in the year 2005 with other anime at that time, I would say it is reasonably presented.  I personally like this kind of drawing.Character: A little too wide of varietyIf I must say a downside to this anime, it would be too many vital characters.  When I first watch this, there are seriously a lot of characters and you would get attached easily to each of them.  Heed my warning though as this can make you suffer halfway through…Enjoyment:  Like I say…  A Hell of a ride…Overall, I enjoy this.  I mean it would be hard to find another anime that can cause as many emotions as this one.  Some may say it would be too tear jerking…  I say it would be great…Moral of the Story:  Extremely great.In every anime, there should be a moral lesson for the viewers.

I myself only came across the anime by accident via a now-taken down video from Youtube, and ultimately decided to check it out because it seemed interesting. While I can\'t say I regret watching it, I wouldn\'t put it particularly high on my rewatch list, as it doesn\'t really stand out in any meaningful way.Story (7/10):Set in...the distant future, twelve years after the planet was ravaged by a mysterious disaster, ""Solty Rei"" follows Roy Revant, a gruff middle-aged bounty hunter with a troubled past who spends his days hunting down various dangerous cyborgs called Resembles. One day, while on what initially seems like any other job for him, he encounters a mysterious girl covered by nothing but a battered cloth. Soon after, he learns three things about her in quick succession- she has very unusual-looking ears, she has strength well beyond that of any human, cyborg or otherwise, and she has no idea who she is. After saving Roy\'s life twice (once indirectly and once directly), the girl becomes acquainted with Roy\'s associates, including his employer Miranda Maverick and her daughter Kasha, and ultimately gets taken in by Roy as his adopted daughter, with Roy giving her the name ""Solty"". The series then follows both Solty gradually adjusting to daily human life and Roy\'s exploits as a bounty hunter and along the way they encounter Rose Anderson, a dashing Robin Hood-esque thief with more to her than meets the eye, and come in to conflict with the Reestablishment Universal Committee (R.U.C.), a government agency that manages day-to-day activities in the city and whose leader has some sinister plans for the world.If this premise sounds interesting, then that\'s because it is. Unfortunately, the plot is greatly hindered by an extremely slow-paced beginning, with the series spending way too long stuck in an episodic format, during which it introduces a whole bunch of various topics that in most cases have nothing to do with the story at best and don\'t go anywhere at worst. While there are a couple of episodes that expand on the characters\' backstories and provide some decent world-building, these are ultimately irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and are conveniently forgotten about once resolved. Even when the first big twist comes mid-season, it takes a few more episodes for the plot to really get going, and while things do improve dramatically afterwards, it further serves to highlight that the first half of the series was mostly just a waste of time.In spite of all that\'s been said, I found myself enjoying the story quite a bit, in no small part thanks to its theme of family. When we first meet Roy, he\'s a bitter, lonely man desperately searching for the daughter he lost as a result of the Blast Fall, the aforementioned disaster that ravaged the planet twelve years before the story began, even though he doesn\'t even know for sure she\'s still alive. Overtime, however, due to adopting and raising Solty among other things, he gradually learns to appreciate those he has in the present instead of chasing after the ghosts of his past. While this theme is mostly in the background in the beginning, it\'s brought to the forefront in the second half, to the point that it serves to contrast Roy and the main villain. This results in the later episodes not only being epic, but highly touching as well, all the way up to a great ending, though this just made me wish that the rest of the series was as good.Art & Animation (7.5/10):As one would probably expect from Gonzo, ""Solty Rei"" is not a particularly good-looking series. While the character designs are decent, the colours and textures are very dull and bland and there are plenty of rough edges to be found. Also like in a lot of Gonzo anime, there\'s a lot of very obvious 3-D effects, namely with the robots of the series, which look so out of place in comparison to everything else that even I had trouble tolerating them, since I\'m usually quite lenient when it comes to that kind of stuff.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The soundtrack is alright, but there aren\'t all that many memorable tracks. Of the ones I remember, there\'s the opening ""clover"", the two ending themes ""Float -Beyond the Sky"" and ""Return to Love"" and one track that plays during particularly somber moments, the latter of which is probably my favourite. Instead, the best part of this category, and indeed the best part of the whole series, is the voice acting. The dub features a number of great talents, including Christopher Sabat and Colleen Clinkenbeard as Roy and Rose, respectively. Carrie Savage also does just as good a job as Solty, capturing the character\'s kind, cheerful nature perfectly and just making me love her all the more. The dialogue can be somewhat corny here and there, but never to the point of making you want to facepalm.Characters (7/10):When we first meet Roy, he\'s best described as gruff, bitter and apathetic. While he\'s kind enough to allow a girl to stay the night in exchange for saving him, which is how he and Solty first met, he means just the night and expects her to fend for herself afterwards, even refusing to take her in after it\'s revealed that the alternative is her getting taken away to a secure facility, though he is convinced to do so in the end. His overall demeanour is very similar to that of Rick Deckard from ""Blade Runner"", which is ironic since he shares his first name with Deckard\'s arch-rival Roy Batty. Unfortunately, this works just as much against him as it does for him, especially since Deckard is known to not be the most likable of protagonists. Overall, he starts off pretty bad, then gets worse (though not without good reason) before finally getting a hell of a lot better, so overall he has a pretty decent character arc. That said, he definitely isn\'t the most complex of protagonists and as far as Christopher Sabat roles go, he isn\'t really anything I haven\'t seen before.Ultimately, the title of ""best character"" goes not to Roy, but Solty herself. When we first meet her, she has absolutely no idea who she is or where she came from, though we soon learn that she\'s a robot girl, or Genuine Resemble as she\'s called, with her true identity being gradually revealed over the course of the series. Despite her lack of memories, she\'s ultimately a very kind and cheerful girl who quickly grows fond of those who have become her new family- not just Roy, but the aforementioned Miranda and Kasha too, who spend just as much time looking after her as the former. She also has a very strong moral compass, as shown by her repeated refusal to get involved in Rose\'s criminal life among other things, and gets some really awesome moments to shine in the second half of the series, to the point that it could be argued that she\'s the real main character. However, much like Roy, she\'s not a particularly complex character, though she\'s definitely a lot more likable than Roy is.The last of the main trio is Rose Anderson, also known by her thief name, the ""Blue Comet"", who works with her brothers Larry and Andy as a thieving trio, stealing various valuables to give to people in the slums. While this gives them a definite Robin Hood vibe, the fact that they\'re thieves really isn\'t glossed over in the series, since it means her relationship with Roy, a cop in all but name, starts off highly antagonistic and Solty repeatedly refuses to get involved in her work despite her persistence. Eventually, though, she relents, with she and Solty developing a sweet sisterly relationship, and she warms up considerably to Roy as well. Unfortunately, in the second half of series, she\'s given a character arc that\'s pretty nebulously told, and not in a good way, though thankfully that gets resolved right before the climax. The supporting cast is decent, but unfortunately they aren\'t given an awful lot to do outside a few specific moments. And the less said about Ashley Lynx, the enigmatic CEO of the R.U.C., the better, as just about anything genuine about him is a major spoiler, though I can at least say that he proves to be a genuinely menacing and surprisingly sympathetic antagonist, as well as a great foil to Roy.Enjoyment (7/10):As a result of the very slow-paced beginning, ""Solty Rei"" is an anime that definitely requires a lot of patience to sit through, as while there are some good episodes in the first half, most of them are ultimately rather forgettable, so a lot of you may end up giving up on the series before things start to get interesting. In addition, while things do get a lot more exciting in the second half, it comes at the cost of the story veering into some very dark places, particularly in regards to the revelation of the world of the series as well as the true nature of the Blast Fall, though thankfully the series does manage to end on a happy note.Overall:It gives me absolutely zero pleasure to say that ""Solty Rei"" fails to leave any real lasting impression, thanks to the dated visuals, likable but fairly underdeveloped characters and a story that, while decent, takes far too long to really get going. The only thing it really has going for it is its theme of family, something it doesn\'t explore to its fullest until the last few episodes. It\'s not a terrible anime by any means, and I did enjoy watching it, but there\'s still no denying that it could have been so much more than it is.Score:7+7.5+8.5+7+7=37/50=7.4/10 the distant future, twelve years after the planet was ravaged by a mysterious disaster, ""Solty Rei"" follows Roy Revant, a gruff middle-aged bounty hunter with a troubled past who spends his days hunting down various dangerous cyborgs called Resembles. One day, while on what initially seems like any other job for him, he encounters a mysterious girl covered by nothing but a battered cloth. Soon after, he learns three things about her in quick succession- she has very unusual-looking ears, she has strength well beyond that of any human, cyborg or otherwise, and she has no idea who she is. After saving Roy\'s life twice (once indirectly and once directly), the girl becomes acquainted with Roy\'s associates, including his employer Miranda Maverick and her daughter Kasha, and ultimately gets taken in by Roy as his adopted daughter, with Roy giving her the name ""Solty"". The series then follows both Solty gradually adjusting to daily human life and Roy\'s exploits as a bounty hunter and along the way they encounter Rose Anderson, a dashing Robin Hood-esque thief with more to her than meets the eye, and come in to conflict with the Reestablishment Universal Committee (R.U.C.), a government agency that manages day-to-day activities in the city and whose leader has some sinister plans for the world.If this premise sounds interesting, then that\'s because it is. Unfortunately, the plot is greatly hindered by an extremely slow-paced beginning, with the series spending way too long stuck in an episodic format, during which it introduces a whole bunch of various topics that in most cases have nothing to do with the story at best and don\'t go anywhere at worst. While there are a couple of episodes that expand on the characters\' backstories and provide some decent world-building, these are ultimately irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and are conveniently forgotten about once resolved. Even when the first big twist comes mid-season, it takes a few more episodes for the plot to really get going, and while things do improve dramatically afterwards, it further serves to highlight that the first half of the series was mostly just a waste of time.In spite of all that\'s been said, I found myself enjoying the story quite a bit, in no small part thanks to its theme of family. When we first meet Roy, he\'s a bitter, lonely man desperately searching for the daughter he lost as a result of the Blast Fall, the aforementioned disaster that ravaged the planet twelve years before the story began, even though he doesn\'t even know for sure she\'s still alive. Overtime, however, due to adopting and raising Solty among other things, he gradually learns to appreciate those he has in the present instead of chasing after the ghosts of his past. While this theme is mostly in the background in the beginning, it\'s brought to the forefront in the second half, to the point that it serves to contrast Roy and the main villain. This results in the later episodes not only being epic, but highly touching as well, all the way up to a great ending, though this just made me wish that the rest of the series was as good.Art & Animation (7.5/10):As one would probably expect from Gonzo, ""Solty Rei"" is not a particularly good-looking series. While the character designs are decent, the colours and textures are very dull and bland and there are plenty of rough edges to be found. Also like in a lot of Gonzo anime, there\'s a lot of very obvious 3-D effects, namely with the robots of the series, which look so out of place in comparison to everything else that even I had trouble tolerating them, since I\'m usually quite lenient when it comes to that kind of stuff.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The soundtrack is alright, but there aren\'t all that many memorable tracks. Of the ones I remember, there\'s the opening ""clover"", the two ending themes ""Float -Beyond the Sky"" and ""Return to Love"" and one track that plays during particularly somber moments, the latter of which is probably my favourite. Instead, the best part of this category, and indeed the best part of the whole series, is the voice acting. The dub features a number of great talents, including Christopher Sabat and Colleen Clinkenbeard as Roy and Rose, respectively. Carrie Savage also does just as good a job as Solty, capturing the character\'s kind, cheerful nature perfectly and just making me love her all the more. The dialogue can be somewhat corny here and there, but never to the point of making you want to facepalm.Characters (7/10):When we first meet Roy, he\'s best described as gruff, bitter and apathetic. While he\'s kind enough to allow a girl to stay the night in exchange for saving him, which is how he and Solty first met, he means just the night and expects her to fend for herself afterwards, even refusing to take her in after it\'s revealed that the alternative is her getting taken away to a secure facility, though he is convinced to do so in the end. His overall demeanour is very similar to that of Rick Deckard from ""Blade Runner"", which is ironic since he shares his first name with Deckard\'s arch-rival Roy Batty. Unfortunately, this works just as much against him as it does for him, especially since Deckard is known to not be the most likable of protagonists. Overall, he starts off pretty bad, then gets worse (though not without good reason) before finally getting a hell of a lot better, so overall he has a pretty decent character arc. That said, he definitely isn\'t the most complex of protagonists and as far as Christopher Sabat roles go, he isn\'t really anything I haven\'t seen before.Ultimately, the title of ""best character"" goes not to Roy, but Solty herself. When we first meet her, she has absolutely no idea who she is or where she came from, though we soon learn that she\'s a robot girl, or Genuine Resemble as she\'s called, with her true identity being gradually revealed over the course of the series. Despite her lack of memories, she\'s ultimately a very kind and cheerful girl who quickly grows fond of those who have become her new family- not just Roy, but the aforementioned Miranda and Kasha too, who spend just as much time looking after her as the former. She also has a very strong moral compass, as shown by her repeated refusal to get involved in Rose\'s criminal life among other things, and gets some really awesome moments to shine in the second half of the series, to the point that it could be argued that she\'s the real main character. However, much like Roy, she\'s not a particularly complex character, though she\'s definitely a lot more likable than Roy is.The last of the main trio is Rose Anderson, also known by her thief name, the ""Blue Comet"", who works with her brothers Larry and Andy as a thieving trio, stealing various valuables to give to people in the slums. While this gives them a definite Robin Hood vibe, the fact that they\'re thieves really isn\'t glossed over in the series, since it means her relationship with Roy, a cop in all but name, starts off highly antagonistic and Solty repeatedly refuses to get involved in her work despite her persistence. Eventually, though, she relents, with she and Solty developing a sweet sisterly relationship, and she warms up considerably to Roy as well. Unfortunately, in the second half of series, she\'s given a character arc that\'s pretty nebulously told, and not in a good way, though thankfully that gets resolved right before the climax. The supporting cast is decent, but unfortunately they aren\'t given an awful lot to do outside a few specific moments. And the less said about Ashley Lynx, the enigmatic CEO of the R.U.C., the better, as just about anything genuine about him is a major spoiler, though I can at least say that he proves to be a genuinely menacing and surprisingly sympathetic antagonist, as well as a great foil to Roy.Enjoyment (7/10):As a result of the very slow-paced beginning, ""Solty Rei"" is an anime that definitely requires a lot of patience to sit through, as while there are some good episodes in the first half, most of them are ultimately rather forgettable, so a lot of you may end up giving up on the series before things start to get interesting.

After this, he could not find his daughter again and fell into direct despair, lost his old self, and became a bounty hunter who hunts criminals. But he didn\'t just do this for money, but also to let off steam. Since he was finished with...his life, there was not much left in him. But then he met the protagonist, ""Solty"" as she was called (probably one of the most annoying female characters in fiction).As far as you can see from the description, it doesn\'t sound too bad, in fact almost inviting. Also, based on the genre, you might think it\'s going to be a more serious and gritty plot.-If only that had really been the case. The story revolves around Roy in the foreground and all other characters get enough screen time depending on their priority. Roy simply cannot assert himself in this work. Everyone rides around on his head all the time, destroys his everyday life and he has no assertiveness. Then comedy often simply takes over, although the genre shouldn\'t be present here. Anyway, the work was also blessed with plenty of ""fan service"" and shower scenes that totally jump out of the overall picture.Until episode 14 the anime is total everyday life, practically absolutely nothing happens.

A carbon-copy moe SoL anime where the only difference is the character design and the activity they focus on.However, I was proven otherwise after the first few episodes. Slow Loop did not attempt to copy from moe anime but instead created its own identity.If I want to summarize the whole anime, I will say that it takes the good part of Laid-Back Camp (Yuru Camp) and Dairy of Our Days at the Breakwater (Houkago Teibou Nisshi) and combine it into this...masterpiece.======SPOILER AHEAD======The anime starts when Hiyori and Koharu become a step-sister after their parents re-married. The sister learned that they have a common hobby in fishing. After every episode, you can see the subtle character development of Hiyori and Koharu.Hiyori is an introvert, who hates social interaction. To the point where she intentionally makes her unsociable.  While Koharu is an extrovert who can make friends with ease. I was expecting a clash between personalities where Hiyori rejects Koharu or goes tsundere. However, instead of that, Hiyori embraces Koharu to the best of her ability.You can see the character development after a few episodes. Hiyori is more open to conversation and takes the role of a mentor for Koharu and Aiko. Meanwhile, Koharu becomes more reserved while slowly becoming better with fishing. Thru fishing, Hiyori and Koharu slowly become closer and closer to each other. To the point where they are inseparable and behave like sisters than strangers.Supporting characters like Koi and Aiko have some character development as well. Koi at the start hates fishing due to her dad's obsession with fishing, but progressively warms up to the idea of fishing. For Aiko, she was unsure about fishing because she felt it is a hobby for boys and girls should not participate in that. To now she openly embrace fishing and even introduced fishing to her friend. These character developments are slow, organic, and natural. Which makes Slow Loop stands out from other moe SoL.======SPOILER ENDS======Slow Loop has a relaxing and comfy atmosphere. Similar to what we experienced in Laid-Back Camp. There is some conflict and drama. However, those conflicts are minor and insignificant and they do not affect the atmosphere that the show wants to create.While you are relaxing, the anime slowly spoon-feeds you the fishing technics and tips. Sometimes, the show will switch to Koharu's Cooking Time where it teaches you how to process the fish and make them into a delicious meal.

Slow Loop managed to not only match my expectations but genuinely surpass them in terms of how well researched the series is and how effectively they covered the hobby. This review will provide a quick summary on why I enjoyed Slow Loop and what aspects were covered well.In terms of story, Slow Loop is fairly basic, similar to most CGDCT anime, 2 girls, had...single parents that got remarried together, which turned them into sisters. It turns out one of the girls enjoys fishing and the other girl gets into it through her. Functionally this is the story, there are some other aspects but most of it falls under characterization that is developed during fishing trips and general bonding through living together. As long as the characters mesh well, then the story is typically good enough for this type of series. Still since I do try to be objective in reviews, the most this story can get is a 6/10 since its very bare bones and even the execution feels rather basic and overly simplified half the time.In terms of art, the character designs really remind me of Is the Order a Rabbit? Everyone, including the adults, look a bit underdeveloped and flat, but this low detail art suits a SOL series fairly well. Overall, the girls do have a nice cutesy look, although the animation and background art leaves a lot to be desired. I do enjoy how the fish are handled and how preparing fish kept all the blood and made it the process look more realistic with the organs and such, definitely some plus points for accuracy.What really appeals about this anime is the accuracy in terms of fishing as a hobby, the show properly explains fly fishing including the various styles and techniques, this was all researched very well. The segments where Hiyori explains to Koharu how certain techniques are exercised are very good, the instruction quality is the same as you would receive in real life and the beginner mistakes are conveyed accurately. In addition, the cooking segments were nice as well, from preparing the fish after catching to properly cleaning them out and seasoning them, Slow Loop actually goes into detail on this topic beyond a superficial lens like many other hobbyist anime do.Overall, I would give Slow Loop a 7 out of 10, its story is a bit weak and art style a bit basic, frankly the audio isn’t even worth discussing, however the characters mesh well and the actual hobby they focus on is very well researched and explained in an interesting and effective manner. This anime is definitely one that is unlikely to be worth watching outside of the season it aired in, unless you really like fishing, but it’s not bad to watch on a weekly basis. single parents that got remarried together, which turned them into sisters. It turns out one of the girls enjoys fishing and the other girl gets into it through her. Functionally this is the story, there are some other aspects but most of it falls under characterization that is developed during fishing trips and general bonding through living together. As long as the characters mesh well, then the story is typically good enough for this type of series. Still since I do try to be objective in reviews, the most this story can get is a 6/10 since its very bare bones and even the execution feels rather basic and overly simplified half the time.In terms of art, the character designs really remind me of Is the Order a Rabbit? Everyone, including the adults, look a bit underdeveloped and flat, but this low detail art suits a SOL series fairly well. Overall, the girls do have a nice cutesy look, although the animation and background art leaves a lot to be desired.

For me it wasn\'t, with 2 of the 3 seasonal animes I watched getting dropped. However, the last seasonal would prove to be a masterpiece in my opinion. That anime is Slow Loop, and in my opinion, is very underrated (even being overshadowed by Winter 2022\'s other CGDCT, Akebi).Story - 10/10Slow Loop\'s summary gives you the idea that it\'s a fishing anime, and that is true to an extent. However, family plays a key role in the story itself. Throughout the anime, we...see the characters dealing issues regarding their family, be it Hiyori and Koharu, Koi and her parents, or Ichika and Futaba. The drama moments, blended in with the comedic moments found in a lot of CGDCT, makes for an anime that can make you laugh, and make you cry. Slow Loop also looks into the backstories of each characters, and how it shaped who they are. The anime\'s tagline: ""connected by fishing line, the loop of family"" really makes sense here.Art - 7/10With slice of life in general, art isn\'t something that is a high priority. Connect\'s animation doesn\'t match the heights that Silver Link hit with Non Non Biyori or say Doga Kobo hit with Koisuru Asteroid. However, to heavily focus on the art would be missing the point of the anime.Characters - 9/10Slow Loop shines strongly in this aspect, with Hiyori\'s and Koharu\'s dynamic being strongly reminiscent of character dynamics like Rin/Nadeshiko (Yuru Camp) or Ao/Mira (Koisuru Asteroid). Koi\'s character is quite unique, and really adds some uniqueness to this anime (a character who has a dislike towards to the main interest of the show for good reasons is quite rare). Slow Loop also does avoid a pitfall of CGDCTs by adding a decent number of recurring male characters. Hiyori\'s character development was good, as she looks to deal with the grief of losing her father. Koi has multiple sides shown to her, improving on her already well-written character. Koharu delivers many of the show\'s good gags, through their faces and jokes, making Slow Loop extremely enjoyable.Sound - 9/10Slow Loop\'s OP (Yajirushi) and ED (Shuwa Shuwa) are both quite enjoyable to listen to. Along with that, it has great background music, being composed by Takurō Iga, who also worked on Koisuru Asteroid\'s OST.(Note that for Yaijurshi, both Kiyono Yasuno and Nao Touyama sang it)Enjoyment - 10/10Slow Loop in my opinion is very enjoyable. The educational bits are pretty nice, and don\'t feel like boring monologues (and is a nice addition to the series itself). The show\'s dramatic bits are nice, and really show the theme of family.  These 2 elements combined really reminds me of 2 of my favourite anime: Hanayamata and Koisuru Asteroid, along with the show already giving off strong Yuru Camp vibes.Overall - 10/10If you are fan of Koisuru Asteroid, this show is definitely for you, as they are very similar in my opinion. In general, I would say this show is definitely worth a watch for CGDCT fans, as it also has strong Yuru Camp vibes. Slow Loop in my opinion is the sleeper hit of winter 2022, avoiding a lot of the tropes of CGDCT,  and exploring the topics of family in a way that\'s not commonly seen in slice of life. see the characters dealing issues regarding their family, be it Hiyori and Koharu, Koi and her parents, or Ichika and Futaba.

Slow Loop is no different. It’s always nice to have one or two more relaxed anime. It’s akin to a detox, something that is very much needed at times.In a weird way, Slow Loop reminds me a bit of Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?, however, the best comparison would be Tamayura because in both instances we have a main character who purses the passions of their deceased fathers. Fuu takes up her father’s passion for photography, while Hiyori takes up her father’s passion for fishing. But anyway going back to what I thought about the first...episode of Slow Loop. I don’t mind the grounds on which our characters meet, it’s simple and straightforward.When you have one introverted character in Hiyori paired with an extroverted step-sister in Koharu. You already know that nothing is going to go smoothly and that has already proven to be the case. That being said, I’m looking forward to this anime because it feels like it’s going to be one of the more relaxing and lighthearted anime to air this season. I can already tell that Koharu is going to be working a treat on this anime. Her happy-go-lucky attitude is something I really like, I also love how she’s unfiltered in her thought and approach. She’s like a character who always seems to be on cloud nine.so if you are looking for something relaxing to watch with Kawai girls then this is for u episode of Slow Loop. I don’t mind the grounds on which our characters meet, it’s simple and straightforward.When you have one introverted character in Hiyori paired with an extroverted step-sister in Koharu.

Whether it was the relaxation nature of Yuru Camp as it helped me through a very difficult period in my life, or the way Non Non Biyori taught me that life goes on and we have to try and enjoy every moment of it. Those 2 set the standard of how to make a Slice of Life anime, how to create good characters and how to build an expanding beautiful world though simple story...telling. So with one ending and another one seemingly getting there, I needed to find something to fill the void. And MAN DID I FIND A PERFECT ONE. IT HAS EVERYTHING!To give you a general idea of what to expect of it, Slow Loop is a story involving some very wholesome yet heavy ideas. The show is about 2 step-sisters, who just met each other following their parent’s marriage after the death of their previous spouse.  The main theme of the anime is one that I love dearly and its building relationships with oneanother. Friendship, family-bonds or even building a healthy habit for yourself and overcoming difficult parts in your life. The anime starts by providing a very simple idea which is fishing. We see how our 2 main characters met and how the anime used fishing as its way to drive the narrative of the story. What is good here is that the anime uses that simple idea to help you understand the inner nature and mind of each of them. Hiyori for example goes fishing alone because she lost her father who she always went fishing with. Koharu loves acting as the older sibling which could easily be traced to her losing her younger brother. The anime uses general ideas like that to not only provide a backstory for each character, but also to show that they have emotions. They have values and they try to cope with the feeling of losing something dear to you and trying to overcome and accept that idea.One of the best parts about the anime is the comedy. The anime doesn’t try to make you laugh every second, but somehow, it always adds very subtly jokes that legit made me laugh out loud. I’m always surprised at how the anime adds that little bit of dialog with a very well-fitting facial expression, which just gets that laugh out of me.Slow Loop excels at presenting drama, character development and actually dealing with issues. To discuss this part in detail, lets look at an example. There is a cute little girl called Futaba who is afraid that people might dislike her because she doesn’t have the same hobbies as the girls in her class. Instead of the anime relying on the general idea of “as long as you are having fun” and stuff like that, it showed our characters actually accepting that idea. It wasn’t thrown under the bus for a child just thinking too much, instead it not only allowed the other characters to understand her and her struggles more, it helped add some character depth to Futaba’s sister and break the idea of stereotypes that many anime fall into. Acknowledging and dealing with the person at hand not just solving the issue which turned out to be a much more realistic approach.And just to emphasize, I need to talk about how brilliant the cast is. Despite having a relatively small number of characters, the best thing about the anime is that there are no stereotypes. No overly shy characters or tsunderes for example. Even when the anime introduced a tomboy, it enhanced her character to the point that you feel her being more realistic that way.  The wonderful cast and the development they get left me in a satisfied state and it didn’t feel like a wasted opportunity.There are two things I must mention as well.First one is that the anime is super informative when it comes to fishing. You get to learn about fishing techniques, types of baits, when to go fishing, how to throw your fishing rod and even the different creatures and fish living in the ocean. It also goes on about how to cook these fish and the different way to enjoy them. That was super informative and actually helped me talk with one of my friends who absolutely loves fishing.The 2nd thing I want to talk about or I guess just mention, is that the anime is super wholesome and cute with almost no dirty moments. Aside from around 5 seconds in the first episode when Koharu is first introduced so please just skip over them.Slow Loop has been a very fantastic anime, it has been a while since a new anime has left me waiting for the next episode and somehow always manages to deliver. It’s a wonderful story about our characters, that help each other grow, have fun and cope with their loss and any issues they have in their life.I would give it a 9/10 and I really hope for a 2nd season.Would recommend it to anyone wanting to relax and have a laugh. telling.

The show repeats the same formula for every episode. They go fishing, there's some tidbits about fishing technique and equipment. I have no problems with that. Problem is that the characters seem to not vary their reactions much than just be the token bubbly/reserved/sarcastic characters that I've seen quite often. And everyone else outside of Koharu, Hiyori, and Koi are just one-dimensional. I was hoping the show would add something more on top of Hiyori's loss to add more depth...But...it doesn't.It had some good touching moments here and there.But not enough to break the monotony that made the show drag on and made me wish it would be over already... it doesn't.It had some good touching moments here and there.But not enough to break the monotony that made the show drag on and made me wish it would be over already..."", ""Slow Loop on the surface looks like a pretty simple cute girls do fishing anime, and while it does that, it also covers a topic near and dear to my heart and that is the loss of family member and finding happiness in the activates you spent together.Spoilers aheadStory:I felt the story did a great job and bringing in the emotional moments of losing a family member and mixing the fun of fishing/camping/cooking. I know a lot of people turn to SoL for good vibes aspect of this genre, the mix of the serious and fun felt right to me. The cooking aspects of the...show were a lot of fun as well.

It just feels so realistic and there's this feeling of growth from the characters that we see from the perspective of the parents (like how they see their children going to their own adventure, that kind of feeling).The story is as expected from a CGDCT anime. Average. The only plot thread that was fairly important is the MC's father. Other than that, there's no stand out in the plot.The...characters are all good. They don't excel in any areas nor lacked anything. I quite like how each characters grow in each scenes, which shows progression to the series and development for them. They aren't particularly memorable, but the time I have watching them is something that I won't forget... probably lolThe animation is pretty standard. It's better than most anime out right now, but comparing it to some of the CGDCT animes in the past... well, it's not really excellent if you think about it. One thing I like though is how consistent the art is. It's great stuff.The music is nothing out of ordinary. I like the OP and ED, as well as the ost. But there aren't any time where the ost blows me away.

You may not know a single thing about fly fishing going in (I sure did not), but we can all understand the desire to partake in a fun hobby and seek the company of others who are mutually passionate. There are approximately five million SOL anime that execute this very same concept, but this one is at least slightly better than average in that it is legitimately educational about its subject matter and creates likable characters with relatable conflicts. It also fails in some key ways that keep it...from being a “great” SOL, primarily the uninspiring artwork in a setting that is more often than not outdoors, but you kind of have to take what you can get in the most regurgitated genre in the medium.First, lets elaborate more on the positive - Slow Loop does a fine job of making the audience understand the nuances and joys of fishing. You go out on a boat or sit by a shore surrounded by nothing but the natural world, free from all technological obsessions and urban concerns. Just man, a rod, and aquatic wildlife. The lead characters Hiyori and Koharu have dealt with immense hardship in their young lives related to the tragic passing of loved ones, but those concerns are eased gradually as they’re connected with nature and grow closer to the friends that surround them. This presents a wholesome message about how no matter the tragedy, you can seek happiness and heal your sorrow with the company of companions over time. There’s also a lot of effort to detail the theory of fishing in terms of effective techniques, equipment and routines. So much so that if a viewer decided to take up fishing, they would be able to do so using the knowledge gained from the episodes.On the other hand, the production values are bad all around. Not just in terms of animation - there is a profuse use of panning shots during fishing expeditions, but the background art is very bland. There are many instances where the detailed character models appear jarringly out of place compared to the ironically static nature that surround them. As a result Slow Loop fails to make one feel immersed into the outdoors as I'm sure its intention was to do. This extends to the texture of the dishes as well - there are few times in this show that something was prepared that made me salivate at the idea of eating it.Perhaps its a bit unfair to harp too much on this point though - this was not some highly anticipated, heavily advertised show. Those who chose to watch Slow Loop likely will have their expectations exceeded. There was just potential here to be something great if the artwork were better. My score of a six may seem to imply this show is bad, but I mean it to describe a show that has enough positives to at least be worth watching and perhaps enjoyed by niche communities. This may perhaps be you if you fancy the premise of cute girls fishing and bonding over time. from being a “great” SOL, primarily the uninspiring artwork in a setting that is more often than not outdoors, but you kind of have to take what you can get in the most regurgitated genre in the medium.First, lets elaborate more on the positive - Slow Loop does a fine job of making the audience understand the nuances and joys of fishing. You go out on a boat or sit by a shore surrounded by nothing but the natural world, free from all technological obsessions and urban concerns. Just man, a rod, and aquatic wildlife. The lead characters Hiyori and Koharu have dealt with immense hardship in their young lives related to the tragic passing of loved ones, but those concerns are eased gradually as they’re connected with nature and grow closer to the friends that surround them. This presents a wholesome message about how no matter the tragedy, you can seek happiness and heal your sorrow with the company of companions over time. There’s also a lot of effort to detail the theory of fishing in terms of effective techniques, equipment and routines. So much so that if a viewer decided to take up fishing, they would be able to do so using the knowledge gained from the episodes.On the other hand, the production values are bad all around. Not just in terms of animation - there is a profuse use of panning shots during fishing expeditions, but the background art is very bland. There are many instances where the detailed character models appear jarringly out of place compared to the ironically static nature that surround them. As a result Slow Loop fails to make one feel immersed into the outdoors as I'm sure its intention was to do.

There is a red-headed, beer drinking, sexy tomboy with a tan who seems to move from anime to anime. And I'm sure there are those who are shipping her with her best buddy the short-haired blond who hunts and fishes. But really, the show is as wholesome as Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.The only flaw I can catch is that the ending was a little rushed, but that is typical of anime studios trying to cram in one last Iyashikei moment while the end credits are rolling.

The original material is beyond the scope of this review and is not a factor for consideration.Story: The overarching story of Hiyori and Koharu overcoming the awkwardness of their new family dynamics is executed fairly well. The episodic nature of the show naturally meant that certain episodes stand out more than others, depending on one\'s tastes, but objectively speaking every story arc was written and executed very well. The final episode felt a little bit lacking: the writer(s) clearly wanted to make the climax of the final arc a character scene between the two main characters...but it lacked the ""oomph"" needed to make the final payoff feel complete. As it stands, the end of the final episode feels more like the end of a regular episode than the end of the show.Character: The characters were the absolute heart and soul of the show and it was great to see all of them get at least a little bit of development. The focus on family and the fact that even the parents got some screen time and character development is a rarity in the medium and an absolute delight to see. Character interactions are well-executed and charming to watch. Dialogue is fluid and well-written.Visual: The animation was perfectly serviceable and never dipped below an acceptable bar of quality. The small number of high-quality still frames scattered throughout each episode really help to bring out the show\'s motif of photographs and the memories they contain. The character designs are good but, unfortunately, they suffer from \'same face syndrome\' in that all the facial features of the main girls are virtually identical.Audio: The music, voice acting (Japanese), and sound design were all splendid. All of the soundtracks were generally above average, though there were no standout tracks. Both the opening and ending songs are enjoyable, but neither is objectively exceptional in their own right. The sound effects were solid and did their jobs well. The (Japanese) voice acting was also well done, with a commendable first-time main role performance by Kusumi Rin as Minagi/Yamakawa Hiyori.Enjoyment: Slow Loop is among my favourite shows of the year and one of my favourite slice-of-life shows ever. Almost every episode managed to click with me and I loved all of the characters, main and support. The character designs are very cute and the visuals and sound design create a perfectly relaxing atmosphere. Both the opening theme and the ending theme are among my favourite anime soundtracks of all time. I especially love the ending theme - hearing the three main voice actresses singing the ending theme for the show is an absolute treat.Objective Score Breakdown:[2/3] Story[3/3] Character[1/2] Visual[2/2] AudioFinal score of 8 out of 10.Subjective Score Breakdown:[3/4] Story[4/4] Character[4/4] Visual[4/4] Audio[4/4] EnjoymentFinal score of 19 out of 20. but it lacked the ""oomph"" needed to make the final payoff feel complete.

You will experience how it feel to be a hardcore fishing fan. You will also know one or two info about fishing technique, fishing gear, and fishing place. They also explain what kind of fish they catch and how to cook it. However i do not reccomend following their recipe on how to cook this, because they are not very detail about it.Story 10/10Simple, but not so simple. At first we just have these girl talk about fishing. As the story progress, we know what kind of problem they have. But they didn't make the problem...a main spotlight, they didn't make it a big drama. Instead, they make it like a side story. It still runs in background while the main theme about this anime is being performed in front stage. I like this because my main reason watching this anime is for the relaxing feeling you get when watching Slice of Life. And the comedy part, you will laugh everytime you watch an episode of this anime.Art 10/10Art is really really great. Every characters here is so cute, especially their facial expression. They changed art style when there is something to explain, and the characters looks more cuter in this art style. Not only the characters, the background is also beautiful. They are fishing so they usually set place around sea or river, the water look so real. The sea is blue and have a wave detail, the river have a clean water and we can see some rocks or fishes inside. You can also feel the atmosphere, its hard to explain but you just feel like you are there in the area feeling sea breezes.Sound 10/10The characters voice sound so cute. Although sometimes they just sound like a little child with that high pitch voice, considering they are in high school. For me its not a problem, because some anime girls did speak like that. OP song is catchy and the ED is relaxing, of course it would be great because the 3 main characters VA sing both of it. Beside from the VA work, they also nail the SFX part. You can hear the nature noise, like sea waves or leaves getting blown by wind.Characters 10/10They didn't just throw a character in and make them comfortable with each other. I'm usually see this kind of action in other anime with the same genre. Instead, you'll see how every MC overcomes their arkwardness of meeting a new people. While its not that obvious, this little thing is what makes the characters feel more realistic. The supporting cast also get treated the same, they're there for a reason. So in the end we get this well-rounded characters with the support of side characters. Its all coming together and make a perfect match.Enjoyment 10/10We have a lot of big titles coming out this season, like AoT and KnY. But why am I choose to watch this anime? I only watch 2 anime at the same time, 1 airing and 1 finished. I choose Slow Loop for airing anime because I really like this genre. Cute Girls Doing Cute Thing and nothing else, this kind of genre will make you relax and dive into their world. Not worrying about characters death, not worrying about who to fight next, just following this girls go fishing and not worried about anything is what i love. Actually i already want a season 2 from this anime, but unfortunately that won't happen any sooner because the manga is still very short. Speaking of the manga, I will definitely read it sometimes in near future.With all that being said, should you watch this anime? Well if you have spare time, why not. When you got bored, just watch this not-so-heavy anime. Just sit and enjoy their wholesome or clumsy moment to fresh your mind from the real world.

The ""side story\'s"" about Hiyori\'s past were quite interesting and cute. I do feel sorry for Hiyori, which lost her father in a young age. I think tho, it would\'ve been better knowing more about Koharu\'s past, which actually never got shown.Rather than in other anime, they made the fishing, i think, very realistic and showed a lot of struggles, when doing it the first time. I actually learned very much about it when i watched it, and would like to try fishing too. ', 'I have been fly fishing nearly all my life. The author clearly knows a great deal about the topic and gets all of the small details correct. There are many things that are obviously planted in the show which are specifically for the fly fishing enthusiast. Each episode so far has had a moment that has left me amazed that a fellow cute anime girl enjoyer also knows as much about fly fishing as I do. A similar anime I liked was Houkago Teibo Nisshi, however, Slow Loop is more detailed than that was and gives fan service to the avid fisherman more (in lots...of subtle ways).This is truly ""literally me"" the anime.I highly recommend picking this up if you enjoy fishing. of subtle ways).This is truly ""literally me"" the anime.I highly recommend picking this up if you enjoy fishing.', 'Slow Loop was exactly everything I expected it to be and a bit more, a moe SOL anime about some girls going fishing. I didn\'t exactly have high expectations for this anime, but it certainly surpassed them and earned its place in my eyes as a ""solid"" show. In many ways its very similar to Yuru Camp, as it follows a very similar formula except with fishing instead of camping. Mixed in between the girls doing cute, moe-anime things are neat fishing facts and delectable looking fish dishes. I think I personally enjoyed it more than Yuru Camp because while I am already decently familiar...with the subject of Yuru Camp, camping, I know complete jack about fishing, so it had a bit of added novelty that kept me a bit more engaged than Yuru Camp did.The characters of Slow Loop were pretty much exactly what you\'d expect, without anything that special. A more introverted girl, a headstrong girl, and a stoic or grumpy girl serve as our main trio and are accompanied by a cast of side characters. Oh and obviously they all fulfill the moe quota of cute expressions and silly jokes. It was pretty basic as far as casts go, but honestly what more are you asking of moe? If it succeeds at being cute then it\'s done what it set out to do.The art style was pretty damn good, the colors popped and really brought the nature in the show to life. Everything was just nice and comforting to look at, which helped give the show a nice homey feel.Overall I was pretty satisfied with my experience and would give it a moe out of 10. with the subject of Yuru Camp, camping, I know complete jack about fishing, so it had a bit of added novelty that kept me a bit more engaged than Yuru Camp did.The characters of Slow Loop were pretty much exactly what you\'d expect, without anything that special.

If that sounds off-putting, it shouldn't. The series is not really heavy handed but touches on these themes and its characters' struggles around them realistically, though I won't go into detail.Like any good SoL series, its main premise is a framework on which it hangs its characters. Each is distinctive, with a personality, competency, and weakness that is well realized. Our main protagonists are newly step-sisters  Hiyori and  Koharu,...who couldn't be much more different in terms of personality but bond over Hiyori's fishing hobby. They struggle with their new family dynamic while growing closer through their shared experiences.It would be excessive to write much more about the show. We have two compelling leads, a lively cast of supporting characters who are all distinctive, and a central theme of fishing. Of course, such series tend to rely on tropes, but here we have them presented in a way that, if not always completely believable, is still charming or at least affecting enough to be forgiven. I'm happy to have this series in an otherwise bleak cour of sequels I don't care about or pandering, otaku-bait shows. who couldn't be much more different in terms of personality but bond over Hiyori's fishing hobby.

Also, as I watch through the anime not once did Hiyori and Koharu call someone...something (I make it vague for spoiler purposes, since its a relaxing and chilling anime by no means is there stress or frustration as you watch it so really do recommend you enjoy it to the end), I was really hoping them to actually call or say it, but well they didn't, kind of depicting that they have not really move on yet with their past even the mom. I hope that if there would be S2, I hope to see them become a real family not only from the outside but fully moving on and becoming one as well from the inside. something (I make it vague for spoiler purposes, since its a relaxing and chilling anime by no means is there stress or frustration as you watch it so really do recommend you enjoy it to the end), I was really hoping them to actually call or say it, but well they didn't, kind of depicting that they have not really move on yet with their past even the mom.

Unfortunately, despite the potential for this being both a chance to share what some love about fishing while at the same time dealing realistically with some of life’s deeper tragedies, this series opts for superficial sweetness that had me dropping it after episode 9.Both main characters have lost a parent at a young age, but the pain of that loss is treated like a trope to make the plot work. Instead, everything works out well – the two girls are now sisters and get along great – and their...adventures all have happy endings. That makes it a nice anime for girls who want to enjoy nice anime, but do they really care about fishing? The anime itself makes it clear that girls fishing is a strange thing to do.Perhaps as a manga this works better. Perhaps as a 10-year-old girl it works better.

After a drought of CGDCT shows for the past two seasons or so, it's so good to see something this soothing make a comeback, with more to come next season.Slow Loop isn't anything special, its comedy is fine and its relaxation value is also just fine. Its focus on fly fishing makes it stand out a bit, but the occasional swerve into family drama with issues like familial deaths and all do take away some of the focus from it. To its credit it does go...quite a bit into fishing as a hobby, though not as much as Houkago Teibou Nisshi did some two years ago.I've said it before and I'll say it again, a SoL show lives and dies on its characters. For Slow Loop, it's Koharu who made the show for me. Her childish and bubbly disposition is incredibly charming and it's a treat whenever she's onscreen. Hioka Natsumi does a fantastic job at bringing her alive and her voice perfectly captures the genkiness and cuteness of her. It also helps that Koharu is the only character to receive any resemblance of an arc, with her journey from a beginner to a more seasoned angler. As for the rest of the main cast, Hiyori is kind of boring with her being the silent, shy type, and Koi is fun and provides a nice foil to the two sisters.Slow Loop may just be yet another Kirara show in a sea of very similar shows, but it's still an enjoyable time nonetheless.7/10 quite a bit into fishing as a hobby, though not as much as Houkago Teibou Nisshi did some two years ago.I've said it before and I'll say it again, a SoL show lives and dies on its characters.

In fact I find it one of the most boring things in the world, up there with golf. But I am FULLY invested in this anime. In a very similar vein to Yuru Camp, this is a chill, wholesome anime about two step-sister's fishing together. It's an anime you can show your parents with no worries.Story & Characters: By far the show’s best aspects. You have the more experienced, reserved girl (Hiyori) who inadvertently encounters the energetic novice (Koharu) who eventually becomes enamored with fishing and decides to take up the sport herself (again very similar to Yuru Camp)....And as the story progresses you meet other characters who share their interests (Koi, Futaba, Ichika). As someone who has never fished in their life, I can't speak about all the different fishing terms they throw around but it seems like they do a good job representing the sport and all its subtleties.One of my favorite things about the show is the family dynamic of the characters is particularly endearing. Hiyori was introduced to fishing by her late father, and clearly uses the activity as a way to stay connected to him. And now through fishing she meets her new step-sister. They both bond and heal through this shared activity/Art & Sound: The art and animation are eh. You don't really need high-quality animation when you're just watching two girls stand at a body of water. And that's fine, albeit kinda lazy. You almost never see any actual fishing. The shots change from the girls struggling with their poles to the fish suddenly out of the water. But then shows like this thrive more on characters than the visuals. So of course the visuals aren't anything write home about. The character designs aren't busy, the environments that fill the background are sufficiently detailed, and for a show that features so much water, it all looks good. The food doesn’t quite have that instant “why does anime food look so good” quality to it that other shows like Yuru Camp or the all powerful Food Wars have.I really like the OST. It perfectly suits the relaxed nature of the show. The sound design is solid. For a show that features so much water, everything sounds very realistic almost as if they just went out to the beach and recorded the sounds of waves crashing (maybe they did).Overall: I plan to pick up the manga once the anime concludes so I can keep enjoying this chill fishing series. It's not perfect, few shows are. It’s the kind of show to turn on when it’s cold out and you want to warm up from the inside out. Sit back, relax with a mug of something warm and enjoy. And as the story progresses you meet other characters who share their interests (Koi, Futaba, Ichika).

Hiyori was introduced to fishing by her late father, and clearly uses the activity as a way to stay connected to him. And now through fishing she meets her new step-sister. They both bond and heal through this shared activity/Art & Sound: The art and animation are eh. You don't really need high-quality animation when you're just watching two girls stand at a body of water. And that's fine, albeit kinda lazy. You almost never see any actual fishing. The shots change from the girls struggling with their poles to the fish suddenly out of the water. But then shows like this thrive more on characters than the visuals. So of course the visuals aren't anything write home about. The character designs aren't busy, the environments that fill the background are sufficiently detailed, and for a show that features so much water, it all looks good. The food doesn’t quite have that instant “why does anime food look so good” quality to it that other shows like Yuru Camp or the all powerful Food Wars have.I really like the OST. It perfectly suits the relaxed nature of the show. The sound design is solid. For a show that features so much water, everything sounds very realistic almost as if they just went out to the beach and recorded the sounds of waves crashing (maybe they did).Overall: I plan to pick up the manga once the anime concludes so I can keep enjoying this chill fishing series. It's not perfect, few shows are. It’s the kind of show to turn on when it’s cold out and you want to warm up from the inside out. Sit back, relax with a mug of something warm and enjoy."", ""First of all, when I read the description before it aired, it sounded really interesting about how two girls with opposite personalities become step sisters. But then everything just kinda when south in my opinion. I have seen one other fishing anime which is Dairy of Our Days at Breakwater. The differences that i can site are the characters in DODB have more depth and the there's a story that you can follow. In Slow Loop its basically cute little girls super interested in fly fishing and thats it. Every single episode the plot is recycled: New stuff->testing it out->cute moments->cooking the catch->the end. It...came to a point that i just let the episode play and wouldnt even bother to look at the screen. Its just that bad. came to a point that i just let the episode play and wouldnt even bother to look at the screen.

To LOVE-Ru OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5667/To_LOVE-Ru_OVA,"['To Love-Ru OVAs are just a whole lot better than the TV-series. At least from an ecchi enthusiast\'s point of view. Why so? I\'m here to tell you.First of all, there are many good insider jokes, since it is supposed, that you already know the characters and the main plot lines. Such humor wasn\'t quite yet awailable until the very latest of the TV episodes, as the characters were still pretty much unknown to the audience. So, even when the plot still contains random outcomes (always leading to ecchi scenes, though) for various random reasons, the scenario gained many new and fun details.Secondly, the characters...themselves have improven, gaining new experience. Rito grows temporary breasts and sees the world through the eyes of a dog, his younger sister gets a new face when she reveales the first signs of puberty (although she already acts more mature than the rest), Lala\'s cute, caring side is shown more closely through her change of personality and her sister twins were a great addition to the Devilukian saga. So now, after their debute, I can\'t wait for the next season season to come. And it is coming - Motto To Love-Ru!The third point is, there is no needless censure, at least in the version I saw. The TV-series contained a great deal of ""fog"" and other unfitting things, like sunshine, used for that. This no kid\'s show anyway, whether it\'s censured or not, I\'m pretty sure you agree to my point of view (only if you\'re not a kid yourself ;) ). And there were no more ugly aliens, which spoiled my fun before, only the cute ones were there, like Justin and Lala\'s dad (he\'s an awesome character, third place on my list after Lala and Yami, which is REALLY high ranked). These are the reasons why my enjoyment rose significantly.So, if you\'ve watched the first season of To Love-Ru, but haven\'t seen the OVAs yet, watch them at once! You will not be disappointed.""Magical Kyouko-kun! Solves any problem by burning it..."" themselves have improven, gaining new experience.

I thought they picked pretty good chapters to animate. Ones that fans would appreciate watching. No episodes entirely of filler (For the most part) not based on the Manga like the actual series. Just going to give some quick (Except 3 and 6) thoughts on each episode.Episode 1: This is where Rito turns into a girl, chapter 100. A good place to start. I didn't have a problem with the episode, it was a pretty good adaptation of the chapters.Episode 2: Mikan feels a bit neglected because Rito spends a lot of time with Lala....I liked the way this episode was handled and thought it was a good pick. Just one of those awwwww kind of episodes. Well, if you ignore the ecchi that is.Episode 3: This was the downfall of this Ova. This is the Revenge of the Fallen, the Endless Eight. I mean, the filler from the last series was bad but not this bad. So everyone gets to go to Saki's beach house and Rito swaps places with Haruna's dog, Maron. Most of the episode is just ecchi stills. Does Rito change back? What's Maron been doing in Rito's body? Who is Eric Cartman's father? None of these questions are addressed. I know To-Love-Ru is part of the ecchi genre but this is just bad. This episode was a big waste of time and a terrible pick for part of what might be the last adaptation of To-Love-Ru. I should also point out that this was supposed to be the last Ova episode until 3 more were announced so originally this was the final episode. Yuck...Episode 4: Everyone gets stuck in an Rpg game. A great choice because I thought it was pretty well done and it's a memorable story from the Manga. For whatever reason, I had to laugh at Rito's first use of his watering can. This bit was nothing amazing humor-wise but it was just funny to me at the time. Good episode.Episode 5: It basically gives you an introduction of Lala's sisters. I didn't like it as much as 2 or 4 but I'm sure many fans wanted to see an episode based on Momo and Nana and they got it.Episode 6: Okay, if you read my review of the previous series, I said that instead of stretching out one story using filler to fill 20 minutes or just making original filler episodes not based on the Manga, the studio should've went with a Full Metal Panic Fumoffu approach where they do multiple stories/chapters in one episode since some of To-Love-Ru's stories are one chapter long. Here it is, we got 3 different chapters in one episode. None of it felt rushed to me and I thought this format definitely worked. Why didn't they do this for the last series? It certainly would've been much better because no one likes bad filler especially for a series of mostly filler anyway. I believe the studio had more than enough material at the time to not resort to original filler. One-chapter stories use this format and should a story need 20+ minutes, do that. Anyway, I'm going to say it's a good episode. I remember these chapters and they were well adapted.Art: They went for a lot more ecchi. They revealed a lot more which kind of reminds me of the Love Hina Again episodes and how different they were from the original series in terms of ecchi-ness. I honestly don't care for ecchi but because it's To-Love-Ru, it's got to be there. Beyond that I thought the episodes looked great compared to the last series. Sometimes it would look a bit... not good but I thought they went a level higher on the animation for some of these episodes.Sound: I liked the opening song, didn't care much for the ending. I believe the background tracks were the same for the last series but don't quote me on that. I didn't keep track of the background music for this series since I didn't like too many of the songs. No problem with the voice actors as usual. Thought they did a great job and I liked Momo and Nana's voices.Character: Just good enough. Episode 2 brought in a side of Mikan we didn't really see before. It wasn't out of nowhere and I can see why she would feel this way. Go character development. Last part of episode 6 was another one of those aww kind of moments brought on by Lala and it was really the only part of these 6 episodes that focused on her. If they needed a chapter that focused on Lala, this was a good one. Also Celine makes an appearance which was nice to see. Lala's sisters aren't my favorite characters but I certainly don't dislike them and understand why they do what they do so no complaints on their arrival. There weren't many changes to the other characters so I'll leave it at that.Enjoyment: One point higher than the first series sounds good. Other than 3, I liked the episodes well enough. When compared to the first series, this one was far better in quality. I really liked seeing episode 6 use multiple chapters and if there is a second actual season, I'd like to see more episodes like this and less bad filler. Can't use lack of material as an excuse this time.Overall: If this was generally speaking, 8 is very generous. This definitely does not rival some of the other series that I rated at 8. I gave it an 8 for what it is. To-Love-Ru is nothing amazing as it is a mostly ecchi Anime and that's not really my thing despite how many I've watched but if they focused on the character interactions more and the relationship-driven chapters I think it would work out as a decent ecchi-comedy barring the Manga ending. That was terrible but most could see it coming. Would I recommend this series? Just to people who go for the ecchi stuff. I wouldn't recommend this to people who like comedy as it isn't that funny. It's also not a general series I'd tell others to watch either sadly but I liked the Manga well enough. If there was an actual second season, I'd watch it.Thank you for reading my review.

Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped."", ""Before you click Unhelpful because of the low score read the review and judge based on helpfulness.  It's not Agree/Disagree it's Helpful/Unhelpful.To LOVE-Ru OVA:I watched this after the TV Series To LOVE-Ru.  The first thing I noticed was the increase in ecchi scenes.  If you enjoy ecchi, than you will be quite happy with this OVA. Also the source I watched included a lot less censorship which again should be a positive for anyone who loves ecchi.The characters are similar to the series and continue to be entertaining.  The characters in my opinion are one of the best features of the...show, I really enjoy their antics and the situations they end up in.The art and sound are on par with the TV series.  I didn't care as much for the Opening in the OVA but the Ending theme was great.  The voice actors were the same, and they fit the roles pretty well in my opinion.  Sound effects and the art style were fulfilling to the overall experience but didn't stand out as anything spectacular.But let me get to the reason why I scored the OVA so low.First off, all I know about the To LOVE-Ru universe is what I've seen in the series.  The OVA makes the assumption that individuals have read parts of the manga.  There are a couple additions and changes to characters that isn't explained.  I felt instead of making that assumption it would of been easy to explain changes using a very short 1 or 2 min comedic flashback to for the uninformed audience.The third episode is Awful.  I don't mind ecchi (otherwise I wouldn't be watching this) BUT about 12 minutes of the 3rd episode is a series of pictures in the style of a slideshow with music playing in the background. Something I could do in 5 minutes using any photo manager.  What's worse is they try to have a story they don't really do anything with it.  Considering there are only 6 episodes total, that's a big knock against the OVA.Finally: I scored the OVA so low because the 6th episode is wonderful.  Confused?  Let me explain.  The 6th episode is split into 3 mini stories.  Each story takes about 5 to 8 minutes and there was just the right mix of story, comedy, ecchi, and enjoyment.  It was great.  The problem is because the 6th episode was done so well, it shows how inferior the other 5 episodes are.  It shows the true potential of To LOVE-Ru.  I felt robbed of an enjoyable OVA and had to put up with 5 mediocre/crappy episodes and one outstanding episode.A score of 5 might be a little harsh but for how good the 6th episode is the 3rd episode cancels it out with how bad it is.  That leaves the 4 remaining mediocre episodes.  Hence the mediocre score.Conclusion:This OVA had a lot of potential and falls short.  But If you were a fan of the TV Series I would still recommend watching this show.  The characters continue to be amusing and if you are a fan of Ecchi, this OVA should be enjoyable for you.  But if you are expecting anything meaningful here, you should probably just pass this up and look for something different.*Edit 9/15/2011* just saw that in my Anime List I gave it a 6 not a 5.

If you liked the original you will surely like this. Although this is much more heavy on fanservice, if that is even possible. They have a whole episode devoted to still and pans of all the female characters in swimsuits, there is even a subplot of Rito becoming a dog, but it gets ignored in favor of more fanservice.

I found funny just simply because of the silly situations..Let me describe a couple of the episodes for you if youre wondering if its worth taking the time to watch...The first ep.. Is the gender-bender.. its sort of funny.. I think people who like to watch the gender bender scenarios would probably love this..The second ep is basically all about Mikan.. Which is a really good plot for a single OVA.. its basically about her growing up.....but realizing shes not grown.. This maybe the ONLY To Love Ru ep Ive ever seen that actually dealt with mildly emotional and structured plots lol...The third is the resort ep.. this one is purely for the fans of the girls.. There is absolutely no plot here.. no story.. nothing.. I would say its about 12 minutes of just gravure scenes .. of like an idol IV... is it worth watching? well YES! .. if you liked the girls of course..The fourth ep is the RPG episode.. and the introduction of Lala\'s twin sisters that she mentions in season 2 but you never see.. I found this episode hillarious.. I love it when anime incorperates RPG themes.. I laughed everytime they ""leveled"" up.. and the status screen would pop-up.. This one is probably the best to watch of the group also for a LITTLE bit of relationship development.. I think I should just say that.. because I really dont want to spoil it..The art was great.. the music was pretty good.. all in all.. it pretty much stuck to the randomness of the Seasons 1 and 2... but these are definately made with the fan in mind..

Though like the manga, The Riko saga is short and only one episode. Overall it is good, if you enjoyed the series and manga, you will definitely watch the OVA too ', 'they nailed it. this is what the anime should have been like, animating actual chapters from the manga, with filler only there to add to the story and bridge gaps that are made due to taking things WAY out of order, and it manages to do it all well.for the most part the characters are the exact same as they were in the manga, the parts form the manga they animated were more or less all one off chapters with no real development in them at all, so its perfect to pick up and watch.the only fault that i found in this was...episode 3, compared to the other 5 this one was realy lacking and felt like it had no conclusion, it was only a fan service episode. but even that didnt make me not want to watch the rest like the first season did after 3 episodes.i recommend this to everyone who loved to-love-ru, but was severely disappointed with the first anime. this is what we were hoping for. episode 3, compared to the other 5 this one was realy lacking and felt like it had no conclusion, it was only a fan service episode. but even that didnt make me not want to watch the rest like the first season did after 3 episodes.i recommend this to everyone who loved to-love-ru, but was severely disappointed with the first anime. this is what we were hoping for.', ""Be sure to watch this OVA so you can keep up with the story of To Love-Ru!Story: Not too much to say here, it's just six episodes - some of these episodes have no real plot to them.

So, it's pretty high on the scale of enjoyability.And so, next is Motto To Love-Ru!"", ""A bit of a Preamble:I think the first thing to mention here should be the unfortunate state of these episodes. As of writing this, there is no legitimate streaming service anywhere, Japan or otherwise, that has these 6 episodes; if you want to watch them, the only legal means of doing so is by purchasing the Japanese home video discs second hand. Of course, that's much more difficult/expensive outside of Japan, but is possible via Japanese proxy purchasing sites, just keep in mind there are no subs for them.This is obviously a bummer on its own, but making it worse is the fact that Motto...To Love-Ru, the actual sequel season to the first season, heavily involves characters that appeared in these episodes and frequently refers to events that occurred within them with no context for anyone who hasn't seen them.With that out of the way; my opinions.If you're watching To Love-Ru, I'm going to assume you're watching it for the fanservice, or at least initially came to it for that. If you were looking for more, you're going to be extremely pleased. The fanservice has been cranked up to absurd levels and is damn near constant. Think of any risque situation that happened in the first season, and make it twice as lewd. Fully exposed butts and breasts are everywhere, characters are fully nude in every episode, and no character is safe from it. If that's your thing, this show is what you want.And it's enhanced thanks to the much better art and animation quality of these episodes. Everything overall looks much cleaner and more colorful, and this is most prevalent in the character design. All the characters have had their designs tweaked a bit, and look much better over the first season. They did give them a...cuter? I guess?...design, so it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I feel it suits the show much better. It's not on the same level as Motto in my opinion, but it's a definite improvement over the more dated look of the first season and still holds up well.Everything else about the show is pretty much what you would expect from OVA's of an ecchi series. Plot is non-existent outside of the basic setup of the events occurring in each episode. It's just there to facilitate the copious amount of fanservice you'll be getting. That said, unlike the first season which only loosely followed the manga, these episodes apparently do a better job of following chapters from the source, so there is that. However, at times this works to viewers who didn't read the manga's detriment as there are some references to the manga with no context for those unfamiliar, such as one of the new characters, Celine, who just sort of randomly appears with no back story or explanation at all. Due to the lighthearted nature of the show this doesn't really have that big of an impact, but it does lead to some confusion.I honestly was torn when it came to whether or not I recommend these OVA. The biggest factor against me recommending them is the sheer difficulty of just being able to watch them. Simply obtaining them requires a good bit of work that the average person outside of Japan likely wouldn't want to deal with, especially for a show that can't be understood unless you are fluent in Japanese. But at the end of the day, even if you can't understand what's being said, the lack of a serious plot and the fact that the show is hyper-focused on fanservice means you don't don't necessarily need to understand it to get what you're looking for out of it, and for how solid the fanservice is, I do think it's worth the trouble if you're a fan of the series. To Love-Ru, the actual sequel season to the first season, heavily involves characters that appeared in these episodes and frequently refers to events that occurred within them with no context for anyone who hasn't seen them.With that out of the way; my opinions.If you're watching To Love-Ru, I'm going to assume you're watching it for the fanservice, or at least initially came to it for that. If you were looking for more, you're going to be extremely pleased. The fanservice has been cranked up to absurd levels and is damn near constant. Think of any risque situation that happened in the first season, and make it twice as lewd. Fully exposed butts and breasts are everywhere, characters are fully nude in every episode, and no character is safe from it. If that's your thing, this show is what you want.And it's enhanced thanks to the much better art and animation quality of these episodes. Everything overall looks much cleaner and more colorful, and this is most prevalent in the character design. All the characters have had their designs tweaked a bit, and look much better over the first season. They did give them a...cuter? I guess?...design, so it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I feel it suits the show much better. It's not on the same level as Motto in my opinion, but it's a definite improvement over the more dated look of the first season and still holds up well.Everything else about the show is pretty much what you would expect from OVA's of an ecchi series. Plot is non-existent outside of the basic setup of the events occurring in each episode. It's just there to facilitate the copious amount of fanservice you'll be getting. That said, unlike the first season which only loosely followed the manga, these episodes apparently do a better job of following chapters from the source, so there is that. However, at times this works to viewers who didn't read the manga's detriment as there are some references to the manga with no context for those unfamiliar, such as one of the new characters, Celine, who just sort of randomly appears with no back story or explanation at all. Due to the lighthearted nature of the show this doesn't really have that big of an impact, but it does lead to some confusion.I honestly was torn when it came to whether or not I recommend these OVA. The biggest factor against me recommending them is the sheer difficulty of just being able to watch them. Simply obtaining them requires a good bit of work that the average person outside of Japan likely wouldn't want to deal with, especially for a show that can't be understood unless you are fluent in Japanese. But at the end of the day, even if you can't understand what's being said, the lack of a serious plot and the fact that the show is hyper-focused on fanservice means you don't don't necessarily need to understand it to get what you're looking for out of it, and for how solid the fanservice is, I do think it's worth the trouble if you're a fan of the series.""]"
Touhou Niji Sousaku Doujin Anime: Musou Kakyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9874/Touhou_Niji_Sousaku_Doujin_Anime__Musou_Kakyou,"[""Touhou: Musou Kakyou ( 東方二次創作同人アニメ:夢想夏郷) is an unofficial doujin anime created by MAIKAGE and directed by Tokine.In my personal opinion, I find this doujin absolutely stunning, what made me say this is MAIKAGE's ability to craft the fictional world of Gensokyo and present the characters in the world of Touhou in an accurate and amusing way. Every single character is instantly likable and charismatic in their own way, when this all blends together, it creates a truly amazing anime.Despite the fact that this is an unofficial doujin, it contains everything required for it to be aired on TV, it's even got an opening and closing!...For this OVA, MAIKAGE hired official Voice actors, some of them you may be familiar with. (such as Tanaka Rie, voice actor for Maria in Hayate no Gotoku, and Nakahara Mai, voice actor for Rena in Higurashi no Naku koro ni and Sawashiro Miyuki, Voice actor for Celty in Durarara!!) The artwork are much better then to be expected, if not on par with some of the animes on the mainstream. The background music used for Musou Kakyou also helps absorb the viewer into the mystical world of Gensokyo.As mentioned earlier, the characters and how they are presented is really what gave this anime it's high scores. namely Reimu and Remilia. (I squeeled when Reimu appeared for the first time) MAIKAGE did an excellent job of showing Reimu's character, she may look like she's very easy-going and lazy, but deep down, she's a caring girl and friendly. Her strong sense of responsibility is the main reason everyone's attracted to her. That being said, she can be instantly angered when something, or someone she holds dear is under trouble, she wouldn't hold back until said thing is back is made safe again. Remilia on the other side can clearly seen as playful and manipulative and always up to something. Remilia can be rather deceitful and tricky too. These characteristics for Reimu and Remilia is strengthened alot more in Musou Kakyou by their dynamic expressions and talented Voice actors.The reason Touhou:Musou Kakyou inspired me to write a review about it was its talented and marvelous voice actors. Every single voice actor in this OVA makes their character appear more lively and friendly (or in some cases fearful) It just makes you want to hug every single girl!~ An exceptionally well done job to the voice actors of Aya and Sakuya. The voice actor of Aya (Fujimura Ayumi) made Aya's character appear energetic and loud, always bouncing around  and shouting at people. The typical Genki-Girl you'll find. Sakuya's voice actor (Tanaka Rie) also did an amazing job for Sakuya's role, the way her voice makes Sakuya sound gentle and elegant, yet capable of being serious at the same time. There are alot more notable mentions, but for now just those two.The art for this doujin was actually suprisingly good. Although at times it looked abit out of proportion, I think it was good, considering that it's an unofficial work.  MAIKAGE did a great job of expressing the emotions of the characters, when they are enraged, suprised, befuddled....etc. MAIKAGE made very good use of the lighting and color range for this episode, It made an overall pleasant and shiny effect. In terms of the battle scenes it wasn't overly done of too flashy, it was quick and direct, with fitting BGMs and cool magic effects that wouldn't be considered as lame and childish. comparable to that of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. The concept of spell cards are also very interesting and references back to the original game series.The way MAIKAGE creates the various atmospheres in the world of Gensokyo is also spectacular, be it the mysterious Scarlet Devil Mansion or the inviting and friendly Hakurei Shrine. These atmospheres are further strengthened by background sounds such as Cicadas, Bird chirps and bell gongs. As mentioned earlier, the lighting is unbelievable well done, and shows when things are easy going or when trouble is on it's way.Overall, I enjoyed this episode the first milli-second and the last as well, it was a truly spectacular 20-minute for me. and I think it will be an equally stunning experience for anyone else viewing it, Touhou fan or not, this Unofficial doujinshi introduces the viewer into the dynamic and wonder-filled world of Gensokyo, it's almost as if the girls of Touhou are right next to you, waiting to share their everyday life with you. Give it a try and you'll be sure to learn more about the wonderful world of Touhou!!~ For this OVA, MAIKAGE hired official Voice actors, some of them you may be familiar with.

The sound was good and the music pulled you into the anime. The only reason that the sound received a 9 instead of 10 was because of:Not using music that was used in IaMP (or  over-editing IaMP's music too much)andThe bad openings for both of the episodes (so far).Characters-10The characters were amazingly interpreted (does that even make sense?? >.

But in order to stop the more dangerous residents from destroying the world during one of their drunk rampages (which happens a lot), everything is resolved using danmaku (magic paintballs).

Since this was made around 2008, series canon is taken up until 2007.Most of the story is wasted potential. Instead of utilizing the rich and deep backstory the series is known for, the creators chose to instead make a cute slice of life story centered around the lives of the Gensokyonites. Nothing particularly wrong with that, but one can't help but feel that they played it too safe in that regard.Characterizations also felt rushed in that regard. Most of the character hinge on the viewer already being familiar with the Touhou Project series prior to watching...the series.Going more in depth to the plot, perhaps it wasn't wise of the developers to make episodes hinging on cliffhangers.Still, the animation and art direction are excellent.Summary :[Bonus marks]Udonge is in it +100000000[Grade is capped at 10]Reimu is in it -2'Therefore 8/10 the series.Going more in depth to the plot, perhaps it wasn't wise of the developers to make episodes hinging on cliffhangers.Still, the animation and art direction are excellent.Summary :[Bonus marks]Udonge is in it +100000000[Grade is capped at 10]Reimu is in it -2'Therefore 8/10"", ""(This is my first review i focused on making it more fun rather then long drawn out.

If you're on holidays during the summer, this is the type of anime you watch to alleviate your boredom and have a short, fun experience in the magical land of Gensokyo.[Story: 5/10]The story in Musou Kakyou is a very basic, simple plot. It won't do much to grab your attention or shock you, but it's enough to pull you through the experience. That said, while the plot is nothing...special, it does seem like something that would happen in-universe; in the universe of Touhou, it's mostly boring until someone decides to stir up trouble for the most mundane reasons, with a few exceptions. Taking that into account, this scenario doesn't seem that out of place.[Art: 7/10]The art in this OVA is pretty standard, although there is visual improvement between the first and second episodes. I will comment that the backdrops are very beautiful to look at. The animation is everything it needs to be and it does it's job well, especially in the sparse fight scenes.[Sound: 6/10]The sound is also fairly standard, with the Opening and Ending themes not really being memorable, and there weren't very many tracks that played in the background. The vocal cast contains a few big stars, and as a whole the voices seemed very fitting for their characters.[Character: 5/10]There's not much in the way of character here. The OVAs automatically assume you know about the characters they're presenting so if you watch this as someone who hasn't played the games or read any of the side material, you're not going to be any the wiser of their antics. Yet, you can tell what most characters act like in their simplest forms, so it's not entirely confusing.[Enjoyment: 7/10]Despite how it might seem, I did enjoy this OVA series for what it is. Being a fan of Touhou, I enjoyed seeing the characters animated and going through their day, even making references to popular (although sometimes annoying and forced) fan culture.

I won't focus on the game itself since this is about the anime episodes that were made from an unofficial group.Story:    The story is really simple.  It talks about past events and encounters...that certain characters had.  However, little to none of this happens in the story, BUT, key word is but, that is where the creator was able to use their imagination to create what they thought of and they did a good job on it.  While there are plenty of plot-convience moments, and lucky pulls for the main two characters, the creator did a fair job in showing off a fair number of the characters.   The plot is rushed like crazy, but still, it is enjoyable to watchArt:   The art style was amazingly well done especially when considering that it was made from some random group who has no where near as much funds as the big name companies do, so the style was shockingly good.  The characters have their original designs and outfits and the maturity of some were put in a way that was very fitting.Sound:   Sounds were fine, nothing much to say here.Characters:   This is where they shine, but not too brightly.  The characters are largely shown at one point or another, and some of them have their abilities showcased which for those who know the series and know the characters, can enjoy seeing the characters use it in a fight or use it in a convenient way.   However, the focus was largely on two characters who use OP abilities to overcome anything, even when in theory they should have lost when fighting someone who has powers that are extremely superior to theirs.Enjoyment:  I'm biased here because the show as a whole, was not the best, but since I love the Touhou project and the modern spin on it, I enjoyed each and every minute of it, especially since I got to see my favorite Sakuya Izayoi character a few times within the 3 episodes.Overall:  I rate this higher than I should, not because the anime itself was that good, but because the amount of effort that the person put into creating an anime for Touhou, which is very much needed, and they did an incredible job when considering.  I really look forward to future releases, and if Im correct, there should be episode 4 coming out this year. that certain characters had.

Reimu is hanging around in her shrine (she is preparing a party this time) minding her own business when EVIL CAME! Wait, no, that was Stephen King…She is minding her own business when once again, something bad happens to her: the donation box is gone. So Reimu does what she always does in situations like these, she gets Marisa over and starts accusing and attacking random people...until she finds out who the real culprit is, though she hasn’t yet as of episode three. I believe this project is still ongoing, it’s hard to say, it usually takes multiple years per episode to be released. This anime has anything you could want out of a Touhou adaption with maybe one exception, the fights. There are two short scenes of danmaku battles, but they are far from what comes to mind when one thinks of bullet hell. On the other hand, it’s somewhat necessary to tune it down a little for an anime format if you don’t want it to look completely out of place and unbelievable. Besides the story and some fighting, we also (obviously) have some references to popular fandom memes like Meiling sleeping or Kaguya playing video games. Thankfully those are just short jokes and don’t fill up the show with unnecessary and unfunny in-jokes that have already died years ago. So far, the writing is very solid and coherent, though not very exciting (storytelling never was the major selling point of Touhou anyway).8/10Art:At first glance the artwork looks okay, but nothing too exciting. But if one remembers, that this anime was done by amateurs, the picture shifts quite a bit. For a bunch of people who don’t do this professionally and who animated this project in their spare time, Summer Day’s Dream looks really, really good. This of course is also the main reason why each episode takes multiple years to be released, but as a German saying goes, “gut Ding will Weile haben”. That means, if you want something to turn out well, you will need to take your precious time to do it. There are “official” anime out there that look like complete shit compared to this, so the effort of everyone involved cannot be rated high enough. Only a few times during character movements does one notice that this isn’t a professional work. That is very impressive.9/10Sound:This one is the reason this anime is even listed on MAL. While the animators and creators are absolute no-names, the voice actors are anything but. Mai Nakahara, the voice of Reimu, has a ton of roles in her vita, like main characters in Mai-Hime, Higurashi or Muv-Luv Alternative. I don’t know how exactly Maikaze got their hands on a cast like this, but the huge popularity of Touhou in Japan probably helps a lot. Other names we have are Miyuki Sawashiro (Monogatari Series), Aki Toyosaki (K-On), Rie Tanaka (Gundam), Aoi Yuuki (Madoka), Ai Kayano (KonoSuba)…the list is endless and that’s not even scratching the cameos. Opening and ending themes are solid, though it would’ve probably made more sense to use actual Touhou music or remixes, as these make up a huge part of the fandom (unless they do exactly that and I just didn’t recognize them, which I should never count out as I haven’t played all the games). Ambient sounds and sound effects are all pretty good. I don’t remember if any background music was used, if so it was it was very subtle.8/10Characters:Characterization in Touhou is a very thin line to walk. About 90% of what people think are established character traits are purely fanon, with canon providing only little in terms of characters, some of which usually gets ignored. Summer Day’s Dream keeps to canon for the most part but isn’t above incorporating some minor fanon gags like I mentioned earlier. After all, the fun in Touhou is the freedom to portray the characters as you wish. Alice is a prime example, whose usual characterization in fanworks is very different from the way she is portrayed in official games. The main characters in this anime all seem to be very close to their canon personas, with maybe one exception and that would be Marisa. She seems to be a lot friendlier and down-to-earth than she was in the games. While all Reimu cares about is punishing the culprit and going back to live peacefully, Marisa usually tags along to steal as much as she possibly can. In Summer Day’s Dream she appears to be the voice of reason for Reimu, which seems a little weird. I don’t mind this change much however, as an anime with two egocentric anti-heroes in the lead would become unnecessarily dark and mean-spirited. There are still many fan favourites left to include in the story (Yukari, Alice, Cirno, Flandre, etc.) but not drowning us in them from the start was the better choice, otherwise none of them would get any meaningful screentime.9/10Enjoyment:Many still dream of an official Touhou anime, but that will never, ever, ever happen. This project is the closest we will ever get to see the girls of Gensokyo animated and thankfully it is more than watchable. Of course a three episode anime with no conclusion isn’t very satisfying in itself, but the main appeal is to see Touhou in anime shape and try to recognize the many little things of the franchise that you already know, like the sunflower field (which hopefully means we’ll see Yuuka next) or the beautifully detailed exterior shots of the Hakurei Shrine or the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Summer Day’s Dream is a fun little watch for Touhou fans that may not be a fantastic voyage, but it’s cool to see it animated. I can recommend this to anybody interested in the franchise without hesitation.8/10Overall:8.4/10 until she finds out who the real culprit is, though she hasn’t yet as of episode three. I believe this project is still ongoing, it’s hard to say, it usually takes multiple years per episode to be released. This anime has anything you could want out of a Touhou adaption with maybe one exception, the fights. There are two short scenes of danmaku battles, but they are far from what comes to mind when one thinks of bullet hell. On the other hand, it’s somewhat necessary to tune it down a little for an anime format if you don’t want it to look completely out of place and unbelievable. Besides the story and some fighting, we also (obviously) have some references to popular fandom memes like Meiling sleeping or Kaguya playing video games. Thankfully those are just short jokes and don’t fill up the show with unnecessary and unfunny in-jokes that have already died years ago. So far, the writing is very solid and coherent, though not very exciting (storytelling never was the major selling point of Touhou anyway).8/10Art:At first glance the artwork looks okay, but nothing too exciting. But if one remembers, that this anime was done by amateurs, the picture shifts quite a bit. For a bunch of people who don’t do this professionally and who animated this project in their spare time, Summer Day’s Dream looks really, really good. This of course is also the main reason why each episode takes multiple years to be released, but as a German saying goes, “gut Ding will Weile haben”. That means, if you want something to turn out well, you will need to take your precious time to do it. There are “official” anime out there that look like complete shit compared to this, so the effort of everyone involved cannot be rated high enough. Only a few times during character movements does one notice that this isn’t a professional work. That is very impressive.9/10Sound:This one is the reason this anime is even listed on MAL. While the animators and creators are absolute no-names, the voice actors are anything but. Mai Nakahara, the voice of Reimu, has a ton of roles in her vita, like main characters in Mai-Hime, Higurashi or Muv-Luv Alternative. I don’t know how exactly Maikaze got their hands on a cast like this, but the huge popularity of Touhou in Japan probably helps a lot. Other names we have are Miyuki Sawashiro (Monogatari Series), Aki Toyosaki (K-On), Rie Tanaka (Gundam), Aoi Yuuki (Madoka), Ai Kayano (KonoSuba)…the list is endless and that’s not even scratching the cameos. Opening and ending themes are solid, though it would’ve probably made more sense to use actual Touhou music or remixes, as these make up a huge part of the fandom (unless they do exactly that and I just didn’t recognize them, which I should never count out as I haven’t played all the games). Ambient sounds and sound effects are all pretty good. I don’t remember if any background music was used, if so it was it was very subtle.8/10Characters:Characterization in Touhou is a very thin line to walk. About 90% of what people think are established character traits are purely fanon, with canon providing only little in terms of characters, some of which usually gets ignored. Summer Day’s Dream keeps to canon for the most part but isn’t above incorporating some minor fanon gags like I mentioned earlier. After all, the fun in Touhou is the freedom to portray the characters as you wish. Alice is a prime example, whose usual characterization in fanworks is very different from the way she is portrayed in official games. The main characters in this anime all seem to be very close to their canon personas, with maybe one exception and that would be Marisa. She seems to be a lot friendlier and down-to-earth than she was in the games. While all Reimu cares about is punishing the culprit and going back to live peacefully, Marisa usually tags along to steal as much as she possibly can. In Summer Day’s Dream she appears to be the voice of reason for Reimu, which seems a little weird. I don’t mind this change much however, as an anime with two egocentric anti-heroes in the lead would become unnecessarily dark and mean-spirited. There are still many fan favourites left to include in the story (Yukari, Alice, Cirno, Flandre, etc.) but not drowning us in them from the start was the better choice, otherwise none of them would get any meaningful screentime.9/10Enjoyment:Many still dream of an official Touhou anime, but that will never, ever, ever happen.

That being said, it's mainly due to the character artstyle in this anime. The backgrounds and sfx looks better in Musou Kakyou, but yeah, there's nothing I can say about the characters. They just look worse. Musou Kakyou certainly has some beautiful backgrounds, and for the few fight scenes there were, it looks pretty good.The best thing that makes me rate this show better than Phantasm, though? It's definitely the story. Sure, there are flashy fights in Phantasm and the characters look...a lot better, but this show has a good story. Phantasm is an episodic series that mashes canon lore from games into a few episodes each. Everything is poorly paced and rushed to make sure that all the content is in there. As a result, the final product isn't that great. Sure, there are fights, and there are events leading up to the finale in these arcs, but they're so rushed that there's basically no downtime. There's too much going on in too little time. In contrast to Musou Kakyou, the pacing is slowed down. It's not episodic arcs ripped straight from the games, but it is it's own side story with an interesting mystery and events that lead up to a climax. The storytelling is so much better in this show. There's a lot of dialogue and events that get told in a different perspective that really engages you in the show.The fact that there is an interesting story that's well paced and tries to do its own thing rather than just ripping events from the original games definitely makes me rate this higher than the Phantasm despite having worse animation quality (in my opinion, at least). I like the narrative a lot and how the show keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. a lot better, but this show has a good story.

I write this because this anime seemed quite out of place in my list, and I think a proper explanation is in order. If you're reading this, shouts out to you. Have a lovely evening, you deserve it buddy:)Prior to uncovering this anime, I had only recently gotten into the honest, but challenging bullet-hell game franchise, Touhou Project. I was already aware that the community surrounding the series was large, far beyond that of just the games. While I didn't think I was all that willing to delve too deep into the fanfare, the games themselves were starved...for lore, and my interest was peaked, so I wanted to check out the anime. I found that two anime adaptions were released. I watched this one first.Going into this 3 episode runt of a show, I excepted nothing more than no context, no restraint, just cute anime girls filling up the screen, created to be an inexpensive figurine-selling money sponge. (This is what the other anime was more or less) This show made an unlikely first impression on me. When I started, I saw that each scene had a great sense of ambiance. Characters only spoke as much as they needed to, and a good deal of storytelling was strictly visual. The character designs seemed pretty amateurish, but the animation itself was top-notch. The voice acting wasn't bad at all either. And once the action sequences broke out, oh man, I've seen A LOT worse out of A LOT of billion-dollar animation companies. As I continued to watch, it steadily became clear to me that this show was beaming with charm, spirit, and a vision to do this iconic game series justice by slowly bringing its characters, and its world, to life.When I learned about how Touhou Niji Sousaku Doujin was not an official anime in actuality, but an independent animation funded by a single passionate Touhou fan, I gained an even deeper appreciation for the show's existence. An appreciation that made me both happy, and sad. Happy that I had become an advocate of this franchise when I did, with the newest and final episode of this show on the horizon after years of hiatus, and sad knowing that I had ultimately fallen down into the hole of this fanbase that I had plodded so carefully to avoid. for lore, and my interest was peaked, so I wanted to check out the anime.

Tsurune: Kazemai Koukou Kyuudou-bu - Yabai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38921/Tsurune__Kazemai_Koukou_Kyuudou-bu_-_Yabai,"[""This is the equivalent to a gag episode. I don't think Tsurune has created a cast of characters that is quite unique and entertaining enough to hold up an episode that's entirely meant for being a senseless comedy episode. If you really love these characters, then you'll probably like this episode more than I did (I do love these characters, but I'm not obsessed with them or Tsurune--I just think this anime was fun and relaxing to watch); in truth, if characters have been created that are obsession-worthy, if you will, the viewer will watch them do anything. Tsurune doesn't have characters like that. Moreover,...if I'm being honest, this isn't a particularly good gag episode regardless of how loveable the characters are.The plot itself is flat at the same time as it's ridiculous. Yes, it's fun to see these characters interacting outside of kyuudo competitions as that's the only significant way these two teams have interacted thus far, but the way this episode achieved that could have been done a million different ways, and this wasn't a good way. I commend the story for trying to place everyone in one spot to do kyuudo and staying that way because, in essence, Tsurune itself is actually that simple--but the contents of this episode just didn't have the same heart the first thirteen episodes did. if I'm being honest, this isn't a particularly good gag episode regardless of how loveable the characters are.The plot itself is flat at the same time as it's ridiculous.

It truly is a sight to behold. The episode had a comedic relief to it too which you’ll understand when you see it. I think all characters are likeable, although those twins are pretty annoying but thankfully they kinda redeem themselves….so it’s really awesome to see them being all goofy yet serious about...kyuudou in this episode.

Between both seasons, this is the funniest episode without a doubt.I recommend it!...Es un episodio especial bastante divertido de ver. Se podría pensar que no aporta mucho al mundo de Tsurune, pero en cierta forma hace que los clubes de Kazenmai y Kirisaki comiencen a formar un vínculo que tendrá mucho sentido en la segunda...temporada.

Wu Shang Shen Di,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42187/Wu_Shang_Shen_Di,"['Reincarnation story ✓Less than 10 min. ✓Kick ass MC ✓CGI ✓I confess, the poster for this anime did not appeal to me.I confess, the lack of information on the page did not encourage me to watch it.I confess, I do not like short anime.I will be honest, go watch Wu Shang Shen Di right now, don’t even read the rest of what I have to say. I can promise you my review will not be “enlightening”, “analytical” or “sophisticated”. I watch anime for enjoyment, not to take it apart and say “could have been better”, “there’s no character development”, “the art style was boring”,...“not enough detail in the art”, “seen one, seen them all”. Alas I have strayed…If you like Isekai you can like this show, if you don’t you can still like it.The first couple of episodes involve alchemy babble, which shows Mu Yun’s knowledge that becomes  his strength to gaining power, influence and wealth. It will be boring and confusing, but you don’t need to learn or remember what they’re saying. The gist of it really, is that the era Mu Yun is from had more understanding of the world and the ‘modern era’ is more backwards than advanced. See it as Mu Yun’s display of superiority. The only thing you really need to pay attention to is the break down on levels and rank. It’s tricky, but it gives you an idea on why some of the things he does might be ‘impossible’ for his level and rank.Mu Yun is like a kid who’s been bullied to the point of fighting back. He does not tolerate disrespect, his slap-boxes are funny cause he catches people off guard. I like that he is somewhat mature, and sassy.The girls are not tsundere annoying types*. Then again, there are not many girls in this show, there’s 3 of them so far and none are damsels waiting for OP MC to save them, which I like. Best girl is Qin Meng Yao if for some reason you disagree, go get your head examined.*Your first 3 experiences, tsundere’s are cute, after that they’re just damned annoying.The CGI isn’t really bad, you know like the stiff robot* walking, fighting or moving. It’s got some flow, wind and stiffness that will catch your eye but not too annoyingly. The Chinese have good looking CGI. Unless you’re nitpicking. I like that background characters are alive and moving outside of interacting with MC, it makes the world feel alive.* Beserk (2016).I’ll be honest, the music and sound effects really don’t stand out to me, but, there is 1 track that plays when the MC succeeds (Ha, sounds like a lvl up tune). You first hear it in episode 2 when he’s talking to Mo Wen about refining pills. Hearing it often in the show, it grew on me, but still I’m not all hyped about it.The fights are okay… there is not a lot shown in fights, but it’s a 7 min show with about 5 min really per episode. So don’t be too alarmed if some fights feel rushed, short, or completely missing. If he’s beaten them before no need to show him kicking their asses again…right? I mean, his bad guys pop up like he’s catching Pokemon, and they show up in 2’s. So he always has a fight or asses to kick.Finally, don’t watch the show with expectations, just appreciate it as it is. I won’t lie, it’s not going to stick with you like your favourite anime, you’re probably not even going to remember core characters names. But it’s a good show to watch if you’re tired of regular shows or just looking for something to pass the time.If for some reason you’ve gotten this far in my review and you have not watched Wu Shang Shen Di.

However after second season it started to get really messy. They use the same rise and fall plot repeatedly and pretty much to be expected. For example when MC failed to defend his hometown he ""died"" but somehow is still alive and disguised himself and cultivate and later to be re-unit with his family, friends etc. then 50 eps later same plot again. MC ""died"", disguised himself and then cultivate and later re-unite with his family and friends. He also never really reconnect with his past. As a isekai-reincarnation donghua there should be element of...the past connecting with present after all it is isekai-reincarnation. literally MC doesn\'t even try to connect his past even when he met some of his old acquaintance. He just blush it off and pretend to know them somehow without even trying to reveal himself and re-connect with them again. Logic just dont apply here. You have a second chance in life to re-connect with people that you used to know and tell them the truth so they can help you get back your strength. But nope rise and fall plot. Just when he made progress villains attacks, MC ""died"" disguised himself and repeat. It does not get better either. After 250+ eps of second season the story does not even progress past this rise and fall plot. You know its bad when having to watch all eps from beginning to current newest release of the aired eps and it still doesn\'t progress. the past connecting with present after all it is isekai-reincarnation. literally MC doesn\'t even try to connect his past even when he met some of his old acquaintance.

Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42962/Uzaki-chan_wa_Asobitai_Double,"['Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! is a decent romantic comedy that follows the often raunchy shenanigans of Shinichi Sakurai, a college student, and his high school friend, the lively and energetic Uzaki Hana. Uzaki is a girl who infamously looks like a 12-year-old boy with honking back-breaking baby-busting tata bongos. She would classify as a manic-pixie-dream-girl if that term weren’t overused and grossly misogynistic. Uzaki and Sakari attend college together and spend their days hanging out together, to the latter’s dismay. They get into mischievous (sexual) hijinks and slowly develop romantic feelings for one another.In season two, Shinichi and Uzaki are still in college, and their relationship...is blossoming. They continue annoying/entertaining one another and learning more about each other while balancing their studies and social lives. Their romantic chemistry is there; Uzaki likes making fun of him while also being attracted to him. Given that he’s ripped, has a job, and is educated, I understand. Shinichi gives her sass right back too. He’s not a cuckold, unlike those other infamous teasing-centric anime.The raunchy humor is caused by Shinichi and Uzaki’s follies more often than stupid contrivances, except the spa episode, and I appreciate that because it’s much more cringe-worthy and less head-shaking. Conjuring cringe-humor from the characters’ personalities develops them while remaining tonally consistent. That way, the gags don’t appear unfunny or lazily written. The jokes are as prevalent as ever in this season, though there are sincere attempts at romantic progression. Seeing the two flustered over one another is funny (sometimes unintentionally), while every side character roots for them to get together in the background.The show introduces a few new characters, including Uzaki’s father and her little sister, who looks even more gremlin-like than her. Their introductions are so out of the blue it could be called a retcon. Shinichi’s coworker and friend, Ami and Sakaki, are also back to provide comedic relief and support, but they take a backseat to the new side characters. Uzaki’s mom plays a more prominent role this season as she trains Shinichi to cook and continues to assume he’s attracted to her—the joke is pretty stale by now. Your mileage may vary on how much you enjoy the innuendo-riddled dialogue, and it’s varied enough that I appreciated it in small doses.Some people find Uzaki-chan’s over-the-top fanservice and cliche slice-of-life plot entertaining and relaxing. It’d be hypocritical of me to shit on all the fanservice since I appreciate the male fanservice. At the same time, others (me specifically) are tired of the predictable plotlines, repetitive humor, and lack of originality. Uzaki-chan is like the lesser-known anime cousin of Family Guy—you’ll see a few funny clips on social media or in compilations, but the actual show itself is primarily predictable, unoriginal, and boring. It’s possibly due to the massive hate the first season earned that Uzaki-chan has gained a niche following and continues to achieve success. When the first season aired in 2020, I vehemently despised it. I wrote a rant so unhinged that it (rightfully) got deleted. After rewatching the first season and watching the second, I’d say it’s actually quite decent.The main draw of the animation is plenty of absurd facial expressions, jiggly jugs, and visual gags. Character designs are standard here, other than Uzaki, as previously addressed. Ami looks a little strange, which may be a problem with the animation. Her face is often off-model, and she looks like she has a unibrow. There’s no need for exciting animation cuts here, though it would’ve elevated the script. One aspect of the production that stood out was the Ex-Arm quality CGI cars. The soundtrack is also upbeat and cheerful. The OP and ED are boisterous and catchy and fit the annoying tone of the show perfectly.Overall, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai’s second season is a wholesome and harmless sequel that will make you occasionally grin and maybe even chuckle. Although unoriginal, the characters are endearing, and their relationship is pretty cute. If you are looking for lighthearted and easily consumable romantic anime fluff, this should serve its purpose. is blossoming.

The OP and ED are boisterous and catchy and fit the annoying tone of the show perfectly.Overall, Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai’s second season is a wholesome and harmless sequel that will make you occasionally grin and maybe even chuckle. Although unoriginal, the characters are endearing, and their relationship is pretty cute. If you are looking for lighthearted and easily consumable romantic anime fluff, this should serve its purpose.', ""All you need to know is you won't get what you what want here. The mangaka is stringing people along.The first cour was a light-hearted slice of life with romcom elements. This second cour, on the other hand, is a straight-up romcom that pretends like it's going to pay off its buildup and foreshadowing. While the ride was enjoyable, it never does.Imagine hiring a contractor you pay by the hour who shingles half your roof, and then disassembles his work as he's about to finish. That's what series like this are. It invalidates anything else good about the work, no matter how nicely he shingled...the first half.It's a shame. the first half.It's a shame."", ""Well, surely, we didn't think that we needed another season of SUGOI DEKAI, but the series is still just as humongous and boisterious as it was when Season 1 aired back in Summer 2020, a relatively good 2 years at this point.To be frank, the relationship between Hana Uzaki and Shinichi Sakurai was kinda a bit of a frenzy back when we were first introduced to the both of them, the not-so-introvert NEET and the big mouth annoyance of a girl that defined just as much as the Senpai-kouhai difference. But after a season's worth of getting used to them, Season 2 continues that trend...and actually refines a lot of the roughness surrounding the lives of both Uzaki and Sakurai themselves, even with the somewhat in-your-face comedy progressively shifting to that of the possible romance relationship as they are literally stuck with each other and being comfortable in each other's shoes.New to Season 2, would be the in-depth look into the families of both MCs, as we get to witness more of what made them as such: the Uzakis' of father Fujio, mother Tsuyu, younger siblings of brother Kiri and sister Yanagi. Yes, the periodic table of misunderstandings grow ten-fold as the comedy grows like weeds from within, awaiting the tingling senses of its origin story and inheritance that basically caused the eldest Hana to be this way. It's good to see Sakurai being less of a NEET (though he usually still is) by trying to be more social, as is the case that makes for some intentional comedy that does feel like mangaka Take's source material is more refined and improved over time, especially with the hints of romance budding as both Uzaki and Sakurai notice that they're more than just hang-out buddies at this point.The rest are practically just the same if you've already watched Season 1 before, I really didn't notice anything different in ENGI's production styles, which is fine by me since I would rather want consistency over any kind of rush to get the sequel out. The OST feels improved for Season 2, or rather, that's because of the change in tones in the sequel's contents that made it to be as such.The SUGOI DEKAI is still beating its heartstrings nicely, and if you're already caught up with Season 1, the sequel should be a no-brainer that it's just as (if not more) enjoyable as the series hits its momentum to give the stride. and actually refines a lot of the roughness surrounding the lives of both Uzaki and Sakurai themselves, even with the somewhat in-your-face comedy progressively shifting to that of the possible romance relationship as they are literally stuck with each other and being comfortable in each other's shoes.New to Season 2, would be the in-depth look into the families of both MCs, as we get to witness more of what made them as such: the Uzakis' of father Fujio, mother Tsuyu, younger siblings of brother Kiri and sister Yanagi.

Besides, I find it interesting how the story of the main couple flows. The chemistry of the two is still very compatible and the anime is very nice to pass the time and have a few laughs. Sometimes the anime presents you with a very exaggerated situation of what is happening and this reinforces the humor of this anime, since it is really just for you who want to enjoy the time without worrying about things parallel to the...story. The plot is pretty basic, nothing to stand out. The characters remain fun and producing good content for the viewer, the anime delivers what it proposes. I recommend it to everyone who wants to enjoy some silly romance. story. The plot is pretty basic, nothing to stand out.

Even though in season 1 we had already got enough hints since…Uzaki spends literally all her time with senpai..., and even stays over .Sak only ever opens up to and is comfortable around Uzaki.They can even tell what is going on in each of the others heads , that\'s how close they are.Season 2 capitalizes well on this already established thing and opens the Avenue of romance , but they don\'t just suddenly ""realize there feelings and get together""ofc if it were that easy they would have dated way earlier since high school.Plot (8/10)A slow and good progression is developed between the main lead, they finally begin to take each other and their relationship seriously , the supporting characters provide the very critical support that these two very volatile people need . The personality of these two leads to the most hilarious of cringeworthy yet funny and relatable situations. The new characters are also pretty out there and colorful and add a good layer on top, since the season has moved on from just Uzaki and antics to a serious character driven comedy.Characters (8/10)The old characters are as they were funny and quirky , but the catch this season is that they are suddenly presented with more sensitive information and their reaction to the same is quite the fun. The newer and secondary characters are also as wild as can be expected and provide the old ones much more of a push in the right direction , which they were missing last season.Sound and VA (7/10)The ost is a bit orthodox , with most characters having a sort of theme that is unique to them played out in a repeated way , the soundtrack itself is good for a comedy settting. The serious developmental / cute moments don\'t have a good soundtrack to accompany it which is a bit of a downer. The Op is pretty good music wise and quite nice to hear. ED is not to my taste but well done artistically.Art and animation (7/10)Pretty average all things considered and there aren\'t any changes from last season as i can recall. The art of OP is good and gives us a first impression of most new characters properly.This is a good watch , please give this a shot if you already went through the first season the payoff and development is worth it. , and even stays over .Sak only ever opens up to and is comfortable around Uzaki.They can even tell what is going on in each of the others heads , that\'s how close they are.Season 2 capitalizes well on this already established thing and opens the Avenue of romance , but they don\'t just suddenly ""realize there feelings and get together""ofc if it were that easy they would have dated way earlier since high school.Plot (8/10)A slow and good progression is developed between the main lead, they finally begin to take each other and their relationship seriously , the supporting characters provide the very critical support that these two very volatile people need .

In all seriousness Uzaki, Sakurai, and the gang have come back for a new season where the focus ended up being less on the comedy and more on the relationship between the two main characters. With that being said it’s still a rom-com, and unfortunately, while I think this season was paced really well and I enjoyed all the improvements their relationship went through, the comedy this season (when it was there) did not hit as much as season one, except the scenes with Uzakis Dad, as he was actually a joy to watch whenever he was on screen....Art: 6While I think the art style is very smooth, and for the most part I enjoy all the character designs, it is fair to say that it is a little basic, that is paired with decent animation makes it enjoyable enough. At the end of the day, it's a romance anime, and I’m not expecting every romance anime to have super smooth animation, so I think it does the job just fine. What I will say though is that I’m not a huge fan of the music, neither the opening nor the ending strike for me and throughout the show, they will play this one theme in the background that will get stuck in your head the worst way possible.Characters: 8I really like the cast of characters this anime has to offer. I love when Uzkais parents are on screen, and most of the side characters bring something to the anime too… minus Uzkai’s brother. As for the main duo, they did a great job at making Uzaki way less annoying than she was in season one, and they both do end up improving a lot as the season progressed. Their relationship actually ended up keeping me entertained throughout the whole show.Story: 7To be totally honest, I was so ready to give Uzaki an 8, as it really did impress me this season, but it does struggle at certain points in the story when the focus is not on the main duo. While I do enjoy the side cast of characters, they aren’t interesting enough to keep me entertained. However, regarding the overall plot, many strides were made with how the relationship between Sakurai and Uzaki evolved, and we are just one step closer to the climax. I wish the season ended a little better, but season 2 of Uzaki-Chan ended up being pretty enjoyable. I’ll give it 7 smug faces out of 10.

Now let’s look at Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai approaching to this.Simply put, they do it very wrong. See, the relationship between Sakurai and Uzaki can be perceived easily at the start between a kouhai and a senpai, but after watching him for some time, Uzaki arbitrarily decides that...Sakurai’s lifestyle is bad and weird so she starts going with him to different places, as it’s the kind of romcom where the girl teases the boy. The point here is that Uzaki in no way sees what Sakurai does as something people should do, and you might argue that living spending time alone and playing videogames isn’t a good kind of way of spending time, but this is what Sakurai wants, and she complains about it and starts to mock him for doing it. I know this is the main gimmick of the series, just like in other series with teasing girls like Nagatoro-san, the thing is, Nagatoro mocks her senpai because she wants him to pay more attention to her, but in here it is because of no more reason than to make this “weirdness of nature” of a person be a “normal” person.Thing is, I’m not bothered as much about Uzaki being annoying, I’m more bothered by how hypocritical she sounds. I usually take in mind this when watching Uzaki-chan and it’s that in the first season in episode X, where Uzaki starts talking about choco-mints, she starts ranting about how people don’t get choco-mints and mock it as if it was tooth paste and not it’s own thing. This is completely hypocritical, just look at what she is saying there and how she behaves towards Sakurai the whole freaking show, treating what he likes and does as some unnatural thing that must be changed because that “isn’t living life” or something, and during this rang she asks what if someone mocks Sakurai’s favourite game without knowing anything about it, when she knows that this is the same she does, but she won’t stop mocking him at any point about this very thing she posited him as wrong in that rant, because you know it’s fine when she does it I guess?Taking this into account and how Sakurai seems obviously annoyed about how she acts, it makes their relationship a mess, as Uzaki most definitely doesn’t accept Sakurai for what he is. But this doesn’t end here and continues with other characters, as there is Ami, a co-worker of Sakurai’s, and there is Itsuhito, who is Sakurai’s friend. These two are probably the worst part of the show for me. They believe that Sakurai and Hana’s relationship is basically meant to be and that they should be together, they aren’t the only ones who think that, many others do, but these are the worst offenders of this because they try to push it hard, saying that if they don’t do anything then everything will go extremely slowly, and it makes perfect sense that it would go slowly, after all, these two aren’t compatible at all. Itsuhito even mocks Sakurai about not taking the first step with Uzaki, which is dumb, if he doesn’t see her that way then why would he do anything? He and Ami are basically stalkers to see their relationship work for their own desires. There is this scene in the second season where this fortune teller says they are completely compatible and stuff like that, and it turns out it was basically Ami the one who pushed the idea for the fortune teller to say it for them to feel more forced to be together. This is not how relationships works, this is not how you build them, telling me again and again that they are very compatible doesn’t make them compatible when their actions don’t match said words. Sure, they can spend some time together and have fun, but most of the time they are just fighting and mocking each other.This is why their relationship feels unearned, after watching two seasons I’m wondering how are they even friends, let alone boyfriend and girlfriend. It was expected that they would be together, and that’s perfectly fine, they way it happened is dumb as their romantic development is forced, not only because it feels rushed, but because the characters are practically forcing them to be together more and more every time.To not say I just disliked all characters, because I didn’t, as there is also the Uzaki family. I actually quite liked them, even the misunderstandings of Tsuki were funnier than whatever Hana was doing, which isn’t much to say because what Hana does isn’t funny. The father is cool, and despite not having much screen time I found the brother cute.It doesn’t help that this is jarring to watch animation-wise, I don’t think there was much of a problem with the first season, but then watching the second season it was painful to see stuff like the football match. The sound has never been something special in Uzaki-chan aside from Uzaki’s VA being annoying as all hell, kudos to her for making it work so well, because there aren’t many voices that can annoy me. The songs are just fine at best, I won’t be remembering neither the opening nor ending of this or the previous season.The first season didn’t make me angry, it was a pretty subpar romcom and nothing much, but this one does things way worse than the first one, as if it was forcing Uzaki’s and Sakurai’s relationship down my throat even more than the characters force it down the MC’s throats. If you want to watch this for fan service, go somewhere else, Uzaki’s boobs are all you’d get.Thank you for reading.

The first season of Uzaki Chan was such a wonderous show full of laughs and heartwarming moments. So what happened here?Everything in this season just becomes so repetitive and boring. Every episode is literally just the characters going ""They like me what should I do about it?"" ""Maybe ask them out?"" ""NO THAT DOESN\'T MAKE ANY SENSE!"" Literally that\'s all that happens for each episode. They tried to cover up the flaws by introducing more of Hana\'s family, none of which I found to be that interesting. Like do we really need a subplot with her brother being jealous...of Sakurai\'s appendage? Yanagi was the closest one to interest me with her interactions with Sakurai, but the charm wears off quick. The jokes became extremley repetitive as well with the main ones being a goofy ahh cat making a face or Hana\'s mom thinking Sakurai wants herThe biggest problem with the show is just how toxic Hana turns in the season.

On the one hand, I'm happy that the series ended with some genuinely lovely reflection and development, but on the other hand, I could see the writers on the other side of the screen getting cold feet at the very last minute. It is infuriating to have a romance series with little to no development. Still, it is downright criminal when a show teases or does an excellent job introducing dramatic conflicts and progression, only to back the hell out to maintain some lame status quo. Oh, and if you read ahead in the manga and know what's supposed to...happen immediately after this finale, this feels like an extra strong kick in the teeth.So we finally got a payoff to the teaser from the beginning of the season. Of course, it was the standard misunderstanding with Sakurai collapsing on top of Uzaki in a way that made it seem like something intimate was going to happen. I like that they kept it a little vague regarding what he would've done if he didn't pass out. But the fact that Uzaki's dad was just outside the apartment meant that no matter what happened, there wouldn't be any actual progression. The real meat of this episode is from Sakurai's perspective as he straight up admits that he remembers everything that happened the night before, including the realization that Uzaki is in love with him, and it is torturing him inside. He wants nothing more than to pretend it didn't happen because he doesn't want to be direct and confront anything that everybody calls him out on. The funniest part of this episode is when he tells his best friend what he discovered, only for said best friend to turn around and yell at him the way I'm sure every viewer of the show has wanted to yell at Sakurai up until this point.It was a little bit frustrating that we had so many nice scenes in the last episode regarding Sakurai saying how he wants to do right by Uzaki and that he's going to think really hard about everything, only for him to just kind of dance around everything like he really wants to maintain the status quo. I understand his logic that it's not fair for him to have found out how he did because he has to now consider their relationship with information that Uzaki doesn't. It is a nice juxtaposition compared to how Uzaki has been thinking throughout most of the season when she kept convincing herself that Sakurai was in love with her this whole time, but that's just it; these are all well-written conversations. Still, they are happening 5 to 10 minutes before the final episode finishes.It is so satisfying when Sakurai monologues about how deep down he's known all along, and he's just been running away from the obvious answer about his feelings towards Uzaki. He loves and cares about her. I know it's not that simple to confess to somebody, but narratively it only satisfies the bare minimum of fulfillment as a viewer. Considering the way this episode ends, it does make me think back to how this whole season has been paced and makes me believe that if we just cut out half an episode of the padding that was obviously placed here, then they definitely could've fleshed this out for more than one episode. This is especially difficult when you consider that we're probably not going to get a season three announcement for a while. Overall, Uzaki-chan Season Two had some of the highest highs of the season, but they ended up being bogged down with fluff that tested my patience instead of making that patience feel rewarded. happen immediately after this finale, this feels like an extra strong kick in the teeth.So we finally got a payoff to the teaser from the beginning of the season.

With that many episodes to work with, one would expect more development, but that was not the case. Even the finale won't be enough to keep this series from sinking.The premise is the same as the previous season. Both of the main characters have romantic feelings for one another but are unable to be honest with themselves. The chemistry between the two is still there, but the comedy aspect has become stale. Everything feels frozen, like a rerun of Season 1, but with the (near) confession scene in the...finale. This season would have been much better if they had focused more on the romance aspect and fleshing out the characters instead of repeating the same old comedy routine. Even the supporting casts are more entertaining to watch right now. You can see good chemistry between them and get something new out of their interactions. Again, I believe that if the confession scene had occurred earlier and we had seen a lot more lovey-dovey stuff, I would have been more invested in the show.In terms of art and animation, I've always found Studio ENGI's production quality to be on the lower end of the spectrum, which means I can't really get invested in their works. The art style and animation have both been carried over from the previous season. Being consistent is desirable, but being consistently mediocre or subpar is not. The art style remains a little wacky, with many exaggerated expressions. There are also a lot of still background frames. The animation and art style have clearly seen better days. There is nothing noteworthy to mention.The OP conveys the show's playful and comedic tone. Not my cup of tea, but a passable standard. The ED, on the other hand, exudes the show's romantic vibe. IMO, the better of the two. Both the OP and ED do an excellent job of conveying the overall vibe and mood of the show. Again, not the best accompanying visuals, but I suppose it is acceptable given Studio ENGI's production quality.I'd like to reiterate how Season 2 felt like it dragged on and how my overall enjoyment suffered as a result. If you're okay with waiting 13 episodes for a teeny-tiny bit of romantic progress, this season might be for you. The comedy skits became annoying after a while since it was the same old routine of Uzaki instigating something and Sakurai being on the receiving end and getting all pissed off.

It felt like budget Kaguya-sama to me, because it resembles that kind of a romcom, just without all the good production value. I never liked anime that were built on misunderstandings, but I’ll give the show this, the misunderstandings made for some decent chuckles sometimes, and that’s a bit better than some other romcoms out there already (looking at you Rent-a-Girlfriend). A constant battle of “do I like him?”, and “do I like her?” is what this show revolved around this season, but I personally found...the side characters way more entertaining than the main duo.STORY:Not much of a story, just the hijinks of Sakurai and Hana, a strange pair that just refuse to get together. Heck, even everyone around them thinks it’s pure comedy how they act when they’re around together. It does get frustrating to watch this at points, with the peanut gallery just staring at this wannabe couple all day long. Do you people have nothing better to do?ART:With studio ENGI at the helm, it’s hard to expect anything from them, and it’s another rather poorly animated series, with limited movement, and sub-par character design.MUSIC:I enjoyed the Season 1 OP and ED way more than this season’s, which just felt extremely generic, and the soundtrack was too.CHARACTERS:The main duo wasn’t the most entertaining, but the side characters were pretty fun to watch, especially the Uzaki family. We have the mom, Tsuki, who constantly gets into misunderstandings around Sakurai, which was hilarious as always, we have the dad Fujio, a typical, overprotective dad, who also works at a gym, we have Yanagi, Hana’s little sister, who really stirred the pot and made things a little spicier for the main duo, and we have Kiri, who had his share of gloomy moments.A character that I just still could not stand was Ami, who slobbers at the sight of Sakurai and Hana together. If you’ve seen or read Komi-san, Ami reminds me of Yamai in some way, with some of the things she does. Both these people should be put on some kind of a watch list.ENJOYMENT:While there was some progress, it felt very slow and painful to watch at times, even with the decent entertainment value.THEMATIC EXECUTION:The comedy bits can be executed well, but the romance is quite the painful watch, as it’s just not that great throughout. It’s hard to care for these characters sometimes.OVERALL:I’d just call this cheap entertainment, a low budget romcom with bits of funny humour masking a slog of a romance.

Average, through and through the characters, the writing, and the story are just so unbelievably bland.  Later in the season, it focuses more on the Uzaki family and they are somewhat interesting but they are not enough of a reason to watch the show.  The main duo barely progresses as characters if at all, I can't recall ONE character developing moment.  They are quite literally the same characters from the end of the first season.  Whereas the first season introduced you to the characters and...while the first season was nothing impressive, at least it got you to enjoy the dynamic somewhat between the main duo.  This season the writing is just so forgettable, even the ending was extremely disappointing, although I can't say I wasn't surprised.  The side characters in this anime sum up my feelings about this show perfectly, they get irritated at the pure immaturity and inaction of the main duo.

Double just doesn't bother to deliver any romantic value to what is supposed to be a romance anime.  It just beats around the bush for 13 episodes, reminiscent of the first season.  At least with the first season, you get the feelings from their budding relationship, but in the end, what we are watching is a slice of life anime, that isn't very appealing....Nagatoro does it better.

It's a simply sweet romcom with a cycle of fun, annoyance, forgiveness, and repeat. This cycle applies to both the main couple and us viewers. We just go with the flow with sequential but unpredictable stories throughout the schoolyear as the characters' lives become more and more intertwined. This season introduced many new characters; the character development is confusing and gradual, but the climax is getting closer and closer. It does sometimes feel like we go backwards, and I'll tell you right now, SPOILER, they haven't made it yet and are still figuring things out. I don't know if this is getting...a third season, but one more would be perfect. It was written to need one more season--I feel like I've been cliffhanged at a random and inconvenient time. It doesn't feel over at all.I haven't read the story, but I pray to God that the author did not find a way to drag on the pre-climax for more than another season-worth of stories. But the worst that could happen is season 3 never being announced. It would have a lot of potential with the state that season 2 ended off in.Tired review:Anyway, I'm tired and not writing coherently--just give us a season 3 within the next few years and I'll be content. I feel like with so many animes I'm begging for another season in these reviews. This anime is no exception. I should be reviewing it though, so I'll say this before I fall asleep. Uzaki-chan is full of unique fun and games, but at its heart we have these dense and unreasonable main characters that don't have any common sense in love, and it's damn frustrating. I can't stay too mad at the dense but understandable Sakurai, and Uzaki eventually wins my forgiveness, but I really have to restrain myself and throw my own common sense out the window to sit down and give in to letting them take things slowly just as friends, despite being such a perfect couple.It's 8/10 for me, I feel like there are so many other romcom animes I could have prioritized over this one. It ain't bad though, but frustration beats out comedy for me as I think back on it with the aftertaste of the ending. Nonetheless I'm sure season 3 will be a banger since this was a more of a buildup. It just built up to nothing in my eyes without a season 3 announcement to keep me sane.

There are a lot of important changes that fix what I believe were some of the biggest problems with Season 1, however, this anime still has a long way to go if it wants to reach masterpiece status. Let’s take a look at the two biggest improvements as well as one persistent flaw present in “Uzaki Wants to Hang Out” Season 2.SIDE CHARACTERS - Started off very rough, but got much better...with time.One of my biggest issues with Season 1 was the side characters. Many of them had dislikable personalities and made questionable choices that ruined the quality of the show. Whether it was a pervert that just wanted to watch IRL sexual tension, a friend that kept setting up awkward encounters, or a mother that somehow misunderstood everything without ever thinking things through… it made their screen time a pain to watch. For the first few episodes, it seemed like things were heading in the same exact direction. But then, we got the light at the end of the tunnel.One of the best decisions this season has made is focusing on the full introduction of the Uzaki family, some of the most entertaining side characters I’ve seen in RomCom this year. Each character has a realistic but likable persona (including a “reworked” Uzaki mother), making the dynamics between the family and Sakurai feel natural and entertaining. This is a welcome change to the previously mentioned side characters whose only goal seemed to be forcibly intervening with the main couple. On top of this, each family member has heavily interacted with Sakurai without Sakurai knowing who the other person is. This starts an interesting build-up toward Sakurai and the Uzaki family formally meeting each other, bringing the potential for funny “that was you???” moments.In particular, I found the relationship between Fujio (Uzaki’s father) and Sakurai to be one of the funniest parts of the season. Neither knows just how closely connected they are to each other, so when they discuss private-life problems, it’s a lot more personal than they both think. This has a wonderful payoff towards the end of the season by creating a super funny situation that was worth the wait.COUPLE CHEMISTRY - When you let things play out organically, you get a healthier dynamic.Again, one of the biggest issues with Season 1 was how forced most moments between Uzaki and Sakurai felt. My personal entertainment was always at its peak when I was just watching the two of them interact naturally with each other. But whenever a side character tried to “speed things up” or introduce tension, the dynamic would feel stiff and awkward.But with the change in side characters comes a change in main character interactions. Season 2 lets Uzaki and Sakurai just hang out like friends, which is kind of the whole premise of the show. Moments of romantic tension are developed naturally through the actions and personality of each character, making the whole relationship feel believable and strong. So when all this tension is brought up during the big finale, I’m left with the sense that this is what both characters truly want, not what the author, audience, or side characters demand.RELATIONSHIP PROGRESS - A slow burn is fine, great even, but don’t get too repetitive.If there is one criticism I want to remark on, it’s how repetitive some things can get when watching the romantic side of things. Again, I really appreciate the slow but natural development of progress in the relationship. However, there were a lot of times when Sakurai or Uzaki stumbled upon the same feelings created from the same situations seen before.The best example I can think of is Sakurai calling Uzaki by her first name, Hana. We saw in Season 1 that Uzaki wanted Sakurai to use her given name as a way of demonstrating their closeness. Sakurai, feeling awkward about the whole idea, doesn’t really budge until Uzaki gets mad. This same exact situation is played out again in Season 2 when Sakurai calls other characters by their first name but not Hana. Sure, you could say this introduces Hana’s feelings of jealousy, but the core of the problem is still Sakurai feeling awkward about closing the gap between them.And this recycling of previously explored developments is used again and again for multiple scenes. I feel like Japanese college friends do more than just bicker, play video games, and drink… so the author should find more unique ways to bring out progress in their relationship. It doesn’t have to be exclusive to this show or built off complete chance, but it shouldn’t be the same thing I saw a couple of episodes ago.FINAL VERDICT - Worth a watch for any RomCom enjoyers, especially those seeking an organic, slow-burn relationship development.“Uzaki Wants to Hang Out” is not perfect by any means, and I don’t think it could ever reach the level of greatness seen in legendary RomComs like “Kaguya: Love is War”. However, this season was well worth my time and I think it will be worth yours too. I recommend giving it a shot if you found the main characters entertaining enough in Season 1. with time.One of my biggest issues with Season 1 was the side characters.

Neither knows just how closely connected they are to each other, so when they discuss private-life problems, it’s a lot more personal than they both think. This has a wonderful payoff towards the end of the season by creating a super funny situation that was worth the wait.COUPLE CHEMISTRY - When you let things play out organically, you get a healthier dynamic.Again, one of the biggest issues with Season 1 was how forced most moments between Uzaki and Sakurai felt. My personal entertainment was always at its peak when I was just watching the two of them interact naturally with each other. But whenever a side character tried to “speed things up” or introduce tension, the dynamic would feel stiff and awkward.But with the change in side characters comes a change in main character interactions. Season 2 lets Uzaki and Sakurai just hang out like friends, which is kind of the whole premise of the show. Moments of romantic tension are developed naturally through the actions and personality of each character, making the whole relationship feel believable and strong. So when all this tension is brought up during the big finale, I’m left with the sense that this is what both characters truly want, not what the author, audience, or side characters demand.RELATIONSHIP PROGRESS - A slow burn is fine, great even, but don’t get too repetitive.If there is one criticism I want to remark on, it’s how repetitive some things can get when watching the romantic side of things. Again, I really appreciate the slow but natural development of progress in the relationship. However, there were a lot of times when Sakurai or Uzaki stumbled upon the same feelings created from the same situations seen before.The best example I can think of is Sakurai calling Uzaki by her first name, Hana. We saw in Season 1 that Uzaki wanted Sakurai to use her given name as a way of demonstrating their closeness. Sakurai, feeling awkward about the whole idea, doesn’t really budge until Uzaki gets mad. This same exact situation is played out again in Season 2 when Sakurai calls other characters by their first name but not Hana. Sure, you could say this introduces Hana’s feelings of jealousy, but the core of the problem is still Sakurai feeling awkward about closing the gap between them.And this recycling of previously explored developments is used again and again for multiple scenes. I feel like Japanese college friends do more than just bicker, play video games, and drink… so the author should find more unique ways to bring out progress in their relationship. It doesn’t have to be exclusive to this show or built off complete chance, but it shouldn’t be the same thing I saw a couple of episodes ago.FINAL VERDICT - Worth a watch for any RomCom enjoyers, especially those seeking an organic, slow-burn relationship development.“Uzaki Wants to Hang Out” is not perfect by any means, and I don’t think it could ever reach the level of greatness seen in legendary RomComs like “Kaguya: Love is War”. However, this season was well worth my time and I think it will be worth yours too. I recommend giving it a shot if you found the main characters entertaining enough in Season 1.', 'Now I was really excited when they announced that uzaki is getting a second season because I thought its finally going to conclude and end both of them dating. I was wrong, its literally s1 all over again with more goofy ahh characters and same humor all through out the show. The reason s1 was i guess decent is because its something new and the jokes are still fresh but since s2 is the same shit as s1 then it just becomes bland and boring.I feel betrayed with this sequel is because both Uzaki and Sakurai somehow became even more brainless in this season and...proceeds to go around making excuses not to date or admit both of their feelings like dude just fuck her already like jesus christ.Animation 5/10Sounds 5/10Characters 4/10Humor 3/10Overall 4/10 proceeds to go around making excuses not to date or admit both of their feelings like dude just fuck her already like jesus christ.Animation 5/10Sounds 5/10Characters 4/10Humor 3/10Overall 4/10', ""What initially was advertised as a punching bag for virtue signalling anitube ended up being an extremely enjoyable slice of life.Uzaki chan second season is a massive step up from the first season. They didn't make the common mistake of reusing the big breast gags like how To Love Ru. Nor did it try to force a romance too fast like Aharen.Uzaki's family is absolutely loveable and a blast to be with. Fujio really is a dad you want to root for since he is flawed, but also really wants the best for his daughters. Kiri definitely feels like he has personality. Ami is a...great side character.Sakurai is really one of the best rom com MC's we have gotten in a while. Not only is he kind of cool and someone you want to idolize, but he actually feels well written and down to earth. He seems more believable as the lone wolf senpai vs someone like Gojo from dress up darling who is way too much of a walking floor mat that happens to get into ecchi situations. His hobbies are relatable like going out to the gym, hanging out with guy friends, taking school seriously, making friends with people. It makes sense he is distance with his family since that is how a lot of lone wolfs chads act.The plot is surprisingly unpredictable and it does give a good breath of situations to see how the Uzaki family reacts.Overall Uzaki chan is the season that improves a rom com in every single way by exploring and expanding on every aspect of the characters vs relying on too many forced gags. Highly recommend to watch, since it vastly improves your opinion even if the first season felt full of gag. great side character.Sakurai is really one of the best rom com MC's we have gotten in a while.

Our favourite cute gremlin with big anime titties is back to annoy her incredibly hot yet paradoxically socially awkward, unaware, honest to a fault, massive penis confirmed, gamer senpai, and just like the first season I wouldn’t be watching this (I’ve read the manga) if it wasn’t for the incredible cast of voice actors which carry this anime from being just another slow burn romance to a bonafide rom-com.That’s not to say that I think the writing is bad, on the contrary I think it’s pretty good. It’s rare to see one of these kind of shows without...there being some sort of ridiculous love triangle or a straight up harem around the mc. Uzaki-chan holds a unique kind of restraint over itself and focuses squarely on Uzaki’s and Sakurai’s relationship which I really appreciate. The friends around them like best boy Sakaki and giant pervert Asai are there (mainly their own entertainment) to help Uzaki and Sakurai overcome their shared uselessness and obliviousness towards each other so they can finally get together instead of being their to cause tension.This season focuses more on the Uzaki and Sakurai families so we get to understand why the two of them are the way they are. We already know about Uzaki’s extremely hot mom who believes Sakurai wants to have an affair with her (and doesn’t seem opposed to the idea) thanks to all the soap-operas she watches, but this season we learn that her little brother Kiri is close to becoming the protagonist of Rent-A-Girlfriend, her little sister Yanagi is the actual devil, and her dad is a highly eccentric, overly protective helicopter parent.Meanwhile, Sakurai’s family is… well I won’t spoil it if you haven’t watched that far yet.The art and animation is pretty mediocre. This is an ENGI production after all, and judging by the list of anime they’ve created (and that I’ve watched) they’ve never really push the boat out when it comes to animation standards. That doesn’t necessary mean they have too. Despite the characters looking a bit bland and the line art not being great, some of the backgrounds look nice and there’s enough expression and characterisation to really make me appreciate how good of a job the voice actors are doing.Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! Double is more of season one and if you’re into that then you’re going to enjoy this. It’s funny, silly and sometimes, even doki-doki. Even that one filler episode which is literally there to advertise a Japanese resort park gets an okay in my book because it gave us Uzaki’s mom in a bikini, and that my friends, is the meaning of Christmas.7/10 Good. there being some sort of ridiculous love triangle or a straight up harem around the mc.

By the end of this, the main two have been on 100 dates, are exclusive with one another, she sleeps at his place, they both like each other, he knows she likes him, and yet absolutely no real romance (going out, physical intimacy, relationship, anything concrete beyond romance vibes). It is blue balls the anime. In a world where anime getting a sequel season is the exception and when the anime is hardly unique or special...enough to deserve such a thing in the first place, it's baffling that this anime would be so smug and frustrating to its audience. If ML is going to be such an indecisive fool, at least make them kiss and have him take a step back. Give it some real stakes, some life or drama, rather than banking on more episodes that might not come.I highly recommend you don't watch this. I honestly believe even with a third season, the most we would get is a confession, with no kissing or displays of affection, but them just struggling to call each other by their first names and that kind of nonsense. With a fourth season, they would just hold hands by the end. What is the point of a romance anime where there is no romance? This would be like if it was a sports anime and they just practice for two full seasons and never play a game against another team. Just pointless and insulting to the viewer. Has romance anime just become a contest for how little progress a couple can make over the course of a season? Light Yagami makes more progress with Misa, a woman he could not care less about, in Death Note than the main two make in two seasons of this. Hell, Naruto makes more progress with Sasuke in one episode than this couple does in 26. I hate this trend.

With the main plot now diving into the ""will they, won\'t they"" overarching narrative, Uzaki 2 struggles to keep the minute-to-minute interest and fun in the same manner as its previous season. A large reason for this comes down to the dynamic between the characters. This has shifted from a man vs. woman scenario to a matchmaker scenario, taking away a lot of the fundamental building blocks for how Uzaki wrote its stories. In the previous season, for instance, Uzaki and Sakurai were antagonistic toward each other in...a lighthearted, sometimes flirty manner. The fun was in who would come out on top between the two. Now the focus is less on the two main leads and more on the side characters trying to get them to confess to each other.

This season has almost no lewd scenes, in comparison to season 1, and is about Sakurai’s character development in his feelings for Hana.Me personally, I loved that, as I never watched the show for its “spicy” scenes. I wanted a lighthearted romcom that would get me invested in the characters. If you’re looking for that, you won’t be disappointed.The only thing keeping me back from giving this a perfect score is sometimes it was extremely unsatisfying and frustrating. I’m talking about the ending. Yes,...the author/director are dragging it on, with many moments so close to the ultimate love confession (if you’ve read the manga you know it’s just chapters away.)I think what this show does nicely is characters. For me, there are few shows/manga that have invested me in the personality of the characters quite as much, and after hearing the season 3 is not confirmed yet, I was upset.Yes I admit, as I said before, the pacing to the confession isn’t great and is dragging on too long (no I don’t think this is a spoiler because we all know it happens eventually, though I won’t say how it happens). Believe me I like for the show to be longer, but it’s kind of a bitchy move to end the season with no confirmation of a third season right before the confession.In summary, you’ll love the second season if you’re looking for more character development between Hana and Sakurai.

I loved the 1st season, Hana & Sakurai one of my favorite pairings (they have some of the best reactions and funny faces) In short it’s the story of two apparent opposites- an outgoing girl and a silent, brooding type guy who end up as friends (season 1) and the rest of town is doing everything they can to get them to hook up- and failing... and hijinks ensue.I enjoyed...season 1, to the extent I was defending it on CR against early critics who actually claimed Hana was ‘annoying’ and hated her design, or didn’t understand Sakurai’s grumpy demeanor.And it's true it isn’t perfect.

It distracts from the whole story of the anime; and then teenage boys (or most likely- adult men with the maturity of teenage boys) could not see past them.If they could have just made them ONE SIZE smaller- and not had her wear that shirt ugh…Because I love everything else about the show.As for the second season:Second season is not as nice looking, not as well animated as the first. Hana feels like less of a genuine character and more like the meme, like it seems they’ve elevated the more humorous side of her while the more serious- and lonely side- isn’t in view anymore. There’s a lot more focus on everyone just trying to hook them up; and because we’ve now seen them together for about 16 episodes total- their closeness seems a little less special. They need to take it up a notch.But it is VERY funny I am totally enjoying the humor and it gets at least half a dozen laughs out of me each episode.I won’t hide that of course I want to see them together by the end… I want to see them get married, the whole thing. Maybe that’s the romance addict speaking. But it’s not clear when ‘the end’ is- if there’s going to be another season after this, then don’t expect the plot to progress at all.

Xue Ying Ling Zhu 3rd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49569/Xue_Ying_Ling_Zhu_3rd_Season,"[""I'm very dis-pointed with the 3rd session.MC Acts as a foolish. They know some people are working for devils but they didn't suspect anyone.Even what irritating is they trust everyone.Devil subordinates try to resurrect they leader MC find the location so Elders are went to that place kill most of demon generals. Some people (Priest)   try to resurrect the devil god MC only try to stop the Main event other elder who are too powerful are at that time fighting with the small mounters. I don't understand what type of  story line it is. MC seen the one of Priest got something...from devil god it's was devil god soul so he can again resurrect Devil God but he didn't inform it to anyone what type of logic is it too much nonsense. They even feels they successfully   stopped devil god.What I MORE FOCUS ON ANIME IS STORY LINE.BUT THIS 3rd SESSION HAVE HORRIBLE STORY LINE.If you ok with above mentioned points just want to watch a anime where you like fight scenes and OP MC, Good Graphics then you can watch it. from devil god it's was devil god soul so he can again resurrect Devil God but he didn't inform it to anyone what type of logic is it too much nonsense.

"""Bungaku Shoujo"" Memoire",https://myanimelist.net/anime/8481/Bungaku_Shoujo_Memoire,"[""Edit: This review is for the first of the three OVAs for this series.Bungaku Shōjo Memoire, a three part OVA series produced by Production I.G., is the prequel for the recently released Bungaku Shoujo Movie. Although it is a three part OVA series, each OVA by itself is a standalone OVA with little direct connection with each other. The first episode of this OVA series, titled Yume Miru Shoujo no Prelude, focuses on the story of Touko Amano (天野遠子), the main heroine in the subsequent movie.Also, a little note here: I have NOT read the original light novel source material, so you could say that...I'm starting with a clean state regarding the Bungaku Shoujo franchise.The story itself is somewhat peculiar, focusing on Amano’s love of books (and literal eating of them), and her subsequent run in with both tragedy and love, although love not quite in the way that you would expect. The tragic moments took up a rather brief minute or two in this OVA, with the death of Touko’s parents while she was a child. They didn’t linger or overdramatize the tragedy, and simply moved on. The lasting impact of Amano’s father words of wisdom, however, are clearly seen through his daughter’s personality. There some wonderful series that have an intense focus on the theme of how loved ones are never truly gone as long as they are remembered, shows such as Cross Game and Touch.However, due to the brevity of this particular OVA, such themes could never be fully fleshed out. The plot explores other aspects of the main character in more detail, such as the budding love of a young girl for books of all flavors, the social anxiety that comes with being a part of a niche fandom isolated from others, and an innocent fascination to explore the boundaries of your own interests.The true strength of this OVA is the dynamic, always-enthusiastic-and-filled-with-energy main heroine, Touko. Her sheer level of pure, unadulterated love of books really shines through in her actions, ranging from jumping through imaginary fields of raining candy and talking cats after reading a wonderfully imaginative story, to being all giddy and smiley while explaining the wonders of today’s literary class lesson to her classmates who fell asleep in class. She is truly a wonder to watch, with absolutely no restraint in showing her love and appreciation of literature. Her love for books is so extreme that it’s almost fascinating; you can’t help but wonder what it’s like to be so carefree and passionate about your interests.She is truly a joy to watch, but not everything is all good and happy for her. In the scenes where she is hanging out with other girls, you could tell that she has trouble fitting in with others, precisely because of her overflowing love of books; she simply cannot properly socially interact with her peers unless they also love and appreciate books, which unfortunately they do not. There isn’t an explicit focus on this, per say, but it is touched upon towards the beginning of the OVA, and is more darker in tone in contrast to Touko’s light hearted antics.And here is where the major flaw to this OVA presents itself; it touches upon some very interesting themes and ideas, but it never fully immerses in properly fleshing out any of them. Because this OVA is only 22 or so minutes long, there simply isn’t enough time to properly develop and explore some of the ideas presented in this OVA. How I see it, this OVA was overtly ambitious about what it wanted to accomplish, but the end result is that it developed each idea moderately well, rather than polishing a single idea to perfection.  An episode or two more to this arc could have done wonders for this particular story.However, just because the OVA was all over the place doesn’t mean it wasn’t good. This OVA still has it’s charms and is by no means a bad OVA. It’s truly a wonderful watch that tells the story of a young, enthusiastic girl and her books;  I almost guarantee that this will bring a smile to your face.Overall: 8.5/10 (rounded up to a 9 on myanimelist)Production Quality: 8.5/10Characters: 9/10Story: 8/10Overall Enjoyment: 9/10this is a copy of my original review (^.^), which could be found here at https://blogs.emory.edu/animec/2010/07/17/bungaku-shojo-memoir-i-yume-miru-shoujo-no-prelude-ova/ I'm starting with a clean state regarding the Bungaku Shoujo franchise.The story itself is somewhat peculiar, focusing on Amano’s love of books (and literal eating of them), and her subsequent run in with both tragedy and love, although love not quite in the way that you would expect.

The opening theme of the OVA gave me a initial impression that was very positive; not only it was a good way of introducing the major characters in the novel, but it was also visually pleasing, especially with the surreal background of sunset shining on Amano’s face with a slight red hue and the beautifully-rendered colored marbles flowing out of Amano’s hands. Later,...the quality of the visuals remained solid with the episode itself with no apparent drop in quality. However, I was slightly annoyed that some of the drawing felt bit angular such as the hairstyle and the jaw of certain character’s face. On the other hand, I think it had the advantage of keeping the characters crisp without any unnecessary details that would distract viewers from enjoying the overall mood of the story.The classic music in the background matched well very well with the overall atmosphere of the show, which was light-hearted and calming in the most part yet dramatic and serious in some crucial moments. Also, the lightening effect was employed with precision for similar purpose as above, as the shadow caused by the sunset fills the most of the screen when Amano finds about the retirement of Miu Inoue and it is again filled with bright light when she discovers and meets with Konoha Inoue at the school.While there’s really nothing particular to note about the side characters’ voice acting, I really liked the decision to use Hanazawa Kana for Amano’s role as her youthful and energetic voice fits well with the literature girl image. (Just to note, Hanazawa does also very good job of acting quiet girls like Fujiwara Sora in Sketchbook and Sengoku Nadeko in Bakemonogatari) To be frank, I also really look forward Hirano Aya and Mizuki Nana’s voice acting in the future episodes of Memoire OVA.Even though Bungaku Shōjo did not seem to be a high-budget production, I should give credit to the director, Shunsuke Tada, for keeping the OVA consistent with the novel while making efficient use of the available resources. Overall, the OVA should be appreciated by the fans of Bungaku Shōjo, while remaining enjoyable for those who have faced the series for the first time.Source: https://blogs.emory.edu/animec/2010/07/17/bungaku-shojo-memoir-i-yume-miru-shoujo-no-prelude-ova/ the quality of the visuals remained solid with the episode itself with no apparent drop in quality.

(the other OVAs bring the series down, The only interesting is this one)A few months back I saw a OVA prequel of a light novel called Bungaku shoujo, at the time I wasn’t quite sure of what was I getting into, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, I decided to watch it because I was looking for a more dark perspective on the romance genre and that’s what I got for most part, I even watched the movie who pales comparing it to the prequels but that’s a topic for another day, keep in mind these OVA´s...have completely different purposes and stories, Now without further a do Ill start my review:Story:The story centers around a boy named Inoue Konoha a boy who likes to write, and its shown that he has talent for it.. Has a kid konoha met a girl called Miu Asakura a girl with a cold attitude that doesn’t get along with other kids, everyone “hates” her and she can be called a loner. She can be also considered a pathological liar, she lies for the most trivial things but for me I can interpret it has a method she has to try to affirm and get the attention of others, she does not care about what others say but deep down she shows sorrow because what she really wanted was someone to rely on and interact with, it’s a common thing among children and human in general, they strive for emotional connections and seek romance in this world. Consequently it also shows our greed and obcessiveness over something we hold dear, and sometimes it gets the best of us.It’s a bitter sweet story with a decent direction and presentation and has great atmosphere. It stays focused troughout and doesn’t try to diverge from it, being a single OVA is very limiting yet they made something worth watching, this however is much more well explored in the LNs.. , this OVA has all had great ideas, great direction and presentation, the setting while being quite generic also fit (another fucking highschool setting), I give it a 6 because it doesnt have a ending (its continued in the movie) and because it was indeed rushed.Art:The art was solid for most part, sometimes some re used footage but very rare, other than that the character designs were generic, and the characters look like robots sometimes (Production IG) The backgrounds were pretty simple and it didnt had anything to the overall atmosphere and tone settled by the show wich wasnt a good thing, especially when I am a sucker for atmosphere.Sound:The sound was pretty forgettable but fitting, the opening was suave and melancholic (fitting the show´s themes). On this case the soundtrack actually contributed to the atmosphere, (even being forgettable) like I said above it fitted the show.The VAs did a pretty good job, especially Aya hirano wich was amazing while voicing Miu.Character:I have a lot of mixed feelings regarding this, the problem is that despite Miu Asakura being a great character the rest of the cast is just bland and uninteresting, most of them just being mere plot devices, one of the main things I absolutely love about this OVA is the fact that it has Miu has the MC and it shows you Miu perspective of the world, it was a great move by the writer.Even if Miu is a great character I still stand for my point that a single character cant carry a show no matter how good it is. Its meaningless when the same character doesnt have anyone to interact with and influence others with the ideals and motivations they couldve introduced in the others.Inoue is a bland ass MC for a show, he is absolutely annoying and bland, he almost comes off has a self insert if it werent for his reactions and motivations towards MIU, he is just forgetableMiu´s parents was just there to provoke victimization that isnt necessarly bad in this case since it was needed to introduce us to Miu´s situation, the same goes for Miu´s classmates wich they show understandable reactions to her gimmicks, it all plays to Miu, they all rely on Miu but in the end they build their own grave because like I said "" a single character cant carry a show no matter how good it is"" .. and well Ill keep saying that because the side characters are just moved by reactions nothing else, bland like a sheet.Enjoyment:I clearly enjoyed the show, because  Miu was the MC, that alone gives me the confidence to give this single OVA a 6 out of 10. I just hope for a remake just featuring Miu and her perspective on the world, without the bland ass characters. have completely different purposes and stories, Now without further a do Ill start my review:Story:The story centers around a boy named Inoue Konoha a boy who likes to write, and its shown that he has talent for it..

Appare-Ranman!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40532/Appare-Ranman,"['This anime is something.There\'s a remarkable originallity on it, but, at the same time, it feels a bit nostalgic. Appare Ranman has quite a strange plot, its _bizarreness_ isn\'t something your average anime has.Its characters are unique, and, at the same time, clichè. Appare is an aphathetic boy, but really gifted. His companion, Kosame, is loud and a complete opposite of Appare. Their relationship develops in a strange yet hillarious way, making the anime more enjoyable.The art and the sound, the ""creativeness"" of all of it. Frantically exposing its own weirdness. Yeah, im quite amazed by how enjoyable and funny all of...it is, and they are yet to start the Race!Appare Ranman is a gem of this year, i\'m happy it\'s back!9/10 till now. it is, and they are yet to start the Race!Appare Ranman is a gem of this year, i\'m happy it\'s back!9/10 till now.', 'Jojo\'s Steam Ball Run: the Animation, that is yet unfortunately another COVID-delayed show.It\'s hard to believe that this one show that\'s full of experimental creativeness and perceived notion is all conceived by one man alone: Masakazu Hashimoto. From the story to the series composition that\'s tons of wacked insanity, it\'s more than enough to stand out in its originality, yet also be a callback to his career days of starting out as a director over at P.A. Works circa. 2011 (after flailing around from different anime projects in the 2000s with varying degrees of success). His first directorial and series composition work being Tari Tari...way back in 2012 wasn\'t game-changing, but the way that it was done certainly had the early otakus take notice of his idea of a unique storytelling that\'s totally Hashimoto\'s: a fairly simple tried-and-true story plot, but with a pinch of inspiration to carve out its own identity and stand out as so. But as is with HaruChika\'s somewhat odd approach and consequence of people attacking him (as the director) vs. the novelist that has somewhat of a mish-mash of ideas that are not put well together, it\'s sad to say that it was kinda a defining moment of unnecessary hate strewn from that.But now, after some time, Hashimoto is back with a story setting about a cross-country race that spans cities and people from the East to the West within a 19th century modernized Wild Wild West take, and it\'s honestly a thrill to follow the many characters who have defied dangers whilst participating in unforeseen deathmatches, fighting to save theirs and others\' precious lives from time to time. ""It\'s a strange world"" as the quotes say, with the bombastic bizarreness of a plot and setting that only complete once they are joined together.""Who says death-defying races are just for the Americans, both locally and natively?"" This is a question that always pops up in my mind about people from different cultures entering into another culture, and totally getting that ""culture shock"" factor, and that is exactly what the 2 main characters are here for: the ""Alexander Graham-Bell"" of big-ass inventions of a dreamer that is Sorano Appare, and the skilled coward of a samurai who needs to pluck his courage, Kosame Isshiki. The idea of steamships in the 19th Century was a thing when transportation was getting ready to ship the masses across vast distances, and with Appare enamored at the idea of it, he so desperately wanted to create one for himself. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the playful strings of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" landed both Kosame and Appare in another continent (that is the U.S. of Los Angeles) and a particular race (of which the prize money won will be used back to Japan) sets the both of them on a course that will teach each other about camaraderie, and the dependence that will prove to be both MC\'s biggest character tonal shifts from time to time.A ""Trans-America Wild (car) Race"" that\'s sponsored by organizers of big coporations who call themselves B.I.G. Boss (that you can see where the inspiration when it comes to automobiles), and within it, an assassination plot of the most mind-numbing kind that only weaves its unwelcoming stance the more is revealed...that suddenly isn\'t so much of a race anymore against rivals, but a fight to the death with a group of bandits wreaking havoc all around. Simple and overly cliche, but it works as a final product altogether.To properly understand this show in general, there are many characters that play a part in this expedition:- The Appare-Kosame team of an unusual steam-powered car, along with Hototo, a ""Red Indian""-ish native American of a child, whose gain is to seek revenge for a gang that killed his tribe and family after being rescued from thugs.- Jing Xialian, an assistant for a racing team that is constantly being accused and judged by her gender in an all-male society, and her #MeToo statement being a forthcoming judgment to see her in a totally different light, that women can also be like men and race wild.- Al Lyon and Sofia Taylor, potential family heir and the heir\'s chaperone of one of the B.I.G. Boss corporations (BNW), with a desire to win to prove his solidarity and firmness of being his family\'s next in-line to the corporation.- Race organizer Seth Rich Carter (you can call him Mr. Carter), whom has been ridiculed in the past as an engineer for another B.I.G. Boss corporation (G.M.), but like Kosame, holed up due to cowardice and not being able to stand up for himself.- The Bad Brothers Tristan and Chase, whom like native Hototo, are burly Americans but whom first came under the wrong impressions, and are some of the kindest characters in the series.- Last but not least, the ""Thousand Three"" outlaws which form the basis of B.I.G. Boss: skilled gunmen Dylan G. Oldin (racing for G.M), ""Crazy"" TJ (racing for Iron Motor Company) and the leader of the bandits Richard ""Gil (the Snake) T. Cigar"" Reeseman (lone driver).All characters get their lone times of character development, which is to say that for 13 episodes of a shit-ton of concurrent events happening at different times, every character has their definite background moments to shine their light and shoot over the moon. Take Appare and Kosame for example: Appare is like a gifted bookworm, very focused on what he needs to do and forgets about the outside world instantly, while Kosame is loud and obnoxious, with a clear reason for his vengeance and redemption as the series progresses, both characters shrug each other off at the very beginning, but the apparent figures of simultaneous events that force them to double-team up and understand each other\'s motivation is always nice, and it only gets better from there on. Needless to say, the character department will be one of Appare-Ranman!\'s stronger aspects when considering about the final product (which is the show itself in full glory).P.A. Works is NO stranger to original shows in the past few years, but the records have been few and far in-between if there is any level of hype to back it up. Of course, this show had it in the Spring season, but the COVID push-back of a seasonal delay definitely hurt the enjoyment more (of people forgetting that it exists, DUH). It was a constant treat to see the art and animation show its legs, and even with some CGI (on the race), it will not win any awards, but at least it\'ll get the race done and dealt with. Overall, I\'d never think to see 19th Century America so well-thought out, even resembling with the Wild Wild West of olden days past with a good sprinkle of animation to accompany it.The OST, well oh well, it had a very nostalgic feel to it...that\'s if you feel inclined about 19th Century worldly standards. A good job on taking what is already well known and putting a nostalgic spin on it, kudos for setting the appropriate atmosphere for what it is. Good pairing of the OP and ED, and YES, finally a good song from Mia REGINA that screams ""I don\'t give a F***"" at how balls-off-the-wall the series has been flexing its personality. Long-time veteran Shoutarou Morikubo with his ED is also a good way to finish each episode, and anticipating what\'s to come, step-by-step. Truly the ""I\'ve got it!""A-HA moment.The above-average spectrum of P.A. Works\'s catalogue of original shows, and watching people do what they love is a nice gesture, on top of just going bonkers and sticking lackluster endings of the shows gone by. At most this was a passion project done pretty good (not great, but passable), but at least I enjoyed my run with this show.Now if you\'d excuse me, I must now muster my creativity to make my own dream automobile and enter the race of a ""lifetime"". way back in 2012 wasn\'t game-changing, but the way that it was done certainly had the early otakus take notice of his idea of a unique storytelling that\'s totally Hashimoto\'s: a fairly simple tried-and-true story plot, but with a pinch of inspiration to carve out its own identity and stand out as so.

Boss corporations (BNW), with a desire to win to prove his solidarity and firmness of being his family\'s next in-line to the corporation.- Race organizer Seth Rich Carter (you can call him Mr. Carter), whom has been ridiculed in the past as an engineer for another B.I.G. Boss corporation (G.M.), but like Kosame, holed up due to cowardice and not being able to stand up for himself.- The Bad Brothers Tristan and Chase, whom like native Hototo, are burly Americans but whom first came under the wrong impressions, and are some of the kindest characters in the series.- Last but not least, the ""Thousand Three"" outlaws which form the basis of B.I.G. Boss: skilled gunmen Dylan G. Oldin (racing for G.M), ""Crazy"" TJ (racing for Iron Motor Company) and the leader of the bandits Richard ""Gil (the Snake) T. Cigar"" Reeseman (lone driver).All characters get their lone times of character development, which is to say that for 13 episodes of a shit-ton of concurrent events happening at different times, every character has their definite background moments to shine their light and shoot over the moon. Take Appare and Kosame for example: Appare is like a gifted bookworm, very focused on what he needs to do and forgets about the outside world instantly, while Kosame is loud and obnoxious, with a clear reason for his vengeance and redemption as the series progresses, both characters shrug each other off at the very beginning, but the apparent figures of simultaneous events that force them to double-team up and understand each other\'s motivation is always nice, and it only gets better from there on. Needless to say, the character department will be one of Appare-Ranman!\'s stronger aspects when considering about the final product (which is the show itself in full glory).P.A. Works is NO stranger to original shows in the past few years, but the records have been few and far in-between if there is any level of hype to back it up. Of course, this show had it in the Spring season, but the COVID push-back of a seasonal delay definitely hurt the enjoyment more (of people forgetting that it exists, DUH). It was a constant treat to see the art and animation show its legs, and even with some CGI (on the race), it will not win any awards, but at least it\'ll get the race done and dealt with. Overall, I\'d never think to see 19th Century America so well-thought out, even resembling with the Wild Wild West of olden days past with a good sprinkle of animation to accompany it.The OST, well oh well, it had a very nostalgic feel to it...that\'s if you feel inclined about 19th Century worldly standards. A good job on taking what is already well known and putting a nostalgic spin on it, kudos for setting the appropriate atmosphere for what it is. Good pairing of the OP and ED, and YES, finally a good song from Mia REGINA that screams ""I don\'t give a F***"" at how balls-off-the-wall the series has been flexing its personality. Long-time veteran Shoutarou Morikubo with his ED is also a good way to finish each episode, and anticipating what\'s to come, step-by-step. Truly the ""I\'ve got it!""A-HA moment.The above-average spectrum of P.A. Works\'s catalogue of original shows, and watching people do what they love is a nice gesture, on top of just going bonkers and sticking lackluster endings of the shows gone by. At most this was a passion project done pretty good (not great, but passable), but at least I enjoyed my run with this show.Now if you\'d excuse me, I must now muster my creativity to make my own dream automobile and enter the race of a ""lifetime"".', ""Another season. Another good original work anime by P.A works. This time it comes in the form of a racing anime. Appare-Ranman is different from anything I've ever seen. From the character designs to the actual plot of the show, nobody can say it's generic at all. The closest comparison I could think of for Appare-Ranman is around the world in 30 days. It's a wild, wacky and entertaining journey with Appare and co. as they race from LA to NY for prize money to return home to Japan. Unfortunately, things aren't as smooth sailing as they'd like.Unlike Fairy Gone, which I love, Appare-Ranman has...some solid CG. One of the biggest complaints about P.A works last show was the subpar CGI, convoluted plot, direction, etc. All of those were improved upon massively here. While I didn't enjoy Appare as much as FG, objectively it has better quality production.It's rather sad that the show was postponed due to COVID a few months ago, it took a lot of wind out of its sails and led to it being criminally slept on as people forgot it really existed. That said, I'm glad I was one of the few to watch this show, it really is unique and entertaining. I know those phrases get thrown around a lot, but I'm confident you'll find enjoyment from this one.Appare-Ranman gets 8(insert something catchy from the show) out of 10 from me. some solid CG.

Yes, I recommend this a lot.Appare Ranman deserved so much more attention and love.

Do you want to see the boundaries of racing pushed? Do you want to see cool engineering and masterminds fight? Do you just want speed? If so this is the perfect anime for you. Completely unique, original, well animated, and most importantly its actually good.Story - 7/10I'm...not sure about you, but this is the first time I've seen something like this. I like it. The story is completely new (I think), and for once it's done correctly. Some animes with new concepts just flop and just become unbearably bad, while others are just generic. This plot might be a little too easy to predict, but I will love seeing this grow bigger.Art - 9/10I like it. I always say no art is bad in my reviews, can I just say the art is really nice this time. The coloring, the character design, the settings. All of those are very distinct. The animation is nice. Done well. Never seen characters so original.Sound - 5/10Honestly as long it is in sync, not too cringy, and sound good I don't really care. Who even judges animes by the music? I can assure you the intro is pretty good.Characters - 4/10Besides from the art quality, man its shallow. Not much characteristic, not very unique. There is the smart one, the girl, the rival, the funny sidekick, and the invis support sidekick. Did I basically describe all the characters in the series? Yea, I guess.Enjoyment - 6/10I could have enjoyed it so much more if the pace was a little faster. 6/10 isn't bad, I just have high standards.Overall - 7/10Doing the thing you love and is good at is always fun.

There are many anime with the over-powered main character, viewer watches those anime for How the MC defeats or overcomes the hurdle? rather than does he actually able to overcome it. There can be many ways to show the characters are intelligent. Minor spoiler:The Main character(Appare) within a split second can calculate the objects trajectories and able to escape, in one scene. If it is limited to the MC (Appare) itself it would have been okay. The other main character (Kosame) able to split the bullet in...to half with a sword with no logic is certainly a big plot hole for me.If they wanted to keep it close to natural,they should haven't shown those scenes, my experience could have been a much better, it was too hard to ignore. They didn't even try to cover it with some power (I can understand,if they did it would have been even worse). Kosame backstory became so cliche (used in almost 5-6 episodes) and I absolutely hated the way it is presented.

A major plus if you're into those themes, but also for the anime itself.Second so far, the characters. There are a lot of relatable characters in the show, mainly from their personalities and backgrounds. But also...just a likeable cast in general, with how they interact with one another, with how the story goes at least. Along with the chemistry with other characters. Just looking at our two MCs as an example, they really fit and mesh together well, and some of the moments so far are quite a laugh.Each character has fun and interesting backgrounds of how they all came here too. Sure some are quite heart wrenching or depressing, but they're still strong characters, even with all that.The story itself seems rather interesting! A big race that we're all just dying to see.

I wonder where I heard of this plot idea before?Appare-Ranman takes a classic trope and tries to run off with it. There\'s so much rushed pacing and irregularities in the plot in order for the story to progress as fast as possible. You don\'t get to see any of the character interactions go beyond a surface level. Before you know it, the story progresses and new, random characters get thrown into the mix in order for there to be more diversity. It\'s pretty...clear that Appare-Ranman is a story-centric show that uses characters as a mean to make the story happen. It doesn\'t even try to hide how bad the pilot episode is because it\'s a mere way for the actual story to come into play. Right from the start we get the very obvious plot devices that get spam thrown at the viewer. Appare is a ""eccentric genius"" that likes to tinker with gadgets, is unsociable and unpredictable, and our other main character, Kosame is forced to keep watch over our character. In no more than a single episode we get the common tropes thrown at Appare. He gets berated by his father for not having a proper job, he gets into big trouble but is able to get out due to his genius intelligence, and he doesn\'t think about the consequences of his actions because there are none, no matter how severe it actually is. Why? Because our boy Appare is the main character with plot armor given by the gods. Anything and everything he does goes his way no matter what. Kosame\'s just a character to keep Appare ""in check"" and a ""normal"" character to be a contrast with Appare, making a ""dynamic duo.""There\'s a lack of logic in many of the characters and the way they act towards Appare, because if they didn\'t do that, he wouldn\'t be able to get away with all the things he does. Get stranded? Don\'t worry, help comes miraculously. Stand in front of car throttling through at top speed at the dead of night? No worries, Characters get introduced in a similar fashion. Luckily meet the same characters over and over, random scenarios lead them to meet different characters, and they all become great friends after interacting for a few minutes even though they were complete strangers just before. Then, they obviously have to spew their entire life sob story in front of Appare and Kosame, where then they will become a side character that will help the duo in some way shape or form. Appare\'s eccentric and life threatening actions would normally kill or jail a person immediately, but his smarts and plot armor seem to make his actions without consequence.And the story? Win a million dollars in a race to go back home to Japan.

In the end by some freak accident the 2 found themselves in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where they were rescued by a ship bound to the USA, from there they have to find a way to live in that new place and yes it entering that race that would serve as their ticket for the two to go their separate ways since the two don\'t want to have to do with each other , that\'s it as soon as Appare comes up with some ways to make a something they can use to race and win.

Every character grows... every character is explored and developed some more than others...but its enough for us by the time stuff really...goes down in ep 8 and 9 ... yes prepare yourself as I don't think any of us saw that twist....but by this point you will feel something.The next point I really want to praise is the art/ the shadow and use of light/ there are some beautiful scenes in this anime... the art style took some getting use to. But by the time we get some beautiful misty mornings/ sun shining through trees and shadows.... I was on board.The plot itself is straightforward enough. Through a series of mishaps Appare and Kosame  two Japanese characters...end up in turn of the century LA.They have no money to their names and Appare is a wacky out there mechanic...they see the Trans atlantic race is about to happen with a sum of money as a reward and booom plot is in motion....however what I wasn't expecting was a whirl wind of emotions that followed.The plot initially seemed boring to me... but I was wrong.The race is just a driving force.... haha car pun.... it moves the characters forward...however along the way there are obstacles to over come and feels to feel.I dont write reviews until the end credit has rolled. But because no one is talking about this anime... I made the choice to write it early.If you have an interest in - steampunk/ wild west/ cars or the dying samurai way ...this anime may be for you....Also because hes mentioned nowhere in the cast...or wasn't when I made the video....Kenshiro Tsuada is literally killing it this season as the evil shark from GOH and now hes terrorizing the west. The voice talent in this show is amazing.Its funny/ sad/ interesting and at times clever ....this anime deserves to be on your watch list!!! goes down in ep 8 and 9 ... yes prepare yourself as I don't think any of us saw that twist....but by this point you will feel something.The next point I really want to praise is the art/ the shadow and use of light/ there are some beautiful scenes in this anime... the art style took some getting use to.

It\'s not just that the show is set on the cusp of technological revolution, nor that the expansive cast hails from all nations and backgrounds, but also that the work itself is able to refute traditional genre constraints, free to present something altogether new, a rarity in this age. And it\'s not just a thoroughly unique story, but one that becomes its own themes manifest; innovation and refinement being both watchwords and destinations.----At first glance, the story doesn\'t appear quite so...special. A lawless race with a huge cash prize and the impetus of being stranded across the ocean are both strong ideas, but both have been explored. Where Appare-Ranman! adds intrigue to the mix is with its cast, and the approach they take to the goal. A test ordinarily of speed and determination instead becomes one of creativity and research. This is most evident in the downtime allocated both prior to and alongside the race, where careful planning and constant improvement are what pull the protagonists through. These points also provide an excellent stage for each of the many subplots, though I have to note something of an imbalance amongst those focusing on side characters, with some particularly endearing ones robbed of more exploration.On the subject of characters, I must commend the way Appare-Ranman! handles its roster. Rather than the opponents being a simple gallery of faces to strike down one by one, each and every other participant gets to spend plenty of time with the protagonists. As a result, the interactions between the group are fluid, believable, and quite entertaining. Their attitudes toward each other make for some ratehr good moments of comedy - the ""Who\'s a thinker and who\'s a fighter?"" scene toward the end is a great example. Again, thought, there is a single gripe to be had, and that\'s that giving each and every cast member focus leaves the eponymous Appare somewhat less than the protagonist should be allocated, even compared to his companions Kosame and Hototo.----It\'s animated well, but there\'s little I can say to dwell on that. Instead, it would be more germane to praise the design work on display. Appare-Ranman! has a brilliant eye for colour, and uses it to full effect to create one of the more visually unique, and I presume intentionally anachronistic, settings in recent productions. The music is likewise more important, and thankfully brilliant across the board, with the OP, ED and OST all top-notch. Each uses an interesting blend of instrumentation that matches the meting pot nature of the rest of the show, and thus fits exactly.The direction front is, alas, a mixed bag. Though there are dozens of nice touches, from believable gun and swordplay, to effective visual characterisation, they\'re let down by the framing. Without explaining the last act too much, a moment tense and sombre is shattered just by recalling the first scene. I do however have to give credit to the niche act of race direction, which has been given surprising attention. It is easy to understand the relative positions of the competitors, the sequences surrounding them are thought out, and there\'s even at times a live-updating leaderboard, a feature entirely superfluous, yet exhibiting an endearing sort of dedication.----Were I to polish it up, I would do away with the framing and give a few more spots dedicated to Appare. Little else needs to be done, which rather succinctly demonstrates the show\'s quality.With that all assessed, Appare-Ranman! was a marvellous outing with a whole crowd of talent at the reigns.

I certainly and unquestionably recommend it to anyone seeking out creativity.And I would, finally, like to make a note, in part to myself, to follow Ahndongshik\'s future work, as what has been presented here has been exquisite.', 'Appare Ranman is set in the late 19th century where the eccentric Japanese mechanic Appare Sorano and swordsman Kosame Isshiki find themselves in America after the former made a small steamship he intended to use to go on a journey, before Kosame\'s meddling led them both to be stranded in the ocean before being saved by a large American steamship. Seeking money to return to Japan, the two enter a race crossing the country from Los Angeles to New York City, with Appare converting the steamship he made into a steam-powered car to compete in it.From the looks of things, Appare Ranman appeared to be...going more for spectacle than any kind of depth with exploring the Trans-America Wild Race that Appare, Kosame, and several other racers wind up participating in. All the characters have their standard character types they follow with a sprinkling of backstory to have reason for them participating in the race, which the first several episodes are focused on dabbling into before the start of the race. Plus, the series seemed to have plenty of anachronisms in accurately depicting the supposed late-19th century setting it has with a number of the cars in the race having more modern designs from the 1920s to 1940s, mention of the Panama Canal which wasn\'t completed until 1914, the American flag having 50 stars when much of the Western part of the country were still regarded as territories, and one of the racers appearing to listen to modern rap music in his car radio in spite of said radio not coming around until the 1950s.While it may seem like I\'m criticizing these points of the series, the spectacle that Appare Ranman has to offer actually works pretty well to its strengths in spite of its obvious hiccups with depth. Appare\'s eccentric character is an entertaining one to see with the heavy devotion he has toward building things with his mechanical aptitude and the character chemistry that unfolds between the racers can be entertaining to see at points such as Kosame playing ""straight man"" to Appare\'s behavior and some of the antics that unfold during the show\'s breather episode later in the series. Plus being animated by PA Works, the artwork for Appare-Ranman is nice to see in action with some pretty elaborate character designs with some of the racers and fluid animation coming from the racing and action scenes within the series.While I could be forgiving toward the anime\'s lack of depth as it wasn\'t Appare-Ranman\'s intended focus, I did take issue with the show\'s abrupt addition of an antagonist toward the final four episodes of the series. While the show did foreshadow his presence in earlier episodes, said antagonist only exists to add in a needless conflict into the series that gets in the way of the Trans-Atlantic Wild Race due to his presence in the series and is pretty flat as a character compared to the other colorful personalities seen with the racers.In short, Appare-Ranman largely gets by with the spectacle it offers up with its race with its disregard for historical accuracy and its colorful cast of characters. While I\'ll admit I was engaged to its racing premise in spite of its issues with depth, the addition of a needless conflict with an antagonist in its final episodes did derail some of the enjoyment I was getting out of the series. As long as you don\'t question the particulars of things with Appare-Ranman that it blatantly disregards, it still makes for decent entertainment due to it embracing its spectacle and colorful characters. going more for spectacle than any kind of depth with exploring the Trans-America Wild Race that Appare, Kosame, and several other racers wind up participating in.

Works decided to throw caution to the wind and suggested something stupid for their next project. Which, if this is really how this thing came about, I’m all for it. I know darts on the wall don’t always work, but when they do, they do.Story:At the height of the roaring 20’s, an eccentric inventor by the name of Appare causes trouble in his little town in Japan before deciding that instead of staying in a place that doesn’t appreciate his push of progress, he will take his invention and his tools across the Pacific Ocean and go to...America where stuff like that is both commonplace and encouraged given the technological advancements in the country. Dragging alongside a poor man named Kosame who only wanted to keep the poor boy safe, the two of them enter that grand trans-continental race starting for a shot at the prize money. And for Kosame, a chance to get back home.So that’s the framing device for the anime, and what we have here is definitely a trans-continental race that takes up a greater majority of the series once the setup’s out of the way. So there’s no funny business, is there? Well… Appare-Ranman has something of a mixed identity. It definitely feels like the creators wanted to do a racing/car anime. But at the same time, it also seems like they really wanted to do a western with gunslingers, shootouts, gun-fu, and the like. As a result, the story bounces back and forth between both of these storylines, crossing over a couple times only to transition the racing parts to the western parts and vice versa. While it’s not bad, it’s definitely not what I expected in this show, although given what our cast list is, this was almost assuredly the expected result.Despite that, the execution of this mixed identity was surprisingly well-made, especially given the fact that the show managed to also provide decent character arcs for most if not all of our main cast members, and managed to keep the tempo of the series going till the very end. An energy that gives the series a satisfying result due to the tension and escalating moments that keep ramping up as the western half of the show starts to encroach more and more onto the series. A big part of this as well comes from the historical aspect of the show, as 1920’s America is at the heart of the show’s story. The ugly side of this developed country from the misogyny (which isn’t an America-exclusive thing, mind you), to the treatment of its natives and other races adds another bit of spice to this already volatile mix of a show, which again, is an aspect I neither expected, yet is something I greatly appreciate.My only qualm with all of this comes with the show’s ending because the show kinda feels like it forgot to give a proper ending to the whole thing. Things just kind of end, and it’s a stain on an otherwise really fun and surprisingly well-executed show. I’m not really gonna hold it over the show’s head, but it’s kind of a shame considering the sheer amount of cheese, energy, excitement, tension, and just overall fun the series exudes. Only for the series to drop the ball at the very, very end of the series as an anticlimactic tick to the whole thing.Characters:You ever seen Wacky Races? Think that but with stereotypes as the racers instead of goofy characters.Appare is our kabuki actor-looking protagonist that’s both equal parts eccentric and aloof. Focusing pretty much only on his machines and whatever goal he has a the current time, Appare is interesting if only because he feels more like a robot than a human. His qualities make him less of a protagonist to latch onto, but instead more of an interesting case study to watch as the audience is treated to watching a robot discover feelings for the first time. Personally I think he’s interesting, but gets treated like too much of the Messiah to everything, especially since his only expertise is machines. He’s certainly a good engineer, being able to do literal ‘quick maths’ on the spot, but in the rest of the cast list, there’re definitely other contenders for the spot of ‘main character’ in this show.Kosame is the opposite of Appare, being more grounded and more of a realist who worries about their situation since they’re in a new country who by all sense of the word, are folk that they really shouldn’t be able to communicate with. Semantics aside, Kosame comes into the series as a character who has his own personal struggles and has a fairly satisfying character arc that, though kind of by the numbers, helps add to the series’s overall energy. Which is something that I can’t really complain about because his chemistry with Appare is fun, and he definitely pulls his weight around to become his own character instead of just the dude to reel Appare in.All that being said the cast for the Appare-Ranman is a bunch that each hit different points of stereotypes and have similar character arcs that ‘make sense’ for who they are. Al is the fancy French boy who wants to prove something to Daddy, Jing is the Chinese woman who wants to prove that a woman can do what a man can do, you have the Hispanic brothers who fit the small smart one and the big gentle one tropes respectively, Hototo the Native who wants revenge on a white man, literal Jazz Funk personified, and the brooding white outlaw loner who does things his way and has a dark past. They’re all pretty simple characters with simple character arcs and motivations, but seeing how they mix with each other is where the real fun comes in. Their interactions with each other were way more entertaining than they had any right to be, and after a while, I kind of cared less that they were all stereotypes that served the purpose of easy character writing. Especially as the story pushed them to talk to each other more and more and face similar issues.Aesthetics:P.A. Works seems to have fallen in a bit of a ‘less spendy’ mood lately, as the quality here with Appare-Ranman is about the same as what we got with Irozuku and Fairy Gone, with a few resources allocated elsewhere depending on the project. With Appare-Ranman, the budget seems to have gone towards the backgrounds and animation. The setpieces depicting 1920’s America are honestly really nice, and it’s clear that for the times the cast are in cities, there was effort to show off the kind of modern living that was available at the time. And by contrast, what the midwest looked like as a result of Manifest Destiny, showing off a lot of western-inspired towns that really makes me think that there were people involved that really wanted to make a Western show instead of a racing one.And that shows with the animation as there are a lot, and I mean a surprising amount of gunfight scenes that show off a lot of dynamic action and CQC combat among the combatants. It’s something I never expected in the series, and I’m pleasantly surprised that they went that route considering this was supposed to be a RACING anime. Speaking of the racing side, the show exclusively uses 3-D modelling in order to show off the various vehicles in the series, which honestly works for the show if only because the models flush well into the overall look of the series, and it’s not a glaringly obvious thing that looks out of place.Mia REGINA’s “I got it!” is a high energy, big brass song that is way more memorable than it has any right to be. The song just screams ‘fun’ to me, which coupled with the images of gunslinging and car repairs, shows off the series in a spectacular light by being this excitable, big band number that portrays what Appare-Ranman is in a nutshell.By contrast, Shoutarou Morikubo’s “I’m Nobody” is a more acoustic song that plays during the literal movie credits that show up at the end of every episode. It’s literally country music, and well, it’s fitting. It’s not my style personally, but it only adds to the sheer amount of ‘America’ that P.A. Works wanted to go for this show when they made it. Which is an effort I appreciate, even if some of that effort went in ways I don’t really agree with.Final Thoughts:I was supposed to finish this one last season, but COVID happened, so unfortunately this show got pushed back a season. (Which ofc a P.A. Works show of all things got pushed back for me, ugh.) That being said, honestly…I really like this one. My history of shitting on P.A. Works shows is nothing new, but honestly, this show was really, really fun. And I’m glad I can put away my distaste for the company’s storytelling directions for one show. (Though I can’t guarantee it for the next one.)That being said, there’re a few notes I can’t fully agree with, and that’s mainly on some of the character designs and the coding that goes along with it. Things like having the only Chinese character know Kung Fu and the Native American wear feathers in their hair make for easy nods to representation, but kind of turn the ‘diversity’ instead into either design or character quirks for each of the racers. Though this is just a minor point of criticism just based on my personal bias. Overall, the cast is still one that I had a blast watching, and Sofia is undoubtedly the best of the bunch. And I lament the treatment of her character the longer the series went on.Honestly, there really isn’t much I can say that’s bad about the series aside from a few minor points, a mixed identity, and a sort of anticlimactic ending. The story is kind of by the numbers, but I can’t really dispute how much enjoyment that I got out of this story, especially with how much I like history, and this really scratches my itch at something that’s not wholly Japanese set in a not Japanese place. I’d recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a fun time, since this show has the correct amount of dumb and serious to make the viewing experience satisfying and fun as a result.Now if only P.A. Works could keep up a streak past one… America where stuff like that is both commonplace and encouraged given the technological advancements in the country. Dragging alongside a poor man named Kosame who only wanted to keep the poor boy safe, the two of them enter that grand trans-continental race starting for a shot at the prize money. And for Kosame, a chance to get back home.So that’s the framing device for the anime, and what we have here is definitely a trans-continental race that takes up a greater majority of the series once the setup’s out of the way.

It’s something I never expected in the series, and I’m pleasantly surprised that they went that route considering this was supposed to be a RACING anime. Speaking of the racing side, the show exclusively uses 3-D modelling in order to show off the various vehicles in the series, which honestly works for the show if only because the models flush well into the overall look of the series, and it’s not a glaringly obvious thing that looks out of place.Mia REGINA’s “I got it!” is a high energy, big brass song that is way more memorable than it has any right to be. The song just screams ‘fun’ to me, which coupled with the images of gunslinging and car repairs, shows off the series in a spectacular light by being this excitable, big band number that portrays what Appare-Ranman is in a nutshell.By contrast, Shoutarou Morikubo’s “I’m Nobody” is a more acoustic song that plays during the literal movie credits that show up at the end of every episode. It’s literally country music, and well, it’s fitting. It’s not my style personally, but it only adds to the sheer amount of ‘America’ that P.A. Works wanted to go for this show when they made it. Which is an effort I appreciate, even if some of that effort went in ways I don’t really agree with.Final Thoughts:I was supposed to finish this one last season, but COVID happened, so unfortunately this show got pushed back a season. (Which ofc a P.A. Works show of all things got pushed back for me, ugh.) That being said, honestly…I really like this one. My history of shitting on P.A. Works shows is nothing new, but honestly, this show was really, really fun. And I’m glad I can put away my distaste for the company’s storytelling directions for one show. (Though I can’t guarantee it for the next one.)That being said, there’re a few notes I can’t fully agree with, and that’s mainly on some of the character designs and the coding that goes along with it. Things like having the only Chinese character know Kung Fu and the Native American wear feathers in their hair make for easy nods to representation, but kind of turn the ‘diversity’ instead into either design or character quirks for each of the racers. Though this is just a minor point of criticism just based on my personal bias. Overall, the cast is still one that I had a blast watching, and Sofia is undoubtedly the best of the bunch. And I lament the treatment of her character the longer the series went on.Honestly, there really isn’t much I can say that’s bad about the series aside from a few minor points, a mixed identity, and a sort of anticlimactic ending. The story is kind of by the numbers, but I can’t really dispute how much enjoyment that I got out of this story, especially with how much I like history, and this really scratches my itch at something that’s not wholly Japanese set in a not Japanese place. I’d recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a fun time, since this show has the correct amount of dumb and serious to make the viewing experience satisfying and fun as a result.Now if only P.A. Works could keep up a streak past one…', ""Appare Ranman is probably one of the greatest anime, ever!! This anime was not what I expected at first, and it's greatness blew my mind! Every single character is so loveable (except that Gil the Butcher), and the art and animation is purely amazing!!! The story itself is great, and the Intro's definitely the part of this series that's gonna be stuck in my head for a loooong time. Some of the parts of the story don't really stick together though, and there are some flaws in each character's personalities, which annoyed me from time to time. I'm really gonna miss this anime though, and...can't wait for the next season (if there'll be one, which there definitely should)!!!!! can't wait for the next season (if there'll be one, which there definitely should)!!!!!"", ""Do you want to watch an anime adoptation of Fast and the Furious? Just kdding! But here i'll introduce you a somewhat peculiar anime about steampunk meets samurai meets cowboy meets weird hair MC. The story starts with our MC Appare, a very genius 19 years old boy when it comes to machine. He builds his own machinery such as steam boats and other invention but in his country that's not something acknowledgable for them because they are too old fashioned and still stuck in the past. He decided to go for an adventurer and prove to the world that his...creation. To do this He must join a competition of racing with his companion but this race is not an ordinary race. It is a race of life and death and all of the participants here have their own reason why they must win the race. As for the artstyle, damn, the animation is good and fluent and check out the manga! The artsyle really is beautiful. As you can see the character design in this anime is quite unique so it's a plus points for me. As for the sounds i really love the OP and ED and all of the seiyuus are really great. One of my favorite seiyuu is here, Amamiya Sora, who played as Jing ( the chinese hot girl). I really love all of the cast, no one is boring or dull and even the season 1 have only 11 episodes you'll get attached with all of them because they did a great job of developing all the characters within these 11 episodes that's a good job.

The major problem for me, was in the end when the subplot becomes a major one and the race was left aside for no reason at all. It is a good story, well written, but has problems with what do they want to focus, becoming something more related to action than the race itself (7/10)Art: The aesthetic of the characters and the world inserted into the story is very unique and pleasant. They surely take much time on this to be something to be memorable. I...remember when I was studying Creative Writing in college and one of the assets was how giving a visual style that were unique, could drag more attention to your story even if your story wasn't so good, and the anime follows that rule (8/10)Sound: Don't have much to say about it, because it very generic and doesn't add to much to determinate scene that maybe should be more emphatic with a proper sound design and editing. It was fair because the visual were the part that they attached to (6/10)Character: The protagonists of the story had a very good design but not so much of a good background to follow it. Kosame fails to this rule because he was the best written character and his arc of understanding what is the most important thing for him and his path of the warrior had a good piece of write, but it was also generic and cliché. The major problem with the characters was that had no difference between them and the extras, beside the visual: they could be part on that history as well, but doesn't fit because they weren't aesthetic enough (7/10)Enjoyment: The enjoyment of the anime was good in the first half when they focused the action on the races and the competition itself but as soon they started to follow the subplot of Gil, started to turn into a piece of generic situation and action. I mean, do they really needed an antagonist in this series, besides all the situation they been through? Who knows (6/10)Overall: This is a good piece of anime to see expecting nothing about it. They had the chance to make a japanese version of Wacky Races but couldn't because of that subplot involving Gil.

Both in the characters being simple, but at the same time with their charisma, added to a fairly well elaborated story and set at all times. A very polished visual posture and a catchy and convenient Opening for this show leave great feelings of it. So I think that in general terms this adaptation has a job that is quite subtle, without being too pretentious or commercial, but...if you give it a chance you will surely not regret it and it is fun enough to keep the viewer glued to the screen.Now if I had to name a program defect I lean towards the issue of the format and the lack of a certain number of more chapters, to give an even more epic ending. I feel that from what happened with Kosame for chapter 8/9, until the end of his broadcast of the program, events tend to have a higher pace and does not leave room for some specific issues such as the suffering and growth of Appare e on The whole race itself, which really leaves a little flavor in this sense, being very summarized in this end.En español:General: 7,9La verdad Appare-Ranman me parecido toda una revelación.Llegue aquí por la expectativa de las carreras y me termino quedando conforme con mucho mas de la obra en si, que justamente esta  temática.

Por lo que considero que en líneas generales este adaptación tiene un trabajo siendo bastante sutil, sin ser demasiado pretenciosa o comercial  pero que si le das una oportunidad seguramente no te arrepientas y es lo suficiente divertida para mantener al espectador pegado a la pantalla.Ahora si tuviera que nombrar algún defecto de programa me inclino por el tema del formato y la falta de una cierta cantidad mas de capítulos, para dar lugar aun final mas épico aun. Siento que desde lo que sucedió con Kosame por el capitulo 8/9, hasta el final de su emisión del programa, los sucesos tienden a tener un ritmo mas elevado y no deja lugar hacia algunos temas puntuales como el sufrimiento y crecimiento de Appare e sobre todo la carrera en si, que realmente deja un sabor a poco en este sentido siendo en este final muy resumida. if you give it a chance you will surely not regret it and it is fun enough to keep the viewer glued to the screen.Now if I had to name a program defect I lean towards the issue of the format and the lack of a certain number of more chapters, to give an even more epic ending.

Trying to escape the consequences of his actions, he & his retainer Kosame find themselves on the other side of the Atlantic, just in time to catch a cross-country race. Since the prize money would easily get them back to Japan, Appare enters them in the race (converting his steam-boat into a proto-hybrid car).I will say...that this series does suffer from something I\'ve classified \'The 2/3rds bait & switch\' (as seen in Carole & Tuesday), where a premise is established, characters are introduced & stakes are laid out. Then after the half-way point, an element (previously hinted at/glimpsed only) enters the story becomes the sole focus of the story/characters. This is a very specific personal nitpick, so your mileage may vary whether it affects your enjoyment of the series.In all honesty, had the series not swerved away from the actual race so hard (or at least had the villain be characterised a little more ... comedically evil & less war crimesy) I probably would\'ve placed it much earlier in this list, because on every other front, this is a triumph of a story & I think we need to do more to support anime that isn\'t just a glorified commercial for the source material. that this series does suffer from something I\'ve classified \'The 2/3rds bait & switch\' (as seen in Carole & Tuesday), where a premise is established, characters are introduced & stakes are laid out.

Yes, the studio behind Canaan, Another, Charlotte and some less impressive works like Fairy Gone. Still, they\'re a studio that generally does pretty well as far as I\'m concerned. I mean, the weakest anime I\'ve seen them produce was still average.Story:Our tale is set in a fictitious version of the Meiji era, so around 1870s since it seems to be pretty early on. In this time, there\'s an eccentric young inventor named Appare. He gets into some trouble at home and sets sail in a steam boat where he\'s pursued by the young...samurai, Kosame. This results in the pair being propelled forward and going all the way to the United States where they eventually decide to take place in a cross continent race called the Trans-America Wild race because Kosame wants the prize money to return to Japan and Appare just wants to tinker with cars.The whole narrative is a balancing act since it\'s largely more light-hearted and comedic but it does bring up some pretty serious things. And it\'s one that\'s actually executed pretty well. They basically take the route of letting the darker elements be very subtle and mainly conveyed through insinuation in order to maintain the light-hearted aesthetic. It also helps that nothing too bad happens to any of the major characters. It is refreshing to see a work that can manage to maintain its light-hearted aesthetic while also having some content that delves into more serious territory. Especially given how many things I\'ve seen fail at it.The biggest issue with the series has to be that they try to do a bit too much with the time they have. There are a lot of plot elements and flashback that aren\'t really taken advantage of and are generally under-developed. Like, the stuff with the Thousand Three is barely touched on given how much of the plot it helps drive. It\'s also a bit bizarre that the series starts around the end of episode five and then goes back to the beginning. It\'s one of those ""Yes, that\'s me. Wanna know how I got into this situation?"" openings but with no apparent reason for it.With that said, the series is charming and entertaining. The whole idea of the eccentric genius and his more grounded companion isn\'t anything new, but this series does put its own spin on it and it uses the concept very well. I also do think the comedic elements are well done. Particularly the jokes based off of major cultural differences.Characters:The major characters in this have a surprising amount of complexity. They have various motivations for what they\'re doing. They have little bits of back story flavour. Which does make them more relatable and likeable. The big exception is the antagonist who has this vague ""might makes right"" philosophy and is just kind of evil for the evils. There are a lot of good interactions and dynamics as well. The dynamic with TJ and Dylan is really good, for example. So is the relationship with Appare, Kosame & Hototo. Nice of them to use an actual Native American name for their Native character. Although I admittedly don\'t know enough about the Hopi to know if he\'s portrayed accurately in other ways.Art:The biggest issue with the art is that it has the shounen style character designs with bizarre hair styles and other design elements that just look odd. Appare\'s hair, the thing TJ wears over his eyes, also his hair. There are quite a few. And, when it comes to certain characters, these over the top design elements could be seen as mildly racist. I actually wouldn\'t go that far in this case, but I can sort of see why some other people might.Sound:The acting is well done. Hanae Natsuki, Yamashita Seiichirou, Yuuki Aoi, Amamiya Sora and the other actors all give strong performances. I\'m not completely sold on Evan Call\'s music for the series but it works fine, I guess. I think my big issue with it is that it\'s very modern but the anime is set over a hundred years ago and I kind of prefer for historical works, like this one, to base their music around the time period.Ho-yay:There is some stuff that comes across as a bit gay. Like, towards the end Kosame and Appare develop a dynamic that comes across the same way Holmes and Watson do in their more ho-yay moments.Areas of Improvement:1. The music should be more suited to the time period. Modern day hip hop is just weird in that context.2. The series could benefit from a little more time on the background of the Thousand Three and some of the other under-developed elements. Maybe this should have been fifteen episodes. Maybe it should have spent less time recapping the previous episodes. Either way, it could have managed its time a bit better.3. Just start at the beginning.

I\'m going to give it a solid 8/10.', ""i enjoyed appare ranman a lotyou can say that it isn't the most perfect anime or the most relatable,but if you watch it in the way you are supposed to watch then it is a great showin my opinion the characters are probably the best aspect of the show,each character has a vibrant and unique design but what stands out the most is their personalities.each character felt like a potential MC for me.tbh this show was a solid 8.5 with me,but due to the lack of an actual score like that,im gonna rate it a 9 cause the word great sounds closer to what i...think this anime isthe story isn't as solid as the shows we have now and it may be short.but i can understand,i mean after all a race anime doesn't have many possible arcs if its bound to the laws of reality.but this show makes you forget about the race and you just cant take your eyes off of the characters.tho this show was able to show a lot of emotions in the span of just 13 eps . which in my perspective is a pretty big thing to pull offit gave of a lot of various vibes from several animethe american setting gave me the jojo[stellballrun] vibesappare gave me a lot of senku vibesand probably a lot morethe opening is also a great op.it was able to show what type of show it was just by the jumpy music and animationthe character i really liked were tj and gil.even if they were given like almost non existent backstories,just their interactions,designs and personality do the job perfectlyonce again.this isn't an anime with a specific message towards the watchers and its a really enjoyable show think this anime isthe story isn't as solid as the shows we have now and it may be short.but i can understand,i mean after all a race anime doesn't have many possible arcs if its bound to the laws of reality.but this show makes you forget about the race and you just cant take your eyes off of the characters.tho this show was able to show a lot of emotions in the span of just 13 eps . which in my perspective is a pretty big thing to pull offit gave of a lot of various vibes from several animethe american setting gave me the jojo[stellballrun] vibesappare gave me a lot of senku vibesand probably a lot morethe opening is also a great op.it was able to show what type of show it was just by the jumpy music and animationthe character i really liked were tj and gil.even if they were given like almost non existent backstories,just their interactions,designs and personality do the job perfectlyonce again.this isn't an anime with a specific message towards the watchers and its a really enjoyable show"", ""Buckle up for a wild ride. Appare-Ranman is an anime I've grown to love over time. It slow start was hurtful to witness but when the story gained speed it also get my interest. Lets get this review up to speed!The story is pretty simple and linear yet well written and entertaining. As this follows a dynamic trio and their racing rivals it gets wilder and wilder. The story shift in another gear when we arrive with the big bad boys. Some puzzling pieces fall in place as we find out who or why the race gets slowed down. The bad part is how long...it took to actually get on point but in the end it paid off to watch the whole thing.The character design is done pretty well. Each character has their distinct traits but still fit together as a whole. i had some troubles with accepting Appare's behaviour as it was just plain stupid. However the payoff is that i got to see a nice character development that is not to cheesy but realistic and rewarding.I like how Kosame can be a clown but isn't a laughing stock. He perfectly wields the mysterious aura of being a skilled samurai. This badass is the right wingman and a lovely support.As for the rest of the characters its to be expected that most of them stick to their character design and won't change to much over time. It was fine because the characters weren't annoying or to repetitive.The art was very nice. I missed the waxed shining chrome wheel plate shots but that's forgiven. The calm background made it easy to focus on the character and movement. The action was fluent and the colours were nice and vibrant. Overall a good job and a satisfying atheistic.I enjoyed this goofy story much. There were some spots which could have been better executed but overall it did a great job. The catchy OP is always a banger to listen to and I would gladly see a second season.Do you love samurais, gunslingers and a bit of racing?

That is such a unique sounding idea which is why I watched this anime in the first place.Story: 6/10The story is primarily about the Japanese duo, Appare and Kosame, building a car to win ""Trans-America Wild Race"" and win the prize money. They meet friends/rivals that are all unique in their own personality and also different part of the world. When this series is about the meeting and competing with the other competitors is where this series shines the most. The racing, the planning and building for and during the race...is the most exciting moments. However, this is only for the first 8 episodes and sadly the last 5 episodes completely forget about the racing for some generic bad guy they got to beat. It\'s truly a shame as the original and unique concept is tossed out.Art: 7/10The character designs are really nice, the 19th century America looks nice and the cars are all visually vibrant. There are some points where the animation can feel odd, especially near the end but for the most part its pretty good, albeit not going to stun you but its satisfactory.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is pretty good but ain\'t going to make you want to search it on youtube or anything. The openings and endings are pretty awesome though and really fit the era this series is set in.Character: 7/10Every character has their own quirks and struggles. Some are over the top and some are more down to Earth. Our main leads also have some pretty strong character development with some supporting characters, Hototo and Jing, also getting some character arcs. All of them are lovable characters and none of them are hatable, except for the dumb villain group that appear near the end.Enjoyment: 7/10I enjoyed the series and definitely glad I\'ve watched it. Just wished the whole series just focused on the racing rather than the dumb villain group garbage. is the most exciting moments.

Swords pistols and no money, what could possibly go wrong? Well a whole lot while travelling through America they live all kinds of stuff gain friends and overcome difficutys.Admitted it might not be worth a 10 because it still have some flaws here and there, but as someone who loves this kind of stuff I couldn\'t help but encourage these storys with my good vote. an engineer and a samurai during the wild west period.

I'm absolutely in love with the eccentric character and car designs.  Music was great.  I don't necessarily remember any standout tracks from the soundtrack, but they did their job in establishing a decent 1920s-esque vibe, even though historically it can be a little confusing as to when this Appare-Ranman actually takes place when you juxtapose the racing scene against the outlaw environment the show takes place in.This is a story that takes its drama seriously, but takes its historical accuracy less-so, and that's totally fine with me.  All...7 of our main protagonists get their fair share of character development, even in this short 13 episode package, and by the end, I am convinced by the bond that they share.2020 has been a tough year, especially for this anime since it got delayed, but do give this show a watch! 9/10! 7 of our main protagonists get their fair share of character development, even in this short 13 episode package, and by the end, I am convinced by the bond that they share.2020 has been a tough year, especially for this anime since it got delayed, but do give this show a watch! 9/10!"", 'Appare Ranman centers around a cross country car race, and it generally relishes in its own over-the-top silliness. The characters and the cars that they drive are all presented in day-glow colors, and their antics are overwhelmingly absurd. This is not a realistic series at all.The working relationship between the three lead main characters is a bit contrived, especially in the early episodes. I honestly found it hard to believe that they would stick together long enough to eventually race together. I also found the tech savant to be difficult to warm up to, but this is balanced by how likeable the samurai character was.With...the short run time, the biggest problem was the villian. They only start antagonizing the cast directly in the last four episodes, and their scheming is slightly orthogonal to the thrust of the cross country car race. This means that that they felt more like a random obstacle rather than something that would bring the story together at a climax.The biggest strength of Appare-Ranman is the strong supporting cast of characters (these characters wear flamboyant outfits that run the gamut from ""cool"" to ""what?"" to ""oh no"").  Each of the racers is decently well developed given the constraints of a single cour series. They played off of each other surprisingly well and helped invigorate the proportionally high number of breather episodes.Animation and production values are extremely appealing.

Appare is probably one of the coolest designs I\'ve seen. The story is fun and action packed, even though it\'s not exactly realistic (especially for a ""historical"" anime lol). My only issue is that some moments were a bit lack luster, and some characters seemed very weak compared to others. Appare, TJ, Dylan, and even Kosame were so fleshed out and unique and had some badass moments, but then the females (Xialian and Sophia) just seemed bland and kinda just there to have some...female characters...The voice acting was great and the cast all did an amazing job!

While at the outset, it pitches itself as fundamentally a racing story; the development of the car, the establishment of rivalries between the competitors, even the early stages of the race, all play out pretty impressively. While it took a couple more episodes than I would have liked for it to really capture me, once it did, I was excited to see the race play out. As a big fan of Formula 1, a proper show about motor racing sounded great.Which is why I find it a shame that,...right as the series draws to a close, it loses its way a bit, and turns from a unique show about racing rivalries and teambuilding into another shounen action show. To give it its due credit, it's an excellent example of those; the fighting we see is energetic, and the characters have distinct styles, just like their distinct cars. But in shifting itself to this dramatic, action-packed finale, it forgets that it was a show about racing.So, after all of the excitement and development starting out the race, the show stumbles across the finish line having failed to really fulfil the thing it pitched itself as. What it really was, to be clear, was very good; I really did enjoy this show. But I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I think about the potential it wasted to tell a much more unique story in the process. right as the series draws to a close, it loses its way a bit, and turns from a unique show about racing rivalries and teambuilding into another shounen action show.

I\'ll be the first to admit that I\'ve always had a soft spot for anime taking place during the late 19th to early 20th century and since those don\'t often come around I was immediately intrigued by this one. Although historical accuracy isn\'t precisely a strong point of the series the setting does contrast well with the vibrant characters and over-the-top premise. With it\'s striking character designs, incredible fight choreography and soundtrack by none other than Evan Call himself this show is a wild ride to say the least.The story...is very much driven forward by the characters and the show spends the first 4 episodes setting up stakes for several major characters showing us why they want to win the race. Appare wants to win to prove to everyone that he can build a faster car than anyone else, Jing wants to prove to the world that she can be a racer despite being a woman and Kosame wants the money so he can go home to Japan and so on. Overall those episodes do a good job of introducing the characters and setting up the stakes but they are undeniably slow and not the most entertaining. However when the show starts to pick up it REALLY picks up. Kosame and Hototo\'s backstories constantly being retold to us in the form of the same flashbacks gets old after a while and the plot itself never comes across as spectacularly creative in itself unlike the characters and setting. I am also aware some people were unhappy with the direction the plot didn\'t stay centered around the race but I have to disagree with that and say that I really liked the turn it took.I believe the ending was satisfying enough, most of the major characters in the rather large cast had their arcs resolved during the final fight which was an incredible showdown and one of the best fights in anime that I\'ve seen in a long time.  Personally I enjoy seeing what actually happens to all the characters in a show after the story has concluded and since most of them really didn\'t get anything in that regard I was mildly disappointed but it was still better than what P.A did in Angel Beats! so I really shouldn\'t complain.The character designs are all vibrant and unique from the poshness of Sofia and Al to the pure crazy that is TJ to whatever the hell Appare\'s design is. Despite many of them being out of place and ridiculous it still works very well. The characters are one thing but what about the vehicles? Considering how big a role the cars play in this show you would expect them to be well designed and they absolutely are. Each of them radiates character and you could easily tell which vehicle belongs to which character without any previous knowledge just by looking at it. Overall the art of the show is truly outstanding which is just what I\'ve come to expect from a P.A works anime originalEvan Call stands at the very peak of soundtrack composition and he has once again outdone himself with the music in ""Appare Ranman!"". Everything from lovely strings to high tension standoff music straight out of a western movie to jazz-rap somehow all fit together perfectly in this spectacular OST.""Appare Ranman!"" overall is a good anime with great music, fights, designs and setting. As for the lack of realism... well it is what it is. Why can Kosame slice bullets with his katana? Why can TJ dodge a bullet fired at point-blank range? How does Appare manage to fly by simply adding more power to his engine? Because it\'s fucking cool that\'s why and that\'s very much the attitude of the show.

True, with P.A. Works there tends to be a mixed bag on the shows that they have worked on. Beautiful animation,good to fantastic storytelling, characters that you can invest in, music(not so much). Appare-Ranman! is not a bad anime by any design, do I wish it was better in certain aspects instead of it turning into an episode of twists and turns trying to find the big bad? Yes, of course. Given the time period that this anime is set in, I can appreciate the realism of how characters of different backgrounds were treated...in living in America. No, this is not me clapping and applauding racism, sexism, or anything of the sort. I would rather have something be a bit accurate, than have nothing at all.  Especially, when it comes to two supporting characters based on both their ethnicity and gender. Look, I can get that we are in a different time but if we pay attention to history we would often need to understand the time period of it. To see and sit there to understand a different perspective. While, I am not done with this anime, I can honestly sit and give this anime a solid. 7.5/10 for the efforts it brings to the table.UPDATE:I have fully finished with this anime and I feel as if it jumped the shark around the latter part of episode six into the ending of the full show. I have had to drop my rating down from a 7.5 to a 7 out of ten. This is the type of anime that should have worked better as a 24 episodes type of situation instead of just thirteen episodes. You get good glimpses of character backstories, and not everyone seems fully fleshed out. Some characters who should be more important, do not get the proper screen time or care to be presented in that manner. The problem was the issue of an antagonist becoming the biggest talking point all of a sudden. Not in the best way to go about and making a show seem good for what it is. This is one of the rare points where a P.A. Works anime should have done more to really entice their audience, with the hook. The premise of this show in the beginning was great, but in the end it felt like there was too much with not enough care at the end.

Hence I\'ve only seen 3 full episodes of it, but three I think is enough to point out some of the most glaring flaws with this show:[ Historical Inspiration / Accuracy ]Alright.So if a western produced show or movie airs, it HAS to be historically accurate and if not, then it gets pointed out even if it doesn\'t bear the ""historical"" label. But this show gets away with it, because what? Because it was produced in the...east?With it being labelled as ""historical"" and not even as ""historical fantasy"", what right does it have to be this blatantly historically inaccurate without it getting pointed out?One look at the character designs could tell you this much.The most grievous and most obvious offense is that Sophia\'s dress isn\'t so much as ankle length... which is quite frankly ridiculous because she doesn\'t exactly require it to be shorter for absolutely any reason thus far. And all it would have taken to not make that mistake is google late 19th century fashion. Oh, and a quick google brought up images of late 19th century fashion, none of which had the kinds of sleeve\'s Sophia\'s dress had.Heck, I can tell that Jing and Hototo are likely not dressed aptly either. The male cast doesn\'t even to be wearing clothes vaguely inspired by the 19th century.Also, spoiler alert... but I\'m pretty sure they got the cars wrong too... you know, in a car racing anime.Also, I DO see a Trans America car race mentioned on google, but it starts from the late 20th century onward NOT the 19th. Heck, TV tropes even seems to point out the cars appear to look more early 20th century than late 19th century.Next time creators want to slap ""historical"" onto their show or movie, please at least consult the first two pages of a google search. -_- An alternative way of doing this would have been to instead call it ""historical fantasy"" or ""historically-inspired"" and then no one would have expectations of historical accuracy from it. And, considering we expect historical accuracy in western movies and shows that aren\'t even labelled ""historical"", we SHOULD expect the same from easter movies and shows.Also, how is it that if the west does it it\'s ""Cultural Appropriation"" but if anime does it, it gets away with it?[ Characters ]Kind of boring, actually. Normally it\'s the characters, no matter how simple or complex, that drive me to watch a show... but while at least Jing has struggles - can\'t say the same for our rebel steam boyo, he\'s just a douche as far as I\'m concerned, so far - and so does our honourable swordsman character, along with Hototo, that\'s about it. They don\'t have much in the way of personality that would make us care asides from the fact that in America they\'re all minority groups, but that\'s not enough in my opinion.Did I mention Appare is a little so-and-so? Because he is and it\'s not even in a fun way. I just really feel for Kosame.Maybe I\'d like them more later on, but characters should really be a bit more enjoyable right from the get-go than this. At least in Black Clover, though Asta was obnoxious, Yuno\'s sass nicely balanced it out.---On the plus side, the opening and endings aren\'t bad... the soundtrack is actually pretty nice. And hey, the art style does look unique. And it\'s a fairly unique concept far as I\'m concerned.

The male cast doesn\'t even to be wearing clothes vaguely inspired by the 19th century.Also, spoiler alert... but I\'m pretty sure they got the cars wrong too... you know, in a car racing anime.Also, I DO see a Trans America car race mentioned on google, but it starts from the late 20th century onward NOT the 19th. Heck, TV tropes even seems to point out the cars appear to look more early 20th century than late 19th century.Next time creators want to slap ""historical"" onto their show or movie, please at least consult the first two pages of a google search. -_- An alternative way of doing this would have been to instead call it ""historical fantasy"" or ""historically-inspired"" and then no one would have expectations of historical accuracy from it. And, considering we expect historical accuracy in western movies and shows that aren\'t even labelled ""historical"", we SHOULD expect the same from easter movies and shows.Also, how is it that if the west does it it\'s ""Cultural Appropriation"" but if anime does it, it gets away with it?[ Characters ]Kind of boring, actually. Normally it\'s the characters, no matter how simple or complex, that drive me to watch a show... but while at least Jing has struggles - can\'t say the same for our rebel steam boyo, he\'s just a douche as far as I\'m concerned, so far - and so does our honourable swordsman character, along with Hototo, that\'s about it. They don\'t have much in the way of personality that would make us care asides from the fact that in America they\'re all minority groups, but that\'s not enough in my opinion.Did I mention Appare is a little so-and-so? Because he is and it\'s not even in a fun way. I just really feel for Kosame.Maybe I\'d like them more later on, but characters should really be a bit more enjoyable right from the get-go than this. At least in Black Clover, though Asta was obnoxious, Yuno\'s sass nicely balanced it out.---On the plus side, the opening and endings aren\'t bad... the soundtrack is actually pretty nice. And hey, the art style does look unique. And it\'s a fairly unique concept far as I\'m concerned.

And I'm not american/english, lol.The story is one of the first of its kind: people transformated in machine, like Astro Boy before and Kyashan after.Shotaro Ishinomori made out, with an american-like style, a perfect mix of action an drama, in fact in the anime there is more space for feelings and the story isn't centered only on the fight against Black Ghost.At first, characters weren't well delineated, but they evolved with the art and the flow of the time.Ishinomori, who was a cinematography fan,  put in this work a lot of movie quotes (ex. Jet Link's...introduction, an evident quote from &quot;West Side Story&quot;).Story9 people, kidnapped from and evil organization, the Black Ghost, and trasformed in nine cyborgs, rebelled themselves and escaped at the time of freedom.Don't be afraid if you don't like old anime/manga, because cyborg 009 has a never old story: simple and linear, it can satisfied everybody.There are serious themes too, like the sad past which everyone have lived or the intolerance to be a cyborg.There is a bit of romance in it too, so that's a bit of a plus.I give to this: 7/10Art:Well, the art is not the best, even because it's from early 60s, and when a japanese drawed a comics there was a lot of american influence, so it seems be a cartoon than a manga. It improved really much in the final numbers of the manga, and was get the old style back for doing 2001 anime: this was a further improve for the style, but sometimes it looks to be too approssimative.I give to this: 6/10Sound:There aren't characters song, but only a main theme which is put under a fight scene, or when all the cyborgs appear.In my humble opinion, I didn't hear any other OST under the episodes, so this is one of the defectes.2001's Openings and Endings are awesome and they fill perfectly with the story.I give to this: 7/10Characters:At the first characters weren't really definieded (like I said before), they had a summary past which entroduced them, but in the anime theirs have an important role, in fact a lot  of episodes are centered about their normal life.In this anime there are a main cast who appear in every episode, and some figurehead, but no one is unsuitable or boring.I think there aren't hatable characters: maybe 009, for his depressive and sad actitude, or only because he is the hero of the day.They will be well knowed at the end of the serie, from their past or their habits, but no one evolve in the flow of the serie, perhaps this an other fail from Cyborg.I give to this: 8/10This anime is one Ishinomori-sensei's masterpiece, it is enjoyable to watch and the story involve the viewer at the point to say &quot;Oh my God, I MUST KNOW.&quot;, there are a lot of black hole because of the early death of the sensei, who was working on the 2001 serie when he is dead, but this doesn't weaken the beautifulness of this work.Sorry if my review can't make full appreciate Cyborg 009, but for believe you must see ! :3I want to put a 10/10, but I can't, I should be objective, lol.So this is an other 8/10. introduction, an evident quote from &quot;West Side Story&quot;).Story9 people, kidnapped from and evil organization, the Black Ghost, and trasformed in nine cyborgs, rebelled themselves and escaped at the time of freedom.Don't be afraid if you don't like old anime/manga, because cyborg 009 has a never old story: simple and linear, it can satisfied everybody.There are serious themes too, like the sad past which everyone have lived or the intolerance to be a cyborg.There is a bit of romance in it too, so that's a bit of a plus.I give to this: 7/10Art:Well, the art is not the best, even because it's from early 60s, and when a japanese drawed a comics there was a lot of american influence, so it seems be a cartoon than a manga.

English version also sometimes changes lines completely. For example let\'s take the last scene in episode 21 [SPOILER FREE]: in the original version couple people of the cyborg group hear unfortunate news and 009 ponders...to himself ""what did we fight for?"", then after a slow fade transition the scene shows some statues under a lighting storm to set up the next ""adventure"", if you can call it that. The English version made me cringe; The same scene goes 009 saying ""Dr. Ross gave us an adventure we\'ll never forget. Meanwhile--"" and then he goes on and on narrating about the statues and setting up the next ark when the original let the pictures talk for themselves. Changes like this are all over the series and make the characters way too undeviating.What I mean to say is: watch the original version! The characters are more believable with their voice acting and the dialogue makes a lot more sense. But if you watch this with English subtitles, I\'m almost positive, that you\'ll end up with the subtitles that are straight copied from the English audio. If you don\'t know Japanese and can\'t spot the differences in the general dialogue, then at least you\'ll notice the non-existing dialogue that according to the subtitles is taking place.The sound design has become iconic to myself and if any of those sounds used in this show are used in any other installments, I will notice. Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier also has one of the best soundtracks I\'ve come across and I even ended up purchasing the two albums.I\'ve watched this series 3 ½ times and gotta say, though most likely the suitable demographic is children, this series still holds a special place in my heart.

Not back in 1979 when the original was broadcast, but back when Cartoon Network was still broadcasting Toonami. I remember seeing an episode of this program on Toonami. I don't remember when, but I know it was when Toonami was still airing.But enough about old memories. Cyborg 009 is the anime for you if you are into retro stuff. You know back in the 70s or 80s. The story is about nine people who were transformed into cyborgs by the evil Black Ghost. And now they are rebelling against him. The characters all seem sort of cartoonist esspeacially 007....The one thing that angers me is that 003 dosen't really do any fighting. All she does is locate the enemies standing and the guys just take it from there. I feel like this anime is sort of sexist because of how they make the main female character useless. That's one negative spot about this show.The music is a different story. It's like the best music I've ever heard in my life. It's just the coolest techno music in anime history.So this anime about average. Love it. Hate it. Dosen't matter to me. The one thing that angers me is that 003 dosen't really do any fighting.

It also has some of the best stand-alone episodes such as ""Frozen time"" but this is also mixed with filler. The music and art designs are some of my favourites, especially when the cartoony art contrasts with the dark themes. Each character has a unique backstory and are based from around the world. Some characters are serious while others are usually comedy relief (they can be serious and reliable when called upon) so there is a good variety. This anime has it all: heroism, rebellion, mystery, a great story and...fight scenes. fight scenes.', 'I don’t understand why people focus on small things like it’s a show for adults or kids, there are some peeps who keep their kid side even though they’re older. This is a show that is for everyone as it conveys good messages to lil jimmy\'s and adults (It’s an universal underrated masterpiece ). This show have some crazy adult themes with no sexual content, so It\'s a safe show to watch with the family. What I like is that It\'s a show that is smartly done and both the younger and older peeps can enjoy it.Back in the day saying that you like anime...is like literally a death sentence for your social life, so I had some fun with that stuff for a while until it began slowly but surely to change later on thankfully. And cyborg 009 is a great example of a show that gives output on how great animation can convey special emotions to the audience. It isn\'t mainstream by any means but It stays as a true classic that delivers whenever you watch it.I have many memories with Cyborg 009 as I watched some parts randomly on tv long ass time ago, while being a kid I felt different things at the moment like sorrow, fun, cool heroes, they work as a group complementing each other’s abilities, staying true to themselves, missing their countries, fighting back against evil entities and never giving up when the situation became dire.This is a rare anime that you could watch with anyone be it young or old which is F*king amazing… They talk about disasters, poverty, war, homelessness, greed, culinary, love, family, unity and much more. It didn\'t matter to see blood. I didn’t even feel like it was needed to be shown as we have cyborgs here so you can understand when they’re in pain, the way they convey it through little details is easy to understand and follow. It\'s a smart choice made by animators.This series is really old by today’s standards and I understand that, it may not appeal to you graphically (visually). however, For meIt\'s a timeless series that goes beyond the test of time which is powerful.The cyborg’s as you know have different backgrounds and different personalities so they clash more often with each other on the decision-making side of things, I find it interesting to see the humans side of them which brings up the tension and mindless arguments that make them hate the opposite side without listening nor give a chance to understand situations , find solutions to the matter as an example which is relatable to me. Working with a group of people is always is a hassle and a pain in the ass.They get emotional when they are forced to kill robots, and they sympathies with them despite knowing that it\'s needed to be done for peace even if it\'s painful. Cyborgs 009 and 003 for instance shows it a lot throughout the story.The SAKUGA parts are extremely well done overall whereas you kind of see the small details , the little bits of creativity sprinkled here and there that display an outstanding art that transcends the usual tropes and barriers between animation and some themes in real life. It has one of the best fight choreographies I’ve seen in anime. I wish to see that kind of dedication on the battle genre as it lacks this level of detail.The music is powerful! and what I mean by that is It\'s used carefully. While listening either to the opening, ending or sound tracks. I tend to sing along with it and get hyped up a lot whenever I start anew episode. Additionally, they chose precise moments to use nothing but silence which elevates the emotions & experience altogether. But yeah, the sound design of this show is a great 2nd layer to the animation which despite its antiquity, it still holds the overall atmosphere really well in my eyes. VA’s performance is good for its time, nonetheless it didn’t ruin the experience although I would still welcome a full remaster of the whole show. I still listen to the anime\'s battle Ost’s, the op\'s and ed\'s are fun to listen to, at the same time the action scenes have the best ambiances but also the emotional moments.The main group of characters have a lot of depth to them apart from 2, 006 and 007, although 007 have a solid background story I still find his role is limited in the show to being a comedy relief character and they got forgotten rather quickly where we focus more on cyborg 009.The characters design is a matter of opinion so I don\'t really nitpick too much. I find it good enough, It works well with the shows themes and story.The different cultures displayed throughout the anime is really outstanding as you get to see different cities around the world which had reminded me of Lupin III franchise, every episode after the death of Skull are small arcs,  I find it hella interesting to see every character’s connection to the world through those events. After the incidents with black ghost, they kept visiting countries all over the earth scared that he may get to be revived, searching for clues and solving issues like war and helping humanity as much as they can.Black ghost is like a mixed representation of all human villains which can be interpreted as a lot of entities throughout human history. As he keeps popping up in different shapes and forms Because people are evil by nature, I think that\'s one of the most important view points that came across and stuck with me while viewing this anime.The misuse of robots is a topic that I really love about this show because it may happen in the near future (in real life) that’s why I always feel that it\'s a timeless masterpiece on steroids, I may have had exaggerated a little but personally as a kid back then and as an adult now there\'s different perspectives to catch and dive in with which brings out different meanings to the world and conflicts as a whole, also the deeper side of human emotions materialized by the created cyborgs that initially were human as well, although tempered with by scientists to create emotionless instrument. Adds a lot of substance to the main cast, as a result there\'s a whole package of different personalities that gives the feel of unity. Moreover it\'s a beautiful message to indulge in.In my childhood I looked at it in a simpler way, seeing it like ""super heroes saving the day"", but now I see it as a way to represent our world in the future  like Climate change or lack of application of human rights in some countries, the endless wars that still ravages this planet since humans put foot on it etc...I personally love how they made this show close to home like for an example when they went to Africa where people were fighting for their life to free their countries of tyrants, bad leaders. by contrast when they\'ve gone to an another world with some kind of Aliens looking like children where they tried teaching them on what it means to be a man, stand up for yourself and fight back.If you pick this show though, watch it in Japanese because it\'s just better than the dubs imo. Back in the day the translation wasn’t the same as the original script because they tend to change everything to fit their narrow mind thus making it seem look like dumpster fire. I hated how they’ve done that and thanks to these individuals behind the dubs they fucked up any chance this show had to be successful, they love to censor everything sadly.All in all, This masterpiece will always get negative reviews about its ways of representing things or because it isn’t violent enough or it shouldn’t be recommended to anyone… On the contrary! I believe that This show should be given a chance mainly being an enjoyable ride minding the time it came out of course. But at the end of the day, It\'s great to share the experience I love about anime using this series as an example and many other classics to bring the medium closer to all people.‘It’ll always have a special place in my heart.’ is like literally a death sentence for your social life, so I had some fun with that stuff for a while until it began slowly but surely to change later on thankfully.

As he keeps popping up in different shapes and forms Because people are evil by nature, I think that\'s one of the most important view points that came across and stuck with me while viewing this anime.The misuse of robots is a topic that I really love about this show because it may happen in the near future (in real life) that’s why I always feel that it\'s a timeless masterpiece on steroids, I may have had exaggerated a little but personally as a kid back then and as an adult now there\'s different perspectives to catch and dive in with which brings out different meanings to the world and conflicts as a whole, also the deeper side of human emotions materialized by the created cyborgs that initially were human as well, although tempered with by scientists to create emotionless instrument. Adds a lot of substance to the main cast, as a result there\'s a whole package of different personalities that gives the feel of unity. Moreover it\'s a beautiful message to indulge in.In my childhood I looked at it in a simpler way, seeing it like ""super heroes saving the day"", but now I see it as a way to represent our world in the future  like Climate change or lack of application of human rights in some countries, the endless wars that still ravages this planet since humans put foot on it etc...I personally love how they made this show close to home like for an example when they went to Africa where people were fighting for their life to free their countries of tyrants, bad leaders. by contrast when they\'ve gone to an another world with some kind of Aliens looking like children where they tried teaching them on what it means to be a man, stand up for yourself and fight back.If you pick this show though, watch it in Japanese because it\'s just better than the dubs imo. Back in the day the translation wasn’t the same as the original script because they tend to change everything to fit their narrow mind thus making it seem look like dumpster fire. I hated how they’ve done that and thanks to these individuals behind the dubs they fucked up any chance this show had to be successful, they love to censor everything sadly.All in all, This masterpiece will always get negative reviews about its ways of representing things or because it isn’t violent enough or it shouldn’t be recommended to anyone… On the contrary! I believe that This show should be given a chance mainly being an enjoyable ride minding the time it came out of course. But at the end of the day, It\'s great to share the experience I love about anime using this series as an example and many other classics to bring the medium closer to all people.‘It’ll always have a special place in my heart.’', ""Story 6/10To tell a great superhero story, a great hero needs a great villain to fight, but that's where this show's problem lies.Black Ghost is a great villain; he's ruthless and doesn't even care if his own henchmen get killed. He's also smart and devious which are all great qualities in a villain, but the problem is, despite being the main antagonist, Black Ghost only appears in a handful of episodes leaving all the other episodes just feeling like filler.The cyborgs do fight other villains besides Black Ghost with some cool fight scenes, but the other villains are all just forgettable with nothing...that interesting about them.Characters 6/10While all the cyborgs do have some cool powers (009 having super speed, 006 breathing fire, and 007 being a shape shifter) that doesn't make them great characters.It's not that I don't like any of the MC's, but they just all feel like tokens with 009 being the token leader and 003 being the token girl and 007 being the token comic relief character.It doesn't help that the characters don't have the best chemistry either or demonstrate the best teamwork. Good team members should compliment each other and work together, but whenever there's a fight it's like everyone splits up and does their own thing.Art 5/10The fight scenes are well animated and I do like this 1960's SciFi aesthetic they use for things like the ray guns and giant robots. However, the character designs are another story.There are some characters that look fine like 009 and 003, but then there are other characters like Dr. Gilmore and 007 that just look plain ugly. Gilmore's nose is the size of a watermelon and 007's eyes are way too close together.I understand that this what the characters looked like in the 1968 version, but, in my opinion, they just look ugly.006 is even worse, however. I understand that 006 is Chinese and anime artist like to draw Chinese people with weird looking eyes like Brock from Pokemon, but seriously, what are those things? Those aren't eyeballs! They look more like little mouths!I know it may seem like I'm making a big deal about it, but it's an understood rule of character design that it is extremely important that you get the eyes right because, as they say, the eyes are the windows to the soul.Sound 5/10I don't want to use the word robotic to describe the voice acting, but I does sound like the actors aren't putting much emotion behind their words which really hurts the characters.Also, I can't really explain it, but I feel like there's too much silence in each episode. What I mean is there's too many moments where there are no characters talking and no background music playing or a character is talking, but with no background music. I know that may seem like a nitpick, but I do think it hurt the quality of the show.Overall 6/10I'm glad I watched Cyborg 009, if only because it's such a classic anime in the same way Astro Boy is, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone. If you want to watch some good superhero anime, One Punch Man and My Hero Academia would probably be a better choice. that interesting about them.Characters 6/10While all the cyborgs do have some cool powers (009 having super speed, 006 breathing fire, and 007 being a shape shifter) that doesn't make them great characters.It's not that I don't like any of the MC's, but they just all feel like tokens with 009 being the token leader and 003 being the token girl and 007 being the token comic relief character.It doesn't help that the characters don't have the best chemistry either or demonstrate the best teamwork.

[write more later, dont feel like covering this rn. i liked it doe]the second half of the show post recap ep is more than a little shakier. as i understand it, more of these episodes are based off works from post the initial manga conclusion (that\'d be vol 10 of the tokyopop translations). the works in this half just tend to be... well, sometimes, they\'re great! but there are many times where i was watching and. y\'know. there\'s aliens now. fine. a supercomputer tried to bang francoise. okay. now joe\'s time traveling and a bright blue dog just telepathically beamed the entirety of earth\'s history into g. junior\'s head. i don\'t fucking care anymore man.i get that part of cyborg 009 has always been heavily tied to shotaro ishinomoris fascination with esoterica and the occult, after all, ishinomori only decided 001s powers would be psychokinesis-related only because he knew the russian government was experimenting with psychic powers (look up nina kulagina, i\'m not kidding on that)... take it from someone into that sort of stuff, one doesn\'t pick up on that unless they have an active interest in it. but, 009 becoming the sounding board for this interest, as well as being an episodic series as a whole, is to its own detriment precisely because ishinomori clearly wanted to tell more dramatic stories than he could with the limitations he had. since these stories are episodic, they have to be ended off cleanly, and ishinomori more often than not has a few stock endings which get tiring after a while. with few exceptions, either black ghost did it, the character of the week dies tragically (cause war is bad!) or its just straight up magic that won\'t ever be explained or touched upon again. this last one opens up a whole other can of worms- because characters don\'t really look back and reflect on these events past the episode itself... or even giving a reaction of ""that was weird lol"" like a normal human would, it creates a sense of passivity that pervades the show. characters have things happen to them constantly- rarely is the conflict STARTED by them, and most of the time, even that\'s just jet running off only to get whooped for the twentieth time.the characters are wooden at best, and downright offensive at worst. there\'s no real contrasting views or friction between characters after the first few episodes, which feels strange especially for a group of nine people all from different places, and when there are, there aren\'t any long term consequences. even something basic like ONE character going ""hey, why are you calling me by a number instead of my name? this feels dehumanising"" vs say, one going like ""whoa this is cool... it\'s like a spy movie... it\'s my codename :]"" would go a long way in showing the difference in personality between characters, but then again, in comparison to the original manga, we should be lucky we have the amount of characterisation we do at all. then, there’s francoise’s role as the only woman basically boiling down to ‘mother figure’ or the secondhand embarrassment-inducing “YOUR PHONE LINGING” type soundtrack that plays whenever chang shows up. thank god they changed pyunma\'s appearance at the least.while the anime pares down and collates the stories of 009 in such a way that the average watcher is to get a broad base of what ishinomori did with the series, it is precisely because of that that it replicates the same issues... and the severe dropoff of animation quality in the second half doesn\'t help matters. i regret to say this, especially since i’m coming up on the adaptation of the yomi arc which i heard is supposed to be decent, but i felt like after such a strong start, my time as a watcher was being wasted, and i don\'t know how many more ishinomori-isms (see: being preachy and tragically killing off every side character that could have potential future relevance) i can take. for now, i\'m putting this series on indefinite hold. the park. the first half of the series is pretty tightly told, with a general overarching story about needing to beat black ghost driving the first 18 episodes. all throughout, the driving goal helps thread together some otherwise quite distinct character stories, which gives us the best of both worlds, really- we get to learn more about each character and their individual struggles pre-black ghost, which, when there\'s nine main characters, is a necessity, believe it or not. there are a few stinkers here and there, with that one episode before joe fights scar or the one with the dinosaurs coming to mind, but for the most part the good outweighs the bad. the time spent exploring the characters in this half of the story were very well spent, the tone being generally consistent, grounded and in some ways, heartfelt. in particular, i think reintegrating the vietnam arc as pyunma’s backstory was a very clever move, helping set apart and modernise the work from prior adaptations. i can confidently say i genuinely enjoy the vast majority of the first half of the anime. theres a short lull, and then we return to the mythos arc.

Blood Lad,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11633/Blood_Lad,"['Vampires are overrated these days. The idea of them being in anime series isn\'t a new concept either. In fact, there\'s plenty of them already like Vampire Knight, Shiki, Rosario + Vampire, etc. Most of them involves some sort of strange faithful day event when the vampire gets caught up with a human in their world and then certain twists come that ties them to some sort of relationship. Only this time, it\'s a little a bit different. In Blood Lad, the vampire actually wants to help the human. Rather than treating them as a slave or food, this series takes a twist as our...vampiric friend Vlad Charlie Staz embarks on a journey to restore a human back to their mortal selves after a tragic event. (by tragic, I mean as in getting eaten alive)Blood Lad is an anime adapted series based off the manga of the same name written by Yuuki Kodama. The series takes the vampire theme idea and twists it into a humorous tale. That\'s because our otaku friend Staz has never met a human girl before. So, what happens when a young, pretty, and shy Japanese girl accidentally wonders into his territory? All hell breaks loose. Or rather for Staz, it\'s like the dream of a life time. After all, he\'s never met a human before. More so, Fuyumi Yanagi happens to be a girl with a Japanese background. It\'s a fun journey and one hell of a ride, for both our main characters.For starters, we know that Staz is a vampire but also a boss of sorts at his own territory. He has his own underlings for dirty work. Judging by his appearance, Staz also seems to be unemployed and is literally an otaku with the stuff he has hanging around his room. More interesting factors about his character reveals that despite being a vampire, he doesn\'t seem to have an appetite for human blood. Oddly enough though, he does have a bit of bloodlust towards Fuyumi. This spells out a sort of trouble for Fuyumi because Staz\'s lack of common sense. In fact, we can see that Staz only seems to lust after Fuyumi in the beginning because of her fresh scent of blood and body. Strangely though, his lust disappears after Fuyumi\'s death. But the fact that he still cares enough to help Fuyumi return to her normal life shows his sincerity. It almost seems to be human like for Staz because the lengths he goes to help Fyumi throughout the series despite numerous dangers that puts his own life at risk. Fuyumi on the other hand plays the role more of the eye-candy but also at times encourages Staz to be himself. It\'s an odd relationship between the duo but they sure stand out as entertainment.The other characters plays their part to fulfill the entertainment part as well. We got mad scientists, a witch, and werewolf that adds to the package of this series. Their diversity and abilities adds more flavor to the series that is not only tasty but also spices up some troubles for both Staz and Fuyumi. For instance, there\'s a rivalry between Staz and Wolf beyond just going at each other with fists. Then, there\'s also some sibling trouble for Staz later on that adds even more dangers to himself. It\'s a fun take to this series because Staz has to learn how to adjust without depending on others. It\'s the fact that Fuyumi depends on him this time as Staz learns more about humanity as well as himself.Despite the series having a relevant plot, it usually maintains more of a lighthearted and humorous atmosphere. This is evidenced by the various parodies in the beginning such as the stuff  in Staz\'s room or the way that Fuyumi is killed. Even though she is dead, Fuyumi returns as a cute ghost and her method of death can also be surprisingly amusing. The show also plays on Staz\'s character by portraying him as a character with little knowledge of what\'s really there. For example, there are numerous times when Staz uses ideas he gets from Japanese manga which he reads from rather than common sense. On a more serious note, there\'s some revelations revealed later on that might surprise some viewers.Blood Lad also presents the supernatural relevantly well. Although not as grim as some series such as Shiki, this anime portrays Staz as a vampire with supernatural abilities. This is evidenced in the beginning as he is able to do various things that a normal human cannot. Then, there\'s the other characters too who displays their own sides of supernatural traits such as Wolf and his expertise in the boxing field or Hydrabell with her magic. Needless to say, the series\' characters and setting combines elements of both the real world and the supernatural.Fan service is also an overused word but Blood Lad doesn\'t avoid it. In fact, there\'s plenty of those for both girls and the guys. Fuyumi fulfills the role of fanservice with her body structure as well as being stark naked from the very first episode after her fate. In fact, the way she looks must also been a trigger for Staz\'s bloodlust for her. It doesn\'t stop there either though as she has to depend on Staz in order to remain existent. To do, there\'s the finger sucking along with the baby bottles. Furthermore, she is often dressed in skimpy ways or in lascivious outfits. Even for the female audience, there\'s some service to offer when Staz and Wolf gets into a fight in their outfits. It\'s service for the fans and at times, they do get out of hand.Because the series defies any realism, expect some strange twists as well. It also doesn\'t fit within some vampire themes since Staz is shown to be stronger than the typical vampire with his resistance to certain weaknesses. Fuyumi also seems to play along with her new adjusted life even though she wants to return to her human life. The fact that the duo has gotten used to each other shows how much they value their relationship even if it\'s completely on bizarreness. It\'s what Blood Lad is anyways, a bizarre yet entertaining anime with more than just a love triangle or thirst for vengeance.Visuals wise, Brain Base does an alright job with its elements although some of the characters\' designs looks rather generic. Fuyumi in particular is designed to look busty with girlish traits while Staz is more of the bad boy role. The characters all have some taste of their supernatural traits though whether it\'s a werewolf, vampire, etc. The supernatural world doesn\'t look as grim or too unusual compare to our own. On the other side, some of the monsters are portrayed as looking dangerous. The production values are decent though with style. Staz\'s sunglasses, Liz\'s headgear, and Wolf\'s silver hair are reflection of this in a humorous way.The soundtrack for Blood Lad is above par. The OP song ""ViViD"" by May\'n has a rocky style with its presentation. Then, there\'s the action and comedy scenes where music matches its style. True to its premise, Blood Lad also has its occasionally eerie-like soundtrack playing during some of the more scenes fitting within this vampiric theme series. Staz\'s VA Ryota Osaka (Valvrave the Liberator: Haruto, Rozen Maiden: Jun, Hataraku Maou-sama: Sadao) recently began to play parts relating to young teenagers whose life is changed dramatically. Thus expect his talent to come in this series as well in the shoes of our vampire. On the other hand, Fuyumi\'s shy voice reflects her character in the new situation she is in.Overall, Blood Lad is a very fun series to watch and enjoy. To me, it shouldn\'t be taken serious despite its premise. In fact, there are many moments in this series where the fights and moments are portrayed as parody rather than anything too serious. However, Staz is serious about his mission to help Fuyumi return to being mortal once again. If I was entirely serious though, most of the series should be absorbed as fun and a different take on the vampire genre. It\'s not just about falling in love or achieving vengeance. Rather, Blood Lad plays on the values of a relationship between a human and a vampire to see how far they come. It\'s a journey that will quench your thirst if you\'re looking for some fun. vampiric friend Vlad Charlie Staz embarks on a journey to restore a human back to their mortal selves after a tragic event.

It\'s a journey that will quench your thirst if you\'re looking for some fun.', 'Ok, time to make my review of this 10 episode anime thing....then again, I think I should just quit beating around the bush and state by ratings for each of this anime\'s category.Story: mediocre 5.Ok, so vampires plots are overrated, and this anime follow the same path as that of the main character which has some similarities from ""Hataraku Maou-sama"" which is about a underworld big boss who doesn\'t wanna be a big boss anymore and desires a simple life in another place, in fact the plot is almost the same as the mentioned anime. Only the execution is different and it is almost (...and I do mean ""ALMOST"") like a remake.Art: good 7.Ok, I\'m gonna give the credit to Fuyumi and Hydra bell, co\'z I like the way how they\'re illustrated.Sound: fair 6.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, Oh sorry I doze off, ok on this part I\'m gonna refer to the main character\'s diction, intonation, enunciation, and tone as some what, ZZZZZZZZZ, eh! Ok so their voice seemly has that lack of sleep thing in it that one would make you want to doze off or it has the sleepy effect as if the character\'s themselves and I\'m referring to Staz and Braz\'s who have been deprived of sleep for a very long time. However, I give this anime\'s category a 6 co\'z I like the way Fuyumi\'s VA who delivers a sweet tone on to her character. As for the op and ed....I hate them both.Character, Enjoyment and Overall: poor 3.Character- It\'s all on Staz, everything about the character is too cliche especially when everything was place on him, other character\'s here are just antagonist waiting to be tamed by him, Fuyumi on the other hand is more of  a sexy mascot than a damsel in distress as for Hydra Bell... I kind hate her dichotomy character which she\'s this liberated  evil bitch in one hand which you wouldn\'t wanna bring home to mom and on the other hand she want\'s to be loved.Enjoyment- The enjoyment part of this anime is pretty stupid, in fact I can compared it to opening a safe where one wasted a lot of time and effort only to find out that the combination is just 12345. Just like this anime Staz when into a lot of effort to make Fuyumi a human again only to be flustered us audience that Fuyumi simply has to go back to her world to be human again, then again it also conflicts earlier episodes were Fuyumi and Staz did went into the human world and Fuyumi is still a ghost. It would have had a smart ending if Staz forces that Frankenstein doctor in his world to clone Fuyumi\'s body and have her soul posses it just like what Braz did to his father in the final part of the last episode.Overall- Brain Base, didn\'t do a good job of presenting this anime, then again, it was a good thing that they limit it to just 10 episodes.  Overall, this series should be better off as a manga than an anime. Season 2? I wouldn\'t suggest it. and I do mean ""ALMOST"") like a remake.Art: good 7.Ok, I\'m gonna give the credit to Fuyumi and Hydra bell, co\'z I like the way how they\'re illustrated.Sound: fair 6.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, Oh sorry I doze off, ok on this part I\'m gonna refer to the main character\'s diction, intonation, enunciation, and tone as some what, ZZZZZZZZZ, eh!

I mean a vampire boss that is more interested in the otaku culture of Japan over fresh human blood… that doesn’t sound too unoriginal and downright unbearable, right? Well I’m going to tell you why I was neither right nor wrong in Blood Lad’s case....The story follows Staz, a vampire boss of the demon world. He is feared across the demon world for being one of the most powerful bosses around and is also known for always accomplishing any goal he sets out for. So when Fuyumi, a young and big-breasted Japanese girl, accidentally makes it into the demon world and is killed, Staz decides he’ll help bring her back to life. Already two typical character types have been established: an overpowered hero and a big-breasted, clumsy heroine. So, if it sounds to you like a pretty typical hero saves damsel-in-distress story then you’re absolutely right—because that’s what it is. But that is not all it is. Let me explain.One of the best things about this series was the comedy. It wasn’t forced, it wasn’t complicated, the references to Japanese culture were easy to understand for any anime fan, it was not overused and it was just downright hilarious. But the credibility of the series cannot be justified by just one aspect of the plot even if the show is prominently defined by this aspect—and that is where Blood Lad quickly let itself down. At first, the comedy held up the dialogue in a good way but it soon became hard to overlook the lacking parts of the rest of the dialogue. The comedy became repetitive and started to let down the dialogue and eventually the plot also. Where Blood Lad’s story went wrong is when they failed at mixing bad drama and action with good comedy—and then tried to patch up their faults with more good comedy. After this much repetition, the good comedy became bad comedy and the plot became even less comprehensible because of the overuse of unneeded gags.Just like the story, Blood Lad’s art started out great but was relatively let down by a certain aspect. Prominently the most annoying part of Blood Lad’s art was the obscure and abstract changing of colours, backgrounds and art within certain scenes at an attempt to pair with the comedic side of the plot. At first it worked well but this soon enough, just like the use of comedy, became forced and overused. Apart from this annoyance, Blood Lad’s art was actually one of the series’ strong points. The animation was always fluid, the art was consistent, the character designs and the design of the Japan influenced ‘demon world’ worked very well together and over all the animation, when not overused, matched the mood of the series and the genre by having simple and somewhat goofy character designs like typical comedy series do but also mixing it with typical shounen character designs, this caused a nice blend of the comedy and action. Apart from the certain abstract scenes mentioned before, the art was far from an eyesore and actually helped maintain the series when it began to fail.The soundtrack goes with the series in a pleasurable but non-memorable way. The opening song did a great job of giving me a positive view when I started the anime and when I started the new episode every week. Even when I knew the anime that was starting after the minute and a half song was far from perfect. The soundtrack worked well in matching the moods of different scenes and didn’t separate the viewer from the voice acting but instead accompanied the seiyuu’s dialogue well.The characters in Blood Lad all play a relatively necessary role in the show but the way some of these roles were developed is probably the weakest point of the series. In some cases there is no development at all, they are simply placed in the series for the short time they are needed then used later on for gags. But, with it being a 10 episode series and of the comedy genre, which doesn’t typically have or need much character development,  I do take into account that it would be very hard to develop all the characters they introduced. So I’ll only be judging the development of the main characters. Staz, obviously, has the most development as a character throughout the series and for a comedy series this should have been absolutely fine, here’s the problem though-- it didn’t feel like enough. The flashbacks and dialogue he’s involved in don’t provide enough substance to give me a reason to care about him. Little character development in a comedy series is acceptable but if it is not handled well, which in this case it wasn’t, it makes you care about the character less. If you don’t care about the main character then it is hard to care about anything he or she is involved in, which in a main character’s case is usually everything to do with the series. The biggest let down of the series was the underdevelopment of Staz, if you can’t get your viewer to care about the main character then the anime falls apart.Blood Lad was a show that let itself down more than it let the viewers down, because it could have been much more than it ended up as.But after all this negativity in this piece of writing I can honestly say that I still really enjoyed Blood Lad. No it didn’t impress me as much as I was expecting, yes it had a lot of flaws, but the overall charm of the series kept me watching. If you’re a fan of this anime I can understand why and I can also say I am a fan. If I can’t point out the flaws in a series then how can I properly call myself a fan? Blood Lad was a fun experience and I still hold to my previous comment that it was neither unbearable and unoriginal nor bearable and original, because honestly from a critical standpoint Blood Lad didn’t impress me or frustrate me—it just gave me enjoyment.After reading this review I hope you have a good idea on all the flaws of Blood Lad. But if you were interested in this series like I was I encourage you to look past the flaws and have fun with this anime, it might not be the most empowering, impressive, revolutionary anime in existence but it is great for some enjoyable watching and sometimes that’s all that matters. If you can look past that fact then who knows you might really enjoy this anime. Give it a shot. The story follows Staz, a vampire boss of the demon world.

You take what you want.""When and why did vampires become so popular in the past few years? The only conclusion that I could really come to was the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. It\'s the series that sucked the blood (and money for that matter) out of adolescent girls everywhere. Why? Somewhere along the line I think our society forgot what vampires are supposed to be. The premise of ‘Vampires’ were originally made to be terrifying beings that were both intimidating and powerful.  If you don\'t know what I\'m talking about regarding what a vampire...ideally should be, I would promptly direct you to Hellsing Ultimate where you may bask in the bloody goodness that is Alucard.The story of Blood Lad is pretty unoriginal. Vampire meets a human girl, the human girl gets into trouble, and the vampire becomes the hero to save her. Pretty cliché. The plot of Blood Lad, however, is pretty good. The demon world is interesting in itself based on the premise of the \'bosses\' that control territories, the hierarchy of demons, and the Demon Acropolis (where top tier demons reside). Material is presented at a good pace that keeps the audience interested rather than confused; at a ten episode run, that\'s quite a feat. One last thing that I want to mention is that Blood Lad is lined with constant references to other anime and anime characters. If you\'re like me and enjoy knowing what is being referenced, you\'ll think or say something to the equivalent of, ""Fuck yeah! I got that reference. Sweet!"" as you give yourself a high five.The art/animation of Blood Lad is good. It\'s an anime of 2013 and thus there it\'s essentially a basic standard to have good animation and art. The action scenes look nice, the characters look good, and everything flows well overall. Nothing to complain about here, but also nothing to brag about. The sound portion is decent enough. The OP and ED are both pretty good; I enjoyed them both, but they aren\'t something that warrants watching and listening to every episode. There are a wide array of voices for the characters and I liked how fitting they were for their respective characters.I enjoyed watching the characters of Blood Lad interact. Each of them is interesting in their own sense of the word. Staz, the main protagonist, is a vampire of prestigious class/breed and \'boss\' of a territory in the demon world. He’s also and an otaku that aims to quench his thirst for something that isn’t blood; he\'s infatuated with all things from the human world, but mainly things from Japan. He collects anime, manga, video games, Japanese attire, and becomes entranced by anything new from the human world. This is also part of the reason he is attracted to Fuyumi, the female lead. Fuyumi is a human girl from Japan who ends up wandering into the demon world accidently and subsequently turned into a ghost after dying. She entrusts her future to Staz in hopes that he can return her back to being human. She\'s really shy, quiet, and humble for the most part. Bell, a spatial magic sorceress, acts like a second female lead. She\'s provides quite a few comedic moments and often teases Staz. She\'s clever and deceptive, but also is also quite the softie. While those three are the really prevalent characters, many other characters take up their fair share of screen time such as Wolf, Braz, and Liz. I don\'t think there was a character I legitimately didn\'t like in the whole series, however there also wasn\'t much meaningful development for the series’ characters either.Overall Blood Lad is entertaining to say the least. I enjoyed what it had to offer for a story about vampires and the supernatural. Fan service is really prevalent in this series and did become slightly a nuisance for me; it seems they took every opportunity to showcase cleavage and added it in. The series runs for only ten episodes, which is a shame because it leaves a lot of questions unanswered and feels rather incomplete. If you\'re looking for a fun, simple show to watch, Blood Lad might be what you\'re looking for; just don\'t expect any deep themes or depth that makes a series great. ideally should be, I would promptly direct you to Hellsing Ultimate where you may bask in the bloody goodness that is Alucard.The story of Blood Lad is pretty unoriginal.

It is weird yet unique.The story starts of when a human girl (the main female character, sadly I forgot her name) appears from nowhere in town and thus Staz's people find her, knowing Staz will be fascinated by the human girl. Then he realizes that she is fading from the world of living and he decided to help her initially for his own goals. He gets help from...his friends and yea.However the story of this anime is really inconsistent, it is like sht happens, then it becomes good again in a matter of time, fluctuating the repetitive pattern. Some episodes are really interesting with it's action scenes and humour and it is so hilarious most of the time while it also contains many references to real anime in our world, however, some episodes are just SO boring I actually fell asleep for half an episode and could not wake up until my room was drooling from liquid......inconsistency is majorly a lack down for this show.The animation and art quality was decent to say the least. The character designs were well made and they were recognizable, sadly though, it isn't amazing either. The background colours were quite random, they were all over the place and although it is a demon world, every single street in this world shouldn't look like its graffiti done by a 5 year old brat.The music was fine, the opening was catchy and a bit addicting, but then the ending song was quite wrong, it doesn't fit well with mood of the ending of any episode, doesn't collaborate well or match nicely to present a neat and long lasting effect to the audience, every time the ending song played, i felt like i was in a funeral with a group of friends singing a sad song. Also, noneo f the soundtracks were memorable, but o well.The characters were all-rounded, there were the girls who only tried to get laid with Staz, and then the male characters who were nicely brought in. Wolf, the masochist was basically a power-house, he could tank an entire army including Staz and he was strong as well, being that said, one of my favorite scenes was him fighting Staz in a boxing match. He also showed feelings towards liking Fuyumi the main girl (oh i remembered), helping her out. Staz was quite likable, a badass overpowered damning kamikaze here and there fanboy who gets all the chicks day and night. However, none of the characters were well developed, reducing the potential of these characters. Building a development, story or background of a characters especially the main characters will definitely provide and deliver more feels towards the show, and we will care more about them, because when Fuyumi was fading i didnt even cry, when staz was beaten up, i didnt cry or flood a river in my room becaue I already knew that he would wake up and trash the enemy in a matter of 3 seconds.Blood Lad, was not terrible or extremely bad, but the potential wasted was disappointing as I really did expect more from these characters and even the plot as well. Pacing was poo, inconsistent episode delivery too. The humor and action were the notable qualities that were well done in this anime. It is a good comedy and fantasy genre animeIn a nutshell, Blood lad will give you quite a lot of laughs, but you can be sure to feel safe because there isn't anything sad or tragic here, don't worry your room will not flood with tears. You wont give any damns, when someone dies.

Inconsistency kills Blood Lad, leaving it stoned, becoming little bacon-bits."", 'Oh, damn, those vampires again, it seems they are everywhere, and why am I complaining when I am reviewing a vampire anime? First lets make it clear I picked up this only for the fact that it seems like it would be a comedy and for the Seinen tag. Turns out it is mostly a comedy anime but I don\'t understand why its Seinen? This is typical Shounen manga with damsel in distress formula with a supernatural comedy twist, but definitely not Seinen ( some uncalled for ecchi doesn\'t make Seinen,sorry), so stop advertising false information.StoryThe story of Blood Lad follows our ""hero"" Staz who...is a vampire in the makai (demon world) who doesn\'t drink human blood & is also an otaku, he is a leader of a small portion of demon world but mostly spends his time watching anime, reading manga and playing Japanese video games. One day our ""heroine"" Fuyumi accidentally wanders into the demon world and ends up in Staz\'s territory, Staz is so excited to finally meet a human girl but when he was a bit busy protecting his territory Fuyumi gets killed and turns into a ghost. And thus the story begins as our hero decides to revive Fuyumi into a human again. But wait there is a catch, Staz is not as heroic as it seems, actually he has a strong desire to drink Fuyumi\'s blood so he secretly wants to resurrect her for that. And thus our heroes trial begins as he tries to find ways to reach his goal. The story was a bit boring at the start but after a few episodes it starts to get a bit interesting, mostly due to some nice side characters most of whom actually are cliche Shounen characters but none the less likeable. The main likeable thing about the story is not its premise or the character backgrounds (which are too generic if you ask me) but the comedic side of it, the continuous pun at typical Shonen\'s like Staz trying to use Kamehameha was really funny stuff and it keeps the show enjoyable but when the writer tries to make things a bit serous with romance and family chemistry stuff then it starts to fall apart cause the main storyline for this anime is not original at all, we really have seen all those cliche stuff way many times before.From me story gets 6.5 out of 10.CharactersThe characters are not the strongest aspect of this anime, Staz is actually alright when he acts his funny self but his back story and all other aspects of his character are to bland for me but at least he is better than our heroine Miss-I-am-so-innocent-and-dumb-and-typical-with-unnaturally-big-breasts Fuyumi, come on we had these kinds of heroines for so long its just unbearable now.  And those unnecessary ecchi stuff, provocative dresses and shameless fan service is just too awful to waste my breath on.But not all is lost in the character department either because of some strong side characters, I mean Braz, Bell & Liz are almost impossible not to like and although a typical rival character I did like Wolf, and other side characters like Staz\'s gang members (Deku,Saty,Yoshida) were written with quite a lot of care it seems. So all I can say about the whole character business is that if Kodama would have given his main characters the same level of care as he did most of his side characters it would have been a way more better anime in my opinion.The characters get 7.5 out of 10 (and that\'s mostly for all the characters minus the main two).Art/AnimationUnarguably the animation is top notch and the best thing about this anime, the action sequences are colorful and a delight to watch, the character designs are lovely and the whole animation is fluid and crisp, it is one of the things to be amazed of in this show. But sadly that is not enough, you need good story and solid main characters to tell the story with your nice animation.The animation gets 8.5 out of 10.SoundThe sound effect is appropriate for the show but nothing that really pulls your attention into it. The Opening theme is ""ViViD"" by May\'n which is a nice opening for the show but doesn\'t really makes you want to get the listen to it as a separate form of entertainment. The ending theme is ""BLOODY HOLIC"" by Yuuka Nanri which is rather bland is my opinion and really doesn\'t go with the show, it tries somehow force the romance into the front of the situation which unfortunately I say is not the strongest aspect of the show, its the comedy that is, the opening song at least acknowledges that.The sound gets a 6.5 out of 10 from me (its okay but really nothing to write home about).In the end of the day the writer did try to make a show which tries a different take on the vampire theme and the otaku twist is nice with the pun at other animes & manga bit is nice but unfortunately it seems that he himself sometimes forget what his initial intentions were and tries to inject serious stuff into the fold and force some unnecessary ecchi and romance into the mix which turns a otherwise quite innovative and fun idea into a cliched mental anguish for the viewers.OVERALL SCORE6.5 out of 10. is a vampire in the makai (demon world) who doesn\'t drink human blood & is also an otaku, he is a leader of a small portion of demon world but mostly spends his time watching anime, reading manga and playing Japanese video games. One day our ""heroine"" Fuyumi accidentally wanders into the demon world and ends up in Staz\'s territory, Staz is so excited to finally meet a human girl but when he was a bit busy protecting his territory Fuyumi gets killed and turns into a ghost. And thus the story begins as our hero decides to revive Fuyumi into a human again. But wait there is a catch, Staz is not as heroic as it seems, actually he has a strong desire to drink Fuyumi\'s blood so he secretly wants to resurrect her for that. And thus our heroes trial begins as he tries to find ways to reach his goal. The story was a bit boring at the start but after a few episodes it starts to get a bit interesting, mostly due to some nice side characters most of whom actually are cliche Shounen characters but none the less likeable. The main likeable thing about the story is not its premise or the character backgrounds (which are too generic if you ask me) but the comedic side of it, the continuous pun at typical Shonen\'s like Staz trying to use Kamehameha was really funny stuff and it keeps the show enjoyable but when the writer tries to make things a bit serous with romance and family chemistry stuff then it starts to fall apart cause the main storyline for this anime is not original at all, we really have seen all those cliche stuff way many times before.From me story gets 6.5 out of 10.CharactersThe characters are not the strongest aspect of this anime, Staz is actually alright when he acts his funny self but his back story and all other aspects of his character are to bland for me but at least he is better than our heroine Miss-I-am-so-innocent-and-dumb-and-typical-with-unnaturally-big-breasts Fuyumi, come on we had these kinds of heroines for so long its just unbearable now.

You should watch this too.  the ending sucks, b/c the rest of the story needs to be animated.  I hope they make another season or continue it somehow. anime, i knew that i had to muster the courage through hard work and walk back to the store and face my enemies.  but ofc first, i needed to train.  so i did four pushups and i curled the freshly bought gallon of milk a few times.feeling pumped, i headed out.  one of the many OP's of naruto played through my head.  and as i rounded the corner, i could smell the diesel and hairspray in the air.  i stalked up to the group and i yelled KAMEHAMEHA!!!!and they laughed so hard some fell off their bikes.  clearly i had scored precious damage points.  so i walked in, grabbed my cucumbers and came back out ready to toss a few extra vegetables at them.  but they were gone.  and at that moment, the theme to rocky kicked in and i knew i was the VICTOR.so i went home and watched blood lad, which i found to be very funny and cool.  so much like me, it was an instant classic.

It was so boring, cliched, generic, uninteresting, annoying, unfunny, and just stupid. I didn\'t want to know what any of the episodes contained after what is established to be after the 2nd episode. I couldn\'t careless.These characters were the worst thing about this show, I couldn\'t stand to think why they are even in the show, it all felt like excuses for entertainment. All of them were easy to look in the eye and know what they are, and that\'s great, I love a show that can establish something, but when you are obnoxious about it, then you are bound...to make it tiresome and annoying.The show carefully explains what this whole story is about, saving a human\'s life. Now it sounds serious, but they executed it like it was child\'s play. Wow, I am so interested how they are going to save a human\'s life. They went through boxing, they fought a boring ass side villain, the main character has family problems, and, and... wait, why do they all sound so simple, but not even a single bit of original idea\'s in it? DING DING DING, you hear that folks? They made a show not only to slowly advance what the main story is about, but to shove in every cookie cutter activities just to make a show cool. WOW, THIS SHOW IS A NEW HIT. A BIRTH TO A NEW GENERATION OF STEALING IDEAS FOR TEENAGE ENTERTAINMENT. I GUESS WE GOTTA HAVE A NEW TITANIC WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLAY GOLF TO WIN THE GIRL OF THEIR DREAMS! DOESN\'T""T THAT SOUND EXCITING??Even the whole story is dreadful, I can explain one sub-plot without making it sound entertaining, but that\'s how the actual show is. Here is one sub-plot I have summarized while watching this show, and yes, it is spoilers. Here we GO!The main character and the human ran to see the main characters buddy. They found him coincidentally and asked how to resurrect a human. He wants to know why the main character cares, and the main character just does. His friend asks for a competition and he agrees. If the main character wins, he gets to know how to resurrect, however, if he loses, he needs to give away the human. He was unaware what the competition, generally we all thought they were just going to fight it out using their powers, well they are fighting, but by boxing. The human is wearing a costume for fan service. The main character and his friend were fighting, and the main character drained his strength by using his fangs. His friend transformed into a werewolf, but it was pointless. The main character was about to conclude the fight, but the girl starts crying and said to stop fighting. The other girl, who was unbriefly introduced in the 2nd episode, stopped the fight by teleporting the characters to a different area. The werewolf gives in and explains about the resurrection.You starting to see how boring and plain this was? Well if you watch the anime, you aren\'t going to be thrilled about watching the actual event, because it is, so, damn, BORING AND ANNOYING.I can\'t understand how this can happen. I don\'t understand why people think it is funny and original, I don\'t know why people think this is a masterpiece, and I don\'t know PEOPLE ENJOY IT. It\'s the fact there are vampires that are way overrated in this show, how there is a werewolf, there are monsters in the show, the main character is all powerful and is chill about it, a girl looks attractive that they dress her up and make her do things that no standard girl would ever do in their entire lives because she is played like a plain girl, so WHY MAKE HER LIKE THIS AT ALL, and... you know what, this is why it is enjoyable because IT IS SO GENERICALLY BULLSHIT.Well there are more shows out there that are like this, and people seem to enjoy them and don\'t care, so I guess trying to prove why it\'s bad is pointless.I give it a 3/10, twilight but with boobs. to make it tiresome and annoying.The show carefully explains what this whole story is about, saving a human\'s life.

"", 'Alright yall Ima keep this short and simple for a short and simple anime. Blood lad, to put it simply, was funny. For one, it made a great job of making the whole mood feel light-hearted, even when people were ""dying"" and the mood was supposed to be set serious it had never felt that way to me.For a while now I had tried to search for an anime taht even from the very start I could tell was going to be an anime that didn\'t have such intense and heavy moody characters.... COUGH all those characters who think smiling is...a sin COUGH. Even then though, it was hard to find something both interesting and light hearted, I wanted something like hunter x hunter. Blood lad had successfully accomplished that for me.So that\'s it for my short and simple review, this anime is comedic, light-hearted, has plenty of action, enjoyable, has a very nice story and plot, and it\'s only problem is that it wasn\'t longer. 10/10 would bang the end PEACE OUT.PS I gave this anime a 9/10 for the sheer reason that it did what it set the mood for. It didn\'t have a peaceful nonchalant mood but has everyone dying and crying for days. It struck for a light - hearted fun enjoyable short anime to watch. It\'s plot was quite good for an anime so.So when you watch this don\'t expect the deepest plot ever, with twists and turns and amazing woahs after every episode, if you\'re tired of being serious watch this anime. If I had had a serious mood and been searching for that, this anime would have gotten a solid 6. But it didn\'t, it hit exactly what it wanted to hit, and that\'s why I felt that this anime was more than enjoyable. It set the mood, it carried out the mood, and it kept it at that pace for the entire time without missing a single beat. PEACE OUT NO I AM REALLY DONE 14/10 WOULD BANG PEACE OUT! a sin COUGH.

Then, eaten by a plant Fuyumi dies and the rest of the show is about trying to resurrect Fuyumi and Staz's actual feelings for her. The fast paced story goes great with the just as fast Character Development with in just about every episode a new character is introduced, not all ones you like, but none the less new.

The excellent portrayal of said Comedy really sets the light tone of the anime which favours the otherwise feeble story. The timing of the jokes was never rushed nor forced nor complicated. They were easy to follow and hilarious to watch so you are in store for some serious chuckles! Regrettably this seems to be the only strong point of ‘Blood Lad’, for the comedy bits start...to partake a repetitive nature which brings down the overall nature of the show since it’s other aspects like Action and Romance are mediocre at best! Although the Comedy is solid throughout with many Easter eggs that are plastered all over the place. And I loved how Self-Referential this anime was, shrewdly incorporating it into its Comedy which resulted to a unique and funny experience!Staz (MC) is a very powerful vampire who also happens to be the Boss of his district in the Demon world. Time and time again, he battles powerful opponents but somehow wins despite his lackadaisical nature.  Due to his obsession with Otaku culture, his constant number of manga references and use of anime knowledge were the best part of his trait, often displayed in clever and unexpected ways. And his flashbacks provided enough details about him for you to care, though this arc could have been handled better. Staz life changes when he meets a Big breasted Japanese teenager (Fuyumi) and this is where the show starts. All he wants to do is suck her blood but something happens to her after which Staz can only promise to resurrect her somehow. Fuyumi was a disappointment because for all the unique and supernatural characters with their comical personality types in this show, she was the most plain and boring of all! I really can’t say much about her except that she’s the damsel in distress character, making her forgettable due to her dull and clueless nature. The Supporting characters are interesting on their own, from the manipulative Bell who comes with a dual personality of a Bitch and a girl who wants to fall in love to the Badass Wolf with his scary strength and regeneration powers. You have tons of other characters that are barely shown which hurts them since they don’t get a lot of growth, yet somehow Braz shines by coming off all clever and scary while Liz makes an entrance with her depiction of affection for Braz and her overall cute yet mindless nature. In spite of introducing such exceptional characters, they fail to make a splash due to the short run time given to them.The animation happened to look very neat even when depicting dark places like the demon world but the overall colour scheme and contrast takes time getting used to cause for some reason it gave off a cartoon show vibe that’s made for children! Still the change in the colour art style was well done for it totally worked during the comical scenes despite its cheap looking nature to me. The OP/ED were ok while the Voice Acting was nothing memorable but once again the Comedy and Action bit were elevated with the perfect use of abnormal sound effects throughout the show.This Comedic Action packed vampire show turn these genres over its head by refusing to align itself to being a cliché anime, rather focuses on keeping a light and fun atmosphere. Regardless of this attempt, it manages to start well but the sudden end to an incomplete story leaves a bad taste in your mouth! What’s worst is that it needed just a few more episodes to wrap up its current story arc and they fail to do so in the hopes of greenlighting another season. Add in the completely boring romance attempt between Staz and Fuyumi which leaves you frustrated because you totally want Bell and Staz to hook up since they share more screen time and exhibit actual chemistry! In fact, I would go as far as putting Bell’s mom with Staz rather than that bore fest of a teenager! ‘Blood Lad’ shouldn’t be taken seriously for you to enjoy since it’s flawed in many places, from the straightforward plot to the animation and some characters. But it’s still worth watching just for those parody moments alone. The short run of 10 episodes definitely plays into the anime’s favour since it’s able to maintain its charm for the most of it. All in all, despite all the fan service provided, I still wasn’t impressed but I was entertained enough to recommend this to another viewer for a one-time watch only. Just don’t expect anything deeper or meaningful and be prepared for an unfinished story which leaves many things unanswered. to partake a repetitive nature which brings down the overall nature of the show since it’s other aspects like Action and Romance are mediocre at best!

I decided to try out the English Dub, and though I didn\'t mind it the voice-acting, there were points where listening to some of the dialogue spoken frustrated me. I had started this anime a while back and stopped watching for a bit as it did not peak my interest, but figured I should just finish it off because it is a short season. Let\'s get into this.Story - 5The story was meh to me. It didn\'t really interest me nor kept me engaged, especially with...the main plotline. But I felt the side stories, the relationships between some of the characters were interesting just a bit more, but that is really all. I do like the idea that it is set in the demon world, giving the viewer a bit of new atmosphere... despite it looking like a normal city. Some of the sub stories in the anime were a bit stupid, like the romance between Fuyumi and Stax or Bell liking Stax because of some reason. It just sort of happens, and really, I just found it more irritating them heart-warming. There is no sense of development for these romances, and it didn\'t feel realistic to me.Art - 6Surprisingly, I liked the art. It was simple and clean. Nothing grand at all, but passable. There were some demons designed to look ugly as hell, but luckily those would only be minor characters. Our main Character\'s designs were also pretty cool too. There are some problems I had with the how Bell and Fuyumi are over-sexualized, usually revealing their breasts or asses. They are usually dressed ""appropriately"" for each situation, and it annoyed me. Though it was not my main focus, it was still a bother.Sound - 3Nothing really stood out for me in anime music wise. I don\'t remember any of the music and the opening was meh. Probably one of the few weak points of the anime, actually.Character - 4The characters in the anime are unique in their own ways, especially with their special abilities. I do love how Stax is a full-on perverted Otaku, and I found him an amusing character to watch. I also did enjoy Wolf, and wish I could have seen more of him in the story. There were some weak characters like Fuyumi. She is useless. Like hell, she is useless. Wolf, Stax and Bell always seem to be saving her ass and trying to keep her safe. She does nothing to benefit the characters, and is just sort of there for the plot and give these characters some purpose. Bell was also a weak character. Despite having such an unique ability, I just found her annoying, not at all cute. Whenever she was around, she just frustrated me. I wish she had become a cheeky girl, yes, but also not be tied down by her feelings for Stax.Enjoyment - 3I did not enjoy this anime. Watching each episode felt like more of a chore, and I would find myself swearing at the characters due to their stupidity. Though, I did get some few laughs, I still found myself mostly frustrated. I would just think that this kind of anime is not what I enjoy to watch. Sure, I love watching something to laugh at, which I think this anime was aiming at, but this was just plain ridiculous.Overall - 4Coming to a close, I give this anime a four. I was close to give it a three, but it just didn\'t seem right. It wasn\'t that awful. Blood Lad could be enjoyed by others, but with me, I just don\'t enjoy it. Maybe someone who enjoys complete ridiculousness and don\'t mind the constant fanservice would like to give this a try. Upon this review, my final score is a 4 out of ten. the main plotline. But I felt the side stories, the relationships between some of the characters were interesting just a bit more, but that is really all.

Probably one of the few weak points of the anime, actually.Character - 4The characters in the anime are unique in their own ways, especially with their special abilities. I do love how Stax is a full-on perverted Otaku, and I found him an amusing character to watch. I also did enjoy Wolf, and wish I could have seen more of him in the story. There were some weak characters like Fuyumi. She is useless. Like hell, she is useless. Wolf, Stax and Bell always seem to be saving her ass and trying to keep her safe. She does nothing to benefit the characters, and is just sort of there for the plot and give these characters some purpose. Bell was also a weak character. Despite having such an unique ability, I just found her annoying, not at all cute. Whenever she was around, she just frustrated me. I wish she had become a cheeky girl, yes, but also not be tied down by her feelings for Stax.Enjoyment - 3I did not enjoy this anime. Watching each episode felt like more of a chore, and I would find myself swearing at the characters due to their stupidity. Though, I did get some few laughs, I still found myself mostly frustrated. I would just think that this kind of anime is not what I enjoy to watch. Sure, I love watching something to laugh at, which I think this anime was aiming at, but this was just plain ridiculous.Overall - 4Coming to a close, I give this anime a four. I was close to give it a three, but it just didn\'t seem right. It wasn\'t that awful. Blood Lad could be enjoyed by others, but with me, I just don\'t enjoy it. Maybe someone who enjoys complete ridiculousness and don\'t mind the constant fanservice would like to give this a try. Upon this review, my final score is a 4 out of ten.', ""I'm gonna begin this at the end.  Blood Lad ends on a cliffhanger.  I had not clue it was the last episode until I noticed the count on my list. I was tempted to rate it down just for ticking me off.I enjoyed Blood Lad.  I began it with skepticism because all things vampiric have been letting me down recently.  The concept of a pwoerful vampire infatuated with humans and the human world to the point of being an otaku is intriguing and amusing.  I like the quick pace of the writing.  The animation style is artsy....It's purposefully flat and '70s comic looking to give the watcher the sense that indeed this is not the human world.Staz, our otaku vampire prince, is an anti-hero.  He is not a good guy.  In fact he tells you he's not.  He's a demon afterall.  Most of the demons he runs across are in human form, but there are some in other forms.  I was never sure if our leading lady was dense or just overwhelmed. She was likeable, but I didn't love her.Blood Lad is good, but it is too short and the story doesn't end.  I hope there is a 2nd season. It's purposefully flat and '70s comic looking to give the watcher the sense that indeed this is not the human world.Staz, our otaku vampire prince, is an anti-hero.

I hope there is a 2nd season."", 'I just want to mention first that I have read the manga for Blood Lad (up to where it’s translated) and that this was actually my first manga ever (so it’s a bit special to me). However, that doesn’t mean it’s one of my favorites and really I think it’s just average overall. I’ll be making many comparisons between the manga and anime (without spoilers of course).Story – 6/10I do really like the unique the initial plot. It follows Staz who is a vampire that is the leader of a section of the underworld. Staz also happens to be an otaku for all things from...the human world, especially things from Japan, from anime to figures to Final Fantasy. And yes, they make a lot of references to different things (Dragonball might have the most). One day, Staz hears from his henchmen that a human girl suddenly appeared in the streets. Being who he is, Staz can’t resist meeting her. However, due to an unfortunate series of events involving giant plants, the girl (whose name is Fuyumi) ends up dying only to turn into a ghost. Staz (for reasons that are somewhat selfish) vows to help Fuyumi get her human body back. They travel everywhere in search of clues and even go back to the human world for a short time. They slowly piece things together about how to return Fuyumi to her human form but what they uncover is a much bigger story that pulls them in even though Staz really wishes he could just get this all over with at times.When it was announced that Blood Lad would only have 10 episodes, I was kind of skeptical how they would fit everything in, and, whether or not they would go past where the manga is translated into English as there are about 15 chapters that are not translated (about 1/3rd of the manga at this time). While not too many problems came from having a shorter series, the anime was very fast paced. Blood Lad is a series that tends to jump around a lot and lose focus of the overall plot amidst a sea of side plots. With the fast pacing, there were times during some episodes where the plot switched between places so fast that it became hard to follow. Most of the episodes also end at awkward points in the story and kind of cut up the story in ways that I think mess up the story (at least if you are watching one episode a week like I did).Art – 7/10The anime was done by studio “Brains Base” who is known for works like Baccano, Durarara!!, Amnesia, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc. While they’re previous works (as far as I’ve seen) usually have very impressive art, I felt they went a little overboard with Blood Lad. The animation looks great and the fight scenes are well animated, but the anime was just way too colorful in my opinion. The Blood Lad manga had a much darker edge (despite being a comedy manga), and the wide array of colors in almost in almost every moment of the anime kind of dampens that effect at times. But there are some places, like Staz’s otaku room, which do benefit from the colorful animation, but they are few and far between.A problem with the art that the manga also suffers from is in its character designs. While I really like some of the characters’ designs (like Staz, Braz, and Akimu), there were many that I thought were just strange. Fuyumi and Bell especially look awkward and Wolf’s face in his werewolf form just looks kind of strange and unnatural the way it’s elongated. The characters are also very vividly colorful especially when it comes to hair color, which goes back to the last part. Still, Staz and several other characters do have very good designs.Sound – 6/10The soundtrack is also very average. I really only noticed one track that stood out to me while the rest was mostly average, but I also never noticed any really disliked. The one good track sounds kind of mysterious and is used in the few darker scenes or just before the comedic scenes (the latter of which kind of ruins its effect).The voice actors did a great job of portraying their roles with Staz’s being the standout performance. His voice actor, Ohsaka Ryota, does an amazing job portraying the otaku vampire and all of his craziness. With Fuyumi (who’s just kind of bland to start with) her voice actress did fit the role well, but was still boring. I also found Wolf’s voice in his werewolf form to be very annoying and kind of cheesy.Characters – 5/10This is where the anime drops in my opinion. While Staz is great and sometimes unpredictable, some of the other characters (especially Fuyumi) are very one dimensional and boring. It was the same way in the manga, too. Fuyumi is just one of the most boring female protagonists I’ve ever seen. She’s your typical damsel in distress who gets thrown around by everyone (with occasional fanservice) and doesn’t ever do anything herself. Since the entire plot and most of the side plots are centered on her, it really ruins the story at times because of her being unable to do anything while everyone else fights to help her regain her humanity.Now for some of the better characters. Hydra Bell is a demon who uses magic that opens portals to wherever she wants to go and can even view things in other places just by making a rectangular shape out of her fingers. She enjoys messing with Staz and testing his powers to see how strong he really is. Wolf is a territory boss just like Staz. He and Staz have known each other since they were kids and have an interesting relationship as rivals. Braz is Staz’s older brother who Staz hates. He often experiments on Staz and is kind of one of the antagonists of the series. Liz is Staz’s younger sister and the jail keeper of what appears to be the largest prison in the underworld. She hates Staz because he gets most of Braz’s attention.The rest of the background characters are either forgettable or were just introduced around the end of the anime and barely get any screen time. It’s a pretty large cast of characters for an anime with only 10 episodes.Enjoyment – 6/10I thought the series was rushed too much and would have done much better with 12 or 13 episodes. The manga was already fast paced and the anime only sped that up as it sometimes put about 3 chapters into a single episode. The art is just too colorful in my opinion, and the soundtrack really doesn’t stand out at all. While Staz is a good protagonist, Fuyumi is just a horrible heroine. The rest of the cast is both good and bad as well. It’s definitely not the best show this season, though it’s not really the worst either. If you’re looking for vampire anime (despite being extremely different) I would recommend Shiki instead. If you’re looking for comedy and action then try Blue Exorcist which has a very similar feeling and similar protagonists. the human world, especially things from Japan, from anime to figures to Final Fantasy.

And I loved the Blood Lad manga...from the point I read up to. I await for the next volume to be out in the US.The moment I heard of the anime, I put it on my instant ""plan to watch list"" in my head. (As this was before I joined MAL). (Side note): Okay. So, when I heard it was going to be 10 episodes, I kind of freaked out a bit and since Wikipedia was being edited constantly between 10 and 12 episodes, I didn\'t know what to believe.Anyway, for this review, I\'ll start to say:When I watched the...first few episodes, I loved how closely it followed the manga. I loved how it was almost exactly like the manga, except for maybe a few event rearrangements, but I didn\'t really care about that. After around episode seven though, I was wondering... ""how are they going to wrap up this anime""?Then it dawned upon me: ""It\'s going to end with Staz and Fuyumi are going to go through the doorway, and the vampire hunt will begin"". I got the door part right. I got the vampire part wrong. So, I was right about how it would end to a 50% tangent. I was disappointed it ended the way it ended, so -2 on enjoyment.So, yeah, it covers the first six volumes of the manga, that\'s it. So, 8/10 on story, 8/10 on enjoyment.Art: 9/10.The art is fine. There\'s nothing wrong with the art, and I really enjoy how it looks in the anime. In fact, it\'s better in the anime because I get to see what the mangaka\'s art looks like...animated! It\'s great--like any other manga that became an anime.Sound: 6/10.I have Asperger\'s. So the loud noises really bothered me when I was watching Blood Lad. I had to pause for a few minutes because the sound effects really got to me, and I tried hard to ignore the sound effects, I couldn\'t--they were too loud for me. The music was okay, though, I did enjoy the music to some degree.Character: 7/10.There\'s not a lot of character development. That\'s not bad or anything, but Staz develops nicely, imo. Fuyumi, Bell, Wolf and Staz, don\'t though, that didn\'t bug me, but I wanted to see Fuyumi develop a tiny bit. Liz was a great character, btw. I loved all the characters. Especially Staz, Fuyumi, Bell and Beros...despite her not being in it a lot. All of tears.Overall:8/10.The anime was great, BUT THEN IT WAS OVER. And I was upset by that. The anime had so much potential, but then it ended the exact way I knew it would, I didn\'t want it to be that way. But it was a really good and fun summer anime, probably the best Black Comedy I ever watched. I want, no, I need a season 2.Watch it if you like ten episode anime and black comedy. first few episodes, I loved how closely it followed the manga.

The biggest point downer in my opinion is the randomness of it all. Okay, a human pops out of nowhere, something convenient appears at some weirdly convenient time, and somebody just happens to be related to someone else. People might like that kind of thing, but for me, it just shortens the attention span. At least it was funny...- I can't stand cliffhangers. Blood Lad has got to have the best cliffhangers of the century. I was so annoyed and...close to flipping my desk whenever an episode ended, but the cliffhangers were so cleverly placed and scripted that I HAD to keep watching. That's the best, and the worst, part of this anime.Art: 8/10- What can I say? Art is subjective.Sound: 9/10- The music appeals greatly to my taste. -1 point for the OP that I didn't really like. Subjectivity again... I'm still learning how to listen objectively, bear with me > close to flipping my desk whenever an episode ended, but the cliffhangers were so cleverly placed and scripted that I HAD to keep watching.

Overall, it was alright, something to watch if you're bored but not something I would recommend.The story was decent with some sprinkling of action, character conflicts, some humor.  Most refreshing was the fact it wasn't your typical vampire story.  Stay, our vampire protagonist, isn't fighting of his bloodlust for some human he meets randomly and falls in love with.  This story is at least more complex than that and with the help of many different species of monsters this is not your average...vampire story.  That being said, the characters do nothing to help the story for me.  With only ten episodes you can't go deep into character building, but these characters at their core do nothing for me.  Most fall flat or have contradicting character traits that don't really work for me.  The art I found to be refreshing, however.  It's filled with color and the character designs really follow the monster anatomy.So again, overall, I guess this anime is alright for one of those days you're super bored and have nothing else to watch. vampire story.

A somewhat air-headed human girl named Fuyumi accidentally travels though such a portal and is soon captured by demons. Luckily Staz, the head of the demons, is a carefree vampire who wants to break away from his clan\'s past and has no intentions of harming Fuyumi. Unfortunately, he\'s not terribly attentive and Fuyumi is soon gobbled up by a giant flower-monster. Greatly attracted to something unknown about Fuyumi, Staz vows to restore Fuyumi\'s ghost to her former body, which is now a frowning pile of bones.Blood Lad is a light-hearted...action/comedy with a fair dosage of ecchi. An extremely short and ultimately incomplete work, this is a good watch as a shonen piece. There is not enough depth or complexity to warrant the seinen tag nor is there enough character progress to warrant a romance tag. If you\'re looking for some bloody quick action (of the fighting/magic sort) by all means give this a try. If not, I\'d wait to see if there is a sequel before jumping in. As it is, there are too many unanswered questions for this to be a fulfilling watch.Animation:Blood Lad seems to be going for a cool shonen look. The coloring is quite saturated (except for the vampires\' pale skin) and lots of characters have rather funky clothing. Backgrounds are rather simplistic and detailing is only average at best. Character styling is definitely unique with a lot of interesting designs and twists on established monster stereotypes, my favorite being Yukiotoko, a snowman who is cold from his own existence. In certain short sequences characters are drawn with different hair colors, a stylistic choice I guess. What kind of irritated me was the fact that the protagonist Staz was drawn with such a lack of emotional range. He is either calm and collected or grinning and collected. While a laid back protagonist is fine, having some emotional range would do a lot to engage the viewers.There\'s plenty of action in this show with a range of physical and magical battles. There are quite a few non-traditional attacks that differentiate this from your typical show but nothing that will knock you off your feet either. Expect a fair amount of blood and carnage though, with this being a pretty light-hearted show, nothing is really gruesome in an Elfen Lied sense. There is a fair amount of ecchi in this show ranging from finger licking to bouncing body parts and skimpy clothing.Sound:Blood Lad opens with a rock based OP fit for the amount of action in the show. I don\'t really like the melody and don\'t particularly care for the singer\'s voice. The ED is a slightly slower rock piece with a much better singer and melody. The ""cool"" theme is further reflected in the BGM, which has a percussion-heavy tune with electronic, guitar, and brass-based instruments that gives the series a unique feel.The VA cast is relatively young and new but does a fair job at bringing some life to the characters. I think Emi Bridcut did a great job as Hydra Bell, who has by far the most depth out of all the characters.Story:This is a fairly light-hearted show though there are some pretty late plot twists/revelations. The show has quite a few subplots running alongside the main plotline of trying to revive Fuyumi. Annoyingly, these subplots are developed a lot more than the core goal. In fact, once Staz decides to revive Fuyumi, he seems to be doing everything but that (i.e. getting endlessly sidetracked). Thus, while we learn a lot about Staz\'s family and the demon realm, we still don\'t have a good grasp of how Fuyumi can be a human again.As explained above, expect meandering arcs about various subplots, many of which have their own rising action and climax. While the story progression is fair, there are still way too many unanswered questions at the end of the show. The final conclusion is more of a teaser than a conclusion, which obviously begs for a second season. The caveat is that the events of this show are the type that a viewer soon forgets (think the gap between White Album and White Album Second Season). Thus, I recommend waiting for a second offering for a more complete viewing.Character:While the show has a lot of interesting and unique personalities, I felt there was a lack of actual development. Hydra Bell is probably the only character that shows any growth and development through the piece. Staz starts as a lazy but powerful vampire and ends the same. Fuyumi starts as a clueless living girl and ends up as a clueless ghost. Wolfboy starts as an underdog fighter and remains such at the end. While you get fair exposition on important characters, we\'ll have to wait till the second season for any real development.Value:If you walked into this series based on a potentially intriguing relationship between Staz and Fuyumi forget it. Drop this and move on or this show will leave you with an agonizing, unfulfilled feeling. Otherwise, add this to your list and wait for a second season.

I don\'t really like the melody and don\'t particularly care for the singer\'s voice. The ED is a slightly slower rock piece with a much better singer and melody. The ""cool"" theme is further reflected in the BGM, which has a percussion-heavy tune with electronic, guitar, and brass-based instruments that gives the series a unique feel.The VA cast is relatively young and new but does a fair job at bringing some life to the characters. I think Emi Bridcut did a great job as Hydra Bell, who has by far the most depth out of all the characters.Story:This is a fairly light-hearted show though there are some pretty late plot twists/revelations. The show has quite a few subplots running alongside the main plotline of trying to revive Fuyumi. Annoyingly, these subplots are developed a lot more than the core goal. In fact, once Staz decides to revive Fuyumi, he seems to be doing everything but that (i.e. getting endlessly sidetracked). Thus, while we learn a lot about Staz\'s family and the demon realm, we still don\'t have a good grasp of how Fuyumi can be a human again.As explained above, expect meandering arcs about various subplots, many of which have their own rising action and climax. While the story progression is fair, there are still way too many unanswered questions at the end of the show. The final conclusion is more of a teaser than a conclusion, which obviously begs for a second season. The caveat is that the events of this show are the type that a viewer soon forgets (think the gap between White Album and White Album Second Season). Thus, I recommend waiting for a second offering for a more complete viewing.Character:While the show has a lot of interesting and unique personalities, I felt there was a lack of actual development. Hydra Bell is probably the only character that shows any growth and development through the piece. Staz starts as a lazy but powerful vampire and ends the same. Fuyumi starts as a clueless living girl and ends up as a clueless ghost. Wolfboy starts as an underdog fighter and remains such at the end. While you get fair exposition on important characters, we\'ll have to wait till the second season for any real development.Value:If you walked into this series based on a potentially intriguing relationship between Staz and Fuyumi forget it. Drop this and move on or this show will leave you with an agonizing, unfulfilled feeling. Otherwise, add this to your list and wait for a second season. Blood Lad is a unique but incomplete work; a concept that, due to such a partial execution, really doesn\'t hold its own.', ""The Video review is up on my youtube, but here is the written Review.Story - 4/10Vampires used to be seen as fearsome creatures back in the day, but these days they are usually seen as heroes or anti-heroes. The story begins as a normal day of a vampire named, Staz Charlie Blood, his own territory boss, until, Fuyumi Yanagi, an ordinary human girl wanders herself into the human world and is taken to Staz. Now  naturally when you think of vampire, they’ll of course suck her blood, but unlike his ancestors he avoids attacking humans. However Staz does find an interest in her, until...she is killed and turned into a ghost. So the main premise of the show is that Staz is trying to find a way to resurrect Fuyumi back to a normal human. So he can find that satisfaction he had for her when she was alive, because when  she turned into a ghost he lost that attraction. It’s a basic plot, but following the story is kind of hard.The show is only 10 episodes long and usually one episode has like around 3 different plots. The story jumps around a lot, and that can be confusing. It felt really rushed and even in the end it wasn’t satisfying, as if it was setting up for something bigger. This in turn is kind of disappointing because I was really interested and hooked into the world of Blood Lad. The Demon world, is such a unique and exciting place. I like how the writers were able to put all these supernatural creatures, from vampires to werewolves to frankenstein and many more creatures into one show, and it actually makes some sort of sense. Because there is so much different powers and abilities in this world, if you were to look away for just a bit you could miss out on something. Because there is so much things going on, it’s quite easy to miss something along the way.Characters - 7/10Staz Charlie Blood is the main protagonist of the show. He is the boss of a territory in the Demon World. He is rather powerful often usually able to defeat any opponent, and that is proven further down the track as he becomes stronger. What you probably didn’t expect is that Staz is also an otaku. He is obsess with Japanese culture whether its video games or manga. But it’s more like he’s obsess with the human world, as hinted when he saw Fuyumi. Despite looking unreliable, he is dependable, once he’s made up his mind he tries very hard to achieve his goal, even though he may not look like it, he has enough motivation to. What I like about this character is the mystery surrounding his past and his motives. Because he has interesting past, but also his motives are mystery as well, which really adds to his character, if he didn’t have those mystery surrounding him, he would be a generic never say die character, with a bit of cockiness added. The fact that he’s an otaku, many common anime lovers can relate to a protagonist. Because to be honest, not a lot of people are a fan of vampires, because you know…twilight.Fuyumi Yanagi is the main female heroin in the series. Actually I wouldn’t really say heroin more of a constant damsel in distress. She is a normal Japanese School Girl who accidentally wanders into the Demon world and gets herself killed and therefor she becomes a ghost. Although she is very kind and supportive person, she is completely useless. Yes it does make sense since she comes from the human world, it would make sense for her not to have any powers. She’s pretty much just around for plot device. She relies a lot of the other characters around her to get things done. She is Staz’s driving force, but also everyone else’s object, because she literally gets tossed around by everyone. Seriously she’s rather generic and kind of annoying. She’s also kind of there for fan service. The only the conflict I did enjoy from her was as the series went on, she grows accustom to the demon world which brings the question, does she want to be a human or stay as a demon. But that storyline is short lived and left unanswered.Bell Hydra and Wolf are the other main characters of the show. Bell is a mischievous treasure hunter and her defining appearance is her oversize big ass backpack. Who knows what she carriers in there, maybe just a lot of different frames she uses as portals, because that’s her power. She's around to pretty much ruin people’s day, she’s not evil, but she’s very tricky which can annoy some, and I like her interactions with Staz, because she rivals him. Wolf is Staz’s friend and rival, not much can be said about him other than he is wild. He’s motivation for helping Staz is because he simply has a crush on Fuyumi. But even he was barely given enough screen time to be interesting, there was really any development in him and he is supposed to be Staz’s rival, and Staz did develop.Most the characters have an interesting backstory and past, but because of the run time and how short the anime was, it wasn’t fully explored. Most of the characters only had a few episodes to shine, but there wasn’t enough development in them. Even some of the later characters in the series were hinted of motivations for doing what they were doing, but that is left unanswered, so you’re wondering why was this character introduced in the first place. Also because the ending is  left open ended, the character development just felt like one piece of a great puzzle that was going to be something bigger. So it really feels incomplete and it’s disappointing because I felt there could’ve been potential for these characters.Animation and Sound - 7/10, 6/10This was probably Blood Lad’s strongest point lies, which is the art style. It’s a unique art style, all the characters besides Fuyumi have the evil anime eyes, so you can’t really tell who’s good and who is bad, which I like. Also the Demon world is surprisingly full of colours, everything really looks unique and because they jump around the demon world a lot, you get to see a lot of different settings. Also all characters look unique as well and they look good. Albeit the colour scheme is still very basic and you can see as if some of the backgrounds weren’t completed, but that just goes to the art style. Some people are going to have a problem with the art, because it’s not typical and does look sometime simplistic. The animation does shine around some of the fight scenes though, the effects look good and every character has their own power and animation which is a really shining point in the anime, but it’s too short lived most of the fight scenes.The soundtrack is ok, it’s nothing special. The soundtrack suits the mood and different settings and locations of the show. The show has a good mixture of gothic music to suit the theme of the show, I particular like it the most when they play some punk rock in it. Of course being a vampire theme anime you’re going to get some organs in here and there, but that’s not to say they have some comedic music in there from time to time. The opening and ending themes are ok, the ending does it job, however I do enjoy the opening as it really sets up the show very well, not to mention it basically shows what’s going to be happening in the whole show.Enjoyment - 7/10One thing Blood Lad does very well is having a character with an otaku background. So despite being a vampire he is somewhat relatable. But because when you have a character based on an otaku population, most of the jokes in the show are based on different anime and manga etc. And if you don’t get the reference you’re probably not going to be laughing as hard, but if you do get the reference they make you can enjoy the show. Some of the other jokes tend to involve slapstick comedy, so other than parodying and slapstick they don’t have a huge range of jokes. Because during my time of watching Blood Lad, I don’t think I laughed really hard. But only some jokes where I did get the references, I got a good satisfaction out of it. The genre really surprised me, because I was able to see so many different supernatural things in one place and see how the world unfolds around them, which is what I like about the show.Verdict - 6/10For the story of Blood Lad I give it a 4. For the reason it’s incomplete and hard to follow, yet it has a simple premise. Plus the story felt really rushed and yet, it didn’t conclude properly. The only thing I really enjoyed was the whole concept of the Demon world, as I felt I really needed to see more because it was an interesting world.As far as characters go, they get a 7 from me. Reason being I think most of them were interesting to a point, but they just weren’t fully developed and left out, so I was disappointed. But I did enjoy the character interactions with each other and I think Staz’s mystery really adds to him. I did find the characters likable by the way.For the animation and sound I give it a 7 and 6 respectively. The art style is unique and that’s positive, but because it’s unique it may not appeal to too many people and plus some of it looks basic. But I like how everything is unique and actions scenes were great, but short lived. The sound does it’s job and opening theme setups the anime really well.For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. I’m not a huge fan on vampires, but the anime was able to create a character I normally don’t enjoy as much to a character I like because he’s relatable. And I understood some of the references the anime was making, and it made me laugh which it should be doing for a comedy series. But I found myself confused sometime because the story constantly jumps and expects me to be paying attention to everything, expects it to be funny even when I don’t get the references.So after rounding all the scores up I give Blood Lad a 6/10. It’s not a bad anime, it’s above average because it’s uniqueness and likeable cast of characters. The main character is relatable, however if you don’t understand some of the references, you’re probably not going to enjoy it as much. I recommend this anime to Vampire fans, as I think that’s the only type of people who may enjoy it, because it’s hard to follow. she is killed and turned into a ghost.

I found this anime REALLY funny and I just loved Staz.The story is about this girl who somehow got into the monster world and everyone there were surprised and sorrounding her so yeah she was pretty freaked out. Now they called Staz which is their leader sorta...and he I think he likes manga and Japan (i'm not 100% sure) So when they brought the girl to him he was really interesting in her because she was a human... and he hasn't met humans I think. Then he leaves her in his room because there were some people outside and they were doing bad things and he had to get rid of them. Now he left this plant there which eats people...

It was good though as for the plot and creativity, but it was kinda a cliff hanger for romance. You think something romantic would happen, but it would just stop.

Most of all the art seemed terrible. But, after finally giving it a chance I have to say I'm highly disappointed there were only 10 episodes; it was amazing.The art seemed bad to me before starting, I was wrong about this. While it isn't as good as some higher budget anime, it's dealable. The only character who sometimes seemed to look odd in a few frames would be Staz(the main protagonist), though this was only the case for a few scenes and honestly wasn't...that bad.The plot isn't amazing or anything, but it's not bad either. It has a few twists that are incredibly predictable, still there's a few things I didn't see coming. Often times a predictable twist will turn a different way last minute to reveal a surprise, something which was intriguing. However, the plot isn't entirely what I was watching it for. This series was one of the few to literally make me laugh out loud in certain situations. It's jokes are usually more adult, I wouldn't recommend this series for younger audiences.Nonetheless, it's constantly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty well developed for only 10 episodes, all except(in my opinion) Wolf, so be prepared to not hear a lot of his back story unlike some of the other more main characters.Overall, it's a really good, enjoyable little demon themed anime.

It's jokes are usually more adult, I wouldn't recommend this series for younger audiences.Nonetheless, it's constantly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty well developed for only 10 episodes, all except(in my opinion) Wolf, so be prepared to not hear a lot of his back story unlike some of the other more main characters.Overall, it's a really good, enjoyable little demon themed anime. Be warned though, the ending is a cliffhanger and rather abrupt."", ""This is basically Dragonball with vampires. No, enough said.The important parts of that I got from this anime is: it references dragonball alot for shits and giggles. No other reason. Yes it does look good and yes its funny, but maybe dragonball references aren't funny to you.The characters aren't unique at all, its the same stereotypes you see in literally any anime. The story is the interesting part IMO. It ties magic and technology with vampires, werewolves with a ton of fighting. Not bad at all.There is subtle romance and ecchi but other than huge oppai (which are a staple of ANY anime these days...to get more sales) on the main girl character along with her clueless klutz like attitude. So instead of just the MC, now you have two idiots as main characters. I wish more anime were like this.Overall this is a light hearted anime. It has very cool and some serious moments, but its slap-happy type of fun.I recommend it! Especially if you like dragonball.

Lol"", ""Warning possible SpoilersUsually in anime monsters, demons, vampires etc are considered the villains of the show and end up being defeated by the hero, however Blood Lad decides to concentrate on the whole monster aspect and their world making for one somewhat interesting setup.Story (7/10)The story focuses on Staz, a vampire who rules a section of the demon world. One day a random human girl called Fuyumi finds herself in the demon world and whilst under Staz's protection she gets eaten and becomes a ghost. Staz vows to bring her back to life.Now as simple as the premise is, a lot more stuff goes on...in this show than you think especially considering it's only 10 episodes, so a lot of content was squished into this.It starts out fairly normal as Staz tries his best finding ways of bringing Fuyumi back to life while also getting caught up in ridiculous situations.But as the show goes on it starts to get more plot heavy as more characters are introduced and we get to know more about Staz's history and other family members, I thought this was an interesting addition to the story and kept me hooked, then as we enter the final episodes the story focused more on Fuyumi and her family issues which seemed like it had cropped up out of nowhere, but if have good attention to detail then you probably knew there was something odd about Fuyumi in the first place.Another story line develops along the way too, which is the state of power in the demon world and this was mainly to do with Staz's brother Braz. This tied in once again with their family history and showed how open and expansive this world was.The whole however really has it's up and down moments, the 10 episode length doesn't help with this as I feel like the plot advanced very quickly and never settled in one spot for too long, now this wasn't entirely a bad thing as it kinda suited an anime like this. The problem is that one moment you're concentrating on this thing, then something else gets thrown at you and then something else comes outta nowhere, it got a little tiresome trying to keep track of the amount of things going on and it hurt the story in some way.Characters (8/10)Despite having quite a large cast of characters, most of them were particularly interesting whereas some were interesting, but got a little worse over time.Staz is the MC and a vampire, now even though he's a vampire he tends to have a lazy kind of attitude making people underestimate him, but that is always a bad thing as he is incredibly powerful. He is also very stubborn, doesn't really have much sense of things and is very impetuous, but despite these shortcomings whenever he sets a goal for himself he always makes sure it is done, plus unlike most monsters you see he has an extreme interest in the human world and the products they have.Fuyumi is the female MC, she randomly ends up in the demon world and becomes a ghost after being eaten by a plant. Now you may think she is there for just bland fanservice and in some cases you might be right, but she had a mysterious nature and always had some kind of importance even though she was the butt end of Staz's jokes and actions yet out of all the characters in the show she seemed like the most reasonable and always pointed out how stupid some situations were. Plus she's cute as hell, you can't ignore a cute girl like her.Bell is a sorceress, who tends to get in Staz's way of his goal. At first I really liked her personality as it reminded me of Haruko from FLCL, but despite her funny, playful yet short tempered attitude she slowly became a somewhat forced love interest for Staz and this just didn't fit right for her character, which in the end hurt her reputation a little.Wolf is like Staz, a demon boss, but he is a werewolf. Wolf is a badass and definitely goes great with Staz's character since the two are friendly rivals, he is strong willed and ambitious making him a force to be reckoned with which is why you wouldn't want to fight the fella. He also has a short temper, though much worse than Bells and tends to take his frustration out on his goons, but he means well and does have a caring nature especially towards Staz and his friends. Sadly his presence in the show is kinda cut short as he leaves the group shortly before the final episodes, which sucked since he was a great character alongside Staz.Art (8/10)I will give credit where credit is due, because this was a surprisingly colourful show, each scene looked like a goddamn rainbow, well unless the setting was dark and evil then that's a different story, but it always captured the scenes very nicely. I also liked the punk aspect of Staz's area and the lettering too making it seem like he was a proper gang boss. The other areas were alright too and made the demon world look big and expansive showing it could be as large or even bigger than our own world.Even the characters had a very colourful essence, the amount of outfits and costumes they wore was a lot and surprisingly they fitted the characters well, I especially liked the black jacket getup that Staz had at some point making him look pretty badass, plus it was also funny how the show kinda knew when it was putting Fuyumi in revealing clothing like it was a joke towards other anime's that had busty looking female characters wearing revealing outfits.Sound (7/10)The sound wasn't too bad either, I enjoyed the op which was nicely tuned to the way the show was, which was all over the damn place. Although I feel like the opening kinda spoiled the events that were going to happen and this is something I slowly noticed over time and I suddenly knew where the next locations were going to be. However the op was still fun to listen to.The ed was actually ok, it had the mysterious element that represented a part of Fuyumi's character, but just like the opening it kinda spoiled a story line that would connect her and Bell's characters although not in the way I was expecting.It's soundtrack was pretty surprising, it had great intense pieces for when the action scenes happened and gave them a feeling like there was a lot at stake if the hero's didn't win.Extras:The action was pretty damn sweet, they were quick, thrilling and pretty suspenseful considering what was on the line. The best was definitely the boxing match between Staz and Wolf which just seemed funnily out of place compared to every other battle. However there were some battles that relied more on wit than brawn like when Bell was trying to trap Staz in one of her dimension cages and he ended up outwitting her in a pretty hilarious way.Now when it comes to comedy, this show was a bit of a mixed bag. It didn't start off too well with the comedy and the only funny moments were mainly between Staz and Fuyumi along with the instances that involved Bell, but slowly over time the comedy did get better and better as the characters got into more ridiculous situations.I liked how the supernatural was the entire focus point of the show, usually if would be something supernatural set in the human world, but for once it's actually set in the world of the supernatural which isn't something where many anime's (from what I've seen) are set. So it was nice to see a different kind of setting compared to other anime's I've seen in the past.Enjoyment (7/10)Overall (7/10)Overall this is a pretty short and sweet show, colourful and mostly fun characters and a heavily focused supernatural setting makes this a pretty memorable show that hopefully one day will get the second season it deserves. in this show than you think especially considering it's only 10 episodes, so a lot of content was squished into this.It starts out fairly normal as Staz tries his best finding ways of bringing Fuyumi back to life while also getting caught up in ridiculous situations.But as the show goes on it starts to get more plot heavy as more characters are introduced and we get to know more about Staz's history and other family members, I thought this was an interesting addition to the story and kept me hooked, then as we enter the final episodes the story focused more on Fuyumi and her family issues which seemed like it had cropped up out of nowhere, but if have good attention to detail then you probably knew there was something odd about Fuyumi in the first place.Another story line develops along the way too, which is the state of power in the demon world and this was mainly to do with Staz's brother Braz.

Without looking at the genres or reading the synopsis, I went to watch it and was surprised to be introduced to a weeaboo vampire and a shit ton of jokes thrown at my face. This was fine, I love comedy anime, but the comedy in this show just wasn't very funny. I actually almost dropped it in the first half because I was painful bored. The story wasn't interesting to me and the jokes were unfunny. The second half, however, I...did find entertaining at the very least, though the same problems were there, just less prevalent. Most of the jokes weren't funny and the story was mediocre at best.Now into the specifics. As for the art. I did like the art style, though I feel like some aspects were poorly drawn. Like the eyes were sometimes way too big and the boobs. I'm not one to get upset over big anime boobs but the boobs in this show just looked stupid most of the time.As for the characters, they weren't very interesting. The character who interested me the most was Bell and even she wasn't very intriguing. Also, some parts of their character just made no sense. Bell being in love with Staz felt randomly thrown in there and Staz's personality was inconsistent. This may be a little nitpicky, but these are things that bugged me.I think Blood Lad is what to me, your average, mediocre anime looks like. Silly, dumb jokes, fanservice, trope-y characters, etc. It's an anime you watch when you're bored and want to watch something mindless, not something you analyze or recommend to others. did find entertaining at the very least, though the same problems were there, just less prevalent.

Vampire-themed series are not new nowadays. Blood Lad is one of them. I first encountered Blood Lad on a manga site, the art on it really pulled me in. Its comedic feel didn't left me hanging in the air too. So I kinda expected a lot in the anime.The story revolves around Staz, an otaku-vampire who's obsessed about Japan. He also happens to be a territory boss in the world of demons. One day a girl named Yanagi Fuyumi, a female Japanese high-school girl ended up in Staz's territory. Staz being the one who's obsessed about Japan quickly took the advantage of talking to...her. But during their conversation, someone is trying to capture Staz's territory. Staz succesfully defends his territory, but left Fuyumi unguarded. She died then turned into a ghost. Staz then made a promise to Fuyumi that he'll turn Fuyumi back to human. So that's basically what the plot is.The art is undoubtly great, like I've been saying on most of my reviews; we rarely see ugly nowadays. And Blood Lad is no exception.As for the music. Opening theme was made by May'n which brought us a lot of good OST's. The ending wasn't half bad too. The series contains only 10 episodes, so they didn't bother changing the opening or ending theme.The characters turned out pretty good too!

Well the good thing is that its quite longer than the translated manga on the net. They added a couple of scenes to the story in the anime though. It progressed a little bit different. I enjoyed Blood Lad, it was definitely a good watch for me. A little action and a comedic series once in a while is what I needed these days. I loved how they kept the fan service at minimal. Too much fanservice almost always destroy a lot of good series. But it the end, Blood Lad shows a lot of potential in terms of being a great action-packed series. There were quite a few scenes which shows Blood Lad has a chance of having romance in it. I just hope they make the second season better, and a little bit longer than 10 episodes. For me, Blood Lad was finally reaching its peak then it was ended on the tenth episode. I was truthfully disappointed how short the series came out. I gave Blood Lad an 8, maybe a 9 if it was longer.

If not for the measly 10 episode run-time, this show would have easily been a 10/10 for me.[First Encounter; Second Chance]When I first watched Blood Lad, I was but a pleebaboo. At that point, I had only seen shows like Highschool DXD and Noragami. Not to say that these shows are bad, of course, but they aren\'t representative of anime as a whole. Nonetheless, due to my ignorance at the time, I dropped Blood Lad and gave it a 2/10 rating, noting that ""this show was fucking boring"".Two years...later, after many thousands of hours spent weebing out, I decided that I would give Blood Lad another chance. I\'m glad I did.[City Folks Just Don\'t Get It.]Blood Lad is a great show- if you\'re in on the joke. Blood Lad is very much a parody anime ripe with subversion and throwaway gags. To a normie, it might not make sense that a character is referencing strict TV-PG13 guidelines while censored and riddled with bullet wounds- but to a weeb, it\'s pretty hilarious and self-aware.[Staz the Lad]Staz is a great character. He reminds me a lot of Yato from Noragami- in fact, the entire anime as a whole does. The premises are almost identical, in fact. A girl is accidentally dragged into a world that she doesn\'t belong to and a powerful, yet irresponsible lad promises to help her return to her normal life.[Overall]If you feel like an offhanded Dragon Ball reference wouldn\'t go over your head, give this anime a try.

It is definitely a satire of sorts. Definitely playing off most of the standard vampire stories. Now I would not recommend the anime, but I would recommend the manga. There is a lot of time in the manga for the story to mature, and you get to personally know the characters. As well as their motivations. While with this one they planned on making a second season that has not even had a release date. So this results in a super rushed and kind of non sense story. You kind of feel lost on why the characters want to do what they...do. I also felt like this anime could of had so much more. It is a great satire, and a decent little comedy. However knowing how great the manga was. It kind of hurts knowing what this anime could have been. Despite those downfalls. I thought that the art and sound were pretty fantastic. The animation really compliments the manga, and it is great eye candy. The voice acting was pretty good to. Although the main girl does sound a little to high pitched for my taste, but if yah like that. Have at it haus. So overall. I would recommend this anime, but do not expect huge and great things from it. Hopefully the second season comes in, and helps pick up where this anime left off. do.

One thing leads to another and the girl dies and becomes a ghost. Now it\'s up to Staz to try to resurrect her back to life.I would like to say the story is very refreshing for a vampire anime. However, the more episodes you watch, the more you kind of forget what the main goal of the story was. Each episode ends with them trying to get something which just keeps piling with more stuff along the way. With those things coming in, it might take forever in order for the main character to get back to his main goal.Art: 5The art style was really good. It was bright, colorful, and just something nice to look at. The character art was good, but the background art made it have more lower points. For me, the background was just blurry blocks that could have shaped a building or some sort, and they just colored it with whatever neon color they wanted.Sound: 7The opening had this upbeat rock music that I really liked. The OST was pretty good too but it didn\'t have that much significance for me to listen to it again. The voice acting was good but sometimes it just sounded a bit too forced for me. I guess it\'s just my way of thinking.Character: 4One of the lowest I have for this, the reason why I chose this is because the only noticeable character development I found was the main character himself. Otherwise than that, the other characters just kind of stayed the same as they were when we first saw them. I don\'t want to be that mean because the show was just 10 episodes so they couldn\'t bring out character development for all the other characters but still... just try and show a little of development some.Enjoyment: 7Despite all my protests, I liked the show. It was very refreshing to find a different story line than all those other vampire anime\'s. But it was around the last episode that left a lot of questions unanswered. I don\'t want to say any other spoilers otherwise than that.Overall: 6In conclusion, Blood Lad is an anime that was fair enough and I could recommend to you guys if you want to watch a different vampire story! the part of ""ruling"".

Final thoughts?3.5/10I picked this up as it had been sitting in my Hulu queue for quite some time now, the art was what caught my eye when I added it to the list and to be quite frank that's really the only reason I continued on with it.Plot-2/10It really wasn't that interesting to me, I found the show hard to keep interested in as I didn't find it really intriguing, the plot itself did peak my interest but when I was actually watching it, I found myself anticipating the end more than anything. I never found Otaku culture in anime...to be fascinating, the genre itself was honestly ruined for me a while back. I prefer every other genre than that. And even though it had action and comedy it truly wasn't my cup of tea.Animation-5/10The art itself was nothing too special but it was pleasing! The fight scenes did really get me absorbed into the show when they were happening, I'm also a small fan of pop colors at random moments so I also did enjoy those scenes. But that being said, if I hadn't added it into my list years ago I doubt I would've watched it today as the art didn't really catch my eye as compared to other stuff I've watched.Characters-3/10Once again, the characters weren't exactly interesting in my opinion, the only ones I truly enjoyed weren't even the main *main* characters, and that was Wolf and Bell. Otherwise, I didn't really enjoy them, I pitied Liz and Fuyumi more than anything, everyone else seemed to annoy me, especially Staz. I just couldn't click with them. If a majority of them didn't have dub voice actors I found comfort in, I probably wouldn't even like them as much as I do.Overall thoughts-I'm not saying it's the worst anime known to man, I'd rather go through this again than deal with the disaster that is Rosario, but will I ever pick up the manga? Maybe, it's at the bottom of my list. Will I rewatch this or collect merchandise from it? Nope! I might give it a try again in the future but it's wasted potential in my opinion. to be fascinating, the genre itself was honestly ruined for me a while back. I prefer every other genre than that.

Of course, I almost never drop an anime unless it's boring me to death, and because this anime was short, I managed to finish. It was a pain. By episode 4 I just wanted to finish. The problems?The story was decent, it had somewhat cohesion and it had some interesting themes like doppelganger demons and spacial teletransportation but god it was boring. There was so much talking and the few little fights were just because of shows....If you eliminated them, probably the story would still make sense.Sound, the voice acting was so boring, no personality for the characters (with or without the voice they still hadno character.) The opening and ending were generic, nothing new, and some sound effects I swear to god I heard them in a flash mini game I used to play when I was a kid. So poor.The characters are SO generic, cliché and boring. They had no personality. Main character, confident, powerful and goofy character that his main character trait is been an otaku. The supporting female character, big boobs, innocent, damsel in distress and somewhat oblivious. The Wolf kid was just an edgy guy, and the Bell girl is just the smuggy, playful girl with big boobs, as always.  I don't even want to talk about the characters so basically boring. The characters are BORING.I didn't enjoyed this at all, not a moment of laughter or interest, the only reason i finished this it's because it was too short to leave it half way.

The overrated ""Twilight Saga"" has been crashing on earth with undoubtedly stupid characters that appears to be handsome and beautiful for some. In my case, I hate horribly attention-seeking vampires. I mean, where\'s the action? The great ride to fame and success? The creepy-looking and blood-sucking vampires?On the other hand, an anime arrived with a rather awesome entrance... Here is Blood Lad. It is an anime which I started watching just now and finished it in only one day. SO how did a ten-episode anime caught the attention of a girl like me?...Basically, I saw it airing in one of the channels of the television and I caught a glimpse of the first episode and naturally made me curious. This anime has no sparkling vampire bullshit and having boyfriends and stuff.Blood Lad has its extremes and ordinary spots but in the end, it had quite a long journey for me to get captivated to its story. Staz, an otaku vampire who loves the stuff in the human world occasionally met a human girl namely Fuyumi Yanagi who ended up being a ghost. With lots of mayhem and outrageous outcomes, Staz completely swore to Fuyumi that he will bring her back to life. The itinerary to get there is capricious to take because it changes from one character to another and another conflict arises in each episode. It leads to an absolute long way in order finally get the ending that we want. There are no fillers added and every scene seems adequate to the story line. Some romance can also be depicted from the story but it isn\'t the main idea of the plot so it isn\'t shojo-ish. Some famous japanese celebrities and anime characters (some are uncredited take Dragonball Z as an example) are being mentioned once in awhile. It isn\'t all that original considering its gloomy atmosphere and overly-mentioned type of characters but secrets will be revealed, a whole bunch of action scenes will appear, comedic acts and gags will also be expected and most of all, the never-ending ""deals""of each characters that led to one place to the other which will make you watch every episode with your eyes open.Brain\'s Base is an animation studio which produced Durarara!, Baccano, Isshukan Friends, etc. Blood Lad had its outmost style of high quality and definition that I\'ve seen before. It aired last 2013 so what do you expect? It\'s new, hip and attractive to the eyes. What made it different is that, gigantic letters keep floating or rather attacking on the screen which is very manga-like. It has the Durarara! essence that I\'ve witnessed before. The yellow bright lines caught up to me and it quickly reminded me of Durarara! Anyway, the animation on the barbaric fighting scenes were amazing and phenominal.The sound was a bit undermined. I believe that it needs more improvement and it was one of my biggest concerns about the series. It didn\'t stand out and my option is that they should hire the musical scorer of Durarara!, Soul Eater or Death Note because all of those dark animes have ridiculously awesome soundtracks and background music. I can\'t even remember the tune of the OP and ED of Blood Lad. The voice actors did well somehow and not a single issue was made.Adapted from demons and Halloween Characters, i can help but remember SE. However, Blood Lad has characters that were just fine. Some are annoying and nonchalant. Some are heroic, cool and likable and some are just plain stupid and trashy altogether. The characters have their strengths and weaknesses but it didn\'t bother me that much and they did not catch my whole attention. I like them when they are in the same scene but individually, they are just simple and not really that special. The antagonists look really good and powerful but the main character was just not compelling to me. I also hated that all women were big-busted but it never grabbed my attention so it was just a tame damage.In Karneval, I liked watching the first episode because it had a mysterious way of telling a story and everything seems so vague but exciting until in the latter episodes, it became flat and boring but Blood Lad is different. It is one of those shows that may be pitchy and unfulfilling to watch at first but as soon as you get to the middle episodes, you will get hooked and attentive. It was the kind of anime that I\'d almost given up at first but then as soon as I watch it, It had superior potential after all. The antics were mild at first but soon you will die of laughter after a few episodes. The battle scenes were just great and not too shabby. I just have to criticize the fan service which irritates me a lot but at least it isn\'t forced and it\'s nothing but a bland distraction.Inclusively, I do believe that this 10-episode anime deserves a nine because other 12 episode shoujo animes were not my interests. This is a must watch series that will keep you waiting for the next episode to come up. I do want this anime to have a second season and I will wait for the manga to end awesome-ly.

The fist of which is that, many times, the places they were in were completely void of people other than the main characters. It would've been nice if there were more extras in the background. The lack of people made it seem like the places they were in were desolate, even when they were in cities. Luckily, this problem was remedied towards the end. The other issue is that there's no way to tell how the different places they go to are connected. There was never an...overhead view or a map that pointed out all of the different locations. There are also a lot of isolated views. They never really show too much of the location that they are in, so it's hard to get a grasp of the locations.The show has a good story which really started to pick up towards the end of the show. It seems like there will be a second season. There's also some funny parts in each episode. I look forward to reading the manga and hopefully watching a second season if there is one. overhead view or a map that pointed out all of the different locations.

And not the good kind of conflicted. It\'s not that the characters are bad, the overused vampire thing or anything like that, it\'s just something is unsatisfactory about this anime. (possible spoilers)Story:The story was so cute at first! the first episode really intrigued me, i thought that Fuyumi was precious and Staz was so cool! not to mention Wolf and Staz\'s friendship was really sweet, but something about this story was so meh. It\'s slightly above average. Not saying that you shouldn\'t watch, if you like easy to keep up...with and adorable anime i suggest this.The fights were lame, the fights felt like they only existed to show how strong Staz is, which inherently isn\'t a bad thing if it feels right. But in Bloodlad\'s case, it just feels so boring, like the fights feel so empty and meaningless.Characters:Fuyumi may be a boring, airheaded, walking pair of tits but i love her! i feel like if she was more fleshed out like Staz was it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable. sure she has her moments where she feels more real but i like how dumb and adorable she is. As for our main character Staz, he\'s pretty cool, i mean hes super over powered but i enjoy his selfishness at the start and how he starts thinking for Fuyumi more towards the end. Wolf is super cute and i love him period. He\'s not like super duper important but once again his and Staz\'s friendship is lovely. Bell is cute, she\'s kind of annoying but the moments when we get more of her are nice. Staz\'s brother is so fucking lame, his character is just ""oh im scary and you can trust me but you cant"" and it\'s just annoying but i suppose that\'s the point.There\'s so many cute characters, the world seems so big and so full of all these colorful characters.I feel like they\'re the best part of the show, especially the cute little followers of Staz who watch over his territory, i really enjoyed their scenes.Art:I DIG THE ART. i started watching simply because the art looked nice. i love the style and the colors are nice too.Overall enjoyment:the series was fun, it\'s definitely got a nice uniqueness to it, and i like that, i haven\'t found a series like this in a while. But it wouldn\'t be the first thing i go out recommending, and i definitely am not going to think about it in a couple weeks. I\'ll probably either give the manga or the OVA a chance since I\'d like to know what happens to Fuyumi and Staz but I\'m not entirely sure.

It seems to me that the anime is mostly to garner interest in the manga, which is fine I guess, but if you're looking for a stand alone story, look elsewhere. It doesn't really end conclusively. At all. I found that irritating, but overall I'm glad I watched Blood Lad. Other than that, my only criticisms are that it is too short (didn't really develop the story enough to do it justice) and that this is too much fan service (that is not the way breasts work, sorry).

Not a lot of people seem to remember it anymore...and that is what made me interested in it. Years after the craze had died down, I decided to check it out. Here is what I thought about this series.The bold presentation style was one of this anime\'s strong points. One of the main perks of this anime was it\'s vibrant colour palette. Even though it takes place in the demon world for the most part, the atmosphere and colours blend...dark and light perfectly. The one thing I disliked about the anime was it\'s insertion of fanservice where it didn\'t need to be. It felt like someone was adding it on to sell the anime and not for much else, when the scenes in the source material did not feature fanservice or were drawn as gags.The characters were a mixed bag. They range from lovable and amazing, to bland, to just frustrating and annoying. I absolutely *hated* Bel, and felt that she is the worst example of a tsundere, letting people get into danger all because of her obsession with a man who does not want her, but hey, people will like her anyways because FANSERVICE. -.- Fuyuki was sort of bland, and at times felt like she was just there, but was pretty non-offensive. She got a bit more interesting as the series went on, but during the first half of it she is just bland. Staz and Liz were the best characters in the show, and their interactions in the series were actually pretty cute. I loved how Staz learns to become responsible for his little sister when he is shown from the beginning to be such a self-centered character. Wolf was also a decent character, and I like how the whole ""vampires and werewolves hate each other"" trope was averted.The story was decent, but was cut off right when it was getting interesting. I guess this is due to the anime not getting renewed. I think if this show had more than 10 episodes, it could have gotten more room to stretch it\'s legs and be a more complete story, but what we got was just decent.

The good thing is that it has a pretty good animation and a decent character design, although it is not the best, it is not bad either. The soundtrack isn't bad but it doesn't stand out too much either. The best thing about the series is the...relationship between the protagonist and the human.

The story and characters were very clever and creative yet classic (vampire vs.werewolf). It combines a lot of similar humor from other popular animes which gave me a familiar sense of humor.I do wish there was more episodes because it was had so little episode the story felt rushed. For me, the beginning felt rushed. I needed more episodes to fall in love with the characters more and further developed their storyline. I would also want more episodes to show the character struggles especially Wolf since he isn't shown much yet he is very much a mystery....However, the concept of the anime is cute and enjoyable!However, I heard there's no mention of season 2 which is very unfortunate but hopefully, in the future, there will be.

Before I begin my review, I would like to thank the people behind making this underrated anime. Now my review begins:First, the rating. The rating should be higher in my opinion. It should be 8.00. Seriously this anime is a HIDDEN GEM today!!! I love the story, parody, characters, everything. The story is top notch. I have never seen a story like this. The comedic vibe is funny. The character development is great for me. The parody is awesome. I felt like watching 2 anime series in 1 anime. The action is also great complete with a comedy element. Every episode...is worth the time.The main character is one of my favorite anime character. He has funny personality. The side characters have enough screentime and they are also entertaining to watch.The anime has only 10 episodes but it was a fun ride. Too bad it ended with a cliffhanger. Please make Season 2 of this anime ASAP!!! I believe everyone will love it! To those who haven't seen yet the anime, pls watch it.

Oh boy, he is very entertaining with his insomniac look and nihilist attitude towards everything. I love how he observes himself like he is some kind of an outsider in his own body. He has the strangest fashion style and he obsessed with everything coming from Japan....He has the greatest respect for his manga/anime heroes..but I don't want to spoiler anything. Well, the best people to be in control always the people who don't want to be in control and he is exactly like that. He is the reason why this anime got some fame. Otherwise, it would be a very low-quality show story and character-wise.2, Art: I loved the art. It was something interesting to me. Many times reminded me more to comics than animes. Also I loved how they mixed hip-hop and underground style into it. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of anime girls with huge boobs and of all the perverted jokes, so that's definitely a minus for me. However, everything else looked very good.3, Sound: I loved the music! Soundtracks rarely catch my attention but this one was a bingo.

It has a spin on comedy a different approach that you don't see a lot of in anime, characters that have there own sense of humor that blend together to make it a surprisingly very funny show.I called it refreshing because although short it gives a lot of information not to much but enough and it doesn't drag out the episodes with useless fillers that makes it feel like it going on forever.It also has character development actually...makes you care about the characters. Action that is not overboard but still has plenty of epic moves in it. Magic that you want to learn more about. A good romance plot that isn't to obvious but you know kinda whats gonna happen.All-in all if i had to sum up what i thought of this anime in one sentence it would be:Blood Lad is a very good anime, it doesn't leave you feeling like they could've done better or you just wasted my time with boring fillers and the spoiled the end with a crappy finish, no it has the right amount of everything action, romance, powers, comedy and characters.

I typically watch anime without reading the synopses beforehand, so I went into this one blind, just like all the rest.It was a little jarring since I didn't know the story was about a vampire who lived in the demon world, but I came to love it. I am a little sad that the entire manga wasn't adapted into anime, but I suppose that gives me more of an incentive to read the rest, right?I found Staz to be...a great, dynamic character with a lot of potential for growth and development, which is what I like to see in a main character. Wolf is absolutely precious, and I wish he'd gotten more screen time. Fuyumi is adorable, and I want to protect her with my life.Honestly, it's hard to say anything bad about Blood Lad.

Especially those of a fighting, Shonen Jump style. Not everybody has time to watch a thousand Bleach episodes. Hell, at this point in life, I'd struggle to get through a 24 episode series. 10 episodes is a sweet spot--I can knock it out in about a week without too much effort.Length is both Blood Lad's best quality and worst enemy. It was nice being able to watch through a series for once, rather than start a few episodes and get intimidated by the length. on the other hand, to get to 10 episodes, Blood Lad...just threw the concept of narrative into the air and shot it with a shotgun. Is it worth extoling a short length when the story so obviously needed extra time to flex its muscles?Aside from the weird jumps forward in time that it does in between episodes, Blood Lad simply doesn't have an ending. It just stops.

I really wasn\'t expecting it to be an overly serious anime but it was bordering on parody and I\'m not usually into that kind of comedy so it through me off at first but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.Story - 6.9/10 - The story was decent and was written pretty well. It\'s about a Vampire named Staz Charlie Blood that goes by Staz and a human teenage girl named Fuyumi. Staz is an delinquent otaku vampire that absolutely loves Japanese culture especially anything anime and...manga related and he lives in the Demon World. On the other hand, Fuyumi is a cheerful highschool girl from Earth who accidentally finds her way into the Demon World. Once in the Demon World she meets Staz and shortly after she ends up unable to return back to Earth because of an incident. The story is basically Staz and Fuyumi going around the Demon World trying to find a way to get Fuyumi back to Earth so Staz can live his dream of going to Japan and buying tons of merchandise. There\'s so much random funny things and small parodies that act as an homage to other anime. One such moment is when Staz does a special move of one of his favorite manga characters which is Goku and does a Kamehameha which is one of my favorite moments. The jokes and humor were definitely unique and probably not for everyone but it was one of my favorite parts for sure. It\'s basically the characters getting into a bunch shenanigans that don\'t really feel like they have any consequences for but actually are quite impactful towards the plot. Everything seems connected and a few thing from the early episodes end up paying off in the later episodes. It has an open ending that continues in the OVA so I\'m guessing they were hoping for a 2nd season and it could still happen especially since a lot of anime is getting new seasons after ending multiple years ago and there is plenty of source material that actually has a definitive ending.Animation - 6.8/10 - This anime is from 2013 and has a somewhat stylized animation style that I thought was ok. A few little tweaks and I would have given it a 7. The backgrounds were a little flat and I didn\'t really see or feel the depth. It didn\'t give off any realistic vibes and it didn\'t really give me a feeling that it could be a real place. The colors were toned down slightly except for the action scenes where the characters movement was more dynamic. Other scenes that seemed to pop were whenever they paid ""homage"" to any other anime, it seemed like they took extra care when animating those scenes. Another thing about all the references to other anime and manga helps the viewer immerse themselves in watching and waiting to catch the next reference. As for the OP & ED visuals, they were actually very good I thought. The OP did a good job showcasing the characters and some of their abilities without spoiling anything major. I usually find that the older the anime the less likely they have any special or unique visuals during the OP & ED but surprisingly enough, Blood Lad had a fairly unique OP. As for the ED, that had a few little clues as to what happens later in the anime but nothing so overt that it ruins any revelations later on. The main Studio for this project was Brain\'s Base that has done quite a few other good anime and it\'s produced by KlockWorx and 2 other good studios so I\'m surprised it didn\'t get multiple seasons.Sound - 7/10 - This is the one category that I never really know how to review. I thought that the music and SFX for this anime were pretty good and helped set the mood for the scenes. The soundtrack for the OP was good in my opinion and had an upbeat tempo and really helped get the viewer ready for what was to come in the episode. The soundtrack for the ED was more of a love song especially if you read the lyrics. It helps set up the prospect of a relationship between Staz, Fuyumi and a 3rd character. The SFX for this anime were more prevalent and were used more often especially during fight scenes and when characters did their over the top special attacks. It was done as an homage to other anime with characters that yell out their attacks as they use them and the name of the attack pops up on screen in a weird font and it just added to the anime. Also the use of background music and the soundtrack for Blood Lad was good and made watching it more enjoyable.Characters - 7.5/10 - The characters in Blood Lad were done very well and were most definitely my favorite aspect of this anime. The characters that all play a role were fairly flushed out and I felt it did a good job at getting the viewer to know them better in order to gain some kind of attachment to them. I thought that Staz was a good MC and I really enjoyed his character, mostly the fact that he\'s a proud otaku that proudly boasts about his collection of Japanese Manga, Anime, figures and anything pop culture related. Fuyumi was cute and funny, what else can you ask for!? Bell was also cute and was very mischievous, which is a great quality lol. Then Staz\'s siblings were good too, his brooding but nerdy older brother and his little sister that just wants to be acknowledged and receive head pats from her older brothers. Even all the side characters and extra characters had a certain quality about them that just added to the anime. All the characters were designed well and didn\'t really feel out of place. As for the Voice Actoring, I watched the English dub at first and I\'m a predominantly English dub watcher unless I fell the Voice Actors don\'t quite fit the role. The English Voice Actors did a good job I thought but I did end up watching some of the original subtitled version and honestly I liked both versions. I felt that both English and Japanese voice actors did well with the characters and making them feel real in a sense. If I were to recommend which version to watch it would just depend on the viewers taste and preferences but I think either choice is reasonable. I myself tend to watch the dubbed version first, that way I can pay closer attention to the animation and if I really enjoyed the anime, I\'ll rewatch it with subtitles and pay closer attention to the dialogue. Plus I always find with action heavy anime that if I watched it with subtitles I tend to miss some action sequences and when I watch the animation I might miss some dialogue. It all comes down to viewer preferences in the end.Enjoyment - 7/10 - I definitely enjoyed watching this anime especially not really knowing anything about Blood Lad other than the synopsis that was given. I enjoyed the comedic aspects of the anime and all the references to other anime that I recognized were great. I also liked the flow of the episodes and how usually every episode picked up right where the previous episode ended without any hiccups. The characters were funny any interesting for the most part. One thing I will say though is that it was a little short being only 10 episodes long and I felt that it could have fit more information in if it had the extra 2 episodes. Also it had an OVA that picked up immediately after the 10th episode ended so I don\'t know why it wasn\'t just added to the season. Other than that though, I found Blood Lad fairly interesting and definitely enjoyable.Overall - 7/10 - I thought it was a good anime that at the end left me wanting more and thinking about reading the source material. That\'s definitely one of the the things I look at when giving my overall rating, if an anime left me with feelings of wanting more then that\'s a plus. I would have preferred a second season but I\'m sure I\'ll get around to reading the manga seeing how it\'s less than 100 chapters, it won\'t take more than a day or two for me to finish it depending on if it grabs my attention or not. I have to be careful when choosing what to read especially if it\'s over 100 chapters because I have OCD where if I start a series, whether it\'s anime manga or anything else, since I start I have to finish it. It\'s probably the reason why I haven\'t watched any anime with more than 100 episodes either lol. Anyway I\'m getting off topic, overall Blood Lad was a good anime in my opinion and worth a watch for anyone who likes anime that doesn\'t take itself seriously and has a decent sense of humor.Well that review got way longer than I expected. If you read until the end, I commend you for your attention span lol most people would have seen the length and said ""F that"" so I appreciate it. Hopefully the next review of mine will be an abridged version. manga related and he lives in the Demon World.

The characters that all play a role were fairly flushed out and I felt it did a good job at getting the viewer to know them better in order to gain some kind of attachment to them. I thought that Staz was a good MC and I really enjoyed his character, mostly the fact that he\'s a proud otaku that proudly boasts about his collection of Japanese Manga, Anime, figures and anything pop culture related. Fuyumi was cute and funny, what else can you ask for!? Bell was also cute and was very mischievous, which is a great quality lol. Then Staz\'s siblings were good too, his brooding but nerdy older brother and his little sister that just wants to be acknowledged and receive head pats from her older brothers. Even all the side characters and extra characters had a certain quality about them that just added to the anime. All the characters were designed well and didn\'t really feel out of place. As for the Voice Actoring, I watched the English dub at first and I\'m a predominantly English dub watcher unless I fell the Voice Actors don\'t quite fit the role. The English Voice Actors did a good job I thought but I did end up watching some of the original subtitled version and honestly I liked both versions. I felt that both English and Japanese voice actors did well with the characters and making them feel real in a sense. If I were to recommend which version to watch it would just depend on the viewers taste and preferences but I think either choice is reasonable. I myself tend to watch the dubbed version first, that way I can pay closer attention to the animation and if I really enjoyed the anime, I\'ll rewatch it with subtitles and pay closer attention to the dialogue. Plus I always find with action heavy anime that if I watched it with subtitles I tend to miss some action sequences and when I watch the animation I might miss some dialogue. It all comes down to viewer preferences in the end.Enjoyment - 7/10 - I definitely enjoyed watching this anime especially not really knowing anything about Blood Lad other than the synopsis that was given. I enjoyed the comedic aspects of the anime and all the references to other anime that I recognized were great. I also liked the flow of the episodes and how usually every episode picked up right where the previous episode ended without any hiccups. The characters were funny any interesting for the most part. One thing I will say though is that it was a little short being only 10 episodes long and I felt that it could have fit more information in if it had the extra 2 episodes. Also it had an OVA that picked up immediately after the 10th episode ended so I don\'t know why it wasn\'t just added to the season. Other than that though, I found Blood Lad fairly interesting and definitely enjoyable.Overall - 7/10 - I thought it was a good anime that at the end left me wanting more and thinking about reading the source material. That\'s definitely one of the the things I look at when giving my overall rating, if an anime left me with feelings of wanting more then that\'s a plus. I would have preferred a second season but I\'m sure I\'ll get around to reading the manga seeing how it\'s less than 100 chapters, it won\'t take more than a day or two for me to finish it depending on if it grabs my attention or not. I have to be careful when choosing what to read especially if it\'s over 100 chapters because I have OCD where if I start a series, whether it\'s anime manga or anything else, since I start I have to finish it. It\'s probably the reason why I haven\'t watched any anime with more than 100 episodes either lol. Anyway I\'m getting off topic, overall Blood Lad was a good anime in my opinion and worth a watch for anyone who likes anime that doesn\'t take itself seriously and has a decent sense of humor.Well that review got way longer than I expected. If you read until the end, I commend you for your attention span lol most people would have seen the length and said ""F that"" so I appreciate it. Hopefully the next review of mine will be an abridged version.', ""The only real downside is that there isn't a 2nd season. This is wholesome, twisty entertainment - and all they managed to do in the one season was lay out the groundwork. Considering that the entirety of this show is just lead up to a finale that for some reason didn't make it, this is really good. I know a lot of people may be burnt out on vampire animes, but with how many thousands of animes there are out there, they could really just watch something that doesn't have vampires and not hate on a good anime over a silly biase when there are...more non-vampire animes out there than vampire animes. more non-vampire animes out there than vampire animes."", ""If you take this anime as anything more than a comedy action mixed with supernatural, then you'll be severely disappointed. But taken exactly as just that, you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.This was recommended as an anime to watch after Saiki K, but considering the summary and the reviews, I had no idea what to expect comedy or even story wise. Thankfully though, it worked out.True to its word, it's funny. The kind of funny that had me laughing from the sheer ridiculousness certain scenes had and also just from back and forth casual dialogue. Although I'd argue the comedy in Blood Lad is...quite different to Saiki K, it still made me laugh. In fact if I had to describe this kind of humour, it would be a mixture of sarcastic, ironic, deadpan and just plain stupid at times.Funnily enough, there is a plot. And that doesn't get lost within the show using random filler episodes. No, the aim is pretty clear throughout and it's pretty hard to forget because the anime revolves around the two MC's and their goal at almost every given point (almost). I like that the show stayed true to the plot, even if randomness was thrown into every single episode. I couldn't predict half the things that were going to happen and I kinda liked that.But Blood Lad has this in every SINGLE episode without fail. Fan. Service. It was one of the first things I noticed upon starting it. You get used to it, but it's almost funny how the fan service within the show is hardly ever acknowledged by the characters themselves. At one point Fuyumi is completely stark naked and the MC hardly bats an eye because of the situation and later on, she's only in her bra and underwear. Again, MC hardly bats an eye. (Tbh even when she's wearing clothes, there's still major fan service, and same with other female characters).The animation was pretty solid, I liked the design of the characters and it was consistently decent. In terms of the story itself, it was only really a 7/10. The characters all had their own distinctive personalities and I only really disliked Bell (for personal reasons). My enjoyment of it was pretty high (9/10), it's only 10 episodes plus an OVA, so it felt like barely any time had passed once I finished it. It also doesn't look like a season 2 is coming out... ever, which is a shame.Either way, Blood Lad is probably one of those hit or miss animes. People either really enjoy it or just don't get/like the humour, which is fair enough. Don't expect anything too serious and don't expect anything original. The show is pretty much built off cliches and typical character/story tropes. (I'd like to point out that the MC of Blood Lad is way too damn funny and I quite like him as a character). Totally recommend this anime if you're looking for something easy to watch that's both funny, interesting and has too much fan service. quite different to Saiki K, it still made me laugh.

It is in a similar vein to one punch man where it banks on it's hype fights. It you just want to watch some brain dead fun, this is it.

The other episodes seem to have bits of comedy thrown in there at random places to make it seem more exciting.I did enjoy that Staz seems like a different vampire to what you normally would...get in anime with some instances when you can relate back to him.

The protagonist acts on an impulse and whim and decides to save a human girl who stumbles into a demon world. I had fun and enjoyed watching the protagonist and the human stumble across both the human world and the demon world. I actually enjoy the protagonist viewing Japanese Culture from an outsiders perspective and admiring it like most Japanese enthusiasts and Otakus: bewildered and amused by the plethora of Anime and Manga products as well as the homage to the development of technology. The art-style is lackadaisical,...so it intends to insert itself with comedic relief and jokes.  I would say not to take this series too seriously when watching it. There are enough generic tropes and gags to make the tone and setting of the story more light-hearted contrary to the backdrop of the environment and politics of the world. Some would criticize that the character is generic for the sake of being a ""vampire"" and having a bunch of ""over-powered"" moves, but that\'s not really a convincing reason to disconnect from the show. Vampire is an old trope, but its how the characteristic is executed relative to the context and plot. Since this all takes place in the demon world, there is not much emphasis being placed on the fact that the protagonist is a vampire. However, its his lineage of a certain family that makes the plot and context of the story more interesting. In regards to the fights and battles, I am not going to knock on the fights too hard since it is still the beginning of the story and that there is still potential character and story development to be made.The main gripe I have about this series is that it is cut short and left on a cliffhanger. It doesn\'t properly finish its arc and leaves the viewers questioning about what happens next to the protagonist and gang. Some of the character motivation could be flushed out a little more and the pacing is a bit fast. I guess that might just be due to production issues and green-light consensus from the media companies. If you intend to start this series, I would recommend reading the manga afterwards.

Any serious or fairly dramatic scene is undercut with some (insofar as my taste is concerned) decent humor. It\'s something that shouldn\'t be invested in, whether due to it\'s near suffocating shortness, funky pacing, and the fact that it\'s left on a glaring cliffhanger that is in no way resolved as far as reviews on the OVA have read. It\'s not like it\'s animation is anything terribly special, fights are okay with no real weight; neither story wise, nor actual action scene wise,...lacking choreography, punchy animation or real sense of style. It\'s ecchi bait with the leading female characters agency being reduced to having massive boonhongolas and being really ditzy with no real direction or character, with the secondary female lead being initially really quite fun but all of her intimate moments feel fairly forced and eye-roll inducing. Everything about this show.And yet,it was a frankly good time. It\'s not really a series to be taken seriously, Staz as a character undermines any serious edge this show could have maintained, being this bizarre mix of parody and serious that falls flat on its face, but is sort of charming and incredibly entertaining to watch. It\'s a very ""otaku-core"" kind of show, where it knows exactly what it is, how trashy it is, and kind of revels in its own mediocrity. If it actually had a chance to be completed I would honestly recommend this show to any viewers. It\'s a sort of relic of middle two-thousands anime, giving me the same warm/nostalgic feelings that watching any episode of Soul Eater always evokes.But that comes wit ha major caveat-It\'s just unfinished. Setting up for the biggest plot relevant event in the entire show, frankly one of the two important things that even happen in the show- and then it just ends. I know the manga was barely even halfway finished by the time this series was airing, but it honestly desperately needed those last two episodes to at the very least just wrap things up even if it wasn\'t anything crazy, and ended on the same chintzy air it carried throughout its whole runtime. But it doesn\'t, it just ends. No second season, no real conclusion, no closure. Just the set up for something else that would be concluded with the same nonchalance the entire series took. In a way it was sort of sent out to die, it doesn\'t\' even really function as an advertisement for the manga, but then fails to be a complete adaptation since it\'s conclusion was axed.It\'s messy, it\'s frustrating, and more than anything it\'s kind of sad. It\'s a show that doesn\'t deserve any degree of reverence, but it still deserves to be a complete show. In a way it\'d probably be more fondly remembered because of that. But it\'s not, and it won\'t be.But- does that really mean it\'s not worth watching? Nah. not really. I had a much better time than I would have otherwise expected with this show, maybe my acetone soaked brain has finally given up on trying to maintain any sense of pretention and has ceded the fact that I just enjoy art that\'s frankly trashy... which is entirely the case. It kind of sucks, it\'s a really trashy taste with not a whole lot of redeeming qualities, but it\'s very fun. Going it knowing that it won\'t even end won\'t change how abruptly ends, but it\'d probably soften the whiplash that you\'ll have going into it. I like the show, and while you\'re probably better off watching nearly anything else- if you\'ve got the time and nothing to watch, it\'s really nice to just sit back and enjoy some real goofball typa anime. lacking choreography, punchy animation or real sense of style.

Its a bit funny, lude, and serious with characters you'll actually care about by the end for the most part. It's short and to the point and doesn't really have any filler. The world building is pretty decent and how the world works is explained pretty well. I've wanted this twice and the firt time I was a little disappointed with the ending however the second time watching was better since I understood the story a bit more plus it had been a few years since I'd watched it. "", ""Blood Lad is a solid action comedy with an excellent premise that decides to play it safe instead of achieving its full potential. To begin with the story, it serves as a very solid foundation, which provides stable footing for interesting and compelling developments to build upon it. The idea of a demon world which does not overpower the human world which parallels it is a fun distinction, and the complicated political hierarchy that makes up that world makes it feel even more believable. Furthermore, in this world, a vampire otaku encounters a human girl who stumbles into his territory, and hijinks ensue, lending itself...to a naturally funny plot progression. It's a rather fun watch, and the first couple of episodes really feel like something set apart from similar anime in its genre. However, this novelty soon fades as unique characters are reduced to standard archetypes and interesting plot lines are reduced to predictable formulae. Don't get me wrong, the laughs are consistent throughout (even if they're sometimes cheap laughs) and the action is solid, but it abandons what makes it special to the point that it goes from something that stands out to a pretty unremarkable experience by the end, which is a real shame for an anime with such a good hook. A great deal of this is the fault of the characters, but the story bears some responsibility as well, as it becomes predictable less than halfway through, and any twists that present themselves are contrived or otherwise pretty flat by the time they're revealed. The art meanwhile is consistently good, and is definitely one of this show's major strengths. The art direction is utterly unique and highly compelling, from the colorful and vibrant demon world to the strong and unmistakable character designs, it is a treat to watch from start to finish. While the animation isn't revolutionary and the art sometimes deals with minor time or labor saving measures, it all still comes off as sleek and beautiful. I have to reiterate that the character designs are excellent in Blood Lad, and every one was given the care and creative forethought so as to have their own unmistakable aesthetic, no matter how minor they were. Even characters that naturally looked fairly similar, like Staz and Braz, were distinct in enough ways to make them unmistakable between each other. The sound was pretty good, meeting the basic standards of quality for voice acting and sounds of life, but the best part was the OST, which was surprisingly cool and fun to listen to. Not to mention the OP and ED were both quite good, and I don't think I skipped either one a single time. Also, fair warning, there are after-credit scenes in Blood Lad that you are going to want to see. The characters are both the most compelling and disappointing part of the show. While initially every single character is very unique and unlike the vast majority of characters in comparable anime of this genre, they all eventually betray those initial characterizations and settle into bog standard tropes. Staz is the most disappointing, as he goes from this believable and endearing asocial otaku to this typical crime boss badass pretty much without any real warning. This happens with all the unique characters too, like Liz and Hydra Bell. It's honestly very frustrating to see the characters become less interesting as the story goes on, and that definitely loses a lot of points for Blood Lad. Overall, while this show is a visually compelling action packed comedy romp with an ironclad premise and world, it ultimately becomes something very mundane by the end, which is a real shame for something that is still quite good, but had so much more potential. to a naturally funny plot progression.

Staz is the most disappointing, as he goes from this believable and endearing asocial otaku to this typical crime boss badass pretty much without any real warning. This happens with all the unique characters too, like Liz and Hydra Bell. It's honestly very frustrating to see the characters become less interesting as the story goes on, and that definitely loses a lot of points for Blood Lad. Overall, while this show is a visually compelling action packed comedy romp with an ironclad premise and world, it ultimately becomes something very mundane by the end, which is a real shame for something that is still quite good, but had so much more potential."", '[Very minor spoilers ahead]Blood Lad is the type of anime that you would enjoy if it was your first anime, reminisce, rewatch it, and then begin doubting your tastes overall. While bearing -at the very least- an interesting concept of a story, it sadly went mediocre for me in the first hour or less of watching it.Story: 5As stated before, it can be viewed as interesting if you want to be overly kind to yourself, but as the story progresses, the more I realized how many convenient and predictable turns the story can make, all in all, it\'s really nothing special. Some other people could...(and probably did) criticize and deem the plot as shaky at some times, which I wouldn\'t really disagree with, but the mundane storytelling got me so bummed, all I could churn out was the obvious point, that it was really nothing special. Maybe the references could be viewed as surprisingly enjoyable but for me, it didn\'t really change anything, maybe its comedy was the only bearable thing and changed the story from a 4 to a 5 for me I guess.Art: 6I will say, the art is pretty good even when there aren\'t that many fight scenes in the anime itself, it gives off an optimistic aura on the viewer that helps them to keep watching and enduring the show, its portrayal of the comedy it showed was also decently done, and I\'m the type of person that doesn\'t mind, actually appreciates the ""well-versed"" art styles that they gave to the female characters, as horrible as I may sound.Sound: 6I rarely pay attention to sounds in animes unless it really catches my attention and I end up liking them and listening to them until I get sick of them, in this anime I didn\'t find any that I personally enjoyed, but at the same time there were none that I disliked for any reason. Therefore it gets a neutral score from meCharacter: 3Even before meeting any characters, most of the time you can easily tell what kind of person they could be and what they would do or not do to affect to story, in this instance, most of the characters are pretty stale and that alone made it a bit unenjoyable to get attached. I\'m guessing the spotlight mainly shines on our main character, Staz, which is understandable, in a way he can be considered the most interesting character as of now, besides that you\'ve got your usual tropes.Wolf - best friend with an inferiority complexFuyumi - basically Hinata but nerfed and quieterBell - the other girl in a love triangle that\'s the fan-favorite to win but usually losesEnjoyment: 4My previous points stand firm and also apply here, also ending the anime on a cliffhanger is just adding insult to injury at this point...Boy was it disappointing, yet I would still watch an unlikely continuation just to see how worse it gets. (just kidding, I\'d only watch it to see more of Bell or what happened with Akimu near the end)Overall: 4More suited to new anime viewers in my opinion, and the reverse for older ones I would assume, if you\'re just wanting to finish a short 10 episode anime then I wouldn\'t stop you from watching it, but I wouldn\'t be surprised at all if you weren\'t satisfied with how it ended.

Bokura ga Ita,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1222/Bokura_ga_Ita,"[""My review will be different.  I might save you some time:The first half of the show (up through episode 12) was simply wonderful, hovering between 8/10 and 9/10 for me.  I don't even mind what happened on episode 12 — I thought they were both right and both acted right.But.Between episode 13 and the end, it kept drawing out, and out... and out.  It became a true shoujo soap drama where one character picks on the tiniest little things and makes the relationship unnecessarily difficult, while the other character can't get away from the past.  It was slow and tiresome....I just didn't enjoy this second half very much, but it was still watchable, and you will probably be able to stick through it.  Unfortunately, the ending is nothing really worth waiting for anyway.The main girl, Nanami, plays it so perfectly in the first half though.  The way she talks... if I hadn't seen the second half, she'd easily be one of my favorite characters.  Animation: low-budget mediocrity galore with mostly static frames, but they do try to be artistic with it (e.g. all the bubbly framing around key scenes, or how they occasionally blank out one eye for effect).  Pacing: slower than average.  Music: gently compliments every mood, insert songs never feel unwanted or out of place, and they cycle through a remarkable number of ending themes (9!).All in all, I definitely recommend at least starting Bokura ga Ita, and if the front half leaves enough of an impact, perhaps try a bit of the back half for yourself.  It's certainly not awful, but just nowhere near as alluring as the front's wonderfully carefree slice of life, and far more irritating.  And it may leave a bad aftertaste.P.S. — If you do watch the entire thing, be sure to check the manga for the last episode since they leave out a key line after the anime's final scene. (It's in the last few pages of Chapter 31. You'll know it when you see it, but feel free to ask me if you're uncertain.)

I, personally love the genre so I enjoyed BgI to its fullest (mind you, not as much as something like Kanon), however, BgI really leaves you with overwhelming emotions.The story revolves around Takahashi Nanami and Motoharu Yano, two high schoolers who unexpectedly fall in love. As the series moves on, we get to see the ups and downs of their relationship that eventually climaxes when both of them must truly mature or move on - the choice being particularly difficult for Takahashi. Throughout the story, the viewer is introduced to various problems every...couple faces from past influences to jealousy -in the end it's quite a simple plot outline with very gripping dialog (for a drama, that is).Animation is taken care of very well - there's a water color-esque feel  akin to Honey & Clove mixed with standard inked anime. The animation won't wow you but it's still nice to for the eyes.Insert songs create a perfect scene where emotion must strike a chord. Music can make or break a scene and although the songs are prevalent during climaxes, they always seem to get the job done.There's about 4-5 main characters that truly effect the plot - a couple of them are boring and static however the three main ones are the ones you'll come to love or hate. BgI is the type of anime that makes you feel for the character and sympathize with them; although you may not be in Takahahi's shoes, she'll often narrate her thoughts and feelings to you.Overall, I'd suggest this for romance/drama lovers -  I truly enjoyed every second of this anime and I'm searching for the manga right now. The plot, while simple provides a lot of entertainment for the viewer - whether you cry or laugh, Bokura ga Ita delivers what it's good at. couple faces from past influences to jealousy -in the end it's quite a simple plot outline with very gripping dialog (for a drama, that is).Animation is taken care of very well - there's a water color-esque feel  akin to Honey & Clove mixed with standard inked anime.

Drama, drama, drama. If you don\'t want to watch a couple go over countless drama scenarios over and over and over, then don\'t bother with this show.Second, and this might be a slight spoiler, but if you like one of the male leads more than the other, this will make or break the series for you.

So lets get to the brass tacks of this heart wrenching tale of an \'ordinary\' girl and her boyfriend. Clearly the most important part of any deep seeded, plot twist driven, emotional roller coaster is the story. If you have watched any soap opera, telenovela, or romance anime/manga, you know how they normally go, Point A, plot twist, point b, repeat. This works perfectly fine in this show. And it even manages to suck me in to this story from the very beginning.They perfectly sugar coat a taste of things to come, when you realize that such an important thing happens very early in the anime. I laughed a lot and cried a lot and even got pissed alot, but the story story still kept me wanting to know, \'whats going to happen next?\' Behold, the power of the \'next episode\' previews and skillfully placed teasers throughout the ending credits. Never have I experienced such a perfect mix of ending credits, cliffhangers, and music mold into such a unique experience, that I realized that i had spent over 10 hours watching this show.___Art___Aside the standard \'shoujo style\' of drawing, the art direction is actually very \'unique\' to say the least. It\'s sort of hard to describe the awkwardness I kept feeling when ever I tried to determine the feelings of the characters on screen. The first thing that will stick out the most is that 90% of the time, you will see all the characters with either one eye or no eyes. Now I don\'t know if this is to avoid ""watching"" their emotions like we normally do and instead, watch their emotions through sounds via the voice acting and chance flags. Whatever the reason, its just damn awkward staring at characters for long periods of time without eyes. Sometimes its just downright scary. And a large amount of the time, its not even necessary.Sometimes I thought this was just a move to save time and money since you will also realize that they do A LOT of flashback inserts, especially during the later episodes. If you take a technical standpoint to that issue, from episodes 15 through 26, a full 8 minutes is wasted to the last episode recap, opening theme, and flashbacks to previous episodes. That is disappointing to say the least. But in their defense, each episode is riddled with so many plot and emotional twists that most viewers would easily forget why they are acting \'that way.\'Another useful \'cost cutting\' technique that they seem to over use would be the pan and scan shots. Which means they draw an \'elaborate\' drawing, then they pan and/or zoom the camera up, down, left, right, in and/or out to get the most effect of the drawing. In small doses, this is perfectly fine like in very important (emotional) scenes. But they do take this technique to the Nth degree. Do we really need to see a pan-shot of Nanami\'s face with no eyes for a full 8 seconds? There are many artistic flaws like that.A little bit off topic but, this series does lend itself to very beautiful still shots worthy of any picture frame. Just google search the images for this show and you will understand what I am saying. Ironically, that is the reason why I started watching this show is because of all the artwork depicting this show.___Sound___As with any drama, there is a wide range of emotions being displayed through all the characters. Some of them play it out very well, some of them not so much. But any show that manages to get the audience to relate or feel the same way as the characters on screen, should be commended. They did a great job in creating such a wide range of emotions by not only voice acting, but the music and sound effects played a large part into pushing that emotional envelope.The various songs portrayed in this show all came in at perfect times and never felt like it was awkward or forced. The lyrics to all 9+ songs are sure to bring tears to any drama lovers eyes. As it did with me numerous times. There is nothing really wrong I can say about the music in this show. Its all very appropriate and at times, too appropriate.Again, with such a great execution of song usage, they manage to screw things up with using the same sound effects over way, way, WAY too much. As seasoned, anime fans would know, when a chance time (or flag) occurs, a \'pleasant\' beep would go off. It sounds harmless at first, until you realize they are going to use the same sound effect 10-15 times in every episode.Not every scene when the on screen characters, gasp, gulp, groan, or preform an act of moe, needs to buzzed in. Granted, half of the time the characters don\'t have eyes (the most predominant  way to read their emotions), but at least let the audience realize these flags on their own instead of literally chiming in for us.___Characters____Love them, hate them, or both, they do pull off their lines with ease. They can pull of their personalities with perfection, but for some reason, I had no connection to the characters after watching for a while. I grew to love Nanami and the other cast of characters early on (remember sugar coating), but the plot twists weren\'t living up to my expectations later in the series that I just gave up cheering for them. The fantasy slowly and effortlessly turned into reality. That\'s when I started to become disappointed with it as it started feeling like high school all over again. Take that however you may (good or bad) I\'m sure you\'re like me and just end up wanting to watch what happens next \'just because\'It\'s also a little hard for me to feel an attachment to the characters when they appear not to have any eyes for no apparent reason. I feel like this show would feel much more complete if they completed drawing their eyes, no matter how ugly they are. Kudos to the main cast though as they did manage to just keep it somewhat interesting from beginning to end. Hell, I even caught myself yelling at the screen from time to time at how irrational this drama can be. But hey, that\'s life right?___Enjoyment___No matter if you\'re a drama buff or feeling nostalgic of that love lost in your past, this is indeed an emotional roller coaster for the soul. Be prepared to cry tears of joy and sadness, and reflect on things that could have been that never were. You will most likely experience all of those things. But sadly the production value and direction they took this show is what ultimately gave me this score. I really wanted to give this show a 9 or even a 10, but the excessive nuances are just too much bear for this poor soul. Maybe they might do a re-release down the line. I\'m sure that\'s just wishful thinking on my part. And on that note......What is happiness to you?

The lyrics to all 9+ songs are sure to bring tears to any drama lovers eyes. As it did with me numerous times. There is nothing really wrong I can say about the music in this show. Its all very appropriate and at times, too appropriate.Again, with such a great execution of song usage, they manage to screw things up with using the same sound effects over way, way, WAY too much. As seasoned, anime fans would know, when a chance time (or flag) occurs, a \'pleasant\' beep would go off. It sounds harmless at first, until you realize they are going to use the same sound effect 10-15 times in every episode.Not every scene when the on screen characters, gasp, gulp, groan, or preform an act of moe, needs to buzzed in. Granted, half of the time the characters don\'t have eyes (the most predominant  way to read their emotions), but at least let the audience realize these flags on their own instead of literally chiming in for us.___Characters____Love them, hate them, or both, they do pull off their lines with ease. They can pull of their personalities with perfection, but for some reason, I had no connection to the characters after watching for a while. I grew to love Nanami and the other cast of characters early on (remember sugar coating), but the plot twists weren\'t living up to my expectations later in the series that I just gave up cheering for them. The fantasy slowly and effortlessly turned into reality. That\'s when I started to become disappointed with it as it started feeling like high school all over again. Take that however you may (good or bad) I\'m sure you\'re like me and just end up wanting to watch what happens next \'just because\'It\'s also a little hard for me to feel an attachment to the characters when they appear not to have any eyes for no apparent reason. I feel like this show would feel much more complete if they completed drawing their eyes, no matter how ugly they are. Kudos to the main cast though as they did manage to just keep it somewhat interesting from beginning to end. Hell, I even caught myself yelling at the screen from time to time at how irrational this drama can be. But hey, that\'s life right?___Enjoyment___No matter if you\'re a drama buff or feeling nostalgic of that love lost in your past, this is indeed an emotional roller coaster for the soul. Be prepared to cry tears of joy and sadness, and reflect on things that could have been that never were. You will most likely experience all of those things. But sadly the production value and direction they took this show is what ultimately gave me this score. I really wanted to give this show a 9 or even a 10, but the excessive nuances are just too much bear for this poor soul. Maybe they might do a re-release down the line. I\'m sure that\'s just wishful thinking on my part. And on that note......What is happiness to you?', ""Beginning off with the horrid graphics, Bokura Ga Ita makes for one of the worst animes I have ever seen. True, this might be because I have very high standards and judge from the quality of art and sound. Honestly, I only forced myself to watch a couple of episodes until I finally dropped it for good. Basically, it's a story about a girl who falls in love with this controlling guy who sees his dead girlfriend in the girl. The main guy's best friend also falls in love with the new girl, and it's all screwed up, but not in an interesting way.The storyline,...I will give 4/10. The idea is somewhat original and is pretty realistic, a characteristic that you don't find in many animes.As for art, 1/10. Watch 5 minutes and you'll know what I mean.The sound is decent, though it could have been a lot better.The characters are pretty interesting, despite the poor quality of this show.As for enjoyment of watching this, it might make you depressed. There is not much of a plot in this romance story, and the guy's controlling behavior makes you want to punch him half the time. Overall, I give this anime a 2/10. I will give 4/10.

For this anime it was especially hard just to watch one episode but I sat through two out of the supposed 3 I was planning to watch no matter how painful it was. By golly was it ever so painful.Let\'s start with the problem of the plot itself. Why is it that it\'s always a popular boy with a problem who is admired by some timid girl? Yes I understand that the popular boys are the ones with the traits us girls like but it\'s not like we strive to...date a popular guy. I can almost guess that the friend of the popular Yano, Take will most likely fall in love with Nana at some point in the story. Maybe it was suppose to be that obvious within the first episode already but I seriously doubt they wanted the plot to be exposed before we\'ve gotten a grasp of the characters.The characters are just so cliché that I count even count how many animes have the exact personalities of Nana and Yano. Nana, the girl who just about fits in with the crowd, doesn\'t really stand out and is a total pushover when it comes to class related situations. The common ""Nana"" always depends on the ""Yano"" to come to her rescue like some prince charming. Corresponding to that, the ""Yano"" of the galaxy must always come save the damsel in distress ""Nana"" even though he finds it rather needy. But the ""Yano"" type of character must always help out the dependent ""Nana"" because he\'s just the type of guy every girl wants, helpful, charming and kind.The art was another story. If I really wanted to see this kind of art, I’d re-watch Lovely Complex because the art is pretty much just a better version of the art in Bokura Ga Ita. The character designs are rather simple and bland for my liking and the colors aren\'t bold enough to be eye catching and comfortable. It\'s pretty much like looking at a canvas painted a beige so light it looks like nothing but white.All in all if there was a sequel I’d say ""didn\'t like the first, don\'t plan on watching the second."" date a popular guy.

I\'ll give it a shot and watch it."" I\'m a sucker for romance/shoujo. So let me give you a break down of this anime.

I\'m not sure, but 6 was ""fair"". I didn\'t think it was the most amazing, yet it showed the struggles of a couple and the reality that everything isn\'t all peaches. I felt like it was a really messed up anime also. The story was down-right depressing.Art: Score 6 - FairI felt like it was very old-school styled and the whole time I kept thinking ""Where\'s their other eye? Oh great, they have no face this time lol. Could they have just added another eye for crying out loud?!"" It really bugged me and anyone that watched this anime can not say they didn\'t think that also lol. Also, the art style was very childish.

I’ve lived to meet you."" - Yano', 'Characters in any good story make mistakes and learn from them. That is a fair statement, in my opinion; however in ""Bokura ga Ita"" I felt like I was watching the characters make the same mistakes countless times. In the beginning (let\'s say about 5-6 episodes) the story seemed fine, but as the story went on, the characters kept arguing and fighting over the same things: distrust, past relationships, lack of ability to convey feelings correctly. I kept going to the next episode in hopes that they would finally learn from their mistakes, yet it never happened.After each fight, they would make...up and the same thing would happen again. Neither one seemed to try harder to make it work. They just wouldn\'t get it into their heads what they needed to do. Both Yano and Nanami were making me frustrated throughout the whole anime. Yano wouldn\'t let go of the past and Nanami had major trust issues. In order for their relationship to go farther, they needed to fix these flaws and it was quite obvious.Anyway, you get the point that they had problems. It was majorly disappointing to see their pitiful relationship. I just could not enjoy the story and I did not have feelings for either of the characters. Rather than enjoying the anime, it was as if I was being socked in the face over and over with the painful drama cycle. It would have just been easier and a lot less miserable if they broke up and never got back together if they\'re just going to contiue fighting.  Nanami and Yano didn\'t seem to have true feelings for each other, because if they did, they would want each other\'s happiness. This was no romance anime, it was a war zone.I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t like anything from it, though. It had nice music and the art wasn\'t too bad. There was some good comedy in there as well. But if I knew of all the craziness I was getting myself into before watching this, I wouldn\'t have touched it.

The characters had one eye missing throughout the show. I tried overlooking it but it was extremely distracting. I don’t know whether that was an artistic signature or pure laziness. Artwork team, maybe get your shit together?But what made the entire anime more hard to watch was *drum roll*: the characters. One of the most important elements of the show was the biggest downfall here. The main protagonists were plain dumb and annoying. I tried overlooking the fact that...they were still fresh in high school (although age doesn’t have much to do with it) but man they were constantly getting on my nerves. One small problem was being dragged for so many episodes simply because of a miscommunication and lack of trust? Also, why does every rom-com/shōjou anime glorify the main male lead to be your alpha dominant, arrogant and aggressive type? Being physically/verbally abusive isn’t something you should be displaying in shōjou anime, where the main audience will be young girls, who will grow up thinking it’s okay having someone slapping/pushing/dragging you by your hands? It's not something unique in this show but it's a common trend amongst the genre itself, sadly. It’s unhealthy and it needs to be stopped. And it definitely doesn’t need any more glorification by having the female lead fall for that nonsense, for heaven’s sake.Basically, most of the episode consists of: misunderstanding, lots of crying from the main female lead and unnecessary drama. The entire series was stretched out thin, there was no substance to the show, and nothing could make up for the terrible artwork & even more terrible plot/character development (because there wasn’t ANY to begin with).Also, I watched this on a whim because someone recommended/suggested this alongside Nana? Like, I saw NOTHING in resemblance, not even close. As a huge Nana fan, I’m offended that they were even compared to begin with.PS - Excuse the typos & grammatical errors in advance! they were still fresh in high school (although age doesn’t have much to do with it) but man they were constantly getting on my nerves.

Being an average show who doesn't  stand out from the others who really shine in this genre although it has enough to create a little corner for itself. There's plenty of happiness and sadness, way too balanced actually not favoring each despite the sad scenes show a bit more of...an effort in characterization, its quite dramatic but doesn't go as far as shocking the viewer, I personally prefer heavier emotions, scenes that make you cry a river over a tragic event and then rejoice when the storm has gone and everything ends better. It lacks the shocking developments that made other shows famous and so its somewhat mild and plain in comparison.The characters are the usual clueless filled with uncertainty, fighting over small things and dwelling too deep, trying to attach meaning to things that are much simple, dragging the show into an overextended carrousel that could be done in much lesser episodes, theres the usual love triangles and lots of unrequited love but their just treated as secondary characters mostly. The drawings seem way too simple at the beggining but their more detailed on the crucial scenes and on the closeups, I'm not sure if its an artistic choice or just a way to produce faster but it looks decent enough and in this genre its not really the main concern anyway, it does a good job conveying the feelings of the characters and portraying them to the viewer and thats what matters here. One of my favorite details on the characters is definitely the cuteness in the girls, the clothes, the expressions and even the weird hairstyles of the lead female.The plot evolves into countless break ups and getting back together, it prolly was meant like that but their always contradicting themselves and falling in the same mistakes not learning but also not giving up, it portrays how clueless a teenager can be and how the events in his life make him grow into a stronger adult, but its far from a reality scenario, I personally didn't like it, I don't mind fantasy but when your revolving around human emotions there should be some reality basis there and the show just seems to twist them as they want and in the end their feelings don't evolve much, definitely the weak point here, not so much the story but the development is flawed turning into a loop trying to better explain things and dragging out for too long.The music is one of the good parts, calm and tender, well placed in the emotional moments soothing the mood.

This is probably the worst romance anime series I have ever seen. Now the question is, were to begin with this atrocity?Let's start with shitty character development. You know how when you are watching this genre of anime, it is common to root for the main character while they go through the obstacles keeping them from their love. Good luck rooting for the main character in this story because she is such a whiny...little bitch. I just wanted to choke Nanami out; making mistake after mistake. The male love interest, Yano, has such a fucked up past love life, it makes no sense why he would want to be in a relationship with Nanami in the first place especially since she has no real appeal anyway.

Character development is suppose to be one of the strongest points in this genre and I feel this show lacked the most in the character development department.The story was extremely bland and predictable. It is also soooooooo drug out.

I think that the story is quite realistic and this is something i look at because then you can empathize with the character, even if you don't it grips you because you cannot really tell what will happen...because reality is harsh and thats a fact. The complications that arise from the supporting characters makes the story interesting and the twists kee p you on the edge of your seat.The Art was great i guess, im not so particular about the art but i think they were able to bring out the mood of the story quite well, and the scenic drawings are quite niceThe songs were great. They definitely suit this anime, being sentimental. The drama is brought out thanks to the songs and the insert songs are done up very nicely, you may even like some of the songs as you go along especially since there are like 8 different songs to end the episodes, and they are not in consecutive order,they are selectively used to suit the ending of the episode,which is quite rare in an anime so the sound was astounding.The characters are of course important in the story with the supporting characters playing fairly big roles and are not left out at all like some other animes, they get a good deal of showtime. I myself found that i preferred one of the support chracters to the main chracter and it had me going like how sad it was for him...well i won't spoil it so go found out yourself...the main chracter Nanami is the narrator of the story and it is important as we get inside  the mind of the chracter and see things from her point of view mostly, but its interesting too.I thoroughly enjoyed the show being a drama-romance addict. The show also had its fair share of comic relief from time to time so its not serious everybit of the way. Its one of those shows where every episode leads to the next so your constantly watching non-stop(caution:once you start make you sure you have several hours ahead of you free).The show really pull at your heartstrings. It is a very touching and meaningful story, you will definitely regret it if you don't watch it, its not everyday that you can find an anime like this. A second season will be out in june 2008 so i'm really looking foward to it, you will be too when you finish watching it. :) because reality is harsh and thats a fact.

If you get easily affected by a little drama (like me) this anime will haunt you for a long time after. The anime left me dumbstruck. And increadibly bitter becasue Yano and Nana just never seem to get what they want. I think this is one of the saddest anime's I've watched, and I actually cried once. Ahem, yes.The story is pretty good (9), its very entrancing and you just need to know what happens next. Overall it was really depressing at times, but there was comedy used at the exactly right time so...it kinda balanced it out.The art...was a little weird so I gave it 6. But you do get used to it.The sound -in the anime- made it all the more enjoyable. Props to the composer. Gave it a 9.The charcters were the best. I gave 'em a 10. They're all increadibly likable (except one purple haired person) and you can get really attached.For enjoyment I gave a 9 - because although this anime will stay with me for a long time, and is one of my favourites, it left me increadibly overwhelmed. I was honestly depressed for a whole day after I finished because ...well *sniff* its just that powerful. Although it probably is just me.But really, I totally recommend eveyone who enjoys shojou to watch this. Because its brilliant. it kinda balanced it out.The art...was a little weird so I gave it 6.

I know it sounds bad but it isn\'t not really. Read on>Short Summary:Nanami is starting her high school life. Her first day there isn\'t going as smoothly as she would want; she forgot a classmates name and was given the wrong name by a guy she met, she also happens to start liking the same boy who caused trouble for her. She knows it\'s a bad idea.  Can she win the heart of Yano and...make him forget his past love?Nanami, the lead girl who just wants to make the boy she likes happy and make him look at her, see her, for who she is instead of always comparing or living in the past. She\'s proof that you can\'t control who you start liking. she is honest about her feeling from the start. You\'ll feel sorry for her and at the same time a bit angry that she takes so much crap. I mean, come on!Take who\'s only fault is that he fell inlove with his best friends girl friend. But, does he do anything about it? No, not really, not while they\'re together. He is there for her to talk to her when she feels lost and doesn\'t know what to do. He was probably one of my first friend-zoned characters in anime for me, and it\'s a shame really..not gonna say anything more on that.Yano is unbelievably sweet (sometimes) but he is so dense. He\'s the type of person that if he\'s good, he\'s so good, but if he\'s bad, he should get kicked in the balls for what an insensitive ass he is. You just want to scream at him, ""Move on Yano!"" Gonna be honest, he just made me angry, maybe I need to drink more tea or something.Sometimes you have to lose something to notice it\'s true value, but do you have to lose something multiple times? Come on!The video quality wasn\'t bad, to put in in one word would be mellow. Like the soundtrack, and their voices were genuine to their character and not annoying. The art is different, and a little old fashioned but pleasant. It wasn\'t like regular bubbly anime that focuses on girls boobs or really huge eyes and I thought that was nice. Reminded me a little of ""Lovely Complex""The beginning it\'s better then the end. Maybe better isn\'t the right word. It\'s sweet. You expect it to end differently. I wasn\'t happy when I finished it but now that it\'s had time to settle, it ended just as it should have. Bittersweet.Now why did it left me feeling empty/a little depressed? Because they don\'t give themselves a break. They have the worst timing and even though they love each other it\'s just never ends happy. They expect for it to be 100% ok and life isn\'t 100% ok. You have to know some things are messed up and you have to move on! Me frustrated? PfftWhy an 8 if I sound so unhappy with it, heck if I know, the anime is like a worm that crawls into your brain and cleans up so that it can be the one to mess things up. cooks for you and things.

VERY close. And there\'s a lot of reason\'s.Story: 7At first it seems like your typical high school romance, until they drop a bombshell on you. And I love that, it makes things interesting and entertaining. BUT. BUUUUUT. There are a few things that urked me. I can\'t spoil anything so I can\'t exactly tell you what but trust me if you\'re sane you will understand what I mean. Around episode 16 things just kinda get grueling and unless you\'re team Yano you\'re going to be so very angry...with Nanami your head may explode.Art: 4To be blunt, it kinda sucks. The animation is choppy, majority of the time characters only have one eye or no eyes (Which is very lazy) and the ears.... oh god the ears. It\'s like Yaoi fingers but on a head. Typically I can get passed this and enjoy the show but there will be times when I just kinda sigh at the very lazy attempt at drawing.Sound: 7Your atypical cheesy romance songs. Nothing too special, but it does fit the show. Might have been rated higher if they didn\'t overuse a very annoying ""lalalalalalalala"" track whenever I\'m trying to enjoy a cute scene.Character: 10Now let me tell you a thing. Let me tell you a big thing. This show isn\'t just some silly romance. It is very much a journey into the mind of a young teenage boy who has to deal with a lot. Okay. This show may SEEM like it\'s about some silly little high school romance, but let me tell you a thing, NOTHING in this show is okay. Once you realize the main characters name is the same as another characters, things will click and you will realize just how bad things are. Again, don\'t want to spoil anything, but just know that these characters are VERY  real and VERY understandable. You WILL get attached to them and feel for them.Enjoyment: 6It\'s be a spoiler to explain this. But I was enjoying the show until a certain point where things just get dumb and then I decided to read the comment section and I realized just how much I hate fangirls ignorant, blind, prepubescent hormonal raging lady boners for characters. I found myself getting more angry with the characters and their choices rather than actually being happy for them. I started to ship something other than the main ship which is always an issue with these types of shows because you begin to understand how horrible the main relationship ACTUALLY is. By episode 16 I stopped enjoying myself and rather I began hating the show and coonsidering just stop watching it all together because I knew EXACTLY what was going to happen and I didn\'t like it.Overall: 7To anyone who thinks logically, I recommend watching this show until around episode 15. Anything after that will cause rage and have you take out that rage on a myanimelist review. I wanted to love this show but it was really hard in the later episodes. My hated for Yano just pilled up until I couldn\'t take it anymore and when I went to go discuss and confirm my rage it only made me angrier.If you\'re just looking for a mind numbing romance and you\'re not looking into plot, then I invite you to dive right in. with Nanami your head may explode.Art: 4To be blunt, it kinda sucks.

Girl likes a boy and they\'ll most likely end up together in the end. This is easily the best part of the show.Sound: 5The opening and ending was ehh and so was the background music.Character: 6The main girl character seems good and the main boy character seems ok but the side characters I remember nothing about.Art: 1Ok. This is what destroys the show and makes it pretty much unwatchable. This animation is the...UGLIEST, not the worst, but the most disgusting anime my eyes have feasted upon. I find it hard to believe that a mentally well human being said this show looks good.It looks like a flamingo took a shit, alright, then the shit was consumed by a squirrel who died the next day from the feces.

This looks more cringey than Hillary doing the dab. I\'m going to cut off my pubes and burn them into the microwave just to prove that would look better than this anal release. This looks like Barack Obama has sexually intercourse with a seahorse with Down syndrome, in Colorado. This makes Mars of Destruction\'s animation look like Angel Beats.

Bokura Ga Ita portrays the common obstacles in relationships and the process of overcoming them. It takes place in high school, where a girl named Takahashi Nanami and Yano Motoharu unexpectedy fall in love. The two lovers are often on the verge of breaking and learn to understand each other .Story (8): The beginning of BgI has a good pace and draws you into the story. It's pretty straight to the point and focuses on important events. The middle to around the end drags a bit and might frustrate you, but it didn't keep...me from continuing. Around the end, it picks up pace again (which I really appreciated). You might not like the ending, but I thought the emotions it expressed were worthy of watching (yeah I cried).Art (7): The art isn't amazing, and it distracted me a bit in the beginning, but throughout the anime I got used to it. It has a slight pastel/water-color feeling to it, which I thought was cute.Sound (10): I personally felt that the sound was what kept me watching. The girl's voice was cute and soft, and had a relaxing aura. The music was cute and soft as well, and I thought that it helped establish the mood very well. It was soothing and drew me into the story. The music also left a big impression on me after I finished the series and I kept remembering it when I wasn't watching it.Character (9): In the beginning, I really loved the girl's personality. The way she thinks, the way she talks; it's very realistic. Toward the climax she was a bit frustrating, but that didn't stop me from watching. The main guy's personality might come off as weird, but I thought that it was understandable, judging from what he's been through. Overall, the characters are realistic and the way they develop is understandable.Enjoyment (8): Overall, I enjoyed BgI. Some parts dragged a bit, making it difficult to focus, but it wasn't unbearable.

I like punishing my self for my past mistakes and all the things i did to people...Or maybe i just practice for the day i die and go straight to hell..Now fair warning there's gonna be too much swearing from this point on so if you're one of those fruitcakes who get offended over bad words, may i suggest you get the hell away from here and into your bubble.But we are not here to discuss my issues or my afterlife vacation plans, no..We have gathered here to talk about anime, so buckle up my beauties we...are goin' for a ride.And we start with NOT the story but strangely enough with the animation. Why? Cause it would scar my soul (if i had one) less if some maniac strapped me to a chair and bit my loved ones to death, shorthly after fucking them in the arse with a steel dildo. I don't mean to be rude to the animators.....Who the hell am i kidding, i hope they die a painful death for inflicting this civil war wound onto me. Honest to Mithra this is way more painful to watch than 80's era anime.Ok let me give you some examples..The characters are drawn like apes, with huge ears and weird body structure and what's even worse is that they look like I drew them instead of pro animators..And some legends say that my drawings are being used to summon ancient demons from other dimensions. But that isn't the only thing that's keeping me awake at nights.....It's their damn eyes. Every 2 seconds there's bound to be a scene where either the characters will litterally have no face at all or even worse they only have one eye drawn or even one eyebrow and no fucking eyes. EVERY 2 FUCKING SECONDS. How low was the damn budget for them to not being able to draw 2 eyes and eyebrows in every scene? Or where they bored and didn't even bother?Anyways the animation is so horrid it can make you sick in your stomach.So..What about the story Dion?Oh yes the story..Now here is my second biggest problem with this one, cause the story, while on paper seems quite ok and interesting, on screen not so much.It starts out as your daily slice of life-romance-high school anime where the female main doesn't like the handsome brute of a male main but because she is a woman she doesn't know what she wants so she decides she wants him after all..That's called being stable kids and staying true to your opinions. After this they start dating or something but they always seem to stumble upon many troubles, one of them troubles being their parents who cock block the couple each time they try to get some action going, which to me is buffling cause for the life of me i can't understand why Takahashi would want to fuck Yano in the first place.To put it into perspective, the guy is a huge douche from top to bottom towards her and her being a small minded idiot that she is finds his whole persona cute?! He doesn't hit her or anything but apart from getting physical everything goes....To bring some justification to the mix, the writer thought it was a good idea to put a harsh backstory for Yano.Poor poor Yano as we find out, had a girlfriend who was...Let's say the equivelant of a male slut(see bitches,i'm all for equality) and not only that but she was also in an abusive relationship before hooking up with Yano..But the hands of fate had other plans for her and the abusive bf cause they both died in a car accident which left our little lad broken cause he couldn't fit in his small head that she would go anywhere with her ex....Poor bastard i really felt sorry for him, you know..Learning at such an innocent time in his life that people are lying scumbags who ought to be stabbed and left bleeding in the moonlight.So what did Yano do after that? He actually went and fucked her little sister!!!!Let that sink in for a while...Ok?....Shall i go on?So Yano not only is an asshole but also doesn't know where not to stick his sausage and he now can't trust women as a result so he makes Takahashi's life miserable...At this point you might expect me to say that all goes well, she comes to understand how toxic this thing is and leaves him...Nope, she keeps on staying with him even when she dumps him...How's that possible? Well even i can't tell..Seriously i'm one of those people who have a hard time ending a relationship but if someone is being a total bitch to me i'll kick her in the abdomen and go for some drinks.At this point the writer also thought it would be a good idea to put some love triangle in there too in the form of his best friend liking Takahashi and slugging it out with Yano for her eyes..How poetic....And how idiotic is that? Honestly what is this? Some teenager's fantasy about what the ideal knight romance should be?Long story short Takahashi develops an obssession with his ex and won't go back to being with him unless they talk about her...I'm sorry but when was the last time a woman wanted to hear all about your ex? I get it being curious what with the situation being as fucked up as it is, but who would dwell on it for months? Well i would for one, but that would be for my personal gain.. I'm always on the look for sick stories to laugh about with my mates.I think you get the picture at this point..It's like watching the chronicles of someone who could never let go of her teenage fantasies about the ideal romance and decided to mash them into a green and blue and beige slime.I've said in the past that when writers have many ideas and try to cram them all in there it almost always ends up in the shitter and this anime is a prime example of that. I liked how she tried to implement real life situations and even ones that aren't being presented in most anime and hooray and all that shit but the way they were thrown in there was less than ideal.The way the story was divided was atrocious. 26 eps that were so drawn out they felt like 103 eps, characters that were supposed to rock this place to the ground but ended up being as boring as a clown in a kids party despite the somewhat fucked up background. There were times were the whole thing was going nowhere and just sat there idly showing irrelevant things or even nothing at all..And to add insult to injury the voice acting was subpar and i'm being very generous here. What i think happened here was that they went outside, picked up some strangers of the street and brought them in to deliver the acting..I cannot find another explanation for such empty performance on their part. No emotion whatsoever and no volume...When i say no volume i mean i had to crank up the speakers all the way up to 11 to hear what they were saying. 26 eps of actors whispering their lines.I really wish i could have liked it cause if nothing else, it had some promise. But if failed to deliver in every way possible. Now if you want to watch this go ahead and do so, just don't say i didn't warn you. are goin' for a ride.And we start with NOT the story but strangely enough with the animation. Why?

He doesn't hit her or anything but apart from getting physical everything goes....To bring some justification to the mix, the writer thought it was a good idea to put a harsh backstory for Yano.Poor poor Yano as we find out, had a girlfriend who was...Let's say the equivelant of a male slut(see bitches,i'm all for equality) and not only that but she was also in an abusive relationship before hooking up with Yano..But the hands of fate had other plans for her and the abusive bf cause they both died in a car accident which left our little lad broken cause he couldn't fit in his small head that she would go anywhere with her ex....Poor bastard i really felt sorry for him, you know..Learning at such an innocent time in his life that people are lying scumbags who ought to be stabbed and left bleeding in the moonlight.So what did Yano do after that? He actually went and fucked her little sister!!!!Let that sink in for a while...Ok?....Shall i go on?So Yano not only is an asshole but also doesn't know where not to stick his sausage and he now can't trust women as a result so he makes Takahashi's life miserable...At this point you might expect me to say that all goes well, she comes to understand how toxic this thing is and leaves him...Nope, she keeps on staying with him even when she dumps him...How's that possible? Well even i can't tell..Seriously i'm one of those people who have a hard time ending a relationship but if someone is being a total bitch to me i'll kick her in the abdomen and go for some drinks.At this point the writer also thought it would be a good idea to put some love triangle in there too in the form of his best friend liking Takahashi and slugging it out with Yano for her eyes..How poetic....And how idiotic is that? Honestly what is this? Some teenager's fantasy about what the ideal knight romance should be?Long story short Takahashi develops an obssession with his ex and won't go back to being with him unless they talk about her...I'm sorry but when was the last time a woman wanted to hear all about your ex? I get it being curious what with the situation being as fucked up as it is, but who would dwell on it for months? Well i would for one, but that would be for my personal gain.. I'm always on the look for sick stories to laugh about with my mates.I think you get the picture at this point..It's like watching the chronicles of someone who could never let go of her teenage fantasies about the ideal romance and decided to mash them into a green and blue and beige slime.I've said in the past that when writers have many ideas and try to cram them all in there it almost always ends up in the shitter and this anime is a prime example of that. I liked how she tried to implement real life situations and even ones that aren't being presented in most anime and hooray and all that shit but the way they were thrown in there was less than ideal.The way the story was divided was atrocious. 26 eps that were so drawn out they felt like 103 eps, characters that were supposed to rock this place to the ground but ended up being as boring as a clown in a kids party despite the somewhat fucked up background. There were times were the whole thing was going nowhere and just sat there idly showing irrelevant things or even nothing at all..And to add insult to injury the voice acting was subpar and i'm being very generous here. What i think happened here was that they went outside, picked up some strangers of the street and brought them in to deliver the acting..I cannot find another explanation for such empty performance on their part. No emotion whatsoever and no volume...When i say no volume i mean i had to crank up the speakers all the way up to 11 to hear what they were saying. 26 eps of actors whispering their lines.I really wish i could have liked it cause if nothing else, it had some promise. But if failed to deliver in every way possible. Now if you want to watch this go ahead and do so, just don't say i didn't warn you."", ""Bokura ga ItaThis was a pleasure to watch, it's been awhile since I have watched something that evoked such strong emotions.The story is very true to real life situations. It truly felt like I was watching two people go about their lives and struggles as a couple. From the start we have a confession and lot's of character growth throughout the season.The art was not the best. Nearing the end of the season there were a lot of instances where the characters were missing an eye, and during the start of the season the backgrounds were lacking so much so it felt like they...weren't living in a real world. By the end the backgrounds did get better though or maybe I just got so involved in the story I didn't notice as much. Characters were fine with me but some people seem to have issues with them.Sound was lovely and helped lots with pushing me over the edge with emotions.Overall I would recommend this to anyone who loves romance with lot's of drama  and plenty of heart filled moments. weren't living in a real world.

Bokura ga Ita I only noticed through user recommendations for Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke and Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo. I wish I hadn't even wasted the time enduring this series in order to pass fair judgement on it, but I'm just that bored by this series.ART – 1/10Bokura ga Ita is largely, in my opinion anyway, a bland series. The actual animation itself is lazy. Aesthetically, it follows the shoujou conventions of a pastel colour palette,...but the fluidity of the character's motions and the ways in which they are rendered leaves much to be desired. I wonder if the production team even *had* a budget to work with, seriously. You can tell when a series is loved by the effort that is put into its animation, and really, the art for this series isn't anything memorable.Sometimes, during particular scenes, you will notice a shift in quality where the characters are rendered in full detail... but this only seems to apply to the scenes where the protagonist and her love interest stare into eachothers' eyes for prolonged amounts of time. Even then, it's not even really a scene. It's just a picture that the camera slowly pans towards/away from while typical shoujou music plays in the background. Animation is minimal at best throughout Bokura ga Ita, so don't expect anything amazing from it.SOUND – 3/10I never place much important on the soundtrack when it comes to shoujou anime, since that is usually so painfully far down on the priority scale that I sometimes wonder why they even bother. I barely even noticed the soundtrack for Bokura ga Ita. Maybe they were going for a minamilist style. Either way, when I noticed it, I found it hard to discern from track to track. Everything sounded more or less the same.CHARACTER – 3/10I found it hard to empathize with the characters. The protagonist, Nanami, didn't strike me as a particularly interesting heroine. I found it difficult to pinpoint any part of her character that I could identify with, which in turn, made her a hard character for me to attempt to understand. As Bokura ga Ita progresses however, I started to decide this fault had more to lay with the character than me. Nanami really doesn't strike me as... commendable. She's your typical shoujou heroine. She perseveres to make her relationship with her love interest work. She's also striking me as teetering on the Love Martyr trope. Yano, the love interest, on the other hand, is basically portrayed as the Jerk With a Heart of Gold. It's so tested and tried, and oft-repeated, that any shoddy incarnation of this trope is doomed to bore, and sadly Nanami and Yano both suffer this.Even with all the drama going on and the ~dark secrets~ and ~troubled pasts~ certain characters have, this does not do anything to deepen my empathy (or lack there-of) for them.ENJOYMENT – 2/10I tried.OVERALL – 3/10Lacklustre animation efforts, a bland and barely identifiable soundtrack, with equally bland characters who neither compel me to continue onwards with their story or inspire empathy within me to, for one second, take their individual plights seriously. I gave up with episode 8. I honestly felt like Nanami and Yano's sexual encounters were the only realistically portrayed scenario in the series. The voice actors sounded bored with the characters they were depicting, the animators looked bored with what they were animating, hell even the composer was bored judging by the lazy compositions they tried passing off for a *soundtrack*.Give Bokura ga Ita a go if you like romantic dramas where things don't always go right, but just don't expect anything groundbreaking or particularly thought-provoking from it, that's my advice. but the fluidity of the character's motions and the ways in which they are rendered leaves much to be desired.

Some people will say that this anime is kinda boring, or had some annoying parts, or they will say that the love story was stupid and annoying, but I think that\'s because many people were watching this from the wrong perspective. You have to put yourself into the story, try to see the things that happened like it happened to you, and then you will understand it. After that you will realize how much this anime gives to you, so much you can learn.There aren\'t many things in life that can teach you, but this is surely something that can teach you of some things, how to act to others, how to care about others, how to feel, how to think about some things,not to judge everyone on a instant, about memories that never really fade away and many many other things even I maybe didn\'t realized, but there is surely so much here to see and I wish many people will see that like i did, because then they will really learn much about HOW TO LIVE, just like i have, just by watching this Anime.Characters: 9/10God damn it. This anime is showing people like they really are, not just some random perfect ones, because no one is perfect, but they show people how they can be different, how they can think different and how they can easily misunderstand each other, just like it really is, just the TRUTH.So many emotional characters, wise ones, the ones that are closed to everyone, the ones that have an open heart and also the ones who don\'t really want to get hurt, but want someone to take care of them.All these characters together made an atmosphere which made this anime and its story so damn good.Animation: 8/10I really got used to this animation, even if I had some problems with it at the beginning.I loved the colors and the warm and beautiful drawings of the characters, where you can see how they really feel. The moments when you can see only ""one eye"" of the character, you can tell how they really feel, on a instant, and i think that\'s a great job they made, I mean i can tell how someone feels or thinks just by looking at the face, and you have to think that this is sometimes really hard in real life, so it is even harder in a animated version.Music: 9/10The beautiful, peaceful, quite music in this anime made my heart so soft, it always made a really great atmosphere that makes you want to cry. A really beautiful opening also, that shows that there is happiness in this anime too, and a really beautiful ending theme that also goes as the background music and fits perfectly to the moments in the anime.Just beautiful.Closing words:All i have to say is, THANK YOU Bokura ga Ita, thank you for teaching me so many things, and thank you for all these emotions i felt while watching you.Thank you for everything... feel and so many things you can learn. Some people will say that this anime is kinda boring, or had some annoying parts, or they will say that the love story was stupid and annoying, but I think that\'s because many people were watching this from the wrong perspective.

Blah, so boring right? Well, this anime actually exceeded my expectations and showed me a story I will never forget. Yup, I have to admit, there was nothing super exceptional about Bokura Ga Ita, and yet there was. It was a drama that kept me spinning through a million emotions. There were happy scenes and sad ones and some were so cute that I re watched them over and over again. There was also suspense that made my heart beat in anticipation.To top it off, the...insert songs were amazing. Yes, they were AMAZING. The insert songs fit the scene they were played in. The animation quality was not amazing though and Takahashi's voice was not that great. On the other hand, Yano's voice was super sexy. This anime is a must. insert songs were amazing. Yes, they were AMAZING. The insert songs fit the scene they were played in. The animation quality was not amazing though and Takahashi's voice was not that great. On the other hand, Yano's voice was super sexy. This anime is a must."", 'Bokura ga Ita, outstanding amongst other romance anime I\'ve seen in ages. Despite the old ass 2006 animation quality and art style. The anime fulfills what is required to be a good slice of life, drama, romance, and shoujo anime.Story : 9/10This anime began where a girl named Nanami Takahashi went into her first year of high school. She met Yuri Yamamoto and catches wind of a well known boy in their class : Yano Motoharu. Yuri cares little about Yano because of his past association with her older sister Nana, and at first, Nanami loathed Yano\'s attitude but as time passes,...she began to take a liking of him. The two of them hung out and ended up dating. However, their affection is tested with obstructions, such as, Yano experiencing difficulty opening up to Nanami since his first girlfriend, Nana, died in a car accident a year back, and she had been with one of her exes at the time. Ending up living in the shadow of Yano\'s association with Nana, Nanami and Yano battle to keep their relationship above water in the midst of errors and anguish with the conviction of their affection for one another.The plot quite a stunning turn. For the initial couple of episodes, I felt as though the anime feels so long yet so short. I attempted my best to concentrate and absorb the composition of the plot, however, it was plain and exhausting to see and it made me yawn,  stop mid-episode because I thought that the episode\'s almost finished, and numerous different things. I also felt as though their takings were too fast paced. As I kept watching the more and more, I felt as though the episodes were reverting back to typical and I didn\'t feel as if they were as long as before any longer. The anime turned out to be progressively enjoyable until I realized that the exhausting scenes were basically an impetus to boost the story development.As the roller coaster proceeds, the story became increasingly distressing, epic, confusing and fun until it hits the peak. The climax merited the build-ups, but after the climax achieves its end,the  falling action of the plot starts. Truly, I figured it wasn\'t awful and kept watching since I felt as though they were working up a decent closure. But.. Sike! You just got jebaited, watcher! The resolution of the plot is like a swarm of junk tumbling from the sky and hitting me. I was left panicked and stunned from the ending that I was about give this anime a low score.But I still had faith within the anime, so I decided to read the manga! And that is when I finally discovered the true ending that finally closed my perplexed feelings for the anime. Without the manga, this anime would\'ve been a pain in the ass for me because I never knew that this anime was a shoujo soap drama. The manga really made me feel relieved and I\'m glad I didn\'t give up. Overall, I think the story development was brilliant for a true shoujo soap drama, what could be improved though is the romance because for some reason I feel as if the male protagonist is not enjoying being with the female protagonist as much. I don\'t know if this is related to the story development or just the lacking of character expression, so I will put it in both. Other than that, there\'s nothing else for me to complain because the story is already perfect!Art : 7/10I won\'t go berserk mode and criticize the art much because this anime is from 2006, but seriously, I can\'t take away the fact that the characters look so ugly. Especially their back, the characters uniform ( especially pants ) looked too large that it made me felt as if the makers don\'t know how to draw the back of the characters. Despite the crappy 2006 quality, I think the art is okay and it could be drastically improved if you just slap some more money into it.Sound : 6/10""lol"". I think the worst thing about this anime is the sound. Okay, the OP\'s good and the ED\'s satisfactory. But other than that, the voice actors seem to not know how to truly express feelings for characters and it made some important scenes look less important. They just sound..Too boring. I don\'t like how it\'s like that, so the sound could be improved if the voice actors try harder.Character : 9/10Character development is as good as the story. Well..Not as much. The development circles around the main characters attempting to overcome their obstacles blocking their path of love. And that\'s about it.Enjoyment : 9/10The anime was very fun to watch. There\'s a lot of episodes and the plot is good.Overall : 9/10I enjoyed this anime, but I wouldn\'t be as much if I didn\'t read the manga.

There was a lot of drama in it but the humor in the story helped when the mood got to dark every once in awhle. It wasn't perfect though. The humor helped, but when I got near the end I had to put the anime to the side for a week because I couldn't take the drama anymore. Partly my fault because I was watching the whole thing all at once I guess. The anime was good but if you're looking for something to make you crack up this isn't it. If you want something thats going to...make you cry at times then this is the way to go.The art wasn't anything to be shocked about. I thought it needed a little work. The art wasn't bad, but the faces were missing sometimes. In the beginning I respected that because I thought it made you more aware of what the characters were feeling through facial expressions, but in the end it was done to such an extent that I just think that it was a short cut. Half of the time the characters only had one eye and sometimes they just didn't have eyes. I think that it was a good idea at one point, but it was done way to often.The sound was average. They're really isn't anything to say about the sound. I could hear what was going on and it was clear. Good enough for me.The characters were well rounded. Maybe I didn't always like what the main characters were doing or thinking, but no one is perfect and the fact that they were flawed made them outstanding.The enjoyment was pretty good. Sometimes I got depressed or annoyed with what was going on but that's a good thing and a bad thing. My feeling something for the anime meant that I was really into the plot and cared about the characters, but I wasn't always enjoying myself. I got a little fed up in the end. I came back and watched the rest but the drama was a little bit much sometimes and I had to take a breather.Overall, this isn't something that I'm going to forget any time soon. It was an amazing story and I'm glad that I stuck to it and finished it in the end. It was worth the time and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to watch a good romance. It may not always leave you smiling but it's a moving story and enjoyable to watch. make you cry at times then this is the way to go.The art wasn't anything to be shocked about.

My feeling something for the anime meant that I was really into the plot and cared about the characters, but I wasn't always enjoying myself. I got a little fed up in the end. I came back and watched the rest but the drama was a little bit much sometimes and I had to take a breather.Overall, this isn't something that I'm going to forget any time soon. It was an amazing story and I'm glad that I stuck to it and finished it in the end. It was worth the time and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to watch a good romance. It may not always leave you smiling but it's a moving story and enjoyable to watch."", ""Bokura Ga Ita is a series with a simple plot. However, it’s simplicity is what makes it so attractive. It got me hooked immediately with the slightest essences of fate and love and obvious heartbreak that is shown in the first few minutes of the series.It is about the relationship of Yano and Takahashi, the two main characters, and that may sound a little plain and possibly predictable. But the characters are so loveable that you can’t help but get even a little attached and that alone will blind you from any predictability in the series. It is relatable to everyone who has been...in or out of love and this series almost perfectly depicts how astounding first love can really be. And that’s my favourite part of the series: how amazing the love was between the two characters. The series also adds some mysterious elements to it as Takahashi tries to dig up Yano’s past. (So their relationship isn't all sunshine and daisies because Yano's past wasn't either.)The only downside to this may be the art. I find that the art isn’t as colourful or detailed as something as Clannad, for example. There are some funny times when the characters have only one eye. =PI love the music in the series and it was nice how they inserted music over certain moments in every episode. It really helped to emphasize the meaningfulness.Overall, I feel that it is an amazing series and I recommend it to anyone who loves romance with a little bit of comedy.

It is funny, cute, heartwarming, emotional and, best of all, realistic.AnimationPretty average animation, but with gorgeous character design. Every single facial expression is thick with emotions and most people look great. There are also plenty of nice lighting effects.SoundThe weakest point of this anime. Voicer acting is not top notch, especially Nana, but after a while you get to appreciate her voice as a natural part of her.Music is not great. The opening theme is alright, despite a bad vocalist and a badly tuned...lead guitar, but none of the many ending songs were memorable. Background music is decent, but repetative (la la la la la...).StoryA truly realistic love story with lots of ups and downs. Not too original, but VERY well directed and paced. There is so much being told every episode that I often thought it was time for the ending song when really only half of the episode had passed.The story focusses on the main couple, with not much attention elsewhere. This usually means lots of fillers and a slow pace. Not so with Bokura ga ita; I was hooked all the way through it.Vastly contributing to the enjoyment is the realism; I felt like a high school student again while watching.CharacterWonderful human portraits with personalities and behaviour that you can understand. I won\'t call it logical (love isn\'t logical after all), but the psychology behind the characters\' behaviour feels solid and real. I often thought ""no! don\'t do that! what\'s wrong with you?"". but never ""argh, what is this? that\'s not human behaviour!"". lead guitar, but none of the many ending songs were memorable.

A story of a girl who starts out absolutely hating a guy who is the womanizer of a lifetime but falls for him because of his kiddish charm. Not the most unique storyline, but one that can lead to tears of joy, sadness, and everything in between. Because of Yano\'s past, Takahashi is forced to go through many realistic things in her new-found relationship. To be frank, i was frustrated at every character is this show by the ending. Not that it was a bad ending though.Art-7/10, Within the first 5 minutes of watching this series i was ready to give it up...because i didn\'t like how the art was done, but i stuck to it because of the storyline. I mean honestly, half the people had no face drawn in or were missing eyes. I dnt know if the artist was lazy or if thats just how he wanted to draw it. By the 3rd episode i was used to it and jus paid more attention to the story.Sound-8/10. I didnt care for the ending but the opening was good along with songs slotted in between.Character-8/10. The characters did grow on me after a while and at the end i wanted more. Each one progressed in their own way but not as much as i had hoped.Enjoyment-9/10. I really enjoyed the ups and downs in this realistic relationship. The only thing that brought it down was the question i had in my mind the whole time.

Yano a popular guy with a troubled past goes out with Nanami, the stories timid protagonist (a typical plot to a high school drama).

Sounds like an interesting plot but it's not very well put together and I...grew to hate Yano's selfish nature. grew to hate Yano's selfish nature."", 'I think what\'s really sad is that the art and sound for this anime was really good, but the characters are so horrible, that the story is affected too much.The main character, Takahashi Nanami, is one of the stupidest anime characters I have ever watched. She has a sweet baby face, so I could accept blind innocence, but her plain stupidity just shines through like a harsh beam.She confesses to the main male character early in the show without really knowing him that well; how am I as a viewer supposed to honestly believe she\'s in love with him and not just another typical fan...girl of a good-looking guy?Of course, as a typical fanservice, the main male character\'s best friend falls in love with her so that we can see a typical ""jealous male complex"". Unfortunately, this part of the story is so exasperating, since the main male character gradually grows to accept the fact that his best friend is in love with his girlfriend, while Nanami on the other hand decides to pick at EVERY little thing her boyfriend does. She reads into every single action he does and gets easily upset at everything.I think one of the main reasons I can\'t stand this anime is because it\'s one of those that try to teach you lessons of life. One of the lessons in this anime is ""The important thing and the right thing are different"". You should ALWAYS choose the important thing, apparently, which is to make sure you never hurt your girlfriend\'s feelings, rather than actually help someone who has been physically hurt.This anime tries too hard to make Takahashi Nanami seem like the good girl, while the main male character is some horrible bad boy who breaks her heart too many times.

You’d flirt around as awkwardly as possible for a bit, help the poor boy/girl get over their traumatic back story with minimal effort, and finally kiss to become the OTP forevermore. For most anime couples, everything turns out honky-dory once their ship is confirmed. This is not the case in the anime I’m writing about today, though. Bokura ga Ita is a story of a struggling couple. It is full of doubt, drama, depression, and just enough laughter to keep the viewer invested in its romance. Though the show has a...few noticeable blemishes that keep it from truly shining as one of the finest examples of the genre, the story it puts forth is interesting enough to warrant a view from anyone who enjoys tales of romance in anime high school.Story:This story begins as our female lead Nanami Takahashi begins her life in a brand new high school. After making some quick friends, she starts hearing rumors about a boy in her class that just happens to be very popular with the girls. Upon meeting Motoharu Yano, the boy in question, Nana blows him off as nothing more than a goofball and a jerk. Circumstances, however, keep bringing them together and, as they get to know each other’s pasts and feelings, they eventually confess their affections and become a couple. Unlike many shows, this all transpires over the course of 5 episodes as opposed to the more common 12-24. For as quickly as the show moves through the early stage of their relationship, the rest of the show has a tendency to plod through the drama at a snail’s pace.Bokura ga Ita has a lot more to say than it does to show and this little quirk has the tendency to slow down the pace of an otherwise fascinating story. You will find the characters frequently staring at each other or into space as they slowly monologue about every thought that runs through their brains. When engaging with other characters, the dialogue is filled with so many pauses that you’d think half the script was written with ellipses. While this is very easy to forgive in the early parts of the show, because of its often fun and humorous nature, it does make the show very taxing to watch once the heavier emphasis on drama becomes the focus of the narrative. This isn’t helped by my belief that a lot of the events that take place in this story feel rote and mundane, making it hard to recall much of what happens in this series.Despite the little hiccups, however, the show manages to make its way to a satisfying, bittersweet conclusion that I couldn’t help but admire. Without spoiling anything, I’d have to describe it as simple, but elegant (Perhaps a fair description of the show as a whole). And, as much as I’d hate to admit it, this ending may not have had quite the same punch if it wasn’t for some of the more tiring and taxing parts of the show. If the slow drip-feed of drama is what it took to wrap this show up in a nice, little bow, then I feel that it was worth the patience. Let’s be real though, none of this would work without the right cast of characters.Characters:I absolutely loved Nanami Takehashi as the main character. For me, she is the centerpiece of this series and the main driving force for why I wanted to see this story through to the end. Nanami is the textbook definition of sweetness and nowhere is that more evident than in her voice.  Nozomi Sasaki did an incredible job of bringing this character to life with the most adorable line delivery I’ve heard in anime in a long time. Add to that her cartoonish/exaggerated faces and animations, her kindness towards her friends, and her exceptional penchant for second chances, and you get a rather likeable, if naïve character. To keep her from being to boilerplate, the show introduces an interesting dichotomy between that and her more jealous, selfish side that makes her have to work for her relationship, but also keeps her from feeling like a complete doormat like some other female leads.If only I felt a similar level of passion for Motaharu, then I may have been able to give this show more praise than I have been. It’s difficult for me to really nail down my feelings on this character. Motaharu is a very troubled young man. He is selfish, chauvinistic, possessive, rude, and doesn’t seem capable of taking anything seriously. Despite the fact that his “tragic” backstory gives reason as to why he behaves the way he does, it still doesn’t justify it. He isn’t a completely awful character, but for much of the show he kept the romance from really making sense to me, and that doesn’t bode well for most love stories.The other characters mostly feel like background scenery. Sadly, this is true for even important ones like Takeuchi and Yuri. Takeuchi is Yano’s best friend and the designated third wheel for this series. It’s hard to have an effective love triangle when the main competition is the nicest “nice guy” you could possibly write. In fact, Takeuchi is so nice that it borders on parody of such types of guys. Yuri is the sister of Yano’s ex-girlfriend and is supposed to turn this whole mess into a weird love quadrilateral, but her part in the story is so sparse and half-baked that her main purpose seems to be causing needless drama. This is especially telling by how her plotline never feels truly resolved.Presentation:The art for this show is absolutely beautiful. While it isn’t anything high-budget and eye watering, the simplistic and minimalist approach to it adds a lot of style and charm to this show that you would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. Sure there’s the occasional missing eye or weird facial structures when viewed from an awkward angle, but it’s never bad enough to ruin the piece. This strength in style is very important in making up for the show’s lack of animation. As stated previously, the characters spend a whole lot of time staring at each other and maybe talking a bit. It’s hard not to sometimes feel like you’re watching a power point presentation on awkward anime high school romances.The music I also found enjoyable. Even though it’s not something I’d want to listen to regularly, the OP and multiple ED’s were a pleasure to experience alongside each episode. What will likely burrow in your mind, however, is the indescribably adorable and cheesy song that plays at least once in every episode. Here’s a hint: there are a lot of “la la la”s in it.Conclusion:Going into this show with knowing nothing but a few funny clips that I’d previously seen on YouTube, I wanted to really fall in love with this show, but that ended up being a bit of a tall order. Though I really loved it in the beginning, the drama soon began to weigh the show down to the point that it actually became taxing just to sit through.

Im a total sucker for romances. It was really well written from my perspective. It was like a true to life high school romance. I was unsure about the animation too but it grew on me after a bit.Towards the end though it got very repetitive and dragged out a lot. I ended up looking up the ending and skipping after episode 22 to get straight to the finish just to see it. Its also disappointing that theres no season 2 as in the manga the story continues far more to a proper ending....If it had been about 6 or 7 episodes shorted I would have enjoyed it much more as it had great potential. I wont say its time wasted watching, cause I really enjoyed the start. But the ending could have been done a lot better.

A real chick-anime! It's somewhere near as romantic as can get. The way it teases; it's a bit like a rollercoaster.I really got caught up with it; so much that I needed to watch 20 episodes in one day! It's very, very funny too. I usually don't laugh out loud, but with this one, I did - more than once.There's something for all of your feelings. Harm, anger, jealousy, happiness, sadness - you name it!...Simply great!The art is typical anime. It's not super glossy and sparkling, which I very much appreciate. It's not as simply drawn as Mushishi (just to mention one), but neither an anime with big, thick eyelashes and eyes soaking in gloss, and hair in weird purple, green or blue colors. It's pretty average (= good thing!).I really liked the music - especially the opening theme! The melody in the beginning of every episode also reminds you of Kotoko, almost instantly making you smile. I didn't pay too much attention to other music, I'll admit.Oh yeah, I never got the beat of the outtro song, lol!Neither art or music drags the overall score down.The characters are FANTASTIC and are really carried through the entire show!

The story was not limited for what we called “Love” but it shows all the learning’s you can get from it being “in a relationship” or not.It was really impressive at all, as you realize what each episodes/chapters really mean in reality as you compare. Yeah, there’s something in this Anime that actually gave me an impact as I discovered deeply about loving someone while you protect and fight for him/her.The two main characters, Motoharu ""Moto"" Yano & Nanami ""Nana"" Takahashi was really great how the...writer Yuki Obata put emotions into them. You will truly feel the sentiment and began to think more, in a mature way. In fact, the intensity of the story gave me a lot of insight about Love.It was worth watching. After all the episodes (or even the Manga) the impression that I have indeed was awesome. It surely makes sense. I also like the soundtracks played in the entire Anime. Even the art, just plain and simple yet you can still see the good looking appearance of the character that being portrayed.*Personal Implication*I find out many things while sincerely watching all the anime episodes. Love really make are life worthy. It gives us happiness to be with someone we treasure most in our life.And sometimes, Love is not just as easy to be with them. You will need to pass all the testing that will come along; issues need to be settled and arguments that need to be ended.I also greatly understood several things how our past can enormously affect our present life. As we don’t let go of them, they will still imprison us. Just like what Yano was, He can’t forget what happened in his previous relationship that causes so much conflict with Takahashi.Then TRUST is required in all relationship that we will encounter. Because love cannot go on without faith, it was the main key to keep going and continue believing each other words.But, you know the remarkable thing about being loved and being in loved, are the affections that inspire us to be better, grow and mature in every way of our life. It provides gladness while our heart is full of thankfulness that we are able to experience feelings that is priceless.So, don’t be afraid to fall in love but make sure He or She can bring out the best in you. Never settle for something that you will regret at the end.Make your life wonderful! As you value what you have and create amazing journey with the person dearest to you.I’ll definitely remember what I learned in this Anime. If you still don’t watch it, then you must.

Even the art, just plain and simple yet you can still see the good looking appearance of the character that being portrayed.*Personal Implication*I find out many things while sincerely watching all the anime episodes. Love really make are life worthy. It gives us happiness to be with someone we treasure most in our life.And sometimes, Love is not just as easy to be with them. You will need to pass all the testing that will come along; issues need to be settled and arguments that need to be ended.I also greatly understood several things how our past can enormously affect our present life. As we don’t let go of them, they will still imprison us. Just like what Yano was, He can’t forget what happened in his previous relationship that causes so much conflict with Takahashi.Then TRUST is required in all relationship that we will encounter. Because love cannot go on without faith, it was the main key to keep going and continue believing each other words.But, you know the remarkable thing about being loved and being in loved, are the affections that inspire us to be better, grow and mature in every way of our life. It provides gladness while our heart is full of thankfulness that we are able to experience feelings that is priceless.So, don’t be afraid to fall in love but make sure He or She can bring out the best in you. Never settle for something that you will regret at the end.Make your life wonderful! As you value what you have and create amazing journey with the person dearest to you.I’ll definitely remember what I learned in this Anime. If you still don’t watch it, then you must. Arigatou!', ""Alright --Let me just start off by saying: This anime is just great for any person who likes  romance, a bit of a laugh, and a slice of life (and the hardship, effort, and the greatness of honesty put into a serious relationship). I recommend this anime.The beginning is so well thought out that you start doubting whether the characters actually have any defects. The lines, their thoughts, all perfect. But as you go along through the anime you see and realize that they're not that perfect, really. Each character starts to become more clear as you go along. You start to see their...weaknesses and their faults/defects, as well as their strengths. Also there's a great deal of mixed/confused feelings which adds a twist.It really shows what a true relationship and what true love is, as well as the mistakes people make, and the trust and belief they have and put in each other. It shows you really what it means to put effort into a relationship and be honest with one another. I'll be honest in my opinion; as you enter a relation, everything seems happy and exciting, and you feel like nothing can go wrong, thinking mainly about the present; but as the relation/anime progresses all sorts of problems arise between the characters, all of them being problems you find in reality. And that's what I really liked about the anime. The emotions expressed by the characters are very touching, realistic and sensational, a lot of the time refreshing/happy/loving/soothing/exciting, and a lot of the time saddening and depressing, but that's what makes it so real.IT FELT SO REAL!!!!Throughout the anime, you get closer to the characters and actually feel like you're with them from how much you learn about their personalities (Main characters). You learn about their insecurities and fears, which is a great part of the anime, and contributes the emotions expressed by the characters directed toward the viewer (YOU).I was very touched by the characters and the story, especially the last few episodes/second half of the anime. Probably the most emotional anime I've seen, especially the ending. I liked the art, especially the smiling faces (I found them very cute), the music was grrreat (added a lot of emotion and feel to the plot), The story was stunning, as I mentioned before, it was realistic and just incredible, with a twist,  and the enjoyment... Well, that was the best part of it. There were many times where I'd just laugh out loud at funny moments/comedy scenes. In the emotional scenes I felt really captured and sucked into the scene.There were times where it would get a bit boring, but that's nothing to think about or bother me.Overall it was a really great, nice, romantic, and amazing anime !I REALLY loved it!! I think I'll now read the remaining manga chapters!! Again, I recommend this.Thank you very much weaknesses and their faults/defects, as well as their strengths.

They both are so ridiculous and annoying. You can watching this, but its not greaat.. ', 'Before I start my review, please, pay attention to the fact I\'m not from an English-speaking country, so I\'m very sorry for my mistakes.Also, this is my first review, so please check it out.Story: 6/10The story is really interesting, but there are some main problems : In this anime everything is about a girl\'s crush and his past girlfriends. They see neither the present, nor the past and the only thing that happens is that the girl is hurted. There aren\'t any other couples\' stories. Also, The first series of the anime are dinamic - especially the 1st one - then, untill the middle...of the anime, the plot gets slower and slower and in the last series of the anime you\'re like ""It\'s so boring, let me finish it faster so I could start another one"".Art:5/10The art of the anime is special by itself, it\'s different and some scenes (usually scenes are not fully drawn and there are some kind of pink baloons surrounding the characters) show how does the main character feels.Thats what the bad thing about art is, too. It\'s really driving you crazy when there are people with one eye or with no eyes. And these baloons are usually made to miss parts of scenes which makes the anime less real.Sound: 7/10About music: Music was fitiing well, theme songs and openings were really good as well, but in the second half of the anime, as lots of boring and filler episodes start to appear, sound changed a lot, too. For example, Nana\'s (she\'s a main character) voice couldn\'t be compared with what it was in the first series.Characters:7/10The whole plot is about 3-4 characters only. The good thing about them: They are little as a number, but they are done very well. Their nature is very good and each of their stories is exciting.Enjoyment: 7/10Bokura ga Ita starts very well but it continues like a long soap drama. Music is good, but bad art makes enjoyment less.Overall:7/10Bokura ga Ita isn\'t as good as it is supposed to be.Sometimes it is too cliched and predictable. It\'s good for people who like good romantic soap dramas, but for these who\'s searching for exciting animes, it\'s really a waiste of time, especially in the end.

To be fair, the art annoyed me at first.  Why are there no backgrounds and only one eye?  Probably because the characters are so wrapped up in one another that they can't notice anything else.  And that's also my biggest problem with the show.  There could have...been a zombie apocalypse happening and the characters wouldn't have noticed because they are so wrapped up in their own problems.  Which really aren't that big, however, we all remember that such problems seemed huge when we were in high school so it becomes part of the show's charm.The plot of this show is all about beating a dead horse.  Let me rephrase that.  Beating a dead girlfriend.  The characters cannot let the past go, even if they weren't the ones to live through it.  The main guy is too conflicted to see past himself, the main girl is too naive to know anything, and the best friend who would be the perfect soul mate for anyone is too nice to ever get anywhere.  It is aggravating, it is annoying, it is irritating, it is...this genre.  It is what one expects.  Don't watch high school romance drama without expecting the irritating and expected.Here's where this show gets good and I'm going to give you a SPOILER, so stop reading here if you don't want to know anything about the story past the anime.The anime  stops at chapter 31 in the manga but the manga ends at chapter 70, and the manga takes us 5 years into the future and really shows what the characters are thinking and feeling as well as past experiences well beyond the dead girlfriend.  The characters become more dynamic and show more background and their relationships become more real and complex.  The rating I gave this show is based on the manga and not the anime.So should you watch this? Answer these questions:1.  Do you love pointless romance dramas?2.  Do you mind teenage problems that are blown out of proportion?3.  Would you read the manga past the anime?If you answered yes, no, yes to the above, watch this show!

The reaction of the characters or rather their voice is very natural and funny.Unlike other romance anime, the boy is somewhat acting always like cool. But here,Yano/Male character is not acting cool or somehow. He has many weakness and keep his problems with him. He is very strange and funny person.And I like the start of their love when Takahashi/Female character used to hate Yano because she thinks that he is like an arrogant or cocky person. But she is wrong, she...fell inlove with a person she used to hate.The ending of the anime is sad. But surely you will be forced to read the manga beacause the sequel continues in it.FYI the anime ended in manga at chapter 31So the sequel will start at chapter 32, the manga has 70 chapters meaning the anime is only the half of the story.I recommend this the most for romance and drama. I don't know why it is underrated maybe because they were disappointed in the ending.Overall rating: 10/10 fell inlove with a person she used to hate.The ending of the anime is sad.

Yes, this one has a horrible art which gives off a cartoonish vibe and the voice acting is also bad. I was thinking twice whether to drop it or just continue.But in the end, I gave this anime a chance and to be honest I enjoyed it.Story:One word. Realistic. There will seldom be anime with stories that mirrors what really happens when two young people get into a romantic relationship. Bokura ga Ita gave me that kind of experience in love. There are a lot of emotional torture, heartaches and break ups which...may throw you off or make you drop the series several times. For me, the more realistic the anime is, the better I enjoy it. Those who have never experienced young love will definitely want to stay away from this series. They would want to preserve their dream romance and never get those dreams tainted.Art:Bokura ga Ita has a mediocre art. I won't say this is the worst I've seen but taking in consideration the year this was made, I would say it just lacks a lot in most areas, not all. People who care about the story can get through each episode without even complaining about the art.Sound/Voice Acting:The voice acting was horrible but after much understanding, I realize that they use some Hokkaido accent throughout the series which make it seem like the voice acting sound so bad.Character:The main characters are so real. A controlling a guy and an insecure girl reflects what most youngsters in real life are. Pretty much we see some fragments of ourselves to them in some situations.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this series. I overlooked the bad art and the horrible voice acting and just focus on the whole story. I'm the kind of person to judge the anime base on my own enjoyment. Even if some say this is one of the worst anime, I would care less about their own preference. As long as I'm satisfied with the progress and the ending, it's a good anime for me.Overall:Bokura ga Ita will take you to the real world of high school romance.

', 'This romance anime surpasses many in the shoujo genre in terms of its fairly accurate reflection of real relationships, however there are certain elements that prevent it from comparing with others of the same depth such as honey and clover.I ended up having a very love/hate relationship with this anime, for a few reasons, which are explained in the categories below.Plot: The first several episodes present background info that interestingly sets up the storyline, but at times the past events seemed so age-inappropriate that it made a couple of the main characters seem less real and credible.  However as the series continues, the drama...keeps ensuing but it is actually fairly realistic and captivating due to its ability to make you relate to the characters.  Overall, expect a large helping of drama, sometimes pointless albeit understandable, from this one and less of the traditional comedic relief moments that many have come to expect from the genre.Art:  Overall, okay: the general drawing style is pretty standard except for certain stylistic elements that were generally annoying and actually plot distracting until you get used to them.  The anime has a tendency to draw characters with only one eye in moments where only one character\'s face is visible; I did not like this technique nor understood its purpose.  Also, the profiles of characters always struck me as ugly, the eyes bulge slightly out from the face and they look kind of like fish.  Otherwise the art was nice enough.Music: Fine, appropriate for each scene.Characters: You either love them or you hate them, but it is hard to argue that the characters are completely stereotyped.  The main ones, Yano, Takeuchi, Takahashi and Yamamoto, are at times very frustruating but all the while are complex enough to merit praise.  They accurately portray the desires, worries, and emotions of teens of their age (with one or two times of exception) and act accordingly.  There are no ""perfectly selfless"" characters that I have seen appear in the genre at times and their are no antagonists for whom you never feel sorry.  One of the strongest points of the anime in terms of believability and complexity, however this doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will care about them.Enjoyment:  Although I would have given this anime a 5 at many times, there were others when I could have given it a 9 because it can be so true to life.  It kept me fairly hooked despite its rocky start, yet however much I felt I could relate to some of the experiences, I never felt as attached to the characters as I have in other, more stereotyped and simple romance animes.  Although the plot is at times heartbreaking, it never made me cry once, which makes me think that there is some element lacking considering the gravity of the events.  In the end, I would say that I am glad to have watched this anime because it is thought provoking and also an interesting comparison to its counterparts. keeps ensuing but it is actually fairly realistic and captivating due to its ability to make you relate to the characters.

The anime has a tendency to draw characters with only one eye in moments where only one character\'s face is visible; I did not like this technique nor understood its purpose.  Also, the profiles of characters always struck me as ugly, the eyes bulge slightly out from the face and they look kind of like fish.  Otherwise the art was nice enough.Music: Fine, appropriate for each scene.Characters: You either love them or you hate them, but it is hard to argue that the characters are completely stereotyped.  The main ones, Yano, Takeuchi, Takahashi and Yamamoto, are at times very frustruating but all the while are complex enough to merit praise.  They accurately portray the desires, worries, and emotions of teens of their age (with one or two times of exception) and act accordingly.  There are no ""perfectly selfless"" characters that I have seen appear in the genre at times and their are no antagonists for whom you never feel sorry.  One of the strongest points of the anime in terms of believability and complexity, however this doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will care about them.Enjoyment:  Although I would have given this anime a 5 at many times, there were others when I could have given it a 9 because it can be so true to life.  It kept me fairly hooked despite its rocky start, yet however much I felt I could relate to some of the experiences, I never felt as attached to the characters as I have in other, more stereotyped and simple romance animes.  Although the plot is at times heartbreaking, it never made me cry once, which makes me think that there is some element lacking considering the gravity of the events.  In the end, I would say that I am glad to have watched this anime because it is thought provoking and also an interesting comparison to its counterparts.', ""I probably just expected too much from this anime or was merely looking for something enjoyable to watch over the spring break; either way, I was disappointed. It was a total waste of time.First of all, the story was hardly exceptional and very predictable.Also, the way Takahashi speaks was intolerable. But that's just me.Adding to that, the art was quite aggravating, especially when the characters are on sideway view. I'd say it was the worst disturbance in terms of artwork that had been bothering me since Barefoot Gen. Worst part was that I was anticipating that something pretty much spectacular would come around around...the bend that I opted to just grin and bear, and in the end it dissatisfied me.Setting those points aside, the overall impression I was left with is that it was completely, simply put, downright soporific. the bend that I opted to just grin and bear, and in the end it dissatisfied me.Setting those points aside, the overall impression I was left with is that it was completely, simply put, downright soporific."", 'If you want to dive into this anime, be prepared to flip a table. I am a person who quite enjoys romance and such, but this anime made me so frustrated I had to take breaks from watching it time to time.Not all of it was bad frustration, using a pretty well thought out character backstory and relationship complications made it enjoyable. However, towards the end of the anime I was getting ready to rip my hair out at the constant soap-opera feel to the entire show. Not only this, but the ending was extremely dissatisfying to me (which led me to pick it...up with the manga).I guess another disappointment of the show was the fact that the ultimate ending of the show was highly predictable. I will have to say that many scenes and problems took me completely off guard, but the ending was going to be the same either way.Overall the art was good, but the animation in places was a bit off to me. Especially when a character was to turn sideways, it jut kind of creeped me out. That might be an art preference on my own, but it still plays a factor in the animation effect to me.I would recommend watching it as a good frustration romance manga, but as far as fantastic?

After all, life is not a fairy tale. It is more unfair and cruel that’s why it is called reality.Falling in love for the first time, the female lead thought that things would be as sweet as she imagined it would be. Founding out the sad and dark past of her new love, Nanami struggled to understand...Motoharu’s situation at the same time accepting his past. This just showed how strongly the past influences the present of two people in love. And as if Motoharu’s dead ex-girlfriend story wasn’t enough, Nanami also has to deal with Motoharu’s past with his ex-girlfriend sister. To add it up, Motoharu had a hard time accepting his past and so his present almost didn’t work. Men can really be a lot work when it comes to their pasts especially if it’s about another girl. Anyways, Nanami and Motoharu still managed to make the relationship worked. You will have that romantic feeling from their sweet moments and cool dialogues which was the strong point of the series. You will absolutely be swayed by the dialogues because it has the sincerity from a real person’s feelings. What’s great about the story was that it showed the more realistic side of love life. But then again some people watch animes so that even for a short time they can walk away from the cruelty of reality. As much as possible they want to rest their minds and experience a little bit of fairy tale. Though I would say the ending was too much of a cliffhanger which was irritating because endings are very important for any type of stories. Everybody wants an appropriate ending in their lives. It doesn’t have to be perfect or so nice but at least a proper closure.

You may think, wow! This show is so great that I had to write something to praise it while in the middle of watching it!Well, sorry to disappoint but it\'s quite the opposite. I needed to write this because of my frustration levels were reaching their limit and my dumbass meter are off the charts.Hold it! That doesn\'t mean I\'m gonna drop the show. That would mean all the time that I\'ve spent watching this total shitfest was a waste of time. All that time...I could\'ve spent doing absolutely nothing wouldn\'t have been any better, so why not continue.Honestly the show isn\'t bad; 6 = fair which rightly so summarizes my experiences so far. Yet there are certain aspects of this show that really rustles my jimmies to an extent until I have to let these emotions loose.STORY: 5Jesus, I should\'ve properly read the tags before watching this one. Yes there is romance and a whole deal of it; the primetime of inexplicable romances are centered around high school, as this one is. The characters: Nanami and Yano are what you would say, the classic, the stereotypical romance couple. The story is told in the perspective of Nanami and without spoiling too much, it was a total shitfest by the end of episode 18. I\'ve never felt so frustrated by how it turned out and by how the characters interacted, which I\'m sure you will or have felt watching this show. Holy jesus ballsack it is just an utter crappy concoction of drama, romance, crying, drama, comedy, and did I mention drama? I like relatable characters and genuine relationship and I can\'t find such things in this story between the two main characters or just in general.ART: 8I don\'t know, I think there\'s a certain charm to this kind of artstyle that is very representative of the time it was produced. It\'s not very detailed, the eyes are huge, facial expressions can\'t really be expressed by such a limited style, but there is a charm to it, I\'ll give it that.SOUND: 8There is a plethora of inserted songs throughout the 18 episodes that I\'ve watched and I\'m sure this will continue til the end and while these songs are very generic in their message about romance, the tracks are good and fit the theme. While some songs are repeated heavily, they merely add to the atmosphere and don\'t generally take away anything from it.CHARACTERS: 3Oh boy, here we go. If I had to give an award for the dumbest cast of characters in a show, this would win it 100%, let me tell you my reasons.Nanami: a sweet girl who is infatuated with Yano, the hottie of the school. Described as plain and generic, I find her lack of willpower and convictions pretty disturbing. Constantly going back on her words in order to benefit this son of a bitch, Yano, (I\'ll get to him later) she seems to blame herself for these mistakes, which are clearly not her fault. She has literally done nothing wrong besides getting involved with Yano. Sometimes, people have to stick to their word and not give in to manipulating mfkers, which i something that Nanami seems to lack.Yano: Jesus H. Christ never have I seen a more despicable character. Fuck, just thinking that someone out there in the world inspired the author to make such a fucktard character blows my mind. I\'m just venting, but not only is this character manipulative, he clearly doesn\'t respect fuck all and in turn doesn\'t deserve anything at all. [SPOILERS AHEAD] Oh you had a childhood without knowing who your father was? Tough luck, that doesn\'t mean you get to disrespect the people around you. Nigga, get off your high horse and open yo damn eyes. Literally the problem to everything in this story. You can\'t trust him cause he\'ll just lie to your fucking face and while you blame his ass, nigga always turns it around on everyone else around. I try to sympathize with his problems, but just because you have issues doesn\'t give you the right to act like a total bitch. May god save my soul. You may empathize with me, maybe you won\'t but dear god if you don\'t, I hope you realize the magnitude of this dude\'s bitchiness and zero responsibility for anything he did. I honestly detest people who have no sense of accountability. /endrantNana: [SPOILER ALART] The late girlfriend of Yano, I guess the saying that similar people attract each other makes sense in this situation cause of both of these characters are fucking dumbasses. There is the concept that love can persevere through hardships and mistakes that is constantly driven up your ass throughout the story, but some mistakes can\'t be fixed, no matter how much you love the person. The epitome of a bitch, not only is she constantly said to be a stupid character even in the show, she feels no remorse for cheating on Yano, fk even I understand this frustrations despite not having had a single girlfriend. The theme of forgiving this person is nailed into your skull and that she was truly a good person capable of being forgiven  is something I can\'t accept nor will I accept.Yamamoto: The stupidest fking character out of the whole cast. Literally no substance or character, I don\'t even know why this person exists or continues to exist. A character that I dear hope to god no one sympathizes with and holds in their hearts as the dumbest and most hated person out of the cast. Her character makes me want to peel my skin off and burn it.Takeuchi: The only sympathizable character and really the only relatable person in this situation. The good bro, best bro Takeuchi. While he may never get the girl of his dreams, may his broness continue to live on.ENJOYMENT: 4All the reasons are above.OVERALL: 5Not sure if ""mediocre"" really exemplifies my feelings for this show, but I\'ll take it.

I wanted a cute little love story in school. What I got was that for the first maybe 5 episodes before it turned into just Yano being awful to Nana resulting in the same events over and over and over. I understand how most of these school romance anime are but after a while it just got so tiring. I literally felt tired after finishing an episode because of how repetitive it became so I just dropped it and had a friend tell me how it...ended. ended.', 'Besides slice-of-life, I\'m also into shoujo, so if there\'s no slice-of-life, shoujo anime will definitely be my second choice. Yeah and on some day (I cannot remember), while I was looking for some good animes (according to others\' opinion), I caught a glimpse of this. After spending quite A LOT OF times watching, I finally came to the conclusion this one is totally a waste of time.To be honest, I don\'t really have a high requirement on the art and I even don\'t pay any attention to it as long as the plot is great, beacause the plot will make up for it, anyway. Hence,...before watching this, I hoped that this anime would live up my expectation (as you can see the score is pretty high). But it seems like ""the art makes up for the plot"" is the truth. It was obviously a LET-DOWN.Let me tell you something about the plot so that you van have a general look about this one. This anime, for me, is just like a typical shoujo anime: a normal, nothing out of ordinary high-school girl falls in love with a handsome, famous, ka-koi-i boy and the girl confesses her love and the boy\'s gradually into her and then the two falls for each other and then some unexpected troubles come and so on. You can get the picture somehow.Well, as you can see there\'s nothing extraordinary about this so I consider this a normal and safe one. Personally this would be a nice one if the troubles between them weren\'t all craps. There are two problems that I want to talk about:First is our first main character: Nanami Takahashi. Well I see her 100% normal and kinda disappointed because she\'s ..... so normal :(. Anyway I could ignore that. But but but, ""What\'s happening with the voice actor""- that was what I was thinking when Nanami started to talk. I don\'t mean to be rude but her voice really DID annoy me, it made my skin crawl all the time. But that\'s not the only problem, unfortunately, she\'s the kind of girl that I hate most. She\'s so easy to cry and her tears weren\'t worth it at all (she needs to be stronger), she\'s arrogant because she always wants her boyfriend to treat her like a queen, she\'s a jealousy girl and doesn\'t have any empathy (why are you  so mean, girl?) and she just acts like she\'s the only one who deserves to be loved.Next is our second main character: Motoharu Yano. Well, he\'s hot so before dating Nanami, he was in a relationship with a girl,who is Yuri Yamato\'s big sister, Nana Yamato. Their relationship seemed quite nice (not until Nana died from a car accident), Yano truly loved this girl (I think this girl and Nanami should\'ve been sisters because they\'re just the same kind of girl) and even though she was dead, he still had feeling for her and he confessed this on the beach, with Nanami (she was the one who told him to). Of course, after that they ALMOST broke up (but they didn\'t) because Yano\'d tried to saved their relationship, which has been the biggest question for me up to now, WHY??? Didn\'t you say that you loved Nana??? OMG I cannot get this.In this anime, I think I like the supporting more because they\'re the ones who really understand their feelings and act like adults. OP and END is normal, too, nothing special.THANKS FOR READING :)))) before watching this, I hoped that this anime would live up my expectation (as you can see the score is pretty high).

The plot starts off as your general girl likes guy story, but the character development of the main girl is next to nothing in the first half of the season, and we are given no insight into what is so great about the main guy too.As characters go, she is naiive, gullible, and dependant on others throughout.He is hypocritical, arrogant, and has vague stalker tendencies along with a possessiveness which would want...to make you vomit. After watching the first half, I simply could not take any more of the crap that is this show and read the summary to see how the story would end up (it does not get any better)SPOILER BITThe hypocrisy I was referring to earlier is him telling her never to betray him, then him going on to sleep with his ex-girlfriend's (who is dead) little sister.

Especially since it contains many aspects that I don't generally enjoy when I watch anime.STORY: 7/10 -not a summary but a reflection -First and foremost this anime was so MESSSYY - one issue after another but I couldn't help but continue watching. Though dramatic the show presented many issues with realistic replies, it felt quite refreshing from most animes (romance to be exact) I see nowadays. Its been a while since I've felt so connected to the character. One of which, unfortunately, really reminded me of myself-...extremely naive and stupidly optimistic. She did a lot of things that angered me but that was primarily because it reminded me of some of the past actions that I regret and cringe about every now and then. Being able to relate to these characters and feel something from their interactions was the main reason I rated this anime so high. Its a rare and special moment when an anime can do this (at least for me. The more anime I watch the picker I become). However, I don't think this anime would be everyone's cup of tea. if you don't like it by the 5th ep just drop it. You might end up having a headache by the end of it.ART 3/10The art was terrible, background characters were rarely drawn proper or even colored in. I quickly got tired of seeing the characters drawn with one eye or even non at times (mind you these were the MC).  I can't tell if this was due to budget issues or if this was on purpose.SOUND 8/10The soundtrack was great the lyrics and sound always managed to fit so perfectly with the scenes.ENJOYMENT 9/10Really had a blast even though most of the time I was angry or in pain. It just goes to show what I good connection I felt with the character. Also, the show gave me a lot more pre-sleep dream content !!Characters 6/10Ngl I didn't really like the characters nor the plot at first. I felt nana fall in love way too quickly and Yano was faking it. But as time went by both of them grew on me.OVERALL 7/10if you were wondering NO I didn't actually add up the numbers. just felt it was a 7/10 extremely naive and stupidly optimistic. She did a lot of things that angered me but that was primarily because it reminded me of some of the past actions that I regret and cringe about every now and then. Being able to relate to these characters and feel something from their interactions was the main reason I rated this anime so high. Its a rare and special moment when an anime can do this (at least for me. The more anime I watch the picker I become). However, I don't think this anime would be everyone's cup of tea. if you don't like it by the 5th ep just drop it. You might end up having a headache by the end of it.ART 3/10The art was terrible, background characters were rarely drawn proper or even colored in. I quickly got tired of seeing the characters drawn with one eye or even non at times (mind you these were the MC).  I can't tell if this was due to budget issues or if this was on purpose.SOUND 8/10The soundtrack was great the lyrics and sound always managed to fit so perfectly with the scenes.ENJOYMENT 9/10Really had a blast even though most of the time I was angry or in pain. It just goes to show what I good connection I felt with the character. Also, the show gave me a lot more pre-sleep dream content !!Characters 6/10Ngl I didn't really like the characters nor the plot at first. I felt nana fall in love way too quickly and Yano was faking it. But as time went by both of them grew on me.OVERALL 7/10if you were wondering NO I didn't actually add up the numbers. just felt it was a 7/10"", '*Review contains spoilers*Story 6/10So, up until episode 15-16, this anime was really entertaining. The story between main characters developed way too fast and often made me think ""this is going to well to last or be true""... Yes, it is also a bit cliche with shy girl falling for the popular kid, who has a bunch of problems and is not as nice as people think he is, but then other twists were added, which made an interesting watch for the most part (such as Yamamoto also being in love with Yano and Yano seemingly feeling pulled towards her for a reason or the other)....I think some of the love triangle Yano-Nanami-Takeuchi could have been cut out, because it felt like they were dragging out that story of Takeuchi also liking Nanami but giving preference to his friend for too long...a few episodes of this arc would have been more than enough and could have made the anime shorter for its benefit...(and why would Yano be mad that Takeuchi gave up on chasing his girl? also...aren\'t there plenty of other girls in school? why so fixated in your ""best friend\'s girl""? where did loyalty go?). To me, this anime could have been 18 episodes and that would have been great. By the end of it I was bored and the ending was just sad and unsatisfying.I found refreshing though that Yano was not shy about his sexual intentions with Nanami and that they almost had sex. That was realistic and not often seen in anime of this genre.Art 3/10Man did I hate those drawings!!! I even had to double check in Google the date of this anime as the drawings make it look really old (90\'s maybe?)..body parts were often disproportionally drawn in comparison to the rest of the bodies (a hand often bigger than a face), missing eyes or face parts in close ups scenes, clothes were too baggy looking for their own good, bodies too short, characters felt 13 rather than 17, what\'s with Nanami\'s hairstyles?...In general, I really did not enjoy art in this anime.Sound 5/10Nothing too amazing about sound in this anime...I am giving it a 5 for effort, because they did have different complete songs (as opposed to just portions of songs or sounds), but I felt they were used way too much.Characters 6/10Yano-he obviously has issues to work on. At times, he was a jerk for no reason, specially towards Yamamoto (not that she didn\'t deserve it, I will get to her in a bit...). However, I did enjoy seeing some good character development in him and how he tried to be a better person for those he cared about. I think his sexual advances towards Nanami were funny (and, worthy of mention, it came to a point he didn\'t even care about sex, which made his feelings more believable). I think his confusion was also realistic because he had loved this person who simply passed away, leaving behind so many feelings and unanswered questions.Nanami-I liked that she was blunt and often said what she thought. I also liked that she was able to remove herself from a relationship that she thought was not healthy for both. I did not like her reaction to Yano giving support to Yamamoto at a time of extreme need...she could have been more understanding and stop wasting time of being with Yano.Takeuchi-This guy is easily my favorite character from the show and I often found myself rooting for him instead of Yano. Not that Yano was a bad person, but I felt Yano offered a passionate and intense love while Takeuchi offered a safe, steady and healthy love. When we are young, we tend to go for Yanos but as one grows older one understands the stability and comfort Takeuchis offer, and I felt that was exactly the juxtaposition offered by having these two love interests for Nanami. That being said, I really put into question Takeuchi\'s loyalty to his friend and why would he even want to be with his ""best friend\'s"" ex...that is not something you do!Yamamoto-""wow man, what a creepy girl"" was what I thought during most of her screen time. I don\'t understand how she could just sleep with her sister\'s ex and then harbor resentment towards him for being the only one actually using his reasoning and feeling guilty for what they did...and then, out of nowhere confessing his feelings to him? and THEN, going to the station where he is leaving but hiding instead of actually saying ""good-bye"" at least? (since she was already there, even though I am sure nobody invited her...obsessed much?).  The best thing Yano could do was to stay away from her.Enjoyment 6/10So, up until episode 15-16 I would have given this anime maybe a 7 or 8, but to me, the last 10 episodes were really slow paced and basically running in circles with the story. When I finished watching, I stayed in a blank for about 20 minutes processing that bleak ending.Overall 5/10I don\'t think I would be recommending this anime to anyone even though it wasn\'t too dreadful. It was just OK. I think some of the love triangle Yano-Nanami-Takeuchi could have been cut out, because it felt like they were dragging out that story of Takeuchi also liking Nanami but giving preference to his friend for too long...a few episodes of this arc would have been more than enough and could have made the anime shorter for its benefit...(and why would Yano be mad that Takeuchi gave up on chasing his girl? also...aren\'t there plenty of other girls in school? why so fixated in your ""best friend\'s girl""? where did loyalty go?).

Yano was that popular guy that everybody liked and off course it was the person Takahashi met. Freaking Yuri, i was thinking she was a chill person for a while, she\'s the typical kuudere, talk only want needs to be sad however she feels needed.**Going over what i dislike and liked in detail sooo kind of spoilers*****I was a little confused when they started to talk about nana-san so much, sometimes I\'d get confused which one they...were talking about, but that wasn\'t a problem for too long because after a while they just started to show her face anytime she was mentioned sometimes even like 5 or more times in one episode. Like i get it, she was verry important person but cant think of anything else to show then constantly a face of a dead character. I don\'t know, its probably just me but they did it was too often for me. i felt that when they added Takeuchi it was a little weird maybe i just don\'t remember him from earlier or something i did binge the show in two nights, but the extra come about his "" transgender brother"" who\'s just ""a man in a dress"", something to that effect and kept going kinda rubbed me wrong, and that was kinda early on when they were first showing his character made me not want to root for him really. But later one we see him with his sister and he seems nice to her now, i don\'t know if i just read it wrong or what but i feel like if they have a good relationship why did they need those comment. At a couple point i did start to question if a man wrote it and surprisingly google said it was a girl. Had me question the types of things teenagers watch and which ones they decided to copy. And i hope its not these couple of teenagers her. i also wondered why continue watching it and i wanted to see how they would end this thing.it went from showing how stupid Nana-san was for staying with her abusive boyfriend, how everybody around her speaks about her, and how they feel about the situation but then when he catches that she has a bruise because of him she slaps him(or pushes her{she hits like the closet}) so at that point i was shocked. But then i saw her go back and forth, not that i get it but now the boyfriend who was calling her stupid for staying with the last guy for hurting her, hurts her.. idk. I get why he has a sort of hate and regret, he didn\'t get to apologize in time and that usually eats you away. Hate on how she went back to her ex. But yeah maybe apologize sooner, but who knows in the show they didn\'t really show what he was doing up until the point that he tried to call her and when he got the call again saying that she got into the accident.From Yano holding on to the fact that he slept with Yuri to lying not only to Takeuchi about what happened, and then later on with on to Takahashi (HIS CURRENT GF), to then only telling her in a way of a joke.. a terrible one at that. Of course she gets over that very quickly like millions of little things here and there that either come out wayyyy later or doesn\'t get ""solved"". The way Yuri keep was the one that kept coming to him really pissed me off and really gave me stalker vibes. And what she says to Takahashi never get talked about with Yano which was little weird to me, but maybe nit pickky. The way that Yano push her so she doesn\'t her didnt sit right with me, and so many other instances that made me feel like Yano was a bit of a narcist. I mean i can\'t tell you enough how much i wanted to stop watching when Yano literally told her put your hand up if it hurts and ill stop and when she does he does. I don\'t know that how animation and scenario made me feel gross to even finish the episode..I don\'t know by the end of it im guessing we were supposed to be crying to but i dont know. I feel for the mom it seemed like a loveless marriage and seems like she got married because ""Yano needs a father figure"" i hope that\'s not the only reason she got remarried, a lot of the problems could have been solved with simple quicker communication. Maybe because it is anime it seems like we have these trips or plans and sometimes all we are shown is they got to the bus and that\'s it. Then later find out they still have the same problem, like so what they just chilled there and didn\'t talk about the thing they were just worrying and crying about, just feels dragged out sometimes.

Why didn't they draw both eyes in ''dramatic'' moments?

Its the girl\'s first love and the guy\'s 2nd (?) .>  The guys cant still forget about his ex-girlfriend and is stuck in the moment for past 2/3 years (?) The girl now is very very very hurt by all these things doing around her and so she decides to breakup. the guy comes chasing...after her. They get back together again then are again or the verge of breakup and so it continues in the story till its ep 23/24. Then is the climax were the girl will again shed litres of tears and say her goodbyes to the guy (And please dont ask why is that. You all know the answer already- EMOTIONAL PUNCH!!!). END OF STORY. Phew. Boy was I glad that it ended finally. To tell honestly people who have read many shoujo manga may get really bored watching this show. But if you are persistent enough give it a try.Art [6/10]: Art is Okay I guess. But there have been many series with much better illustrations and background scenery even if they are just of the town places. The excessive bubbles in the first few episodes show to built up the ""shoujo"" mood was too much in my opinion. Animators could have done much better than this surely but oh well.Sound [7/10]: OP and EDs were good, just not to my liking. Voice actor for the girl sounded highly nasal throughout (wonder about the reason -> maybe to show the naiivity ????) Other voice actors have done a decent job.Character [8/10]: Reckless, naiive sometimes, trying to act like others and indulging in unnecessary adult stuff, etc.. all have been protrayed well via the characters. though I doubt I saw any development.Enjoyment and overall [7/10]: Recommended for one time watch.

I thought it would just be a classic tale of boy meets girl, and they live happily ever after, however, it was a bit more complex than that. Yano's past was rather unexpected and added a lot of drama to the plot line. Unfortunately, Yano's connection to Yuri Yamamoto was very predictable. I thought the love triangle between the two boys and Takahashi was done in a very clever way, that not even I could decide which boy I preferred.Art: 4/10Honestly, I really didn't like the art in this anime. The close ups made...the characters appear worse than they were, and the fading at the edges made it very hard to concentrate on what was happening. It was almost as if it made everything fuzzy and faded in your mind. It also wasn't very memorable. I'm writing this review a couple of days after I've finished the show, however, I barely even remember hat anything, or anyone, look like. I did, however, love the characters smiles. That was great!Sound: 8/10The music was great! I loved it! I liked the fact that even when nothing was happening, (eg. no mood), there was background music. It suited well to the moments and set a great scene. I don't remember many sound effects though. I didn't, however, like the voice actress chosen for Takahashi. I didn't think it suited her, and it rather irritated me.Character: 7/10The character stories were very clever. Everyone had a past and background that intertwined with someone else's. It very much helped with the character development.Enjoyment: 4/10I didn't actually enjoy this anime very much. I enjoyed the surprises when they happened, but most of it was rather predictable. The art irritated me a lot, as I said before, and made it difficult to continue. I found it was an anime I could only watch when I was in a specific mood.Overall: 6/10I thought this anime was good enough to watch, but not enough to get worked up over. It was a very good plot line, but I think it was let down by several factors.

The story revolves around them as a couple and the conflicts of life that they had to deal with.The characters were well developed, some with a tragic backstory and all. You could see who they evolved during the serie, they didn’t stay the same, which made the anime intriguing and something you wanted to see. and problems kept appearing one...after the other, and it was  like I couldn’t get enough.There were moments in which I laughed, moments where I cried, moments wHere I couldn’t stop cursing one of the characters or yelling at the screen.

The extremely few moments that seem positive are usually completely destroyed shortly after.The main couple doesn't fit together at all and those who would are left empty-handed.One could think that the entire story was written by a depressed author who wanted to somehow express his bitterness with this work.But in the end everyone has to form his own opinion.Well, some people are into endless drama, for them the series can be recommended.

I will add however, that there were about 5 or 6 episodes out of the 26 (started around episode 18 maybe...), where the story annoyed me so much it made me feel physically disgusted.  I LITERALLY had to fast forward through the episodes quickly reading the subtitles only, just so I didn\'t get lost, but I could not force myself to watch them fully.The characters at this point were soooo frigging annoying, the main girl was acting so ridiculous I was actually hoping they killed her off during these episodes...it literally made...me hate her.  The ""friend"" was near the same boat too...friend my butt.  They could have condensed those miserable episodes into ONE just to tell the story and skipped the annoyance.  Had they did that, this anime could have received a higher rating from me.The art is so-so, but having them deliberately not draw an eyeball and having very generalized sketches of the characters (lack in detail, etc...) could be annoying at times.  Some may love the ""art-style"", I just felt it was a bit sloppy instead though.  Sound on several episodes was a bit nuts too.Story overall was interesting this is definitely a DRAMA romance, but be prepared to want to kill off half the main cast during certain portions of this show.

The problem is that Yano comes with a ton of baggage and has a lot of issues, and Nanami starts developing trust issues, as she feels Yano isn't being honest with her. Add in a few love triangles, and bam, there you go. The problem with the plot is that the characters never seem to learn and keep...going in cycles of quarreling and then making up, over and over. The characters are done well enough, but start getting on my nerves after a while (like the fact that Yano keeps mixing his current girlfriend with his dead ex).Art & Sound: The art isn't very good, and uses a lot of weird effects to seem more stylish or something. The sound was nice and complimented the mood well.Overall: Maybe it was because of my mood at the time, but I personally couldn't finish the show. I though the first 8-10 or so episodes were pretty good, despite the art, but after that the repetitions got to much. It certainly is a story of some depth and is kinda realistic, but far from as much as I've seen many credit it with in other reviews.

The opening music has a meaningful lyrics and eventually I was very captivated by the song.I enjoyed it a lot but there was something lacking about it. Something very important and that is a GOOD ending. I don\'t like to be a spoiler but for me the ending needs to be fixed.

A really pleasant but sad story..it could have had more comedy in it in my opinion =/ ', ""Bokura ga Ita is a light hearted romance revolving around the two main characters Nanami and Yano. While Bokura ga Ita starts out moderately promising with its enjoyable art style, sound as well as an interesting potential dramatic sub-plot it inevitably falls flat.The art style can be best described as dreamy watercolour landscape which is pleasant and pleasing to the eyes. It has a very similar essence of Kimi no Todoke with the colours chosen as well as the character design, however the choice not to draw the eyes of characters at times tended to draw from the experience or moment portrayed. Furthermore, the sound...direction is overall fair, it does not do anything spectacular, yet it does not do anything awful.There is obvious potential with the story, early within the first few episodes there are hints towards possible drama between the other side characters to possibly drive the story in an unpredicted path, or to even further develop the main characters' depth as they overcome their challenges. However that opportunity is lost, the story stays on the well beaten path of safety and goes no where interesting. There are shimmering moments which enchant the heart, but even for a light hearted romance the characters are uninspiring; despite the length of the series, the characters' progression is very shallow.Overall this would be something to skip over, while the artwork may be alluring, it fails to make up for the rest of the elements of the series. If you're looking for something with similar elements, but with better execution, Kimi no Todoke would be a better choice. direction is overall fair, it does not do anything spectacular, yet it does not do anything awful.There is obvious potential with the story, early within the first few episodes there are hints towards possible drama between the other side characters to possibly drive the story in an unpredicted path, or to even further develop the main characters' depth as they overcome their challenges.

But what separates Bokura Ga Ita from the rest is that the situations are very realistic that you might think that the author is narrating from experience.Main protagonists are well-crafted, especially Yano, who is exactly what a naughty, hormone-driven highschooler should be, though some characters (especially the friends of Nanami) are pitiful, because well, their only role was to sympathize with Nanami, but other than that, they just blend in with the background.The story is beautiful; anyone who has their fair share of happiness and betrayal in a relationship can relate.The art is...simple, I can say it was somehow low-budgeted the way the backgrounds are washed out. The anime just covered the first 30 chapters of the manga (40 chapters were left).

Then I was angry and disappointed, then happy once again, and on and on.Don't take me wrong, this is one hell of an anime, really really nicely done, of course I recommend this to people all the time, but I cannot bear hundreds of emotions swirling inside of me with each episode.For me this is one pretty,but very sad story.If you are not quiet emotional person like I am you will  definitely love it.Try to watch it either way, you will not be sorry. much for me.

Make up your own mind.', 'As a person that adores slice of life, romance and the like, ""Bokura ga Ita"" is a title that is both appalling and atrocious for the genres that it represents.To start off, the series utilises very dated graphics and art which would be a major turn off for most audiences unless perhaps you watched it during the time of release but even then there were far superior styles and animations making this one look pretty tragic in comparison. That said, I\'ll try to be subjective instead of merely blasting the series.This is a 26 episode anime which could\'ve been concluded in 4, and...without giving too much away allow me to discuss what you can expect from the narrative. The flow of the story utilises a reverse format to build its characters, meaning you can expect early progression/attraction, which will eventually pave the way for unnecessary drama and misunderstandings to occur. It will then lead to a vastly disinteresting followup that is both uninspired and somewhat frustrating. (Bonus points for adding drama here I suppose.)Watching this, felt both mentally taxing and physically painful because it made me realise that this is the epitome of a slice of life and romance that causes people to stereotype the genre and hate on it.That being said, the story itself revolves around the main cast that is supposedly \'in love\' and it doesn\'t go well which you can expect in most romance animes because if there isn\'t any conflict and or struggles in-between there isn\'t much to go on about regarding the narrative. But the series does it in such a roundabout way that you just can\'t help but feel somewhat insulted. Also, the art and music did the series no favours although they took the cutesy approach it just didn\'t work and at certain points somewhat annoying. Don\'t get me wrong, I adore cutesy romance but this one was just really way off target.Needless to say, the series held the ability to pull my attention to its comedy tier work that is bundled together with some pretty juvenile romance focus (which happens to be the main theme of the series). Although the start of the series was somewhat impactful it jumped the gun and avoided the build-up and sought to achieve something that most romance titles would call ""an accomplished romance arc"" by missing the necessary steps to build it properly the narrative and its characters felt very fragmented. So, instead of creating something meaningful the story just centres around the idea of what if and what could be.Needless to say, I didn\'t enjoy this show at all, I had to take breaks in between every 2-3 episodes which is usually a very bad sign as I tend to binge everything in one go for most animes.However, there were some elements that would\'ve worked out differently had it been executed well. Such as past trauma, lingering attachments, potential rivals and areas of conflict but because the direction of the narrative was so poorly managed neither of the potential areas of focus was able to shine. Which in turn, caused the characters to be bland and unlikeable. I don\'t usually hate on the voice actors but in this case, the more I heard them speak the more I started disliking them.Being an anime that centres around drama there sure is plenty that came about ""Conveniently"" and being a romance anime, whatever romance it had felt uninspired and bland.Perhaps, this is pretty close to real-life relationships and perhaps a good depiction of reality.It is just not for me.In conclusion,You will like this if- You want to see a back and forth between the love interests- Super slow progression that makes you wonder where they are going- Overly dramatic momentsYou will dislike this if-  You hate slow progression and somewhat indecisive characters-  Dated graphics-  Unnecessary drama. without giving too much away allow me to discuss what you can expect from the narrative.

The animation was cute and my kind of thing but the story was just so cliche. I have seen many movies with a similar plot and I just found the anime very boring. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat as most romance anime do. I wasn't like oh hey when is there first kiss going to be.... whats gonna happen next. I could pretty much predict everything that was going to...happen.the fact that the  ex gf had died was a night twist while that did throw me for a loop the rest was just mediocre and bland /tasteless. happen.the fact that the  ex gf had died was a night twist while that did throw me for a loop the rest was just mediocre and bland /tasteless."", ""This anime is alright somewhat if you are looking for a main character who is a dou*** to the girl.

And it\'s full of drama. Exciting and interesting drama, and very annoying and "" I will turn it off if they continue like this"" kinda drama. I really liked the first 15-16 episodes, but everything slowly got annoying and then turned into being miserable. The last five-episode felt like an eternity to watch. Soooo slow. However, the story was something different than most romances and that\'s kept me going till the end. Drama is a great genre, but if the maker doesn\'t give at least a bit of rest to the viewer and force...the audience to rewatch the same dramatic situations all the time it will be miserable to watch. Exactly like the second half of this anime.One thing that not let my mind rest, they talk about having sex a lot, and some of the characters have already done it...for me, a bit difficult to imagen all these conversations and experiences by kids which are only 15-16. They talk about sex in middle school. How old a kid in middle school, 13/14? ... Somehow most of the conversations are not appropriate to there age. I forced myself to think they are at least 2-3 years older.I give a 7 out of 10 to the story because the main story was interesting and it even could worth an 8, but the second half was like a 4 so I think 6 is a nice middle ground.Art: I didn\'t like it at all. It took me about 3 episodes to get used to it. And still, until the end, I found new things in the art that I didn\'t like. I think this was one of the worst looking anime I ever watched, but I usually don\'t watch ugly animes. The animation also wasn\'t very nice. Sorry, I can\'t give you any professional reason why I didn\'t like it. It just wasn\'t right. I\'m a bit of an art snob. 5/10Sound: The music was okay. I think voices have outshined the character\'s look. I was a bit hesitant with Nanami\'s voice as it too monotonous, but after a while, I decided I will think about it like it wants to be cute. 7/10Character:Yano: He is probably the most sympathetic character of all. He has emotional issues, but he really tries his best to overcome everything for his new love. He is straight forward, caring, and smart. Just a great guy really. His character has gone through an amazing development to the end.Takahashi: I really liked her until half of the anime. I thought she is a cute normal girl. I liked how she is so honest with her emotions and even though she got nervous she had the gut to make herself feel equal to Yano. However, I came to hate her to the end. She got very annoying and turned into a shy and obsessive girl. She barely talked to Yano about her problems and she only was thinking about herself. The most annoying part was that she was listening to all the outsiders, but not to the person she claimed to love so much. She turned out to be the worst character in the whole anime.Takeuchi: I really didn\'t get that guy. Is he really has no other choice just go with his best friend\'s girlfriend. The same goes for Yano\'s previous girlfriend. His whole role was unnecessary to the story. So much extra drama for nothing. I could say he made Yano more serious about Nanami, but the truth he was already very serious and if Nanami has a more understanding attitude Yano would end up on the same level how he did in the end. Takeuchi only made the second part worst.Side characters: Yuri and Nana also been pretty irritating, but at least they had a proper story and reason behind their actions.Enjoyment: I have already mentioned it above that I loved it until the 15th-16th episodes and then just everything went wrong. 6/10Overall: It had so many potentials, but they lost it halfway. It was okay to watch it once, but I definitely wouldn\'t rewatch it.  6/10 the audience to rewatch the same dramatic situations all the time it will be miserable to watch.

in the long run. what i like ab this manga/anime is the realistic approach it took compared to other shoujo/josei.the character development at the start may be a little slow and sometimes frustrating, nana, for example is extremely impressionable, very timid - sensitive. while she does tell off yano at points,...theres a lot of behaviour which he exhibits / bullying / cruel - which nana tolerates - sometimes making you feel bitterness towards yano, or bitterness for nana, for putting up w this behaviour.however, she does develop throughout the story, becoming more comfortable in herself, being able to speak up more. tolerating less. i think this journey is similar in many young girls, as we often feel overshadowed by boys in school - or lack of confidence in their presence.yanos development is interesting - we see someone impacted by loss, deep trauma, familial issues and more. it impacts the way he treats others, to nana, his friends - his own self, and life. despite all this, he showcases so much resilience and a drive to be better. nana is a huge part of this, w yano developing a deep love for her, through the patience and guidance she gives. its nice to see a story where the timid and shy girl, essentially ""saves"" the outspoken, confident boy through empathy and being present. nana\'s character also exemplifies the power of empathy and patience. despite Yano\'s harsh exterior, she manages to break through his barriers with her kindness and understanding, which eventually helps Yano in his personal journey of growth and self-improvement.i also like that the story did not necessarily depict a girl (nana) falling for a ""bad boy"" and rejecting the nice, supportive and loving boy (take) - bc the suitability between yano/nana only becomes apparent after his healing and growth. when he is a nicer / better person.the whole story is rooted in timing. showing that two people, while different, can bond at a specific time which is nourishing for each of them - but the wrong time. it showcases how impressionable that can be, expanding into adulthood - at times the show can be infantile, but definitely stick w it as it develops. the movie (part 1 / 2) may be a little better for those who don\'t like that element. theres a lot of behaviour which he exhibits / bullying / cruel -

Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41710/Genjitsu_Shugi_Yuusha_no_Oukoku_Saikenki,"['Ah, isekai. What was once a promising and delightful genre has now become the punching bag of the anime community. Riddled with memes about truck-kun, harems upon harems, stupidly overpowered perfect MCs, and ridiculously long names, it’s easy to see how this genre has become one of the stalest and over-farmed genres in all of anime.But when I first read the description for Genjitsu, I was intrigued. I’ve always been a fan of realism and reform through policy, add in my economics minor which I’m studying for uni, and you’ve got me hooked on the concept of a hero saving a world through policy reform.But...at the back of my head, there was a voice warning me against setting my hopes high for this series. And as soon as the first episode concluded, I knew I was in for a trainwreck.Genjitsu is a horrible anime, let alone an isekai, because it is predicated on never-ending, bloated dialogue and paradoxical scenarios. Not to mention the classic harem featuring all the tropes, from loli to tsundere to elves and milf-ish baddies.Light spoilers ahead (not that you’d want to watch this series anyways).I’ve seen better story dialogue writing from 4th-grade students. Just take a look at EP 6. A convenient mouthpiece chick shows up in the tavern, coincidentally at the same time as the MC king, and proceeds to go on one of the longest exposition dumps in the series. In general, the dialogue and exposition is just so 2-dimensional and bland, it sounds like it was procedurally generated using an algorithm instead of human hands. Don’t even get me started about the romance writing: I’ve read hentai with better writing and character development than this shit.Genjitsu’s worldbuilding is also filled with more holes than swiss cheese. Everything we’re told just seems to contradict what we were previously told.The entire plot of the story is centred around a supposed food shortage that drove the nation to the brink of collapse. So drastic in fact that they’re ready to sell off a hero only they can summon. Great. Except when Souma takes over, we see literally jack shit evidence of a severe food crisis. Where’s the rioting? The angry citizens? The STARVING CITIZENS? You’re trying to tell me there’s a food shortage when the overwhelming majority of the low-middle class look totally healthy. We had a whole episode dedicated to showcasing “starving people” more untraditional food options, but you’re trying to tell me people weren’t starving enough to be desperately trying to eat whatever they could get their hands on? Pathetic, and it’s a disgrace to people who have faced/are actively facing poverty, malnourishment, or famine.What about EP 7? The new port isn’t supposed to conflict/compete with the port under the jurisdiction of the water duchess, but Souma proceeds to explain how they’ll make this port the “heart of the nation”, essentially contradicting his previous assurance to Liscia. What a joke. Also, realist doesn’t do any research into surrounding settlements or try to gain approval near the planned location which leads to this “conflict” that must be resolved. Really, this is just a masked lazy attempt at making MC seem imperfect and to apply the “plan doesn’t go according to plan” trope so his main harem girl can appreciate his “imperfect character.” Apparently, I’m also supposed to believe it costs more to mass mint medals (which are never made out of pure precious metals btw, it’s always a mix) than it does to hand out royal wine reserved for the royal family and important guests? I guess I could sell my shit and become a millionaire in this world.The only bright spot in this anime is the relatively accurate depiction of basic micro and macroeconomic theories and laws. Outside of that, you have an anime with no inherent value whatsoever. Lacklustre plot, lacklustre characters, lacklustre writing, lacklustre animation and OST, and dog-water-ass worldbuilding. For an anime that’s trying to differentiate itself on being realistic, it sure fell sorely short of the piss-poor standards it set out for itself.If you’re looking to downgrade your IQ and waste your time, go ahead and crank this show on. Otherwise, you’d do best to stay the fuck away. at the back of my head, there was a voice warning me against setting my hopes high for this series.

Really, this is just a masked lazy attempt at making MC seem imperfect and to apply the “plan doesn’t go according to plan” trope so his main harem girl can appreciate his “imperfect character.” Apparently, I’m also supposed to believe it costs more to mass mint medals (which are never made out of pure precious metals btw, it’s always a mix) than it does to hand out royal wine reserved for the royal family and important guests? I guess I could sell my shit and become a millionaire in this world.The only bright spot in this anime is the relatively accurate depiction of basic micro and macroeconomic theories and laws. Outside of that, you have an anime with no inherent value whatsoever. Lacklustre plot, lacklustre characters, lacklustre writing, lacklustre animation and OST, and dog-water-ass worldbuilding. For an anime that’s trying to differentiate itself on being realistic, it sure fell sorely short of the piss-poor standards it set out for itself.If you’re looking to downgrade your IQ and waste your time, go ahead and crank this show on. Otherwise, you’d do best to stay the fuck away.', 'I need a herooooo!!! I\'m holding out for a hero \'til the end of the ni, ight~!He\'s gotta be a chick magnetAnd he\'s gotta have no personalityAnd he\'s gotta be...a realist!?!?Realist Hero might seem like it\'s not worth your time on the surface. The premise certainly sounds familiar. Man gets transported to a fantasy world and is tasked with helping it out with his knowledge and/or power. He meets many impressionable young girls along the way, including a knight and an animal girl loli, and they all fall for him for inexplicable reasons. If this storyline sounds bland and soulless to you, then...that\'s because you\'ve seen this anime before in the form of Death March, Isekai wa Smartphone, and a plethora of others. But wait! This anime does one thing so different, so original, that it completely flips the script.The hero is a realist.""Pray tell, what does this mean?"" Your curious mind might be wondering. Why, this essentially means that the protagonist understands basic concepts on how to manage a territory and its resources and spends entire episodes explaining these things to the stupid cast who are in awe of his intelligence because they apparently know absolutely nothing. Some even pledge their lives to him when he simply tells them rudimentary practices. And that is the entire show. Wow, how exciting! This dude is certainly flipping the switch on stereotypical hero roles!! I love watching characters stand completely still and talk about farming for 20 minutes!!!The characters are all very memorable, they range from fat guy to girl with big boobs. The female lead dresses in a military outfit and wears her hair in a ponytail, which shows that she\'s a strong, independent woman. She still falls for the hero though and becomes completely dependent on him after 10 minutes because his penmanship technique is sooooo irresistible. Oh, and all of these characters have an aptitude, that one skill that makes them truly special. And when I learned about how weird and seemingly worthless their talents are when it comes to bettering a nation, my expectations were certainly subverted! Wow, stuff like this almost makes me forget about the substandard production values!Through watching, I discovered something truly eye opening. The two leads are voiced by Inori Minase and Kobayashi Yuusuke, who are the seiyuu for Rem and Subaru from Re:Zero. This has led me to conclude that the casting director is a RemXSubaru shipper. This is clearly the most important piece of information that has come out of The Realist Hero.

To put it simply it is log horizon minus the guilds and multiple people reincarnated with shiroe(soma) being the king of a failed state. It does try to follow most of the isekai tropes but hey that has its own fans right?I like the fact that the MC is likeable and not some kirito knowall with a degree in every possible subject on earth , his knowledge seems to be more about Human resource and how to get shit done which is kind of a big deal even in our world you know.The art is well done even if it does present the standard isekai setting , it tries and succeeds in telling us about the country lore , conflicts and issues in a very concise and practical manner and i like how well done and properly explained the map was not putting its title of realist to shame, voice acting seems to have some prominent names and is being carried out in a relatively good manner , characters are a little lifeless except of the new minister OP is great and so is the ED , they haven't had the chance to show off any animation yetIf you like log horizon or isekais in general you are sure to love this, However even if you are not an isekai fan this is one of the Better takes on the genre so please do give it a shot ! only reason i feel the cover girl  exists so far is to ask soma questions and make him seem cool while also being a waifu which is why i am dissatisfied with the harem being there in an otherwise fantastic show.The show overall is a really fun ride which focuses on the political elements of a somewhat medieval setting and using logic and politics as well as a bit of economics to make a failed kingdom a better one .

But as it stands, Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki (or its short form ""Realist Hero"" I\'ll be referring to from now on) just sorta went downhill as the series progresses for me. Maybe you\'d like it, but personally I have watched shows that have similar settings, but just executed a lot more better a.k.a Log Horizon. And also, while I appreciate that there\'s a variety of Isekai in the Summer season, there\'s hits and misses, and this sadly falls under the latter.To be...fair, what novelist Dojyomaru has on hand is quite the interesting story plot about an Isekai where politics and power play come into mind: it\'s basically Kingdom Administration (or more appropraitely Re:Construction). A story about an Otherworlder (Kazuya Souma) who got Isekai-ed to not just play the role of the hero, but instead, to be the next king in a kingdom where it\'s falling apart at the seams against all odds of threats coming both left and right. It\'s not just the usual typical trope of the Demon Lord\'s army\'s uprising, but also internal problems that leaves a kingdom incapable of supporting itself. With some words of wisdom from Kazuya\'s grandmother that ""A man needs to make a family and never fail to protect it no matter what."", he is summoned into the fantasy world as a hero first to help solve a crisis. But here\'s the twist: the humanities student Kazuya\'s no OP character, but he has his knowledge of realism and machiavellianism at his disposal to make whatever calls he desires as the roles are consequently handed down to him to help a kingdom come out of its deadly course, from a hero to a realist king. It\'s very similar to Civilization if you\'ve played the game before.This series starts out really slow and boring, because that\'s where the magic happens for Kazuya\'s crusade to save the Kingdom of Elfrieden that equals constant development over the course of its run. Nevertheless, even if Kazuya\'s new at the job of being king, he has to constantly decree numerous amout of reforms, conduct negotiations and do everything a king is supposed to do to win the war against the demons and other kingdoms that could wipe a developing kingdom. In order to understand this series generally, it hinges on these words: ""Slow but interesting"". As far as I understand the pacing of the anime, as compared to the light novel of the same name, it can drag on for episodes with the rhetoric that to ""wait until something happens"". And while that may be the series Achilles\' Heel, it\'s also the backbone of how some people would come to enjoy the series for what it is: consistency, that plays a major part of how Realist Hero is written to be that slow-burner, easily droppable, but fascinating work if you can stick it out ""for just one more chapter"" (that sadly, people don\'t have big brains to understand that it also is a creative concept of some authors who don\'t like to infodump all at one shot).The world-building of Realist Hero does not only kick its legs at the intended story plot, it has to include characters that drive its narrative together with Kazuya\'s realism mentality of kingdom administrative reforms. I have to say that the Elfrieden Council of advisories to the current king are quite the livid frustration, because kingdoms in the past ages can be a lot authoritarian with its leadership and regime, and in this case, they are the last ones that could help save the kingdom of what\'s left. But to summon a hero-turned-king such as Kazuya to solve their issues, it\'s a huge demand on his shoulders to pounce on all that at once, and him using his avaliable powers and resources to save that which is and could be lost is truly a godsend.There is also the traditional tropey Isekai formula of the harem to help Kazuya, and in this case, a mixed bag of execution of some good and some bad. Kicking things off with the Elfrieden crown princess Liscia, she is the one who stood by Kazuya\'s side the most ever since the position takeover, and is quite the amusing character to see. I mean, sure, getting forcefully engaged with Kazuya is not necessarily the right move from a family such as her\'s. It really looks like her royal family just gave up all hope and passed the baton onto Kazuya, which her father King Albert just approves and abdicates the throne to him, making Liscia the next queen in the process to this unequivocal guy who is both IQ and EQ smart to handle. This forces Liscia to a corner, but what choices does she have than to go with her hopeless father\'s wishes. Eventually, her relationship blossoms with Kazuya becoming the typical boy-girl relationship, but on a much higher pedestal being king and queen of Elfrieden. And for those who like your waifus, Liscia can bear a polyamory relationship, so that\'s a first if I\'ve ever heard of someone who can accept being a concubine, but of course adamantly wanting to be 1st place (like any other true wife),Alas, there are just too many characters in this show that while each of them makes useful contributions to Kazuya\'s kingdom reforms, this move is generally good for such a fantasy world of historical origins. But I\'d feel like that the adage of ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" is prevalent, and this is a series that awfully needs that lot in order for the story and plot to work. As mentioned of the harem, there\'re some potential waifus that make up the bulk of Kazuya\'s ministerial team (Aisha Udgard who acts as Kazuya\'s bodyguard, Juna Doma who acts as Kazuya\'s peace-time minister-cum-idol symbol to name a few) plus some men (Hakuya Kwonmin as Kazuya\'s strategist; Poncho Panacotta as Kazuya\'s literate ""Shokugeki no Souma"", it\'s in the name), it\'s equivocally hard to get invested in most characters if they\'re just serving their purposes, and regrettably the anime does that a lot which results in loss of focus. It\'s a shame, really.Also, J.C.Staff, I should give you a new nickname: from ""Justifying Creative Staff"" to ""Just Crap Stuff"", because Realist Hero does feel decently produced. But it\'s clear where the budget is centrally focused at: the wonky 3DCG camerawork, which I don\'t know if going by in-house veteran director Takashi Watanabe\'s direction to include that does make the anime at the very least interesting to give a perspective. If all this was just an experiment for a guinea pig test of sorts, then I\'m not sorry to say that it is weird to see such disparity in the face of inconsistency against the backdrops of the half-assed visuals and bad animation. This guy has done a lot of classic J.C.Staff shows from the mid-2000s, but as well as I want to trust that this director knows what he\'s doing, this just contributes to the miniscule side of failures.I\'ve always said this: even if the anime fails outright, the music aspect can be its saving grace. Dolorously, this aspect is worse than so-so. I\'ve heard a lot of songs from Inori Minase over the years, and the OP ""Hello Horizon"" is a good ol\' catchy song, but compared to her repertoires before, this can be placed into the bottom of a B-roll double-sided CD. What I find absolutely offending is the ED song and its visuals, which can be very comparable to a PowerPoint presentation, just add some animation of its lyrics in there to complete the song. Just pure laziness. What the hell?All of this begs the question: ""Why then contribute your work to a show where there\'s clearly no passion be to shown?"" Realist Hero overall, can be a better show if given the right talents and a production staff team who are truly dedicated to the work. But as it stands of the current state of the anime industry, it\'s just rolls over to us the audience to pick up the original source material, because it\'s a promotional work first and foremost. We\'ve seen big-hit works get phenomenal because of the anime doing justice to the source material (e.g. the most recent being Tokyo Revengers), but this just saddens LN fans (like a certain Typecero) and anime-onlies who wanted more from a political Isekai show such as Realist Hero.This show could\'ve been a decent potential series, but the anime just squandered it to insensibility and pure stupefaction. Good thing Season 2 is coming in Winter 2022, so at least the story has a continuation to cure that disease-ridden mindset. fair, what novelist Dojyomaru has on hand is quite the interesting story plot about an Isekai where politics and power play come into mind: it\'s basically Kingdom Administration (or more appropraitely Re:Construction).

In the anime industry today, we have countless isekai that adapts all sort of tropes. It's become so common that once you've seen a few, it felt like you've seen them all. What does that say about How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom?For starters, we have to understand that the show is somewhat atypical with its storytelling standards, at least for an isekai. Rather than presenting a plot with a hero trying to save the world or...going on some fantasy adventure, he's trying to save a kingdom by rebuilding it. Think of the series as a kingdom management game where the protagonist is the player and controls assets, resources, and followers. When watching the show, it became obvious that our protagonist has a lot to learn to deal with the civil unrest and rebuilding of a kingdom. Meet Kazuya Souma, the man whose life changes forever after being transported to Kingdom of Elfrieden and becomes its ruler.At first glance, Kazuya doesn't come across as an unique individual. He looks like an average man but with a passionate personality and realist point of view. As a realist hero, he is also human and that means he makes mistakes. Being a ruler is no easy task and he learns the hard way when dealing with his followers. At the same time, he's an eager learner and always seeks solutions to problems. Luckily, he's not alone. Kazuya is aided by a diverse group of foreigners with different backgrounds and skills. These include the crown princess Lisica, songstress Juna Doma, dark elf chief Aisha, among others. What's important to understand is not how Kazuya treats them but how he develops relationships and use them to build his kingdom. And trust me, it's a complicated journey.Describing the character roster feels like trying being in an RPG game where each party member is an important asset. Perhaps the most prominent one is Lisicia, a strong willed girl but also somewhat inexperienced in her role. With Kazuya's guidance, she learns the way of the kingdom and supports him during his travels. From politics to military experience, Lisicia's character has a lot of potential and this season explores some of those aspects. Juna Doma represents the mature character of the show as she demonstrates virtue and elegance. She's also fairly intelligent, wise, and loyal to Kazuya, which are all traits imperative for her role. In contrast, there's the dark elf Aisha who serves more as a muscle. While she can be airheaded, Aisha is also very couragous and isn't afraid to fight for what she believes in, regardless how challenging it can be. To me, that represents the heart of the Kazuya's group for she is able to stand strong when a situation gets rough. Finally, we have Roroa and perhaps the odd one from the main character roster. Honestly, she stands out less compare to the others but is known to be cleverly manipulative at times. We don't see her often until the latter stages of the series, when she put her plans to motion.As a fantasy  drama that combines military politics, management, relationship building, and character studies, it's not easy to flesh out the anime in just 13 episodes. Luckily, the anime itself knows what it needed to do to establish its main premise from the beginning. By throwing an ordinary guy like Kazuya in a fantasy setting, it tests his intelligence, integrity, and ultimately, showing us what type of ruler he can really be. When king Albert and prime minister Marx took the risk to assign Kazuya as a kingdom ruler, they made a calculated choice. To further more, he is offered by Albert to marry his daughter, Lisicia. Yes, you can bet that will set off some red flags as the romance element of the show can feel forced at times. Kazuya's humbleness and determination also draws other female characters to him such as Aisha. However, don't expect this any sort of Cinderella-like romance. This anime isn't a love story.Despite the limited amount of action, we do see combat at times when the call needs for it. One of the most prominent threat to the Kingdom of Elfrieden is Castor, as he presents to be a military challenge during the civil war. Gaius also proves to be a troubling individual to deal with especially when he declares to kill Kazuya. it isn't until Kazuya's clever thinking as a ruler that he stops the invasion and ultimately comes up with a compromise to save the kingdom. The war drama and battles often feels like old school fantasy mixed with magic and technology. Remember, this show takes place in a world where science is absent and Kazuya realized this from the beginning. It's just up to him to make use of his skills and be the voice for the voiceless.Adapted by studio J.C. Staff, they handled this show with care and tried to adapt the characters as they should be. The word here is 'tried' because at some occasions, it doesn't hit the bullesye. Characters such as Juna looks less appealing compared to their light novel or manga counterparts. Kazuya himself may be hard to accept as a king due to his average looks. Still, the anime maintains a fantasy level of credibility. It looks like a world built on the Unreal Engine with an acceptable level of technical quality.

That\'s some Bollywood smart-ass tactics I can say. Yea that\'s how I just see this anime. I Have seen like 6 episodes and I can already say that the story goes exactly nowhere, the characters are so generic you can barely get attached to any of them. First of all you have the main characters who everyone thinks that he is...""special"" or something and the female main character which is just some cheap ass king\'s daughter, with no special talent or special abilities. Then you have the supporting characters and of course it needs to be more cute girls so the main female character gets jealous when any of those girls approach the main male character and yea... And one of the girls sings like what the hell, it wasn\'t cringe enough that we always end up episodes with some raveling but not show it? Wow, we sing, What is this ? ""How a realist hero rebuilt the high school musical"" ? Get your shit together. Of course we have an useless fat dude that does nothing but eating and talking about food. And then there is that smart dude who looks kind of evil, but he is not and he joins forces with the main male character, just to betray him in the end (probably, that didn\'t happen in the six episodes that I saw, I\'m just assuming that will happen because that\'s what happens in every generic Isekai)After finishing some episodes you might ask yourself: ""Didn\'t I watch this anime already ?

You have been warned.Rebuilding a kingdom not through might but through words, change and diplomacyBased on a popular light novel series of the same name Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki which is more popularly known among both anime watchers and readers of the light novel as How a Realist Hero rebuilt the kingdom is an action, fantasy and romance genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day Kazuya Souma a 19-year-old college...student is suddenly transported to another world after the death of his most cherished grandfather. However, what if instead of being summoned and granted the combat ability of a battlemaster or the power to use supernatural powers that allows users to use the knowledge that they accumulated in previous lives to enact plans of action that our hero was one that while having neither instead possessed an extensive amount of knowledge on economics and governance and most importantly a desire to rebuild a country from the ground up. In this we have our hero Kazuma Souma who while lacking brawn and powerful magic that characterizes the Isekai genre is one that’s every bit as equal in his ability to use his knowledge to not only change the country but the world as well.On the surface, while the series itself has much of the trappings of the Isekai genre what served to differentiate it in my view was the fact that much of the plans and reforms that he enacts over the course of the series overall narrative is a result of not unmatched combat ability nor mysterious magic that transcends even death as other Isekai shows featured but rather simple replication and application of modern-day economic and governance practices that allowed him to readily reignite the embers of a declining nation and rebuild it into something that its people are content with living in. This combination of a desire to rebuild a nation from the ground up with modern-day techniques when used in combination with Souma’s innate intelligence, charm and ability at foresight I felt really served to make the show stand out from among its peers within the genre as these served to make the series narrative and premise that much more interesting and unpredictable and serving well to draw me to this series. The series opening episode I felt while doing a great job of introducing the main character of Kazuya Souma also did well to showcase not only the dire straits the world and the kingdom of Elfriden kingdom is in thanks to the demon lord’s domain but also the daunting task of governing it as its newly crowned king after being given the role.Kazuya SoumaKazuya Souma portrayed by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Our Last crusade or the Rise of a new world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 19-year-old student that lived in modern-day Japan prior to his summon to the kingdom of Elfriden and appointed as its new king Kazuya from his initial appearances was shown to be a quiet, calm and composed person by nature that while intelligent and well versed in a wide variety of topics was also someone that was capable of not only analyzing its teachings but also applying it in practice as well as shown in the many reforms that he had enacted after taking charge. While a kind and understanding person by nature Kazuya was also a realist and shown to be particularly adept at determining the hearts and personalities of men both in terms of his kingdoms social classes as well as his own people aspects that served to not only allow him to determine the priorities for rebuilding the kingdom but also determine the best ways in which he can win the trust of the people a combination that I felt served to not only establish himself not only as a new king but one that while readily admitting his own inexperience as a ruler was someone that cared little about either tradition, social classes or races and was someone whose first priority was in improving the quality of life for its people by modernizing both its infrastructure and economy even if it meant placing himself in opposition to powerful nobles and ever-ambitious foreigners who would love nothing more than to seize control of a kingdom that has a rookie king at its helm. On the surface, while setting himself to face not only the task of rebuilding and modernizing his country but also planning to unite it against any foreign invasion may sound like one that will be impossible for one man to achieve I believed that the twin tasks served as an excellent means to create the foundation to which Kazuya can use to stand upon as he sets about improving the country’s tech level and allow his people to live safely and in relative comfort.As the series progresses and Kazuya’s efforts to modernize the country are complicated by opposition from not only the nobles but also natural disasters and foreign interventions from opportunistic rivals Kazuya’s personality slowly begins to change as he is forced to adapt to an ever-changing world that is found in no book he’s read. While Kazuya was someone that was kind and honest by nature and was someone that possessed guile and intelligence in equal measure he was not someone that believed that his view should be expressed via forceful means unlike his erstwhile neighbor's in the principality of Amidonia preferring instead to be open with his people and listening to their concerns and discerning measures that can be used to help them overcome both their short term problems but also address it in the long term as well an act that is best shown in him trading their national treasures to repay their debt to the empire and the televised address to the people where he set about outlining his plans and asking for any who think that their innate skills may be useful to join him. This sense of openness for a newly crowned king while doing well in showing his humility and determination to change matters also showed well to the people that young as he is perhaps Kazuya was someone that they can finally place their whole trust in after years of having an ineffective king at the helm. In my eyes this speech while serving as an excellent means to introduce himself to the people also showed well Kazuya’s skill at foresight as he had correctly predicted that while his plans will go a long way in improving the kingdom he cannot do so without the willing support of his people and only with their blessing would he be able to change their lives an aspect that I really admired about him.While the business of running a country even with a staff of handpicked retainers was certainly a daunting task that involved making some heavy decisions both domestically and internationally Kazuya nonetheless was someone that had a more empathic side to him and while not shown often was quite capable of expressing strong feelings openly as shown in the sense of regret, devastation and sadness that he expressed on seeing the impact of the landslide on the dark elves village a side of him that I felt made him more human and relatable as few rulers would spare thoughts for such minor events. While the negative feelings expressed above showcased well his desire to protect the people from all manner of threats Kazuya was also someone that had a surprisingly fun sense of humor within him that he used to excellent effect both to inform the people of new developments but also in showcasing his own creations as shown in the cooking program in ep4 a development that while doing well in creating new food items also showed to them that their king wasn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty when it came to solving the food shortages aspects that were complemented greatly by Kazuya’s friendly, easy-going and optimistic nature. While the event itself was certainly one that had a functional goal in mind, I felt that they also served to allow the characters to have some fun, unwind and bring some welcome comedy to both them and us something that I felt was accomplished quite readily.Overall, as a character Kazuya Souma I felt was an excellent one that while possessing neither skill with blade or magic was one that was able to take to the new role of being king easily via both the recruitment of skilled subordinates as well as his own innate intelligence, knowledge and cunning that allowed him to not only overcome fearsome odds with not brawn but rather with words, ideas, plans and budgets that showed the world that one does not need to be a despot to make their country strong. One that rules with a firm but gentle hand that takes and considers the advice of his most trusted subordinates while always thinking of the people can also create a country that’s strong and united. His development from freshly summoned hero to king I felt while making effective usage of his intelligence and ability to adapt to given situations quickly also in my opinion served to streamline the overall narrative which within the genre often gets itself slowed due to the need for the mc to realize this is a new world whereas in this case Kazuya simply took it in stride and dealt with one thing at a time. After his lengthy stint as Subaru in Re Zero it's nice to see Yusuke Kobayashi portray a character that while similar to Subaru was someone that can be said to be the total opposite of him in both temperament, maturity and ability to think long term.LisciaLiscia Elfriden portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and A Place Further than the universe fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the primary heroines within the series. The sole daughter of the former king and queen of Elfriden and its former princess Liscia from her initial appearances was shown to be a confident, kind and honest person by nature that nonetheless also possessed a surprisingly fiery and haughty side to her that I felt complimented her character well. As a former member of the kingdom’s royalty Liscia was someone that while polite and courteous was one that trusted others warily and as a result of her fiery nature tended to misunderstand situations and the intents of others as shown in her first encounters with Kazuya who she viewed as a cheater or fraud that had usurped her father’s role.However, beneath the surface, Liscia can be seen to be someone that while wary of outsiders and those that haven’t proved themselves to her was one that appreciated hard work and results that have been earned from it and was shown to be very loyal towards those that have earned her trust. While Liscia at the beginning of the series was shown to be somewhat of an idealist that believed perhaps too strongly in the belief that age-old traditions should be maintained, when possible, she was someone that was shown to be rather adaptable with her thinking when sufficient facts are shown to her. Though Liscia’s fiery and stubborn nature can often make people think that she’s a difficult person to interact with Liscia beneath her base nature was actually someone that was honest and caring by nature and was quite capable of reflecting upon her judgement and apologizing when needed a fact that I felt really served to complement her character’s desire to find the best way possible to rebuild her country by allying with Kazuya a person though she suspected as a fraud at first soon become the shining beacon that they needed to help her beloved home.As a character Liscia I felt was an interesting character that was designed and developed relatively well as the series progressed. While Liscia’s first encounter with Kazuya was not the most pleasant experience for either of them Liscia’s innate qualities of being a stubborn and fiery yet intelligent and rational person over the course of the series served to establish her as not a princess but a dear friend and confidant for Kazuya that was always on hand to give him not only practical advice on the world but also emotional and combat support when needed. While her knowledge of how an economy works and how these will affect the kingdom’s people is not as refined as those of Kazuya her ability to self-reflect and expand upon ideas that have been proposed allowed her to not only keep in sync with Kazuya relatively easily but also served to keep him grounded as a person a relationship that I felt served to remind us that while being a king is a hard role it will be even harder if you did not have someone that you can be frank with in both your feelings and your plans to rebuild the land a role that Liscia managed to fulfil excellently.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the animation used within the series was not only clear and detailed but also made great use of colour and environmental variety within its settings. Character design-wise while the series featured your standard variety of humans and elves or in this case the dark elves it also featured some interesting races that were unique to the series such as the Lion Beastman, Sea Serpent, Dragonnewt and Mystic wolves all of which featured designs that I felt while making them all unique in terms of race qualities also served to expand upon the lore of the kingdom as well with each of their traits serving to enhance each of the respective military branches and giving each a unique capability when their service is required as was demonstrated by the air force during their relief of the forbidden army . While the number of locations that the cast visit throughout the series wasn’t especially large by any means the ones that were featured I felt served to showcase well not only the reason for Kazuya’s reforms but also showcase the kind of division that existed within the kingdom even before his arrival and appointment as king as shown in the abundant cotton fields who are unable to sell because of supply exceeding demand, the tired and hungry civilians across the land who aren’t getting supplies due to inadequate road networks and lastly the decentralized military whose cities and domains while impressive in scale did nothing to help the kingdoms people and whose independence while itself initially a safety measure ended up causing issues with chain of command when their strength was needed the most. While the locations shown were indeed few the impact that they had allowing us to see how dire things were within the kingdom were certainly more than enough.Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hello Horizon that was performed by Liscia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase and Kazanear that was performed by Aimi who portrayed the character of Carla. Both of these songs while excellent ones served to represent different emotions and feelings when used in conjunction with their accompanying visuals with the former being able to inject a level of tension within it as it introduced not only how divided the continent of Landia was but also how tough of a job Kazuya and his trusted allies have as they set about rebuilding Elfrieden when faced against the might of hostile nations and ambitious warriors and dukes that are determined to take advantage of the new reality being presented to them. On the other hand, the ending theme can be said to have the opposite effect in that it conveyed the feelings of hope, determination and a desire to forge a new path and future for your people by implementing change without compromising one’s own values and morals a contrast that I felt complimented both the series central theme and the feelings conveyed by the opening.In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall, the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase who portrayed the main leads did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Kazuya Souma and Liscia Elfriden whose character chemistry really served to make them a delight to see on screen. Backing them up were a host of talented seiyuu’s who did well both to support them in their endeavors or frustrating them as their opponents with notable ones being Ikumi Hasegawa whose portrayal of the powerful but surprisingly gluttonous dark elf Aisha was as inspiring as it was amusing, Reina Ueda whose portrayal of the beautiful and graceful angel Juna was as elegant as it was awe-inspiring on account of her ability to combine her singing talent with mc and her duties as an advisor and lastly the trinity of dukes of Excel Walter, Castor Vargas and Georg Carmine who were portrayed by veteran seiyuu’s Yui Horie, Jun Fukuyama and Taiten Kusonoki who managed to convey into their characters a level of maturity, stubbornness and a desire to test Kazuya Souma’s mettle of king that served to make them formidable obstacles for him in the first days of the rebuilding and really make him pull out all the stops needed to overcome them.Overall conclusionIn overall I felt that How a Realist Hero rebuilt The kingdom was an excellent anime that had among its main strengths an interesting premise, narrative, excellent characters that were both well designed and developed, stellar voice acting and creative problems that had to be addressed by the cast all of which served to introduce a welcome change to the Isekai genre by creating a tale in which the hero solves problems via intelligence, knowledge, words and creativity rather than with swords or magic a change that I felt served as an additional reason for this series popularity.While the Isekai genre despite being one that has been in existence for just over 2 decades continues to move from strength to strength its focus in providing narratives that are easily relatable to its intended audience of teenagers have in my opinion started to make animes of this genre somewhat predictable in its ideas. However, in the case of Realist the series while having the standard trappings of the genre represented something of a unique case due to the fact that Kazuya did not take up the role of a combatant as most series of the genre would have but rather take up the role of an administrator or in Kazuya’s mind a caretaker king who would take up management of the kingdom of Elfrieden until a new and worthy king arrives to take over. Although Kazuya Souma was quite capable of taking upon the blade and becoming a warrior as many Isekai before it had done so with their mc’s the narratives decision to place him as a king who fought with words, plans and knowledge I felt really served to differentiate him while also allowing the usage of his impressive knowledge on economics and governance to full effect. While the series itself is indeed a relatively slow-paced series on account of its reliance on diplomacy and problem solving I felt that this resonated well with the overall goal of rebuilding the kingdom from the ground up that served to allow us a unique insight into the kind of goals and milestones that are necessary for the management of a kingdom that ranges from practical issues such as addressing food shortages, infrastructure, optimal crop placement and talent recruitment to more sensitive issues like liaising with the different races and social classes within the kingdom to inspire loyalty and unity against threats both internal and external. Though the reforms extensive as they were are not revolutionary by modern standards their implementation when combined with Kazuya’s skill at innovation proved to be both entertaining and a valuable lesson to learn as well a fact that was bolstered by the excellent usage of Kazuya’s skill at breaking apart complex knowledge into easily understood info that can be easily understood.Overall, how a Realist rebuilt the kingdom was an excellent anime that provided a fine balance of entertainment, tension, comedy, heartfelt bonding moments and a level of unpredictability in the form of Kazuya Souma’s reform plans that left me eagerly waiting to see each episode as a new week began. While there were admittedly characters that I felt were underused within the narrative that I wished could have seen more expansion overall the series’ adaptation from its source material I felt was a resounding success. Anime’s that require the cast to actually think and consider all angles of a problem are a rarity these days and I for one would like to see more of these types of animes over ones where violence and OP superpowers have become the norm. As a final score, I would say that it easily deserves a 9/10. student is suddenly transported to another world after the death of his most cherished grandfather. However, what if instead of being summoned and granted the combat ability of a battlemaster or the power to use supernatural powers that allows users to use the knowledge that they accumulated in previous lives to enact plans of action that our hero was one that while having neither instead possessed an extensive amount of knowledge on economics and governance and most importantly a desire to rebuild a country from the ground up.

In my eyes this speech while serving as an excellent means to introduce himself to the people also showed well Kazuya’s skill at foresight as he had correctly predicted that while his plans will go a long way in improving the kingdom he cannot do so without the willing support of his people and only with their blessing would he be able to change their lives an aspect that I really admired about him.While the business of running a country even with a staff of handpicked retainers was certainly a daunting task that involved making some heavy decisions both domestically and internationally Kazuya nonetheless was someone that had a more empathic side to him and while not shown often was quite capable of expressing strong feelings openly as shown in the sense of regret, devastation and sadness that he expressed on seeing the impact of the landslide on the dark elves village a side of him that I felt made him more human and relatable as few rulers would spare thoughts for such minor events. While the negative feelings expressed above showcased well his desire to protect the people from all manner of threats Kazuya was also someone that had a surprisingly fun sense of humor within him that he used to excellent effect both to inform the people of new developments but also in showcasing his own creations as shown in the cooking program in ep4 a development that while doing well in creating new food items also showed to them that their king wasn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty when it came to solving the food shortages aspects that were complemented greatly by Kazuya’s friendly, easy-going and optimistic nature. While the event itself was certainly one that had a functional goal in mind, I felt that they also served to allow the characters to have some fun, unwind and bring some welcome comedy to both them and us something that I felt was accomplished quite readily.Overall, as a character Kazuya Souma I felt was an excellent one that while possessing neither skill with blade or magic was one that was able to take to the new role of being king easily via both the recruitment of skilled subordinates as well as his own innate intelligence, knowledge and cunning that allowed him to not only overcome fearsome odds with not brawn but rather with words, ideas, plans and budgets that showed the world that one does not need to be a despot to make their country strong. One that rules with a firm but gentle hand that takes and considers the advice of his most trusted subordinates while always thinking of the people can also create a country that’s strong and united. His development from freshly summoned hero to king I felt while making effective usage of his intelligence and ability to adapt to given situations quickly also in my opinion served to streamline the overall narrative which within the genre often gets itself slowed due to the need for the mc to realize this is a new world whereas in this case Kazuya simply took it in stride and dealt with one thing at a time. After his lengthy stint as Subaru in Re Zero it's nice to see Yusuke Kobayashi portray a character that while similar to Subaru was someone that can be said to be the total opposite of him in both temperament, maturity and ability to think long term.LisciaLiscia Elfriden portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and A Place Further than the universe fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the primary heroines within the series. The sole daughter of the former king and queen of Elfriden and its former princess Liscia from her initial appearances was shown to be a confident, kind and honest person by nature that nonetheless also possessed a surprisingly fiery and haughty side to her that I felt complimented her character well. As a former member of the kingdom’s royalty Liscia was someone that while polite and courteous was one that trusted others warily and as a result of her fiery nature tended to misunderstand situations and the intents of others as shown in her first encounters with Kazuya who she viewed as a cheater or fraud that had usurped her father’s role.However, beneath the surface, Liscia can be seen to be someone that while wary of outsiders and those that haven’t proved themselves to her was one that appreciated hard work and results that have been earned from it and was shown to be very loyal towards those that have earned her trust. While Liscia at the beginning of the series was shown to be somewhat of an idealist that believed perhaps too strongly in the belief that age-old traditions should be maintained, when possible, she was someone that was shown to be rather adaptable with her thinking when sufficient facts are shown to her. Though Liscia’s fiery and stubborn nature can often make people think that she’s a difficult person to interact with Liscia beneath her base nature was actually someone that was honest and caring by nature and was quite capable of reflecting upon her judgement and apologizing when needed a fact that I felt really served to complement her character’s desire to find the best way possible to rebuild her country by allying with Kazuya a person though she suspected as a fraud at first soon become the shining beacon that they needed to help her beloved home.As a character Liscia I felt was an interesting character that was designed and developed relatively well as the series progressed. While Liscia’s first encounter with Kazuya was not the most pleasant experience for either of them Liscia’s innate qualities of being a stubborn and fiery yet intelligent and rational person over the course of the series served to establish her as not a princess but a dear friend and confidant for Kazuya that was always on hand to give him not only practical advice on the world but also emotional and combat support when needed. While her knowledge of how an economy works and how these will affect the kingdom’s people is not as refined as those of Kazuya her ability to self-reflect and expand upon ideas that have been proposed allowed her to not only keep in sync with Kazuya relatively easily but also served to keep him grounded as a person a relationship that I felt served to remind us that while being a king is a hard role it will be even harder if you did not have someone that you can be frank with in both your feelings and your plans to rebuild the land a role that Liscia managed to fulfil excellently.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the animation used within the series was not only clear and detailed but also made great use of colour and environmental variety within its settings. Character design-wise while the series featured your standard variety of humans and elves or in this case the dark elves it also featured some interesting races that were unique to the series such as the Lion Beastman, Sea Serpent, Dragonnewt and Mystic wolves all of which featured designs that I felt while making them all unique in terms of race qualities also served to expand upon the lore of the kingdom as well with each of their traits serving to enhance each of the respective military branches and giving each a unique capability when their service is required as was demonstrated by the air force during their relief of the forbidden army . While the number of locations that the cast visit throughout the series wasn’t especially large by any means the ones that were featured I felt served to showcase well not only the reason for Kazuya’s reforms but also showcase the kind of division that existed within the kingdom even before his arrival and appointment as king as shown in the abundant cotton fields who are unable to sell because of supply exceeding demand, the tired and hungry civilians across the land who aren’t getting supplies due to inadequate road networks and lastly the decentralized military whose cities and domains while impressive in scale did nothing to help the kingdoms people and whose independence while itself initially a safety measure ended up causing issues with chain of command when their strength was needed the most. While the locations shown were indeed few the impact that they had allowing us to see how dire things were within the kingdom were certainly more than enough.Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hello Horizon that was performed by Liscia’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase and Kazanear that was performed by Aimi who portrayed the character of Carla. Both of these songs while excellent ones served to represent different emotions and feelings when used in conjunction with their accompanying visuals with the former being able to inject a level of tension within it as it introduced not only how divided the continent of Landia was but also how tough of a job Kazuya and his trusted allies have as they set about rebuilding Elfrieden when faced against the might of hostile nations and ambitious warriors and dukes that are determined to take advantage of the new reality being presented to them. On the other hand, the ending theme can be said to have the opposite effect in that it conveyed the feelings of hope, determination and a desire to forge a new path and future for your people by implementing change without compromising one’s own values and morals a contrast that I felt complimented both the series central theme and the feelings conveyed by the opening.In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall, the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase who portrayed the main leads did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Kazuya Souma and Liscia Elfriden whose character chemistry really served to make them a delight to see on screen. Backing them up were a host of talented seiyuu’s who did well both to support them in their endeavors or frustrating them as their opponents with notable ones being Ikumi Hasegawa whose portrayal of the powerful but surprisingly gluttonous dark elf Aisha was as inspiring as it was amusing, Reina Ueda whose portrayal of the beautiful and graceful angel Juna was as elegant as it was awe-inspiring on account of her ability to combine her singing talent with mc and her duties as an advisor and lastly the trinity of dukes of Excel Walter, Castor Vargas and Georg Carmine who were portrayed by veteran seiyuu’s Yui Horie, Jun Fukuyama and Taiten Kusonoki who managed to convey into their characters a level of maturity, stubbornness and a desire to test Kazuya Souma’s mettle of king that served to make them formidable obstacles for him in the first days of the rebuilding and really make him pull out all the stops needed to overcome them.Overall conclusionIn overall I felt that How a Realist Hero rebuilt The kingdom was an excellent anime that had among its main strengths an interesting premise, narrative, excellent characters that were both well designed and developed, stellar voice acting and creative problems that had to be addressed by the cast all of which served to introduce a welcome change to the Isekai genre by creating a tale in which the hero solves problems via intelligence, knowledge, words and creativity rather than with swords or magic a change that I felt served as an additional reason for this series popularity.While the Isekai genre despite being one that has been in existence for just over 2 decades continues to move from strength to strength its focus in providing narratives that are easily relatable to its intended audience of teenagers have in my opinion started to make animes of this genre somewhat predictable in its ideas. However, in the case of Realist the series while having the standard trappings of the genre represented something of a unique case due to the fact that Kazuya did not take up the role of a combatant as most series of the genre would have but rather take up the role of an administrator or in Kazuya’s mind a caretaker king who would take up management of the kingdom of Elfrieden until a new and worthy king arrives to take over. Although Kazuya Souma was quite capable of taking upon the blade and becoming a warrior as many Isekai before it had done so with their mc’s the narratives decision to place him as a king who fought with words, plans and knowledge I felt really served to differentiate him while also allowing the usage of his impressive knowledge on economics and governance to full effect. While the series itself is indeed a relatively slow-paced series on account of its reliance on diplomacy and problem solving I felt that this resonated well with the overall goal of rebuilding the kingdom from the ground up that served to allow us a unique insight into the kind of goals and milestones that are necessary for the management of a kingdom that ranges from practical issues such as addressing food shortages, infrastructure, optimal crop placement and talent recruitment to more sensitive issues like liaising with the different races and social classes within the kingdom to inspire loyalty and unity against threats both internal and external. Though the reforms extensive as they were are not revolutionary by modern standards their implementation when combined with Kazuya’s skill at innovation proved to be both entertaining and a valuable lesson to learn as well a fact that was bolstered by the excellent usage of Kazuya’s skill at breaking apart complex knowledge into easily understood info that can be easily understood.Overall, how a Realist rebuilt the kingdom was an excellent anime that provided a fine balance of entertainment, tension, comedy, heartfelt bonding moments and a level of unpredictability in the form of Kazuya Souma’s reform plans that left me eagerly waiting to see each episode as a new week began. While there were admittedly characters that I felt were underused within the narrative that I wished could have seen more expansion overall the series’ adaptation from its source material I felt was a resounding success. Anime’s that require the cast to actually think and consider all angles of a problem are a rarity these days and I for one would like to see more of these types of animes over ones where violence and OP superpowers have become the norm. As a final score, I would say that it easily deserves a 9/10."", ""When I first was looking through this season, and picking what I wanted to watch. I had found this show, and it peaked my interest. Being that I love fantasy, who doesn't? But I do love a bit of business too. So to see those two, sort of mixed, it comes across as a great idea. In a sense, maybe like Animal Crossing, where you are in charge of helping things, set up things, all the while taking profit into consideration. It all sounds like a recipe for success. There is just one slight issue...It's a harem for some reason.Now I'm not saying Harems are...bad. But you watch from the first few episodes, and you'll see that this show didn't really need a harem idea in the first place. It would've been fine without it.Does it make it a less enjoyable experience? No, it doesn't. It feels like a bit of a fresh air on the Isekai scene. Much like a certain other two in this season, it's actually nice seeing an Isekai, without the same ol stick happening.As the story follows Kazuya Souma, a 'hero' whom was summoned in typical Isekai fashion, and his way of being such, is more saving the kingdom's financial problems, and helping it establish itself, and grow better. Which already sounds like a much better plotline then a normal run of the mill Isekai. There is a lot to like about Souma too. He really does seem to have the best interests at heart, and even takes in a wide range of people to help with fixing the kingdom. A good bloke for sure. Another main character is Liscia, who is the daughter of the previous king, who honestly with how she looks, gives me Saber vibes lol.  But she is very strong willed, and has a strong and good personality. Can't go wrong there. Besides them however, there is a far few interesting characters to boot, some good, some bad, or least not praise worthy, like the King just really disappoints me, wit how weak he can come across at points.The art style seems nice really. Can't really say anything bad about it, much like the sound of the show. Both are fitting, and look and sound good. What more could you want honestly? Like, I really do love how some of the outfits look, and the style really brings that out in all honesty. Very well done on both ends.Despite having a harem tagline for some reason.

The ""reforms"" (to be honest I\'m really being nice considering them as reforms) taken by the hero is completely BS and it really is a wonder how he isn\'t dead yet. Let me expand on that point: how he governed the kingdom is child\'s play. Starting a complete reform when you literally just took power? And without any base of support? Your reforms threatened the conservative party\'s interests, and yet they do nothing about it? Like seriously, if removing political opponents are...as simple as portrayed by this anime, then the US would become an authoritarian state already.To be completely honest, this anime would have been fine without the title. I would judge it as another isekai-hero-kingdom-building anime, yet the author had to put the word ""realist"" in it. The author clearly knows nothing about politics and had never learned any history. Just refer to the Hundred Days Reform and New Policies Song Reform (search it on Wikipedia or google) as an example of a reform that failed miserablyAnyways this is just my personal opinion, take it for reference only.(As of writing this, I dropped the anime after watching 7 episodes, but given how the plot has progressed, I doubt it gets more ""realistic"" in episodes after) as simple as portrayed by this anime, then the US would become an authoritarian state already.To be completely honest, this anime would have been fine without the title.

""Realist Hero"" has got to be the isekai of all time. The main hero is such a self-insert that at times the show plays like an Adam Sandler flick. The show meets so many stereotypes of the genre, it practically feels AI-generated. Let\'s go through the list:Overpowered MC? Check.Contrived harem plot? Check.Terrible exposition and lore dumping? Check.Emotionless dialogue and tone-deaf voice delivery? Check.Soft magic system that empowers the characters when needed? Check.Demon lord? Check.The gimmick of this show is,...the main character has the power of basic social studies knowledge, so instead of action sequences and dramatic battles, we get extremely boring dialogue about farming and resource management. But somehow, every single female character is in love with the MC by the end of the first season. ""Male power fantasy"" doesn\'t even begin to describe how Realist Hero is written. Kazuya Souma, the ""hero"" makes zero mistakes throughout the first season, since everyone in the world he was isekai\'d to is worse at understanding basic management than a late Roman emperor. I put ""hero"" in quotation marks since an actual hero has character flaws and undergoes a defining arc in the form of the hero\'s journey. But Kazuya spends his entire time on screen being perfect, making his character impossible to become invested in.I have nothing else to say about Realist Hero. It sucks. It doesn\'t even fit the bill of ""so bad, it\'s good,"" because at least those shows aren\'t boring, just bad.

The pages were filled with endless lists of skills and stats which didn\'t really mean anything, and the action scenes made little sense to me. But somehow, last season\'s anime adaptation kept me entertained with an amazing voice acting performance by Aoi Yuuki and fun visuals. What I\'m trying to say is that an anime can be more than its source material. For Genkoku, this is not the case.MyAnimeList has a rather strict policy on spoilers, so I won\'t go into details. Suffice to say that...none of the plot points, and I mean none, make any sense. When you watch the series and something happens, try to think about it for a few seconds, and you should see that something is fishy. All the social/economical/political parts of the series are incredibly lackluster and poorly thought out, which seems even worse when you realise that all problems are made specifically so that the MC can solve them in one sweeping motion. For every challenge that the protagonist faces, either the problem should not be a problem, or his solution should not work as a solution.A piece of fiction can not be any smarter than its author, and despite trying very hard to be so, the author of Genkoku is not all that bright. This part of the show largely reminds me of ""Chōyoyū"", another terrible adaptation of an equally bad light novel.To make matters worse, the generic fantasy world that the protagonist finds himself isekai\'ed to is more devoid of any cultural identity than the half-naked girls sunbathing at your local beach. The style can somewhat vaguely be described as European, though that might be a bit of a stretch, as there is almost nothing to build that statement on. Worldbuilding is one of the most important parts of high fantasy, and it has seemingly been neglegted in favor of what can only be described as pseudo-intellectual nonsense.Finally, I want to write a little about the character interaction. Typically, most such interactions consist of people gushing about the absolute genius of a mastermind that is the protagonist. And would it really be an isekai if everyone didn\'t fall to their knees in complete awe of such brilliance?Well, whatever, we\'ve seen this trope a thousand times before.What I want to write about specifically is what ultimately made me drop the series at episode 5. I don\'t want to spoil, so I won\'t go into details, but in the span of about 5 minutes, the MC and his friends call a member of his harem ugly and disappointing several times. This happens completely unprovoked. The only apparent reason for this bullying is that she doesn\'t fit into their racial steriotypes.Is this what the author thinks counts for dialogue? Is it supposed to be funny? Maybe I just don\'t understand the joke, but if this is what the character interaction is going to be like, that\'s a hard pass for me.2/10 none of the plot points, and I mean none, make any sense.

Don't be fooled by the nation-builder premise; it's quickly evident after 3 or 4 episodes that this anime is mostly fantasy slice of life, and aside from a brief 2-episode story arc it stays this way throughout the whole series. That combined with an incredible amount of talking head scenes left me incredibly disappointed.----The overarching plot is fine, and follows the premise of a man transported into a fantasy world and using his earth knowledge to help improve the kingdom. However this really only happens in the background. He declares that he will do...one thing, and then the anime shows some filler scenes of people scribbling on sheets with pens and such, then two episodes later we all find out it worked to perfection. What happens in the middle? Things like putting on a cooking show, going out on a date, taking acquired fox-daughter shopping, and going on a dungeon raid in a body double are actual things that happen in this anime and take the majority of some episodes, often spanning multiple episodes. Sometimes they are plot related or lead into plot, but they last for so long and drag on so slowly that when the plot goes back on course it's jarring. There's a nice arc of two-to-three episodes towards the end that actually sticks with the premise throughout the entire arc, which is refreshing, but this is the exception, not the norm.Art is lackluster. It's pretty evident this is low budget. Not only that but the vast majority of this anime is talking heads in front of bland backgrounds so it is very visually dull. The few action scenes were okay but in line with what you'd expect from a low budget adaptation. Sound is fine; the voice acting is actually pretty good but the music is reused repeatedly and gets old. You don't notice much else in the sound department because of (again) most of this anime being talking head pieces.A big irritation that quickly developed for me is that the main character is incredibly dull looking. The outfit he comes in - blue slacks, a white button down shirt, an open blue sweater - is the one that he wears in *the entire series*. This guy is a king and he literally sits in a throne talking to subjects like he just came out of a sale at Target. What's disappointing is that you see him wearing a slick military style fantasy outfit in the thumbnail but he only wears that in like one episode then quickly returns to his thrift store outfit. That combined with a head that could be literally any isekai protagonist combines to make something very uninspired and boring, and frankly something that does not belong in a fantasy world.Other characters are actually pretty visually interesting and varied in their designs in contrast to the main. Each character has their own color palette, their voice actors nail their roles, and they fit great with their setting. However character growth is not a thing in this anime, and what characters we get are pretty one dimensional.Did I enjoy this? Eh? I don't know. This show doesn't leave you with any lasting impact, but it's a nice time filler I suppose. That leads into my massive disappointment though, because I expected more out of a plot which was actually consistent and interesting but really only takes up about 20% of the airtime. If you come into this anime with the same expectations I had, for a nation builder with an isekai hook, you will be frustrated with this plot's potential. Adjust your expectations carefully before watching this. one thing, and then the anime shows some filler scenes of people scribbling on sheets with pens and such, then two episodes later we all find out it worked to perfection.

The protagonist is put on charge of a nation plagues by issues and threats, our hero must lead the nation out of this sinkhole. The plot revolves around political decisions and reforms and the fallout of those decisions, again great premise, but since the subpar romance takes the lead in the series we don't see much of it, instead of being shown the progress made by the protagonist we are often told it happened off-screen and we don't hear anything from those particular issues anymore, they are dealt with, the end. This is, again, thanks to the fact that the building of romance and friendship took the lead, thus important stuff is skipped, so we can have an episode dedicated to our MC day off.We also see very little in the way of international politics and relations, only at the end of the season we see a little, and the season ends before we can really see anything getting done due to the pacing.While I really enjoy the idea of the anime and would love to see how the MAIN plot progresses I don't think I would waste my time watching a second season after a first one that went nowhere.At the end of the day I give the story a 4, great potential in the main plot, forgettable romance subplot and bad pacing. Due to the wasted potential tho, I find it even more frustrating, enjoyment is thus, only a 3.Characters: Better than average, they aren't completely stupid, like in most anime, they have flaws but are intelligent, capable of making not asinine decisions, which is refreshing and doesn't break my sense of immersion like most anime, at the same they aren't anything to write home about, I haven't found anything particularly unique or outstanding about them, may be because they spend more time talking about food and praising the MC rather than doing anything noteworthy, very little development in anything but the romance. Again above average, I give it a 7.Art: 5Sound: 6Both average and forgettable.Overall 5: Wasted opportunity, boring. it's integral part of the story and enhances the plot, or at least it should, it doesn't, it steals screen time from the main plot, the issue with the series is that too much time is given to the building of these relations, with the main plot dragging on because more than half of the episode is given to the romance, if at least that plot went forward it would be more forgivable, but it doesn't, a good chunk of that subplot is skippable, where nothing noteworthy happens.So now we come to the main story, as I already said it moves slowly, the plot itself and idea behind it is fascinating and has real potential, which makes it even the more tragic for me.

We can really see where the anime is coming from and what it\'s trying to portray. A leader is supposed to help and protect his subordinates, a moralistic ideology lost in modern times.Considering this alone I would have given...it a 10/10, the isekai is a nice twist that eases the viewer into the anime and its noble goal, whilst explaining the MC and his omniscience. It also explains the slow pacing as a fast pace would have ruined its depth;The art style is avg, does not disappoint, (Isn\'t Wano arc level but pretty decent)Good voice actors.The reason I did give an 8 is cuz of the harem, the plot is sometimes all over the place.It does provide a hint of comedy at times but that\'s not for my palet. (seems cringe)I understand the moral part, but the light needs darkness. The lack of shadows i.e. villains is really giving it a wholesome vibe which is again, \'not to my taste\'.

There is no transformation into an other worldly creature that learns to survive and thrive in a new world....Nor is it a ordinary person brought into a strange world to save it.  Well it is that, but the ""Hero"" decides to go against the norm and actually save the kingdom not by fighting the ""Demon horde"" but by actually fixing what is wrong with the kingdom.That\'s a twist.The art is above standard and goes well with the story line and character design.Sound quality is also good and works well.The characters are developed nicely.  Each having a distinct personality and endearing quality.  Effort was actually put into the side characters.  Even the one liners.So far this is definitely in my top ten favorite isekai anime and if it continues in this way it will be in my top 50 must see anime.Overall I look forward to each episode.

Its funny, smart and really satisfying. I highly recommend this for basically anyone whose looking for something a little more mature than the superkid hero thing.CastThe protag is incredibly intelligent, perhaps ridiculously so, but it is believable for a well read, rational person to know this stuff. The 'found family' cast are what really make this show special though, he's not doing this alone and that really helped carry me through the show. Liscia in particular is a rock, quietly carrying the king through his ordeals. They're mature,...smart and funny people.PlotIt's fair to say unless you watch all episodes over both parts I don't think you'll fully appreciate this, as the first season really deals with him creating stability.

The premise is unique or at the very least specific; while other isekai have economic reforms or geopolitical maneuvering, Genkoku presents itself as focusing specifically on that aspect, with a main character that presumably has no physical talents.As the show goes on though, its faults become evident. Firstly, the supposed administrative reforms are rather hollow. What little is actually done strikes the viewer as common sense, and it\'s never properly explained how Souma manages to round up and punish corrupt officials. The feeling you get is that someone took Civics 101 and decided...to write about it but never considered the full implications and results of reforms and political positioning. It\'s as if the creator learned the Sicilian Defense and tried to write a show about chess grandmasters.Additionally, the show spreads itself too thin. The main plot about reorganizing the country and the subplots of each duchy are rather rushed and not well fleshed-out. After a while the ""reforms"" start playing second fiddle to what can only be described as a food expo, where new foods are introduced to the people which certainly can be effective in curbing a famine but took up too much screentime in the show. Last but not least there\'s just too much harem+clueless MC in this show for my liking, especially when the MC is supposed to be a very perceptive civil genius.So yeah. Started out hot, ended up not.

But after three more episodes, the plot became super mediocre with no twist or plot development.This anime feels like an elementary school where your teacher explains basic concepts of the world in the most basic ways possible but you still become impressed as those things are completely new to you.

But it doesn\'t speak to me. To paraphrase a line near the end, ""this show and I are like oil and water."" Initially, I was fairly optimistic.

However, this realism is quickly undercut by the idealistic way in which events occur and play out. There is no exploration of grey areas and morality.

Usually we get the bog-standard heroes on their journey, dispatching villains like your typical shounen heroes, or two warring kingdoms--one BAD, the other GOOD. There does seem to be a bit of the latter, perhaps, but I suspect the actual situation will become more complex, with one of the plot developments unveiled in an early episode.It\'s easy to overlook the relatively low-budget compared to plenty of...recent anime, as this seems to be more concerned with world-building and scenario writing, but outside of being a little more creative than the average isekai, this looks and feels awfully generic. The camera work is of the slow side-panning variety, and the composition is often mediocre.I say scenario writing rather than simply ""writing"" because the situations the characters have to work their way out of as a kingdom are far more interesting than the actual characters, dialogue, or anything else. Maybe that shouldn\'t be a surprise, given the long, clunky title ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom,"" which embraces the overly explanatory and very non-poetic naming strategy of Japanese light novel series that are now popularly adapted in the anime industry.The story begins simply enough. Elfrieden Kingdom is in decline and unable to pay what they owe to the, rather goofily named, Gran-Chaos Kingdom (What is this? Sonic the Hedgehog?). They use the hero summoning magic, whisking Kazuya Souma away from earth, hoping to use him as a bargaining chip; fortunately, Souma took a few humanities classes at college, so he\'s prepared to run a kingdom. The king with a mommy complex abdicates the throne, and his wife treats him like a widdle baby and cleans his ears all day. Souma takes over and is supremely competent compared to the king, and from this point on, most of the dialogue is puffing up Souma\'s ego and pleasantries about how grand everyone is.Souma corrects many of the kingdom\'s problems, restructures the economy, delves into agriculture, builds roads and a new port town, diversifies the food supply, and strategizes endlessly about how to please the people and maintain good relations with neighboring kingdoms. All of this is pretty good, if you\'re into that kind of thing, though I think I\'d prefer it to go even deeper and with more realism, but I will say that it does a fairly good job with these elements, and there aren\'t many anime series that are comparable. The second half of the series consists mostly of war, and the strategy involved is a lot more shallow and humdrum.Worst of all is the characters are one-dimensional thus far. Most of them disappear for multiple episodes and only pop up for plot points, and they don\'t have a whole lot to do. Maybe they will have more time to become less flat by the second season, but only Souma and the princess have much chemistry at all, and funny enough, the relationship, character design of the two characters, and overall story seem very similar to Amagi Brilliant Park--I haven\'t watched it myself, but the resemblance of these elements are undeniable, and it seems a lot was lifted from that series.Another aspect that is kind of tiresome is every single attractive female character seems to be destined to become part of Souma\'s harem, and they hint at it all the time in a not so subtle fashion (lest we forget). It makes sense that a role as high status as a king would receive a lot of attention from the ladies and could easily result in a harem, but like similar light novel series, such as Shield Hero, this is probably more so authorial (and audience) wish-fulfillment more than anything needed or well-incorporated. Don\'t get me wrong, I think series like Mushoku Tensei handle harem building better than what is seen here, so I\'m not opposed to it, but anime exploring this theme always confront it in a comedic/dumb/gaggy Tenchi Muyo-esque fashion.

You won\'t find many extraordinarily pretty scenes if any, though I also don\'t recall any moments that particuarly hurt my eyes.[Rating: 7]Music: In some cases, the sound tracks of an anime tend to increase it\'s enjoyability dramatically, but in this case it\'s neither appealing nor horrid. The ED is fine, and the OP is good-- though...apart from that, the music isn\'t too much of a deal breaker. If not for the OP my score would be one point lower.[Rating: 7]Characters: Rarely from what I\'ve seen do isekais dive deep into character development, the few that do, neglecting, if only slightly-- everyone except the protagonist. This would be a good example of an anime that only just barely scratches the surface of such things. While you see characters obtain some miniscule fraction of growth-- it\'s ultimately not exaggerated. In comparison, the main character shows his intellect from the start without actually ""growing,"" or ""developing,"" with only a moment of self reflection near the end of the show.[Rating: 7]Conclusion: While Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki falls into the just ""Good category,"" I can\'t help but prop it up a little higher. Throughout the thirteen episodes I enjoyed my time watching them, likely because it\'s refreshing to see an isekai lean more so on the world building rather than the generic qualities of a protagonist or other characters. Learning more about the kingdom and continent\'s state of being is if only slightly more entertaining than having to learn in depth about the past of a side character introduced in a single episode for a plot device or the likes. You\'re given near minimal for character development, but in turn you receive a simple yet decently invigorating plot and setting within the duration of thirteen episodes.[Rating: 8][Rating: 29/40 = 0.72] apart from that, the music isn\'t too much of a deal breaker.

While you see characters obtain some miniscule fraction of growth-- it\'s ultimately not exaggerated. In comparison, the main character shows his intellect from the start without actually ""growing,"" or ""developing,"" with only a moment of self reflection near the end of the show.[Rating: 7]Conclusion: While Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki falls into the just ""Good category,"" I can\'t help but prop it up a little higher. Throughout the thirteen episodes I enjoyed my time watching them, likely because it\'s refreshing to see an isekai lean more so on the world building rather than the generic qualities of a protagonist or other characters. Learning more about the kingdom and continent\'s state of being is if only slightly more entertaining than having to learn in depth about the past of a side character introduced in a single episode for a plot device or the likes. You\'re given near minimal for character development, but in turn you receive a simple yet decently invigorating plot and setting within the duration of thirteen episodes.[Rating: 8][Rating: 29/40 = 0.72]', 'I was exptecting, reading the summary, a story about a king taking pragmatic decisions, harsh ones, kind one, good ones, bad ones etc... A good king has never been someone who could act kindly towards everybody.As such, i was believing that this story could show me mean decisions against people to enable the kingdom to become stronger because the main priority isnt to do social reforms but to be prepared against the demons.I was wrong. It isnt pragmatic nor deep at all . The MC does random reforms using basic knowledge from his world to help the kingdom with a touch of kindness...in it. None of his decisions as a king has ever backfired to him. None of them were double edged sword which is a shame for a story about a king. Even the decisions are just basic choices without any cruel dilemma, hard choices or else...That\'s the main issue. Everything feels so generic I feel like a 11 year old kid watching a kid anime.I could have accepted the terrible setup (classic isekai, transportation to another world for no reason, terrible story about demons coming to destroy the world) provided that the king part was great but in fact it\'s not even near decent or acceptable. It\'s shameful. I could have imagined a deep story with a cynic point of view taking inspiration into some famous books like ""the prince"" from machiavel but there isnt anything. It\'s a story for kids.I mean sure they tried to do something decent showing basic economics and more but everything is so romanced and kid friendly that it feels fake and unreal.Moreover, there isnt any plot. Okay demons will come destroy the world later on but what are the characters doing ? Reforming different things over and over again. There isnt any hardship, any plot, any other antagonists. Episodes are just a succession of reforms. It\'s boring damn i feel like i\'m reading a 4 koma. It\'s not normal for a normal manga or for an anime.Regarding the characters... Well generic generic genericThe MC is uninteresting honestly i didnt even know before watching this show that it was possible to make a smart protagonist uninteresting. He has no identity. He reforms things and it\'s his only trait I guess. He doesnt even feel smart or clever he just feels like an idiot who took hours to learn by heart his lessons. I dont feel that genius vibe i can feel from other interesting protagonists like Lelouch for instance.The main girl is useless. She\'s cliche aswell. She just reacts to what the MC does. I dont even know how to describe her she has never done anything.Other side characters are terribly bland aswell. No interesting characters, a few women show themselves and are impressed by the MC. It\'s full of fanservice, they blush at him etc... They\'re just women to create a sort of harem feeling. Even the worse harems Ive ever seen had better harem girls than this too.The art is random at best, if not it\'s just bad. The MC is disgustingly generic and ugly. Random haircut, random eyes, random clothing. Girls are terribly generic. No original traits nothing.Finally even the sound effects are bad. The first episodes are filled with background songs louder than the voices. It basically means that without the subtitles, I wouldnt even be able to hear what they say. Even this much has been rushed.Overall this anime could have been an original isekai with a deep plot and a really good protagonist but instead we\'ve got a terrible isekai with the worst smart main characters I\'ve ever seen, the most generic girls i\'ve ever seen and the most pitiful scenario aswell. Everything has been ruined by lazyness. Too lazy to make good characters, to create a deep story, to read books about kings, even the economics notions seen are more than basic ones.

Despite garnering decent attention there\'s little being said by the larger names in the community and here on Mal the scores seem bizarrely split between bemusingly high grades of 9\'s and 10\'s, contrasted by those scoring exceedingly harshly in the 1 to 3\'s. Today I\'d like to take after the show\'s namesake and take a slightly more balanced vantage point. First lets cover the spoiler free...items-Music, Animation and Direction  - With this being a new show the OsT has yet to be realised to my knowledge meaning I couldn\'t listen to it independent of the show as per my usual routine. With that said the Ost should by rights be this show\'s strongest selling point, studio JC staff have some great in-house artists and no doubt both the intro and outro are wonderful, further there\'s some simple but nice insert pieces and many of the backing tracks are grandiosely packed with percussion instruments, fitting solidly the medieval aesthetic of the story. With all this said I\'d be loath to give the score top marks as the actual usage of the tracks is a bit clumsy. This could be attributed to the direction segment but some of the less creative tracks are the ones that get the most use and by the end of the show it was monotonous to hear the same \'every day\' and \'tense contemplation\' pieces used multiple times in an episode, there\'s also really nothing here to get you pumped up during the triumphant moments of victory which also feels like a missed opportunity. So while on paper the score is fitting and well made, it\'s execution could certainly be improved.The animation was something of a disappointment for me. While stills can look quite beautiful and the shots of each major city are nicely composed, generally speaking the show looks bland. Not bad, just bland which is strange coming from JC who generally have a track-record for making a show recognisably modern and \'light novel\' based but with enough vibrancy to still stand out(Ala Toradora, Pet-Girl, Aria, Danmachi, Railgun, etc). As for the backgrounds their mixed, some are more then adequately detailed but the location by far the most time is spent in, the throne room, has been designed by someone who I can only imagine was actively out to ruin this show. The large room is all shades of grey, epically behind the actual throne where there is a monotonous slab of flat grey that can\'t help but draw the eye. It\'s as though they\'d never heard of the negative space principal.As for the movements, the fights are down-right awful with shaky transitions and a complete lack of weight or impact. The general movement of the characters is as you\'d expect, much like the artsyle it\'s fine but unmemorable and a bit of a let down.Speaking of poor choreography we have the direction which is maybe the show\'s biggest pit fall. The story is very exposition heavy so how does the director chose to compensate this and keep the visuals interesting? With the use of dynamic 360 degree camera shots and characters walking superfluously to and fro across rooms. Again it could be worse and the first time I saw it I was actually a little impressed by the extravagant camera work but overall it\'s exceedingly boring to look at more often then not. When Souma explains some basic functions of nature in baby terms to the other characters, the best you can hope for is cut aways to completely still images which really isn\'t much. As for battles and such like, the director is clearly cutting as many corners as possible, generally showing a commander talking, while something more interesting is implied to be happening off-screen. Finally you have the structuring which is straight-up abhorrent - We spend an entire episode\'s worth of time on a cooking programme, half an ep on histories\' least interesting adventure ever, a whole half on a shopping trip and another episodes worth on a minor domestic quarrel between two side characters. Now don\'t mis-understand, all these things have their places and can greatly help with the worldbuilding of any good fantasy story, but not only does much of it feel like padding but this poor management of time forces the \'War\' arc of the show to be barely 2-4 eps long, making it feel ham-fisted and almost giving the impression that the production is just un-interested in that part of the show. They don\'t even cut the OP and ED (A JC staple across many of their shows) of the final episode to try and desperately scrap back some much needed time.I especially find all this strange as the director is by no means an amateur, Takashi Watanabe is down-right prolific and has done work I\'ve absolutely loved for many works by the studio in the likes of \'Shakugan no Shana\' and \'The Slayers\' to name his most famous credits. As such I\'m left to question weather they simply had a remarkably small budget for this show or if Covid and time-constraints were the cause of all this egregious corner-cutting and laziness.Story and Characters - In terms of story alot is hampered by the aforementioned structuring and visual elements. The goal of the story is to fix the dire financial straits the Kingdom finds itself in and for Souma to find himself a family and it sort of accomplishes these things, however it\'s not exactly mind-blowing television. Now to be fair I\'ve said on occasion that drama is highly subjective and you may indeed find this a griping tale, however generally speaking the show lacks any real driving force - while fiscal idea\'s are mentioned we\'re never actually told how much money the kingdom has or needs, further it\'s impossible to tell how much time pass\'s between episodes and because we don\'t have any characters with the perspective of the average citizen it\'s hard to tell if anything that we\'re told about has actually worked. By the end of the show you\'d be forgiven for thinking barely a month has passed, something which if anything the characters seem to reinforce.Said characters are fairly standard fare. They fill out regular isekai troops, with the only attractive males of the group(aside from the protagonist) being conveniently off-screen for almost the entire run of the show. Even calling them characters seems a little much, The Princess Liscia at first seems intriguing as someone who migth oppose Souma becoming acting King and then gradually fall in love with him over the course of this first series, creating a classic arc and pay-off to follow, as well as giving a great excuse for Souma to show off his knowledge, but before the first 2 episodes are even done she has already swooned and proceeds to do nothing of note other then get a haircut for the rest of the show. This strikes me as a great shame as what small, tiny hints we get that she and Souma migth actually be a supportive team are never really given any limelight and by the properties close they act the same as they did when they first met with no progress friendly or romantic what so ever bar one single conversation and a few blushes on Liscia\'s part. Now mind you I don\'t hold it against anyone who found her endearing, she is no question cute, I just wish they did a little more with her characterisation as the female lead.The bureaucrat Marks whom actually seems somewhat interesting gets conveniently side-lined for being old or something(?), similarly the Queen and King are irrelevant past ep 1, not even being used for episodic comedy relief or such like - and the others aren\'t of any note except maybe Aisha and Souma himself. These two share an interesting trait, where-by something traumatic will occur and then  they it just sort of has no impact on them what-so-ever. Aisha suffers most here as after a terrible incident her reaction is pretty much just to ask if her uncle could of been less of a fool and then she never brings it up again. It doesn\'t seem to weight on her mind or spark any change in her out-look on life, despite the dark-elves seemingly being a very family and tribal orientated people(something they could of easily tied back into Souma\'s Grandfather\'s words or wisdom....but just didn\'t). Same with Souma who seems to be nearing a revelation that he has the power to affect the lives of thousands in strategic warfare but then in the next episode seems to of forgotten this temporary moral dilemma and returned to sending off armies to brutally murder one another, before sort of remembering it maybe in episode 12(?). Put lightly I\'m not really sure you could say anyone has a character arc in this show, however with that said none of this is quite as big a problem as it migth sound. Indeed considering the type of story this is and it\'s purpose as light-hearted entertainment, it certainly does function with this type-cast of static characters, however it would of been nice to of seen some sort of development implemented for the main duo at the very least, in order to give the show a much needed emotional core (which one would imagine would be obvious consider the \'find and protect a family\' mantra).A Realistic Solution;As I see it, it wouldn\'t actually take much to vastly improve the story of \'""How the Realist Hero Saved the Kingdom""\'. Some small changes like making the throne room more interesting and breaking up the exposition with actual animated cutaways to farmers working in fields and so on, along with a re-organisation of the already quite good OsT could easily push this show up to a 7.5 out of 10. However the sad fact to me is that really I think this one has some potential beneath the surface to be a truly heart-warming and wholesome little tale about found family, unfortunately it seems like JC or the financers behind it just didn\'t care all that much as if they did I don\'t think we\'d have this bland art-style, shockingly bad action, atrocious structure and ultimately cheap feeling product. To me it feels like realist hero is a bad adaptation in-spite of my not even having read the books. It\'s the sort of half-as*ed cash grab that have become all too frequent which I think is a real da*n shame.With just small changes this could improve and with a bit of care I think this could of been a really good watch. For an example of what I mean take a look at the original \'Zero no Tsukaima\', an isekai by JC staff from 15 years ago with an original set of 13 episodes. It\'s action is by no means brilliant, nor is it anything mind boggling narratively and yet despite it\'s age it\'s backgrounds are still gorgeous, its character have far more depth then is required for the story being told, the Ost is an absolute delight and always used sparingly with one off tracks for speical occasions and character themes for the leads - but most of all it exudes passion and heart. You can\'t help but smile at how much the creators clearly cared about every aspect of their funny little light novel adaption (Rest in peace Noboru Yamaguchi). It\'s for that sort of love and attention to detail and caring sense of fun put into what migth otherwise be fairly mundane or forgettable stories, that I loved JC Staff for, it\'s why I\'d of once called my favourite studio.But here it feels like we get none of that, there is no heart in most of these visuals, no passion in the editing room or the producers office. The voice-actors do a good job at the least and again its not bad it\'s just...meh, bland, unimpressive. Hopefully with the advent of a second half we migth see it gain an increase in it\'s somewhat shaky production and with the establishment of the world out of the way we may even get some better structured arcs to come, we can atleast hope so anyway. So to conclude, while you may enjoy this show for what it is, you also won\'t be missing out on much if you decide to give it a pass and as such I\'d advise most readers to go and try other classic isekai like the prior mentioned ""Familiar of Zero"" or alternately ""Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash"" (which takes a different sort of realistic approach to the isekai genre) - and only to watch the realist hero if your board and simply looking for an easily digestible and relatively pleasant way to pass the time.I hope you enjoyed.

Indeed considering the type of story this is and it\'s purpose as light-hearted entertainment, it certainly does function with this type-cast of static characters, however it would of been nice to of seen some sort of development implemented for the main duo at the very least, in order to give the show a much needed emotional core (which one would imagine would be obvious consider the \'find and protect a family\' mantra).A Realistic Solution;As I see it, it wouldn\'t actually take much to vastly improve the story of \'""How the Realist Hero Saved the Kingdom""\'. Some small changes like making the throne room more interesting and breaking up the exposition with actual animated cutaways to farmers working in fields and so on, along with a re-organisation of the already quite good OsT could easily push this show up to a 7.5 out of 10. However the sad fact to me is that really I think this one has some potential beneath the surface to be a truly heart-warming and wholesome little tale about found family, unfortunately it seems like JC or the financers behind it just didn\'t care all that much as if they did I don\'t think we\'d have this bland art-style, shockingly bad action, atrocious structure and ultimately cheap feeling product. To me it feels like realist hero is a bad adaptation in-spite of my not even having read the books. It\'s the sort of half-as*ed cash grab that have become all too frequent which I think is a real da*n shame.With just small changes this could improve and with a bit of care I think this could of been a really good watch. For an example of what I mean take a look at the original \'Zero no Tsukaima\', an isekai by JC staff from 15 years ago with an original set of 13 episodes. It\'s action is by no means brilliant, nor is it anything mind boggling narratively and yet despite it\'s age it\'s backgrounds are still gorgeous, its character have far more depth then is required for the story being told, the Ost is an absolute delight and always used sparingly with one off tracks for speical occasions and character themes for the leads - but most of all it exudes passion and heart. You can\'t help but smile at how much the creators clearly cared about every aspect of their funny little light novel adaption (Rest in peace Noboru Yamaguchi). It\'s for that sort of love and attention to detail and caring sense of fun put into what migth otherwise be fairly mundane or forgettable stories, that I loved JC Staff for, it\'s why I\'d of once called my favourite studio.But here it feels like we get none of that, there is no heart in most of these visuals, no passion in the editing room or the producers office. The voice-actors do a good job at the least and again its not bad it\'s just...meh, bland, unimpressive. Hopefully with the advent of a second half we migth see it gain an increase in it\'s somewhat shaky production and with the establishment of the world out of the way we may even get some better structured arcs to come, we can atleast hope so anyway. So to conclude, while you may enjoy this show for what it is, you also won\'t be missing out on much if you decide to give it a pass and as such I\'d advise most readers to go and try other classic isekai like the prior mentioned ""Familiar of Zero"" or alternately ""Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash"" (which takes a different sort of realistic approach to the isekai genre) - and only to watch the realist hero if your board and simply looking for an easily digestible and relatively pleasant way to pass the time.I hope you enjoyed.

This generic trope that is commonly presented in most isekai inevitably has questionable developments, predictable characters, and a bland plot a toddler could conjure up without much effort.But rejoice, as Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki is quite the refreshing change from most anime in the isekai genre. In the four episodes I've seen so far, this anime has managed to keep me invested not with overblown, haphazard fights where the MC wields trusty plot armor to win, but with interesting political/economical perspectives that...does worldbuilding very nicely.-Story-Souma Kazuya, a college student who has lost most of his family, is suddenly teleported in lieu of a summon from another fantasy world. Sounds familiar, right? I bet most of us were expecting this very next development to give him broken abilities, a harem, and a quest to salvage the world from whatever evil force. But instead, Souma finds himself in a unique situation: summoned to be sold off to a neighboring nation as a form of financial assistance.-Characters-Now, without revealing too much more, he becomes king through display of vast economic knowledge. What hooked me at this point was his character; no getting into strange perverted accidents by unusual twists of fate, no idealistic behavior, no bizarre deus ex machina. Souma's just a regular college student who employs his knowledge to save his kingdom from a financial crisis, and so his journey begins.The main heroine, for once, isn't being used for filler fanservice. She actually has a purpose and is developing feelings for Souma in an actually understandable way. That's not to say the usual cliches are avoided here, but at least I wasn't able to predict every single blush on her face or corny one-liner like I can with every other generic romcom or harem.-Sound-Not much to mention here, but every OST did fit the various moods comfortably. The opening and ending are actually pretty well done as well imo.-Art-It isn't the best, but it works well with what the studio can manage. It didn't deter enjoyment for me, and isn't overly lazy anywhere. If you're someone who's a stickler about animation, then the art may bug you a bit but I feel it's fine for what it is.-Enjoyment-I honestly can't pin down exactly what I liked so much about this anime. It's not some compelling story woven from a mere 72 minutes of run time, but it definitely distinguishes itself from other isekai. It doesn’t quite measure up to  more reputed isekais like Re:Zero or Konosuba, where they make the most of their self-awareness, but Realist Hero knew what they were doing when they didn't make the MC able to beat Goku with the power of a protagonist.Overall, 4 episodes in, and great watch so far! does worldbuilding very nicely.-Story-Souma Kazuya, a college student who has lost most of his family, is suddenly teleported in lieu of a summon from another fantasy world.

I just really enjoy and like this anime because of the characters and story, it is really interesting. Also I really enjoy Animes with Overpowered characters like one punch man or overlord and even if Kazuya Souma isn't the strongest, he is really smart and it is just really fun to watch them do things with ease and settle problems like it is nothing.

He is neither strong, nor powerful. He is merely a student with a deep interest and educational background in the art of governing.The show baits you in with the expectation that this budding political prodigy is going to create miracles for his new nation, and perhaps he...will, but how that story unfolds, how it is portrayed to us the audience, is done in the most uninteresting way.After the first episode the show hits an absolute wall of sheer boredom. The MC never fails to remind us how monotonous and uninteresting his governing work is.

It\'s surprisingly watchable, and is the kind of self-insert I like to see - hardworking stand up guy who is of above average intelligence wins hearts and minds with facts, logic, and respect. The only thing it\'s missing so far is that ""yeah but that never works out though does it"" angle, which would make the writers job harder so I will let it slide. Unfortunatley, the smooth sailing, heavily plot-armored progression does feel gimmicky and even ""fake pedantic"" at times, like when someone who you KNOW doesn\'t know wtf they\'re talking about is just rambling on and on about...fun facts they read in a single afternoon of clicking through articles on wikipedia as though they\'re an expert. Still, though a low bar it is more sophisticated in its treatment of world building than your average isekai. Though there is magic, we rejoice that not everything is about magic, and so far the only OP mighty magic skillz on display from our main character has been doing paperwork AFK and in parallel. That brings a smile to my face everytime I think about it I will not deny it.Story is quite bad so far, but one thing to be said in the shows favor here is that they are not willing to sacrifice the quality of the world building for cheap thrills and your typical ""eyeballs NOW"" storytelling that makes so many shows similar and ultimately banal, especially in the isekai genre. I don\'t mind a fresh take on an isekai despite how overdone the genre is, and we\'ve had some decent tries lately. This can be counted among them, and although I\'m not interested in the story thus far I\'m actually quite interested in the world building and politics/economy angle they\'ve taken despite the glaring oversimplifications and super-convieniences. Usually I\'d lose interest, but the characters do manage to attach themselves to key factions and ""reveals"" about the history/politcs/economy of the new world, even characters that have not had screen time yet have been shown and their character models - like Duke Carmine the Lion - are interesting enough for me to look forward to how they\'ll handle that introduction. Other characters that are near certain to play a large part in the story have just been shown as observers, in their offices or quarters dealing with the concerns of their station and reacting to this new foreign kings\' decrees. Ths super duper chill approach to character introductions meshes very well with the type of story and keeps me feeling good about the show overall and enjoying myself. Degeneracy has also been at probably an all time low for isekai in this show - the protagonist is just a regular dude who is attracted to but respectful of women, with no shy guy syndrome, and the fan service characters so far have been lowkey and have a reasonable excuse for their actions.Unfortunatley, the area I am usually most enthusiastic about and in this show have to say is the weak point - art and animation. It\'s not the worst, the art is pleasant to look at and does a reasonably good job differentiating characters and coming up with good character models that we don\'t mind looking at - not everyone is a perfect 10 male or female model, a kid, or the mountain from GOT for example. I always like to see that, even if most of the demi-human breeds are cut and paste from what we already have in our head as ""default"" for those. I doubt it will get better this season, but given that the writers seem to be comfortable just building their world and introducing a decent cast of characters that are completely inoffensive if a bit dry - if the show gains traction, art and animation are the kind of thing that can be improved in this type of show. We could always venture beyond the relatively bright and colorful pallette of the starting zone someday to witness what the isekai truly has to offer like with Mushoku Tensei, but frankly I would be surprised.I\'m enjoying it.

But given the plot and main character, I did expect problem solving to be a key feature of this story, but even there it only disappoints.But first we need to talk about the characters.The only ‘realist’ aspect I found genuine about this anime is that the main character, 19 yr old Souma Kazuya, doesn’t want to immediately become a sword-wielding edgelord the minute he gets transported to a fantasy world....Respect. But outside that, he’s the same old generic nice guy anime protagonist. He’s an aspiring civil servant, and once he gets transported to this fantasy world, he’s toted as a genius… by virtue of everyone else being incredibly dumb. [SPOILERS AHEAD:]Financial crisis? Sell royal family treasures & tax the aristocrats. Famine? Eat different food. Mistrust of the people? Talk to them via public broadcast. It’s all smooth-brain, low effort solutions which would, in reality, be near impossible to implement. That’s a massive flag for an anime whose whole gimmick is about being a ‘realist’. This kind of lazy problem solving is portrayed as the wisdom of modern civilisation, which I suppose is what you get when you put a 19 yr old intern in charge of governance. And of course, it carries on the trend of isekai authors continuing to claim that being from modern day Earth immediately makes you an expert of civics, politics, economics, military tactics, engineering, forestry, culinary arts… you name it.Look, I know this show is targeted at kids, but even so, it gets so dumb at times there really is no excuse.One scene has 2 friends in the military arguing over which side they will take when a rebellion breaks out in the kingdom. The girl is firmly on Souma’s side, while the guy is trying to go over to the rebels, because of something stupid like this is his chance to earn ‘glory’ in battle or something. And Souma has to literally shove it in the guy’s face that if he does, he’ll likely have to kill his friend (and love interest btw) on the battlefield, and has to ask him whether he’s ready to do that. And the guy’s all shocked like he never thought of that… Yeah, take a moment to let that sink in.In these kind of stories, the supporting characters play a huge role. Think 'That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime'. They add to the ‘power’ of the protagonist by pledging their talents and allegiance to him, and for the audience, they provide a sense of fulfilment, similar to collecting strong characters for your team in a video game. But here, they’re all made useless and pointless just so that the main character can be COMPARATIVELY smarter. At best, they are waifu bait.The entire show feels babyfied — war and politics for 8 year olds. Everything is safe and palatable, and even though wars are fought, everything is nice and clean and devoid of a drop of blood. The protagonist’s side rarely suffer any losses. Everything is achieved with no consequence, leaving you with no tension and nothing to root for.The world building is non-existent. Same old generic isekai medieval fantasy world. It throws around all the tired tropes - corrupt nobles, monsters, swords and magic, elves, beastfolk, demon lord… It hasn’t even reached the level of thought where it considers how magic affects the daily lives of the common folk. There’s no significant difference between their lives and the lives of non-fictional medieval folk.The OST is instantly forgettable. I can’t recall it a minute after it stops playing.And the voice acting for the old king is really irritating. It over-exaggerates his wimpy-ness so much it’s not just cartoonish, it sounds downright amateur.There is some trivia to learn from the show smattered here and there, but overall, my experience with the show was that it was yet another forgettable isekai, at least in season 1. Maybe when it expands on the lore and gets to the main storyline in season 2 (hopefully) it’ll get better. Respect. But outside that, he’s the same old generic nice guy anime protagonist.

You are filled with a wave of disappointment, but click on the episode anyway. You are me.Why did I watch this? Because of a stupid, pointless quest that was really just an excuse for me to watch Shield Hero (which was also quite not good) that I\'m just continuing for the sake of continuing.STORY: 5.0/10It\'s generic isekai, with all the bad writing...that\'s commonplace in this godforsaken genre present too. Not really much to say here, but it was actually pretty interesting in the first couple episodes. Eventually, it turned into a crappy harem power of friendship OP Kirito protagonist thing and that was where this anime really tanked. It even had bad warfare, to boot. Just read Kingdom instead if you want that kind of stuff, it\'s so much better than this. All in all, this was bad.ART: 5.5/10It\'s JC Staff, what did you expect? Sure, they made Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T, which looked really good by JC Staff standards. But they also made Food Wars whose later seasons look like a goddamn PowerPoint I would\'ve made in 4th grade. This isn\'t much better than the latter. Does it tell you what\'s going on? Better than Berserk action scenes half the time, honestly. Does it make your eyes scream in pain? Sometimes. Does it get the job done? Sadly, yeah. But that\'s it. It has visuals, and nothing more, and half the time they look like trash, too.SOUND: 6/10Literally all of this is generic, but I liked the ED.

The beginning was a lot more interesting than most isekai. And that\'s about all the enjoyment I could get from this thing.OVERALL: 5.0/10Just don\'t waste your time with this. It\'s a generic trash isekai, not even an average/decent isekai. It\'s no Arifureta or Tanya the Evil either, because while both of those are trash, at least they\'re funny. It\'s also definitely not Re:Zero, which is actually good. It\'s more like Wise Man\'s Grandchild, a show that doesn\'t take risks, doesn\'t do anything exceptional, doesn\'t do anything horrible, and just sits in the limbo of ""safe cash cow"" that every Hollywood movie seems to find a nice little cave in these days. Just play Halo 2 instead. At least that\'s actually fun. that\'s commonplace in this godforsaken genre present too. Not really much to say here, but it was actually pretty interesting in the first couple episodes. Eventually, it turned into a crappy harem power of friendship OP Kirito protagonist thing and that was where this anime really tanked. It even had bad warfare, to boot. Just read Kingdom instead if you want that kind of stuff, it\'s so much better than this. All in all, this was bad.ART: 5.5/10It\'s JC Staff, what did you expect? Sure, they made Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T, which looked really good by JC Staff standards. But they also made Food Wars whose later seasons look like a goddamn PowerPoint I would\'ve made in 4th grade. This isn\'t much better than the latter. Does it tell you what\'s going on? Better than Berserk action scenes half the time, honestly. Does it make your eyes scream in pain? Sometimes. Does it get the job done? Sadly, yeah. But that\'s it. It has visuals, and nothing more, and half the time they look like trash, too.SOUND: 6/10Literally all of this is generic, but I liked the ED.

Story is good, not that many downsides and no real hook, just good overall. The mc is pretty likeable, he fits his role, he's calm, rational and a realist (lmao). Heroine is fun to watch, especially her interactions with mc.The plot is actually very good, the pacing and story is fun to watch. However, imo it's kinda lacking for me, like I said, it lacks that hook factor that pulls us in. It focusing in...county problems, feudal wars and large scale battles and tactics, is really refreshing to watch. Anyway, just a pretty good anime overall, but it doesn't have it's problems.So my only concern for the show, is lack of character focus, it only focuses on like 3 people, I know it's supposed to put emphasis on mc, but the op had all of the characters and their names, so I thought they would put some emphasis to them. But all they did, was let them solve problems, and that's about it, they're kinda just there.So yeah, if you want a refreshing isekai, watch this anime. county problems, feudal wars and large scale battles and tactics, is really refreshing to watch.

Art is average for your typical JC Staff show where action is portrayed by one, maybe two images with sound effects and left to your imagination to come up with the rest. Characters are disturbingly two-dimensional. Story is as predictable as any other generic issekai out there.Simply put, there are no redeeming factors here.

This is one of those anime that is ""just there"" without ever being talked about or remembered.The concept of this series revolved around the internal politics of a mid-age world and possessed some approaches and thought processes that I liked. Additionally, with the cooking show and the protagonist\'s salt meme. But that was about it. The series was so lifeless, I don\'t really know where to start. And the trivial animations didn\'t help that.First and foremost was the[Story 2]the protagonist was summoned against his will to...another world as a hero and as fate would have it he became king and had to manage the finances. This resulted in some decent moments and in the end a very poorly implemented and catastrophically boring war.There was nothing more, this was just the concept of a few corrupt bishops and kings who got in his way. In the background, there was something about Demon King, but we know this gibberish.[Characters 3]Even though I didn\'t hate any of the characters, they were just as unconvincing the other way around.

Like one part of a song being slightly off the beat, and not in a good way.As it turns out, the current king is incompetent, and for...some reason, quite against human nature, accepts this and steps down, making our protagonist hero the new king.Now, a bad king can very much ruin a country, but the more you watch, the more you realize that the king was not the exception. He was the rule. The people are so bad at what they do, and have presumably been doing for generations, that they should not only be starving, they should all already be dead. They have an economic system, but none of them seem to know how it works and have to be explicitly told in order to figure it out. And, economics aside, for whatever reason farmers and foresters, and presumably other people, if I bothered to watch further, are so incredibly bad at what they do for a living that they need some inner-city chump from another world to tell them new trees can't grow unless old ones go away to make space.So the setting is bad, how about the story?

Realist Hero is a series of payoffs to problems and events that were never set up. This show promises a series of problems that our pragmatic, logical hero Kazuya Souma is meant to face head on by using his brain where others may act impulsively or fail to see the bigger picture. But where\'s the fun in that if the thinking process is never shown? The obvious, but short-sighted solution that one would logically jump to first is never presented until the problem is solved, at which point another character (usually princess...Liscia) asks our hero ""why didn\'t we do the obvious thing?"", and Souma replies by explaining what would\'ve gone wrong if he had done what she asks. But at that point, there\'s no tension or mystery, and we don\'t get to guess what solution he\'ll actually come up with, because it\'s already happening or it has already happened.The art is cheap at best, and fairly inconsistent. The number of dialogue scenes where we don\'t even get to see the face of the person speaking is almost jarring. But for the kind of show this is, it\'s overall passable.Our main character Souma works just fine, and he could\'ve even been great with a better story. But it is quite annoying that everyone loves and either accepts him as king or respects him as an enemy so easily and so quickly. He\'s clever, but he\'s not that clever. Which, on the other hand, is actually one of the things that I like: he uses knowledge that would be unique to him in a different world thanks to our history and literature instead of any kind of really convoluted Keikaku doori-style plan.The rest of our characters are as one-dimensional as they come, but with maybe one or two exceptions none of them are terrible. Like for everything else, their relationships happen offscreen and we get told about them. And most of them appear for 1-2 episodes each anyways, so the lack of depth isn\'t really a surprise or a big issue.The main problem of the show is its lack of stakes or tension. The only time the show tried to set up mysteries is as a hook at the end of the episode. But by the 3rd time the issue is immediately solved at the start of the next episode, people will catch on to the trick and the only setups the show was attempting to use just stop working.Don\'t watch this. I can\'t say that it\'s horrible, but you will probably get nothing from this. No tension, no humor, no action, and no feels.

It is for this reason that I started watching this item.The story is simple, the hero goes to another world, and in order not to be given to another country for ""research"", he decides to help the kingdom that summoned him to get out of poverty. As his ideas are helpful, the current king abdicates and makes Souma king and gives him back his daughter. The story goes on a straight track where the main goal is to save...the kingdom from poverty and corruption.

Granted I\'m a sucker for the isekai genre in general, but this really has a fresh take on it that I like.It definitely doesn\'t have a lot of action/fighting monsters/op magic scenes, and people keep comparing it to Log Horizon, but I don\'t really see that except in the broadest sense in that Log Horizon dealt with some political things, but Log Horizon was a much heavier serious anime. This is a lot more light hearted. The stakes are definitely there but it\'s still fun.I especially enjoy how romance is handled in here. Yes there\'s the typical building of a...harem, but it\'s not your typical spastic MC doesn\'t know how to talk to girls, or has no idea that girls like him or lets girls beat him up for no reason. It\'s very pratical realistic interactions between him and the women around him and relationships develop much more organically. It\'s not perfect, but again, it\'s a welcome take.Finally I enjoy this anime because the MC is not an idiot. He doesn\'t do stupid things for the sake of ""plot"" or mope around going ""woah is me"". He just rolls up his sleeves and gets things done.The anime definitely isn\'t for everyone but I reccommend if you like isekai and want something light hearted and don\'t mind that it\'s not fighting / action / adventure. harem, but it\'s not your typical spastic MC doesn\'t know how to talk to girls, or has no idea that girls like him or lets girls beat him up for no reason.

This is a trope that gets repeated both on individual levels and cultural levels over and over, like it\'s the only note the writers can hit and it\'s a false one.I more or less expected the tragic MGTOW/incel attempts at ""subverting"" the harem trope, but they didn\'t even bother to make an effort to be convincing or subtle about it. It\'s as if they had a list of concepts about applying real world social systems with all their complexity and nuance to a fantasy realm, picked one at random,  but didn\'t do any research or world-building or character development and decided to forgo the complexity and the nuance for some really simplistic and patronizing colonial chauvinism.Want a good story, good characters, interesting and novel problems/solutions?- Avoid this show, it\'s a participation badge of anime writing.- Target audience: insecure man-children who failed civics is apparent when the MC starts lecturing forest dwellers on how to use the plants of the forest, as if the millennia that passed left them unable to accumulate any kind of basic knowledge of their surroundings.

Even comparing the character designs to their other works the characters of Realist Hero are just so plane that their almost uninteresting. And, bias up front, it\'s even worse for me since I\'m habituated to the manga\'s art by Ueda Satoshi. Given Ueda has a background in drawing doujins with only commercial manga before drawing Realist Hero, but his design is so eye-catchingly enthralling that it actively elevates the story. And while this difference between J.C. and Ueda is obvious in the female characters, it\'s particularly noticeable with Georg Carmine, Poncho Panacotta, and Gaius and Julius Amidonia. These 4 characters looks so much more appropriate for the rolls they play in the series with the designs by Ueda then they do in either the LN or the anime. But considering that Fuyuyuki is on staff at J.C. for character design AND is the artist for the LN, you\'d have to expect that the anime will end up as such.

As well as modicums of character growth as you should expect from a story that is well put together. The permanent characters grow with the story and the temporary ones serve their purpose and end with their roll before they overstay their welcome. The anime just cuts a few too many of the minor character behaviors and interactions that really drive home the interpersonal relationships for my liking though. Another case of could have been better but could have been much worse.Enjoyment: 7.Despite its flaws, I still come back to watch the weekly episodes. More out of a curiosity of what\'s changed rather then what\'s going to happen, probably the only downside of being a manga/LN reader is you know the story beforehand but if that\'s enough to cause you to not enjoy the series then you might as well not watch it at all.  And in spite of my own bias towards the art, it\'s not so bad that it would chase me away from watching it. I\'m just significantly more liable to recommend the literature, manga or LN, over the anime and point anime watchers at other series.Overall: 7.Standard J.C. quality product.

"", ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Season 1 is a captivating anime series that combines political intrigue, kingdom-building, and a dash of romance. Based on the light novel of the same name, this show offers a refreshing take on the isekai genre, focusing on the protagonist's wit and strategic thinking rather than relying solely on action and fantasy elements.One of the highlights of How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom is its intelligent and resourceful protagonist, Kazuya Souma. Instead of relying on brute strength, Kazuya employs his extensive knowledge of economics, governance, and modern-day technology to reform the struggling kingdom of Elfrieden. His ability...to apply real-world concepts and implement pragmatic solutions to societal problems sets him apart from typical isekai protagonists and makes for an intriguing storyline.The world-building in the series is commendable.

I\'m glad I watched it because in the end I really enjoyed it. The Kingdom development and management isn\'t something you see the ""Hero"" that has been summoned to ""save the world"" do very often. Review Time!Story: 7/10 - I found that the story was good, it\'s an Isekai which there is an abundance of Isekai anime available to watch at the moment but it has a couple things that aren\'t seen in many anime especially Isekai. The ones I\'ve seen anyway. The MCs...name is Souma Kazuya and at the beginning of the anime he gets summoned to this new world to a country named Elfreiden. He is summoned in his own body so there\'s no age regression or body transmigration which I find is less complicated for the storyline. The country that summoned Soma happens to be in debt and in the middle of a food shortage at the time he was summoned and he ended up presenting a few solutions to the issues which leads to him becoming the new king. That\'s the 1st episode lol. After he becomes king he enacts multiple new policies and wins the approval of the people but also the animosity of the countries around his new home country. The story was interesting and surprisingly entertaining with a few funny instances throughout. I like the fact that the season was longer than just 12 episodes because I thought that the story needed it, I just wish it wouldn\'t have been released in two separate cours to make it easier for review purposes lol. Also another thing I wish that would have been done differently was the action scenes, and the battles between countries because they looked like small skirmishes not battles with thousands of people lol. I\'m guessing it was done that way because of budget reasons and they would have had to take time and money away from other aspects so it\'s understandable.Art: 7/10 - the animation is good for the type of anime it is. There aren\'t any major fight scenes that required a lot of choreography or special effects so it didn\'t effect the budget. I liked that the animation was consistent throughout the entire season and didn\'t look like it was rushed. There also wasn\'t any unnecessary CGI that can seem like it chops a scene up and I also find that it can be jarring and effect the viewers immersion with the anime. The backgrounds were done well also, they were legible and not too repetitive. Plus you could actually tell what objects in the background were supposed to be, you didn\'t have to guess lol.Sound: 7.5/10 - the sound in this anime is really good for the most part. The OP and ED were done well and both had vocals, which isn\'t a guarantee. Both sounded decent although I did like the OP more than the ED. They weren\'t on the level where I actually enjoyed watching them at the beginning and end of the anime so I just skipped them most the season except for when I was writing this review during the 13th episode. Atleast they both seemed original and weren\'t some generic mono tone garbage. The SFX (sound effects) were ok in the few places it was used because there wasn\'t to many crazy battles. The background music was really good throughout the season though and helped add emotion to the scenes it was in. I feel that the background music and SFX are best when they can effect the viewer and add to the viewers immersion into the anime and not take them out of the zone and distract them.Characters: 7.5/10 - the characters in this anime are good in my opinion. They all have good designs and I honestly liked pretty much every characters voice acting. The MC looks plain most of the time but that helps project to the viewer what kind of person he is. Although he was summoned as the ""hero"" he isn\'t the tough guy, he\'s got more mental toughness than physical toughness and that fits his character considering he was just an average University student before he was summoned. He wasn\'t some martial arts master and didn\'t have a grandfather or uncle that had a dojo. The characters around him are done well too in my opinion and he may have a Harem but it\'s not done in the typical way, it\'s kind of a background theme. As I said before, the voice acting was pretty good whether it\'s the English subtitled or English dubbed version you choose to watch. Also one other thing I noticed and I liked was the fact that the MC and a few other characters changed what they were wearing a couple times during the season which doesn\'t happen much in anime.Enjoyment: 8.5/10 - I really enjoyed this anime a lot more than I expected to, to be honest. The story was interesting enough to keep me focused and it had enough things that I hadn\'t seen in other anime. I found that it was funny at the right times and it didn\'t effect any of the important events. I liked the MC and how he just wanted to find a family for himself and he does what he has to in order to keep them safe. If you\'ve read any of my other reviews you know I like Isekai and Harem anime but I like how this anime handles both genres in unorthodox ways that even if the idea isn\'t completely original, it hasn\'t been done ten thousand times and that\'s part of why I liked this anime.Overall: 7.5/10 - it\'s a good anime to watch if you enjoy watching anime in general and this anime doesn\'t really connect to any genre completely other than Isekai, it\'s got hints of Fantasy and Action along with Harem, Drama and Comedy with abit of Slice of Life, so I\'m sure that as long as you are an anime FAN and go into this anime with an open mind then like I say with pretty my anime reviews, I\'m sure you will find something about this anime that you will enjoy. The characters are relatable in a sense and at times felt like they could have been real people at some point in time. Also it isn\'t perfect and it isn\'t super action packed either so it can be watched at any time but in my opinion, it\'s best to just chill and watch it. It was worth watching for me the 1st time I watched this anime and it was worth when I watched for the like..... 4th or 5th time before I wrote this review and it will probably still be worth it when I watch it the next time because I\'m sure I\'ll watch it again at some point. LoL.Review End!Just one more thought,Sometimes I like reading other peoples reviews but I really can\'t understand how someone can think they have a decent understanding of an anime and then right a review without watching the full anime and sometimes it takes multiple viewings to have a complete understanding of an anime and catch all the details or catch any other things that might have been missed if the viewer was reading the subtitles during a scene. I don\'t have a problem with people sharing their opinion on how they feel about an anime but to me unless you\'ve seen the entire season that\'s being reviewed, then is more of a ""My Thoughts"" post and mot a review. But that could be just me. So I\'ve been seeing a lot of reviews of unfinished anime lately and I felt I just had to say my opinion, I\'m sorry if you read through this but I appreciate if you did read it lol. name is Souma Kazuya and at the beginning of the anime he gets summoned to this new world to a country named Elfreiden. He is summoned in his own body so there\'s no age regression or body transmigration which I find is less complicated for the storyline. The country that summoned Soma happens to be in debt and in the middle of a food shortage at the time he was summoned and he ended up presenting a few solutions to the issues which leads to him becoming the new king. That\'s the 1st episode lol. After he becomes king he enacts multiple new policies and wins the approval of the people but also the animosity of the countries around his new home country. The story was interesting and surprisingly entertaining with a few funny instances throughout. I like the fact that the season was longer than just 12 episodes because I thought that the story needed it, I just wish it wouldn\'t have been released in two separate cours to make it easier for review purposes lol. Also another thing I wish that would have been done differently was the action scenes, and the battles between countries because they looked like small skirmishes not battles with thousands of people lol. I\'m guessing it was done that way because of budget reasons and they would have had to take time and money away from other aspects so it\'s understandable.Art: 7/10 - the animation is good for the type of anime it is. There aren\'t any major fight scenes that required a lot of choreography or special effects so it didn\'t effect the budget. I liked that the animation was consistent throughout the entire season and didn\'t look like it was rushed. There also wasn\'t any unnecessary CGI that can seem like it chops a scene up and I also find that it can be jarring and effect the viewers immersion with the anime. The backgrounds were done well also, they were legible and not too repetitive. Plus you could actually tell what objects in the background were supposed to be, you didn\'t have to guess lol.Sound: 7.5/10 - the sound in this anime is really good for the most part. The OP and ED were done well and both had vocals, which isn\'t a guarantee. Both sounded decent although I did like the OP more than the ED. They weren\'t on the level where I actually enjoyed watching them at the beginning and end of the anime so I just skipped them most the season except for when I was writing this review during the 13th episode. Atleast they both seemed original and weren\'t some generic mono tone garbage. The SFX (sound effects) were ok in the few places it was used because there wasn\'t to many crazy battles. The background music was really good throughout the season though and helped add emotion to the scenes it was in. I feel that the background music and SFX are best when they can effect the viewer and add to the viewers immersion into the anime and not take them out of the zone and distract them.Characters: 7.5/10 - the characters in this anime are good in my opinion. They all have good designs and I honestly liked pretty much every characters voice acting. The MC looks plain most of the time but that helps project to the viewer what kind of person he is.

I won't spoil who But Dont expect action in the series. I won't spoil who But Dont expect action"", ""How the Ugly Anime Turned Out to be Pretty Okay.How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom was an... interesting *sigh* light novel isekai experience. Amongst all of the new *sigh* light novel isekai this season whether okay-ish or bad, Realist Hero was the one I looked forward to the most each week.Kazuya Souma a civil servant in training is summoned as a hero to a kingdom in debt only to find that he would be sold off to the empire. Not wanting that of course he decides to solve the kingdom's debt problems and food crisis leading to the king passing the throne onto...him after just three days.It's a pretty good premise, it's pretty well executed and it was satisfying to watch Souma overcome the kingdom's problems and inject his modern knowledge and ways of thinking into a medieval, European-ish, fantasy world with an aristocracy system. That said it's far from perfect. The show is a little up itself to what it thinks a civil servant does and can do. Souma can go from having a believable to an unbelievable amount of knowledge on subjects he really should have no believable business knowing and it comes across as being a bit too convenient from time to time in the story.I enjoyed the cast for the most part. Princess Liscia keeps Souma grounded and is fun to watch and Aisha the Dark Elf is Shion from That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime which is always good. Juna and Hakuya were good, but under-utilised and Poncho... just kind of plays an anime-fat person. Though he does do his part in the story I just didn't find him all that interesting. I rolled my eyes when I saw Tomoe though as I guessed she was there to satisfy a certain... disturbing audience niché that Spirit Chronicles had been supplying in buckets *cough* lolicon *cough* siscon *cough*. Surprise... I was correct.I cannot get past how ugly this show looks from an animation point of view. I honestly thought this was a Studio Deen production at first. The animation is very sloppy at times, the character models look ugly and the moments when the camera does a dramatic sweep makes the whole production feel like a Playstation 1 cutscene. I don't know what's going on at J C Staff who usually puts out well-polished-looking yet under-animated shows, but this is not the kind of standard I expect from them. Maybe J C needs to stop taking on so many projects and give their animators the time off and rest they need and deserve.Now that that's off my chest I think the world-building is pretty solid. Though it is mostly explained through exposition I enjoyed learning about the world, its political structure and how magic and certain monsters replace certain modern technological advances. The magic is pretty *sigh* light novel isekai standard however, I like Souma's Poltergeist magic. It's interesting, it doesn't necessarily make him overpowered and it makes him unique amongst isekai light novel protag-kuns.The show can be cringy at times. It goes out of its way to say harems are okay in this world, but then immediately falls back onto light novel tropes which the world-building should've freed it from. The dialogue can also come off as cringy and unnatural at times making some scenes difficult to sit through.Overall Realist Hero is pretty okay. It has its flaws which hold it back from being good, even great, but season 2 has been announced and I'll be watching it when it is released.6/10 It's Okay *Thumbs Up* him after just three days.It's a pretty good premise, it's pretty well executed and it was satisfying to watch Souma overcome the kingdom's problems and inject his modern knowledge and ways of thinking into a medieval, European-ish, fantasy world with an aristocracy system.

It was promising at first. You know a little bit different than the usual Isekai. And then BOOOM Harem... They did it again. A likeable couple and an interesting concept butchered on the altair of the Harem...As for the story. I was hoping it will deepen as the time goes by, but no. Actually quite the opposite, it became more and more haremish. The political games were childish, the problems were childish, and the sollutions were childish. Not because it was solved by an 18 years old. A talented 18 old today knows...much-much more than a King in the middle ages. Yet, the sollution were pretty simple and straight forward, so it didn\'t felt like they are real problems. The whole show felt like a sandbox where our MC is playing like a child...Sounds, visuals and the characters are fine. Nothing fancy though.So all in all this is an uninteresting Isekai. It had a few good moments though, so I can\'t say that it is bad. However I would expect a much deeper economical and political aspect from a show which tries to sell itself as a ""economy simulator isekai""... Disappointment. much-much more than a King in the middle ages. Yet, the sollution were pretty simple and straight forward, so it didn\'t felt like they are real problems.

MC is a studious guy with higher than average knowledge on state affairs, economics and politics. In short succession MC acquires harem to boink, kingdom to rule and work pile to slave away.There is a drastic fall in anime production somewhere around midpoint (after first 4 episodes before 8th episode). Source of story is light novel with manga adaptation of the same name (manga illustrations are...much better than anime and story is more flushed out/detailed),But animation is degrading.

Fewer and fewer lines are used for art etc. Some of more iconic scenes got left out (comparing manga v. anime) and things that could have been conveyed using visual medium ever often were told by voice actors.Recommendations of similar anime:Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko - if you enjoyed Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki then Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko has similar sense of rushing and degrading animation episode after episode.Aldnoah.Zero - story is similar as a realistic MC has to deal with a lot of bs from both friend and fiend, scale is much large, animation is times better, musical score too.Alderamin on the sky - MC is a plain staff officer in failing state's militia, and he offers some insight into political scheming and larger landscape of on the ground action. much better than anime and story is more flushed out/detailed),But animation is degrading.

But, if you are just like me, and sometimes just want some vanilla, then this show is for you."", 'Genjitsu was a good surprise, my initial expectation is that it would be a generic dragged Isekai, but with each episode it conquered me little by little, doing what an Isekai should do which is to show our protagonist knowing this world and showing us the conflicts that move the plot. In the case of Genjitsu he decided to go to the political side, instead of a magical adventure, which for me, a fan of political geography, was something wonderful and the work gained a special charm.The characters are not wonderful, but they manage to be interesting and fun, in addition to dealing with themes...such as economy, culture and foreign affairs in a simplified and light way, making me keep my interest both in the story and in the construction of the world.I want to emphasize the romance between the protagonist and the main heroine that is slowly developing, but in a natural and fun way to follow, as there is no stigma of ""The heroine needs to be a tsundere who likes him but doesn\'t want to admit it that, or that she is extremely fickle in her actions in relation to the novel"", she is not fully aware that she likes him and tries to respect his space, not forcing interactions and always respecting the chemistry they both have, and this was something that Interested a lot, because I don\'t force them both to stay together, everything happens naturally.now, let\'s talk about episode 08 which is easily one of my favorite episodes of the entire season (Summer/2021).[BEWARE, EPISODE 08 SPOILER]This episode of Genjitsu had a lot to tell in a short amount of time.My issues with suspension of disbelief:1st It was really cool that Souma, it not only brings technology from the 21st century, it also brings technologies that were the basis of humanity there between the 10th and 18th centuries, I think it\'s kind of ""overpowering"" for him to know, engineering, economics, cooking, biology among others, but if we take into account the quality of Japanese education, it makes sense, he has so much knowledge, however I think they should use more of the ""magic"" to exalt the knowledge of the characters in this world, with this most fanciful part.2nd About the rescue squad, when he put together the plan and immediately put it into action, I was incredulous at how he can do everything very well, but then I remembered all the geographical problems in Japan and really, coordinating an evacuation and rescue, is the basics of life for a Japanese in the fire circle and tectonic plate meeting region :VNow about the episode itself:1st I think it\'s cool that they bring how technology works in that world, but I think it\'s a waste to use such an interesting theme in such an expository dialogue, such as ships and firearms, and they know how to do that, still using a lot of expository dialogues, but this time bringing it to a context within the work and that makes sense within the scene, as was the explanation of Roman concrete2nd When there was the disaster, being a shonen/isekai, I was like ""They\'ll get there in time and save general, just watch"" and when they arrive after hours and hours of walking, there was no magic to overcome and people died, the scene of them saying how many people died, it just wasn\'t better, because it came down to a number, ""100 people died"", yes it\'s sad, but without weight, it\'s just a number. If they had been showing, the bodies scattered, some covered, to cover up the gore, it would have been heavier than it once was.3rd It was very good, the final sequence of the village leader\'s brother bringing the pain of those who stay and Souma, feeling this and being able to interpret what a King should have done, took a huge leap in character development, because we saw he was always taking care of the food, drawing up diplomatic and economic relations, but what about the rest? As he himself brought in the final reflection there, ""A country does not reign only with food and army"", so it was wonderful how much this episode has to tell us, from the chance of a disaster, distribution line, the pain of loss , what it\'s like to be a king, the weight of life, was amazing even with an average production. such as economy, culture and foreign affairs in a simplified and light way, making me keep my interest both in the story and in the construction of the world.I want to emphasize the romance between the protagonist and the main heroine that is slowly developing, but in a natural and fun way to follow, as there is no stigma of ""The heroine needs to be a tsundere who likes him but doesn\'t want to admit it that, or that she is extremely fickle in her actions in relation to the novel"", she is not fully aware that she likes him and tries to respect his space, not forcing interactions and always respecting the chemistry they both have, and this was something that Interested a lot, because I don\'t force them both to stay together, everything happens naturally.now, let\'s talk about episode 08 which is easily one of my favorite episodes of the entire season (Summer/2021).[BEWARE, EPISODE 08 SPOILER]This episode of Genjitsu had a lot to tell in a short amount of time.My issues with suspension of disbelief:1st It was really cool that Souma, it not only brings technology from the 21st century, it also brings technologies that were the basis of humanity there between the 10th and 18th centuries, I think it\'s kind of ""overpowering"" for him to know, engineering, economics, cooking, biology among others, but if we take into account the quality of Japanese education, it makes sense, he has so much knowledge, however I think they should use more of the ""magic"" to exalt the knowledge of the characters in this world, with this most fanciful part.2nd About the rescue squad, when he put together the plan and immediately put it into action, I was incredulous at how he can do everything very well, but then I remembered all the geographical problems in Japan and really, coordinating an evacuation and rescue, is the basics of life for a Japanese in the fire circle and tectonic plate meeting region :VNow about the episode itself:1st I think it\'s cool that they bring how technology works in that world, but I think it\'s a waste to use such an interesting theme in such an expository dialogue, such as ships and firearms, and they know how to do that, still using a lot of expository dialogues, but this time bringing it to a context within the work and that makes sense within the scene, as was the explanation of Roman concrete2nd When there was the disaster, being a shonen/isekai, I was like ""They\'ll get there in time and save general, just watch"" and when they arrive after hours and hours of walking, there was no magic to overcome and people died, the scene of them saying how many people died, it just wasn\'t better, because it came down to a number, ""100 people died"", yes it\'s sad, but without weight, it\'s just a number.

I was a little disappointed with the adaptation.Compared to the light novel and the manga (there will be no spoilers), the anime lacks impact, whether in the visual, in the scenes, music, the characters are good, but the elements that make up the anime don't help...I believe the work has a certain level of potential, if you are reading the LN or the manga, forget about the anime, as I doubt it will improve in the next episodes.Sorry for bad English, I wrote this on google...translator. :) translator. :)"", ""I will admit the only good point of the series is Kazuya and Carmine. If the story focus in conclude the conflict with Carmine faster and go on to next story this series still have a hope. Kazuya is 'Realist hero' they said. But for me it just Kazuya have awareness of economy and politics because he an aspiring civil servant. In coincidentally it good trait for prime minister. So he can solve Elfrieden Kingdom economy issue.The story itself feel boring and generic, but I will admit Kazuya is smart to recruit most talented citizen to help him rebuild the kingdom. Another point that this...series lack is not using fantasy setting well. I mean Kazuya transported to another world because the Kingdom have problem with Demon army, the issue itself haven't been touched in this season.In conclusion I heard this series will have 2nd season. I hope they will make interesting story, make use of fantasy setting and Kazuya experienced to the fullest. Don't be normal harem anime we don't really need Liscia to fight for Kazuya love. series lack is not using fantasy setting well.

Don't be normal harem anime we don't really need Liscia to fight for Kazuya love."", '*Note: This review is for Part 1 and Part 2.*tl;dr: An anime that fails in terms of handling any of it’s complexity properly, but is still pretty solid.This anime is an isekai with the main differentiating factor being that the summoned Hero protagonist, Souma, has no real special abilities. Rather, the only thing he has going from him is that he’s a very logical and pragmatic person, calling himself a realist. As such, he doesn’t go off to go fight the demon lord, but rather takes charge of the nation he’s been summoned to, Elfried, and implements a number of political, economic, infrastructural, and diplomatic...reforms. This inevitably leads to conflicts, both internal and external, which he must also deal with.While most isekai are very character driven with very generic and often nebulous world building, a story such as this must inherently have a heavy emphasis on the broader world and it’s various intertwined systems. Unfortunately, while there was an attempt, it didn’t really feel like the writing was at the level it needed to be to handle the subject matter it was tackling. It felt like the author had an inability to imagine a world that differed all that much from his own, and thus despite being set in a fantasy world, it carried over various concepts from our modern world, even when it doesn’t make much sense to do so. There are smaller examples like school uniforms, cuisine, and idols that are easy enough to wave off, but there’s a broader undercurrent to the political and economic systems of the world operating closer to the modern world than they would in a medieval society, let alone one with fantasy aspects. It feels that the writing leaves how magic and such work nebulous so that they can be used as a crutch to address such inconsistencies, but it results in the world building overall feeling kind of lazy.It also feels like the author doesn’t have a depth of knowledge on the various ideas that Souma has that push society forward. It feels like he’s missing the larger context, so the explanations are reasonably accurate when applied to our world and history, but they don’t seem to fit well in the context of the fantasy world. A lot of the innovation especially feels to miss the point on it not just being the final invention that was important, but that the various supporting innovations are what allowed the invention to actually have an an impact. Over the course of the series, it actually goes back and tries to explain things that don’t make sense from earlier parts. While it can feel somewhat forced at times, I suppose the explanations are decent for the most part. However, there being large gaps between showing the contradiction and trying to explain them away leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand why that would be the case in the novels, as the explanations are likely the result of feedback received between volumes. However, the anime should have restructured things such that it flowed better and seemed more natural. As it is it feels like there’s way too much random infodumping which results in subpar pacing. The second part also ends in a straight up episode long infodump explaining away some major issues from the start of the series, so the final impression of the anime overall is pretty weak.Furthermore, despite this anime heavily involving the types of conflicts that are generally marred in complex competing motivations, characters in this are incredibly black and white. The people on Souma’s side are the good guys, honest paragon’s of virtue that value the greater good, and the people against him are the bad guys, lying cartoon villains that care solely about enriching and empowering themselves. There are no instances of Souma having to work with or make concessions to people who are clearly unjust, nor are there long term instances where he has to perform acts of injustice where the other side has an equally strong point and he could be portrayed as the villain. I specify long term because though there are some instances like this, they are smoothed over so simply and quickly it doesn’t feel like they should count. For example, he kills the nobles opposing him and his reforms, but they turn out to be traitors. He invades a nearby nation and so it’s people hate him, but as soon as he implements his reforms they love him. Everything goes way too smoothly with no shades of gray whatsoever.So ultimately, despite it feeling like it’s trying to be, this isn’t anywhere near the likes of Maoyu or Spice and Wolf. However, that doesn’t make it a complete failure. It’s pretty solid when it comes to the simpler aspects. Though the protagonist doesn’t really have much of a character arc, he’s pretty solid in terms of his personality and how he interacts with the world. The characters around him are handled pretty well too. The heroines in general are pretty likable and have a decent variety to them and their romantic fluff with the protagonist is amusing. But what I think makes this story stand out somewhat is that there are a lot of important male characters and non-heroine female characters that it also puts effort into making interesting. It sets up and develops a lot of relationships outside of the protagonist and his harem, which I think is really rare as far as modern isekai are concerned. And the plot is pretty solid if you can just go with the flow and not worry too much about the details or broader context. Thus, while this isn’t an anime I would recommend for it’s depth, it can be pretty enjoyable and is on the upper end of the scale as far as trashy isekai go.The art and animation are decent but not particularly exceptional. Characters designs are pretty solid though also not particularly remarkable. Souma keeping his clothes from his previous world throughout the season looked pretty dumb though. The soundtrack is reasonably solid and works well enough. The OPs are both decent in terms of visuals and audio. The ED to the first cour has a pretty good song but the visuals are incredibly lazy. The ED to the second cour is also pretty good and has decent visuals. reforms.

At first this anime really got me interested until episode 3, but after watching ep 4 I realize how slow and bland this anime is. I'm expecting that the happenings will go a little faster but the story focuses more on the little dumb things that makes the story moves very slowly. After watching ep 4 I got fed up and stopped watching it, I think I'll catch up to this if there will be an interesting...event from this show.Overall:This anime is pretty chill, if you want a super slow isekai with a slice of life vibe I'm sure you will enjoy this.

I went into it with low expectations and was surprised by how invested I became. The twists are excellent and there was something weirdly satisfying about seeing a hero fix the political and logistical problems of isekai land instead of just punch things because the royalty who summoned him said so. I also feel like the hero truly earns the respect of those around him. He is hard-working and considerate, but not a doormat. He allows dissenting opinions and genuinely doesn't know how to deal with his adoring harem.On the subject of that harem, WHY?! Why ruin this...good show with such unnecessary nonsense? Women do not need to fall at the feet of every male MC. I am so done with this trope. Almost no women in the real world want to be part of a harem. Even in polyamorous situations, you want a certain equality among everyone involved. The princess in this show is super jealous anytime the MC so much as looks at another woman, though she reluctantly acknowledges that the MC will almost certainly end up with several other wives. I appreciate that the show addresses a few of the issues a harem might cause (e.g. the wife hierarchy is clarified pretty quickly) and the characters involved in the harem TALK about the situation. Thumbs up for communication in relationships! :)It's just so obnoxious (and kind of insulting) how every. single. woman. who meets the MC is super quickly infatuated with him, including the woman who he literally enslaved because she revolted against his rule and the mother of his main fiancé who supposedly loves her husband (the previous king and his fiancé's dad).Anyway, if you are fine with harems, I think this is one of the least squicky out there because all the women freely and enthusiastically choose to be with the MC, who in turn treats them well. He's not gross about having so much female attention all of a sudden. In fact, it's sweet how happy he is about having a family and how seriously he takes protecting his new family.Another--though more minor--negative to this anime is the side journeys/filler bits/whatever you want to call them (e.g. the ninja puppet's adventure in the tunnels). They're unnecessary and not very interesting, but whatever.Overall, this anime is quite good. Most of the characters are interesting, the plot is interesting, the world-building is fairly interesting, the politics are decently interesting but have excellent twists/reveals, the magic system is not great but not terrible, and the romance is mostly kept in sweet/cute territory despite the aforementioned boobalicious harem. good show with such unnecessary nonsense?

As I mentioned earlier a character I found to be intriguing ended up being totally unutilised as his only involvement was to solve a problem which had literally never been shown to us as if we were expected to know all about it but sadly this is the fate of most of the male cast as they\'re introduced and then quickly left behind to instead focus on the main character and his growing harem.- The character relationships in this show are completely dry as the only good two dynamics this show could have had ended up being wasted. While one (Roroa) could\'ve been a direct challenge to the protagonist and his kingdom its all thrown away to become another member of his harem for no real gain on her part it\'s just a plot device. As for the other (Hakuya) it was spoiled not because of the characters actions but just by the fact that he can never interact with the protag one on one as the mc is forced to have at least two of his harem members with him at all times. Speaking about the harem though I think the show wants us to actually care about their relationships while giving them literally no growth at all and just substituting it with brief one on ones (only with the main girl) just before the mc goes to sleep from overworking.- The past events in this show are non existent aside from mentions, they\'re something akin to cookie clicker where you set something up and now it magically runs without maintenance whatsoever but I suppose that is at least better then what the series has a habit of doing which is showing the result of something major the MC has done completely off screen with no context as to how it happened other than (well in my world it was like this so I replicated it)In conclusion this was the biggest let down of an isekai I\'ve possibly ever seen even on par with ""In another world with my smartphone"" and if you for some reason still want to watch this then all I can say is good luck to you be found.- The art/animation is fine but nothing spectacular and while I normally don\'t mind CGI, the use of it in this show at random points is a let down honestly as it kinda breaks immersion to some degree.- The story is for the most part after the first few episodes a complete mish mash of events which have little to no correlation they just kinda happen without context or that would be the case but the series enjoys shoehorning in tons of information at the beginning of episodes to cover its tracks as if that\'s supposed to count as adequate world building.- The character depth is honestly about as low as it goes here.

Does it work at making the series comparatively interesting? Well, it\'s complicated.On the one hand, there is an undeniable novelty to treating statecraft as more than an afterthought in a fantasy series like this. It\'s a largely untapped vein of storytelling that only Tensura has really explored in a satisfying way to this point. The plot moves along nicely rather than being mired in generic dungeon adventuring, and the focus of the story necessitates a more built-out and interesting setting than...you get from almost any other isekai.The downside though, is that if you\'re going to make a series about diplomacy, you need to actually know something about diplomacy, and it\'s apparent that the original writer doesn\'t. Instead, it\'s clear that he thumbed through a copy of The Prince to reference a few quotes and called it a day. What he calls ""realism"" is actually just politics, not the Realist philosophy of international relations. Souma, the ""Realist Hero"" of the title, is not a Realist but an idealist who believes in keeping everyone safe and minimizing casualties as an end unto itself, an emphatically non-Realist idea. I realize this seems like nitpicking, but when the selling point of the series is its comparatively serious treatment of politics and diplomacy, it matters that the writer is flubbing all of the references to political philosophy. The use of Realist in the title and the constant references to Machiavelli would probably prime you to believe this is a brutal series where an amoral protagonist has to make a lot of hard choices, but in fact he\'s not like that at all and almost never encounters serious problems or resistance. One of the worst things about the writing is that when you get right down to it, it\'s just a different flavor of isekai power fantasy about a guy that has everything go his way while he amasses a large roster of girlfriends.More than the writing though, the key problem with Realist Hero is the production by JC Staff. Watching isekai anime generally comes with the implicit promise of bad animation, but this is on a different level. Characters are off model far more than they\'re on, and not in a charming way. The simplest cuts of animation melt like a chocolate bar in the desert. The few action scenes in the series are simply not animated at all and are presented PowerPoint-style instead. The CGI and digital backgrounds look like puke and the compositing is incompetent at the most basic levels, like not lining up people\'s feet correctly with the surface they\'re walking on. It almost feels insulting to watch, that they thought this was an acceptable final product to put out into the world.Overall, I do think this is better than most isekai anime, but I can\'t fully recommend it. The plot has a certain propulsiveness that makes it pretty binge-able, and the political gimmick makes it feel comparatively fresh and distinct in an ever-more-formulaic genre, even when it indulges too much in those formulas itself. On the other hand, the treatment of politics and diplomacy is pretty shallow and uninformed, which makes it maddening if you\'re actually passionate about those topics. The dreadful standard of animation tips it into ""don\'t recommend"" territory for me, but you may feel more positively about it if that doesn\'t matter as much to you you get from almost any other isekai.The downside though, is that if you\'re going to make a series about diplomacy, you need to actually know something about diplomacy, and it\'s apparent that the original writer doesn\'t. Instead, it\'s clear that he thumbed through a copy of The Prince to reference a few quotes and called it a day. What he calls ""realism"" is actually just politics, not the Realist philosophy of international relations. Souma, the ""Realist Hero"" of the title, is not a Realist but an idealist who believes in keeping everyone safe and minimizing casualties as an end unto itself, an emphatically non-Realist idea. I realize this seems like nitpicking, but when the selling point of the series is its comparatively serious treatment of politics and diplomacy, it matters that the writer is flubbing all of the references to political philosophy. The use of Realist in the title and the constant references to Machiavelli would probably prime you to believe this is a brutal series where an amoral protagonist has to make a lot of hard choices, but in fact he\'s not like that at all and almost never encounters serious problems or resistance. One of the worst things about the writing is that when you get right down to it, it\'s just a different flavor of isekai power fantasy about a guy that has everything go his way while he amasses a large roster of girlfriends.More than the writing though, the key problem with Realist Hero is the production by JC Staff. Watching isekai anime generally comes with the implicit promise of bad animation, but this is on a different level. Characters are off model far more than they\'re on, and not in a charming way. The simplest cuts of animation melt like a chocolate bar in the desert. The few action scenes in the series are simply not animated at all and are presented PowerPoint-style instead.

If you generally don\'t like isekai, then this show won\'t be for you. I am a fan of the isekai genre, so I enjoyed myself and watched the whole show. But nothing stands out to me that I REALLY enjoyed. It was just ok. I gave it a 7/10 overall, but I tend to give shows I don\'t regret watching but wouldn\'t watch again a 7. That being said, I will not be rewatching...this show anytime soon, and probably never will. I will watch season 2, which I believe releases in the Winter 2022 anime season, but it will be more of a ""oh yeah, season 2 of ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom"" is airing. I\'ll have to watch it once its fully out."" If someone asked for an isekai anime recommendation and I knew they had already seen all of the isekai I consider really good, I would recommend this show. However, I would not proffer a recommendation for this show without being specifically asked for an isekai recommendation.The story is decent, MC is summoned to another world to save the kingdom. Instead of the usual isekai storyline, the MC is not overpowered at all. The MC ends up using his knowledge of modern day Japan to save the kingdom from economic ruin, but he doesn\'t run around slaying baddies. There is a small harem if you\'re into that kind of thing (I sometimes am), but the harem is not an ""in your face"" harem. It almost feels like an afterthought, like the authors were like ""oh yeah, lets add a couple of girls that hint at having feelings for the MC"" instead of blatant in your face such as in shows such as ""5-toubun no Hanayome"" (The Quintessential Quintuplets). If you hate harem anime\'s, this show probably won\'t be unbearable for you. If you\'re looking for a harem anime, this show is not for you. This is a straightforward isekai.There were a few times where I was bored with what was happening, but it kept me semi-interested throughout the show.

The majority of the anime is spent learning about the fantasy world's problems and watching the main character come up with solutions. He is typically underestimated by people who don't know him before winning them over and therefore growing a bigger reputation as the anime progresses.It's an OP anime, but instead of being physically strong, it's the main character's ingenuity that drives the story. His ingenuity comes in the form of being...a decent strategist and implementing modern knowledge and social policies to win everyone around him.The main character is a Mary Sue who can do no wrong, which becomes the main negative of the show. There is a real lack of conflict and stakes. Everything comes too easily. Everyone is too nice to each other. It takes away any tension and excitement. There are no real story twists, just the odd reveal and turn to show the main character's foresight when dealing with certain obstacles.Realist Hero is a sit-back and easy-to-watch anime.In typical Isekai, he also grows a harem of female characters that fawn over him because of his smartness and kindness. This aspect doesn't take away too much of the story nor are there really any fan service scenes, which is typical of animes in this genre.

It\'s got that interesting practical look at addressing the problems of a burgeoning civilization using a smart modern outlook that I genuinely enjoy. The problem however comes in Episode 6 when the show introduces (and according to my research, will later deliver on) a social dynamic between the protagonist as his harem of potential waifus that I am not comfortable with, and at least personally I think calls into question the protagonist\'s morality. Still, I would recommend the show to someone with a different moral outlook on this topic than I have, but...I\'d recommend looking into who the main character decides to marry in order to judge for yourself whether this show might make you uncomfortable in the long run as well. I think the show\'s exploration of fantasy worldbuilding, politics, and economics is genuinely interesting... but I\'m definitely not willing to put up with what I suppose you could consider the show\'s more ""horny"" element. If you\'re as interested in this type of slice of life story as I am, you\'ll find both less uncomfortable (and better written) stories in Spice and Wolf or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

As a die hard fan of Log Horizon, that really annoyed me. So, I just had write a review to say, there is nothing similar between this trash and that masterpiece.Here's a quick pro and con on this anime, if you are planning on watching this.Pro:+Really good op and ed songs. It's not the best, but still better than many other anime this season.+Decent art. But the main girl looks like a rip off of the infamous Arthuria Pendragon.Cons:-Very slow paced, with almost no progress on plot. I feel like there is no story...at all in this anime.-Characters are very generic and bland. Almost no character development.-Animation is very bad. combined with the slow pacing makes this show very dreadful to watch.Now, people compare this anime to log horizon, because, the MC here is portrayed to be very intelligent. But in the 5 episodes I've seen, there has only been one scene, where the MC actually said something intelligent. Most of the times, his knowledge is just exaggerated and boring.I have not read the source material. But maybe, the novel or manga could be better, simply because you can read it at a faster pace. And if you genuinely liked this plot and looking for something similar, I recommend 'Release that Witch' webtoon. It is by far the best strategy /administrative Isekai I've read. at all in this anime.-Characters are very generic and bland.

Well, he\'s an important figure in political philosophy, and his namesake, in addition to the clunky title, give a firm grasp of what this series offers.I really want to like this one a lot more than I do, because it\'s one of those rare fantasy/isekai anime that focuses on often overlooked aspects of any city--fantasy or otherwise--namely, statecraft and diplomacy. Usually we get the bog-standard heroes on their journey, dispatching villains like your typical shounen heroes, or two warring kingdoms--one BAD, the other GOOD. There does seem to be a bit...of the latter, perhaps, but I suspect the actual situation will become more complex, in light of one of the plot developments unveiled in an early episode.It\'s easy to overlook the relatively low-budget compared to plenty of recent anime, as this is more concerned with world-building and scenario writing, but outside of being a little more creative than the average isekai, this looks and feels awfully generic. The camera work is of the slow side-panning variety, and the composition is often mediocre, if not outright bad.I say scenario writing rather than simply ""writing"" because the situations the characters have to work their way out of as a kingdom are far more interesting than the actual characters, dialogue, or anything else. Maybe that shouldn\'t be a surprise, given the long, clunky title ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom,"" which embraces the overly explanatory and very non-poetic naming strategy of Japanese light novel series that are now popularly adapted in the anime industry.The story begins simply enough. Elfrieden Kingdom is in decline and unable to pay what they owe to the, rather goofily named, Gran-Chaos Kingdom (What is this? Sonic the Hedgehog?). They use the hero summoning magic, whisking Kazuya Souma away from earth, hoping to use him as a bargaining chip; fortunately, Souma took a few humanities classes at college, so he\'s prepared to run a kingdom. The king with a mommy complex abdicates the throne, and his wife treats him like a widdle baby and cleans his ears all day. Souma takes over and is supremely competent compared to the king, and from this point on, most of the dialogue is puffing up Souma\'s ego and pleasantries about how grand everyone is. The remainder of dialogue is focused on strategizing and bureaucrat-speak.Souma corrects many of the kingdom\'s problems, restructures the economy, delves into agriculture, builds roads and a new port town, diversifies the food supply, and strategizes endlessly about how to please the people and maintain good relations with neighboring kingdoms. All of this is pretty good, if you\'re into that kind of thing, though I think I\'d prefer it to go even deeper and with more realism, but I will say that it does a fairly good job with these elements, and there aren\'t many anime series that are comparable. The second half of the series consists mostly of war, and the strategy involved is a lot more shallow and humdrum.Worst of all is the characters are one-dimensional thus far. Most of them disappear for multiple episodes and only pop up for plot points, and they don\'t have a whole lot to do. Maybe they will have more time to become less flat by the second season, but only Souma and the princess have much chemistry at all, and funny enough, the relationship, character design of the two characters, and overall story seem very similar to Amagi Brilliant Park--I haven\'t watched it myself, but the resemblance of these elements are undeniable, and it seems a lot was lifted from that series.Another aspect that is kind of tiresome is every single attractive female character seems to be destined to become part of Souma\'s harem, and they hint at it all the time in a not so subtle fashion (lest we forget). It makes sense that a role as high status as a king would receive a lot of attention from the ladies and could easily result in a harem, but like similar light novel series, such as Shield Hero, this is probably more so authorial (and audience) wish-fulfillment more than anything needed or well-incorporated. Don\'t get me wrong, I think series like Mushoku Tensei handle harem building better than what is seen here, so I\'m not opposed to it, but anime exploring this theme always confront it in a comedic/dumb/gaggy Tenchi Muyo-esque fashion.

It's insanely bland and it drags on and on as the result of it. I think the most important episode should have been moved into a much more relevant place then the finale.

Gokushufudou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43692/Gokushufudou,"['I normally don’t write reviews, but I am now because this anime is getting a lot of unnecessary hate.This anime has a clear vision on what it wants to accomplish, and accomplishes it. It’s a short and sweet comedy about a former legendary yakuza member who now works as a house-husband. It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and I had a great time watching it. The characters are simple yet memorable. The voice acting is phenomenal, and this is by far one of Tsuda Kenjiro’s best performances.Now, the elephant in the room - the animation in this show is minimal. Things only move when they have...to. Otherwise, they sit still like a manga panel. It may be a bit jarring at first - I was initially surprised and almost angry when I realized that this was what the anime was going to be as well. However, as I continued to watch it, I began to see that this wasn’t a big problem at all. In fact, I enjoyed the different direction they took, as it felt more lighthearted and charming. It just so happens that the simple animation style works just fine with a comedy anime like this, where most of the jokes are found in the dialogue. They still animated slapstick and action scenes like when Tatsu would do his thing with the kitchen knife or slap Masa in the face as well. Animation still exists when necessary.A lot of the people who hate on this anime seem to be people who just couldn’t get over the animation. I understand why one may be unable to get used to it, but just because you don’t like the animation doesn’t mean you should ignore everything else that makes this anime good. The anime also very closely follows its source material, and could seem just like a slideshow of colored manga panels. To that, I’d say: yes, it kind of is sometimes. However, the jokes are still delivered well, the voice acting is great, and overall it’s an enjoyable show that can be finished in just about an hour. I also personally thought that it would be great if people welcomed this style of animation, which would mean studios could possibly adapt more unique and “risky” stories into anime without needing to spend so much time and money, and possibly go on with fully animating it depending on the reception.I won’t be one of those people who just tell you to be grateful with what you got, because I’m personally against that kind of mindset. After all, I know a lot of Gokushufudou fans including myself were expecting a more traditional, fully animated show. However, whether you’ll choose to continue being angry and bash on the glorified slideshow or choose to give it a proper chance to find a genuinely wholesome and entertaining anime is up to you. to.

First of all the coloring of the anime was really good but the animation was so bad it is like a manga panel but the characters are being dragged out such as pretending it is moving.  The VA was really good and the acting of all characters in every situation is outstanding. Many situations are too confusing due to another character appears and not even knowing who the hell they are or any...clue about them. But pretty much it was so enjoyable that an adaptation with 5 ep with 16 mins i laugh straight from beginning to the end. Overall I gave this anime a 7/10. hope that they may fix the adaptation of any manga panel such as running and improve it. clue about them.

A short and sweet story about a terrifying yakuza subverting expectations with a short and sweet anime, and I honestly cannot wait for season 2.I am seeing several people complaining about the adaptation, but honestly, I found it perfectly fitting for the kind of story Gokushufudou wants to tell, and whitout Netflix, I and most everyone would have never even paid the manga any mind.This is...the same thing that happened with One Punch Man season 2, with picky fans upset they didn't get an all-star animation team to turn short gags into sakuga, and completely missing the fact that the heart and soul of the comedy remained not only intact, but stronger than ever.Yes, the animation is sparse and the visuals are nowhere as detailed as the source material, but the voice acting, soundtrack, and directing more than make up for it, doubling down on the hillarious writing and unique atmosphere Kosuke Ono so expertly crafted.Also, can we take a moment to appreciate the opening and ending tracks? They alone work wonders to elevate the material and set the mood for the antics to come. I cannot fathom consuming this story without them, and I pity those poor souls who have.Watch this if you are a man, and bring forth your inner house husband! the same thing that happened with One Punch Man season 2, with picky fans upset they didn't get an all-star animation team to turn short gags into sakuga, and completely missing the fact that the heart and soul of the comedy remained not only intact, but stronger than ever.Yes, the animation is sparse and the visuals are nowhere as detailed as the source material, but the voice acting, soundtrack, and directing more than make up for it, doubling down on the hillarious writing and unique atmosphere Kosuke Ono so expertly crafted.Also, can we take a moment to appreciate the opening and ending tracks?

It even made me ask the question of “does this count as anime?” Well, we’ll get into all of that with my review of Gokushufudou and if this adaptation of the amazing manga of the same name is worth your time or not.So Gokushufudou follows Tatsu. He’s an ex-yakuza that used to be feared as the “Immortal Dragon,” but now he is a humble and professional househusband. It shows you his day-to-day life as a househusband and his interactions with the people that know him as the Immortal Dragon, his wife, and other...people in his neighbourhood, or end up interacting with him. It’s a rather simple plot and can set up some good jokes. On it’s own here, it's a solid set-up for its jokes to work.The characters are all a strange cast of people. You have Tatsu, a man who’s a professional househusband and doing regular day to day activities while still looking and speaking like a yakuza, Miku who’s Tatsu’s wife and has a Policure obsession, but is also caring for Tatsu and is trying her best to do cooking and other things like that, and Masa who’s Tatsu’s sworn brother and is still following him because he believes that the way of the yakuza and the way of the househusband are opposite sides of the same coin. The only personality between the three most important characters is Tatsu. The other two have that simple explanation I wrote as their entire character and it’s not shown much beyond that. The interactions between these main three make up a good portion of the jokes.The animation was well, not exactly there. You know those teasers and trailers they make for promoting anime or just the manga itself? The ones where they photoshop the characters so that it’s just the characters, then throw words and sound over it so that it's just a video without much movement. Imagine that, but there’s no detail in the drawings and the lip flaps move this time. That’s the extent of the animation they have provided. It makes me wonder if this even classifies as anime. It has all of the elements of anime, except for the animation part and it’s just disappointing considering the jokes are good. The animation is the main thing taking away from the jokes too. It’s kind of so bad to look at that you’re distracted from the joke.The art style of the anime was also really bad. It’s like the production staff traced the manga, but only traced the thick lines and made it worse. The colours were also quite bland and were generally a single colour without any gradients or anything. In addition, the lighting was also just kinda bad.The soundtrack of Gokushufudou was rather generic. The music worked in places for it to work, but it’s often the same tracks and gets rather repetitive.The sound design in Gokushufudou was also depressing. It’s like stock sound effects placed over what’s happening.The voice acting was the saving grace of this entire show tbh. The voice acting was really good. It was super over-the-top and allowed for the over-the-top comedic scenarios to take as much of an effect as the animation and sound design allowed for.Overall, this anime was not a good adaptation of the source material or a good anime in general. The jokes are good by themselves and are heightened even further because of the voice acting, but the animation, soundtrack, and sound design took away a lot of the fun you’d have with the show because they were distractingly bad. people in his neighbourhood, or end up interacting with him.

There's nothing new or unexpected, and the jokes are still really funny.The problem with the series is the animation style. It's looks incredibly lazy, and gives the audience nothing new at all if they've read the manga. Even if you weren't a manga reader, it's pretty clear that this is a low effort adaptation. It seems like it was rushed, with no real attention to detail and incredibly simple movement, backgrounds and transitions.I'd also have appreciated...a better OP. It's boring and doesn't do anything to excite the viewer. I started skipping it after the second episode.Overall, like a lot of others, I'm just extremely disappointed. I wish the series had gone to a different studio or just hadn't been a Netflix original.

But the storyline is really funny, and the way that it\'s been presented as little ""shorts"" makes it enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes humor, and is okay with them focusing more on the characters, rather than the medium it\'s presented as. I found myself laughing at the unexpected but cute moments highlighted, especially because they could be seen as normal things that people working as househusbands/wives could face.Additionally, the fact that it is so short makes it...a lighthearted watch, easily something anyone could do after a really long / tiring day (which I\'m sure we all have, given these trying times). Please watch it before judging it! a lighthearted watch, easily something anyone could do after a really long / tiring day (which I\'m sure we all have, given these trying times).

It\'s fundamentally what makes watching an anime based on a manga so fun.Whoever at J.C. Staff decided that this ""slideshow"" or still-picture panning was the correct move deserves all the flak this anime is taking. The source material is funny, the characters interesting, and the overall story is fresh. They had everything to turn this into...a fun anime and butchered it.The only reason I give this anime a 3 overall is because of the voice actors. At the same time, the good voice acting makes it all the more painful that this anime is so poor when it shouldn\'t have been. a fun anime and butchered it.The only reason I give this anime a 3 overall is because of the voice actors.

Nothing too special but an engrossing series to say the least.  The main character is somewhat relatable and the supporting characters as well. One notable thing though is the animation which is at best, a 6/10, although the show is overall an 8/10 as I see it.It doesn't dive too deep into romance and action, it sticks to comedy, and that's what I appreciate in this series. The quirky unorthodox humor is strangely great, which had me shaking with laughter. "", 'Ok, first time reviewer here, so bear with me.Gokushufudou: The Way of the House Husband is a 5 episode animation based off of the manga of the same name. It\'s about an Ex-Yakuza member known as the ""Immortal Dragon"" due to his terrifying fighting prowess, having been known to wipe out multiple large groups of enemy gangs bare handed in one night. However he decides to give up the life of crime in order to be a full time househusband, and care for his wife Miku. That\'s it. Nothing more. Nothing less. However, i feel like people are trying to treat it as if it\'s...something more than that, as if it were an epic action manga that ""wasn\'t done justice"" by the animation, and i couldn\'t really disagree more. More on that later.As for the individual ratings:Story: 9It\'s a simple, cute, fun concept that you honestly can\'t really go wrong with on it\'s own.Sound: 7Intro and outro tracks were pretty good. (idk if this goes w/ sound or characters so apologies if I am wrong) The voice actors were great as well, with Kenjiro Tsuda acting as Tatsu\'s VA.Character: 10I love the idea behind Tatsu as a character. I think that the designs are executed well, and that the other characters do a good job of supporting his own character.Art: 5Look, I\'m not gonna sit here and act like it was animated well. It isn\'t great. To be fair I do think that it was colored very well. But, I don\'t feel that the animation needs to be absolutely insane to find enjoyment in the series. I think we should take a slightly different perspective on this. I believe that the animation quality was not a main focus. I think that they may have even lessened the animation quality purposefully in order to make it more akin to a motion manga than an anime, as well as highlight the story a bit more. While this is QUITE a stretch, I know, for me, it had that exact effect, which is part of the reason i would rate the enjoyment:Enjoyment: 10As I sat and watched all 5 episodes, I genuinely couldn\'t stop smiling. The jokes, the story, the characters all gave me the goofiest smile I had had in a few days.With all of this taken into close consideration, I rate Gokushufudou: The Way of the House Husband at an overall 8/10.

Every scene is nothing more than a glorified sequence of still images, killing any potential comedy from the manga. There are jokes, but they fall completely flat because of how they\'re presented; with flashes of a black screen like they forgot to check their work.

You can, and should, read Gokushufudou’s 25 adapted chapters in less than half the time it takes to watch this grift. Anime like this should not be made. Netflix is a multibillion-dollar corporation.

You\'d have to treat it like a motion-manga. Which is really unfortunate, because I would have loved to see Gokushufudou as a full fledged anime.Lingering grips about the animation aside, music and comedic timing still hit.Best part of this ""anime"" is the voice acting - hands down. Kenjirou...Tsuda is the first person I thought of when I was thinking of who could voice Tatsu, and he certainly shows why. Honestly, I was really here just to hear the lines voice acted. A real shame that the voices are so good, because I can only imagine what this ""anime"" could have been.In short, the voice acting is top tier and the animation is.. less than stellar.Had a fun time revisiting the content with the stellar voice acting, but you could get a better experience from the manga.

The characters in this show are entertaining, the sound is awesome, and I just love the story.

There's is no reason do a work like this, only 5 episodes and it's not animated. All the jokes kind looks missing something, it just can't hit same way a tradicional anime does.

I really loved how Tsudaken voiced The Immortal Tetsu, it really fitted the character himself, which is really expected.I'll only rate it overall 7 with an enjoyment rating of 8 (since I am following the manga), kinda expected the adaptation to have better animation quality, but I think it is okay with as it is. The sound and the art will be 7 though.

Well the main problem was by far the animation, art and effects (the main thing everyone\'s been talking about).The main problem was that not only the so-called animation was a legitimate slideshow, but how generally obnoxious it was. Remember in school when kids first discovered they could put transitions in their powerpoints and would always have annoyingly long ones? I wouldn\'t say this anime was the same as that, but it was the same type of annoyance. Along with the uncomfortable watching experience, we have irritating stock sound effects every time the glorified manga panel changes.Personally, I find sound very important in anime, but the excessive amount of transition noises started getting extremely agitating the more I watched. It felt a lot of the time the sound was interrupting the jokes and comedy which just lowered the enjoyment even more.  Some people may not mind, but all these factors created an unpleasant watch experience.Though I will say, I don\'t think Gokushufudou is as terrible as some people are making it out to be.Was it disappointing and quite dreadful to see from a manga fan like me? yes.

It really is on QueenBee level, which is a bummer considering this is a Netflix production.Still, I have to mention that this can be considered a stylistic choice.

I've never seen any story similar to it in any form of media so I had a great time watching...it. There were so many twists and turns in the show that I ended up in hospital with whiplash.I think the simplicity of the art is an interesting choice, whilst some more detailed animation would have been nice, the very simplified choice of art style and animation adds more to the story in my opinion. This is not a story of artistic talent, nor animation techniques, this is a simple story of how a complex man living in a complex world became a member of a more simpler, and easier way of living, that is the way of living as a househusband.The characters were all to be marvelled at, and all seem to compliment each other very well. They found a way to even give a cat as much characterisation as the main character. Sadly though, the cat was not voiced by Hideaki Anno, which I believe could have brought on an even larger audience, as everyone, young and old, enjoyed his voice acting as the cat in Fooly Cooly, truly the highlight of the show. Although this was a big missed opportunity, they still managed to pull it off.I find the jokes are great and the stories with the cat are definitely a highlight. I haven't read the manga so i can't compare the two, but if it's better than the show, I can't wait to read it.Another MASSIVE opportunity that was missed was not hiring Nicolas Cage as a voice actor for any character. I'm sure the studio asked him and he did say yes, but somewhere down the line, his letter of approval to say he'll take the role got lost in the mail or possibly his power cut out just before his email sent to the studio saying that he's been waiting for this opportunity his whole life. Either way, Nicolas Cage or Nicolas Cagen't, this glorious show was still a masterpiece.I wish there were not only 5 episodes of the show and hopefully the studio releases more eventually. This ex-yakuza concept definitely more stories to tell, and I'm sure they will be told in due time. If I could give the show an 11/10, I would. 10/10 is an understatement. it.

I\'m aware that a lot of people lament the lack of animation, but frankly, it\'s just sad to see it be repeated even nowadays. We\'ve seen this happen before with shows such as Inferno Cop, people simply value animation far too highly over actual substance. It\'s why to this day so many shows are rated with stellar reviews when their actual plot and characters are mediocre at best.Gokushufudou is an absolutely phenomenal show. It\'s a brilliant comedy that constantly sets itself up perfectly.

The premise was interesting. And I got hooked not through the manga or the trailer, but a live action made by the same VA as the Yakuza. It is quite cool!!Anyway, this was a good watch. I really liked it.My only gripe: The animation. The source material is good so the jokes are good. But an anime is not an anime without animation, and the first few episodes was just manga panels but with effects. As the season went on it got better though. I only marked this anime a 7/10 because of the animation....The jokes are there. The comedy is there.This one does not have a story. It is just a bunch of scenarios.

It’s just little snippets of this ex-yakuza man’s life as he tries to reform his life by doing menial tasks with maximum effort. He still holds the traditions of his old lifestyle and still has the mentality of a yakuza so it creates some fun circumstances as he does stuff like yoga or vacuuming. If he goes out shopping people are scared of him but he doesn’t notice. Things like that. It’s funny and I especially love it when he talks to other yakuza members and sees how they handle such menial tasks. It’s kind of wholesome...seeing these battle hardened men take cute dog photos or worry about which laundry detergent to buy. The sound effects and music is fantastic and adds to the comedy so much. Overall just a fun time. And for me that’s what’s holding this show back. With a premise like that it could be so much more than just a comedy. We don’t see much of his wife and I think that’s a shame. I want to know more about their relationship. How did they fall in love and how did she convince him to turn his life around? What is their relationship like romantically? I want to see their dynamic and I want to see him reflect on his past. Right now it just stands as a pretty good comedy but I want more out of it. I love seeing him interact with other Yakuza members because that’s a great time to explore the fucked up traditions of their mafia. It can still be a good comedy but it could also tell a fantastic story. One with social commentary and with heart. Hinamatsuri did a fantastic job with this concept. In the end of Hinamatsuri, Nitta is still a part of the yakuza but due to his relationship with Hina, he grows more human. Hinamatsuri is a show that humanizes the yakuza, comments on their ways, tells a heartwarming story and questions their characters morality all while maintaining its amazing humor. This show could’ve done that to an even greater extent but settles for one dimensional jokes. Yes it is funny and it’s not a bad show. But it’s bland and it could have been so much more.

Granted its the original and should be the funniest, but everything else is just so weak compared to it.I didn\'t know how they were going to do this, given the manga is told in very short stories that don\'t really run together. So I wasn\'t surprised that this was cut in short 3-4 min eps.What surprised me was how stiff the animation is. I understand this isn\'t a long series with a lot of material right now,...but jfc could you have given it some kind of life? The animation is ""eh ok"" in domestic scenes, but you put a chase scene in and its utter garbage. Like there is someone with a popsicle under their animation just making them go.The story is fine, it follows the manga fairly well imo. It just doesn\'t have the life the manga has. Its one of those anime that I won\'t recommend to anyone, but the manga is one of the top comedy manga I recommend to everyone.I wish they would have put more into this, feels super rushed. (The dub voice acting was good though.) but jfc could you have given it some kind of life? The animation is ""eh ok"" in domestic scenes, but you put a chase scene in and its utter garbage.

(The dub voice acting was good though.)', ""I started this show with absolutely no context and loved every minute of it.StoryPut two completely different genres together and BAM! Comedy gold, which is not easy to do! An original story told from a unique perspective. Household duties are serious business. And the main character Tatsu, is a serious guy. Of course he'd take it seriously, with his own (hilarious) spin on things based on his past. Although he encounters yakuza members on occasion, everyone else in his life treats him like a normal guy despite some of his harmless habits/misunderstandings, which I find absolutely hilarious.Art/AnimationThis is a short anime, with even shorter episodes....That does not mean quality was sacrificed, though. The important scenes are very detailed, and show up for longer. Transition scenes are less detailed, and disappear faster. How I see it is this: with the little amount of animation done, it seems the main goal of the show was to preserve its comedic timing. Which it does, very successfully. After finishing the show, I read a few chapters of the manga. The anime is very true to the manga, if not a literal paper-to-screen translation, with some animation. I understand that not everyone is happy with this, but the producers had a goal and this is what they decided to do. While it would have been nice for this to be fully animated, it gets the point across with what it has already. At least they weren't completely still images!SoundEvery time Tatsu talks, I laugh. His voice is super deep and serious. Makes it even funnier. Sound effects help with the comedy.CharacterWatching Tatsu creatively go through everyday struggles is a form of entertainment in itself. His way of doing things can be confusing to others, but in the end he's doing his best to live an honest life. You get hints of his past when he encounters certain people. I would have liked to see more on his relationship with his wife, though. Because how could this story even happen? But she's a busy lady.EnjoymentIf you need a casual, light-hearted watch, this is it. No commitment needed. You could finish it in one go.OverallA funny, wholesome show. Enjoyed it all the way. Happy to hear there's a second season. Would re-watch! That does not mean quality was sacrificed, though. The important scenes are very detailed, and show up for longer.

This is a fun gem to watch that you could turn off your brain and watch any episode, being that their episodic. I believe the aesthetic of Gokushufudou is the charm that it doesn't take itself seriously. Now when it comes to the animation I can understand why some people detest it. The still frame/power-point slide animation, I'm not fond of it either, but it works in this context. Do I wish it...had better animation? Of course.Tatsu is an ex-yakuza just enjoying every day life as a stay at home husband, and the particular situations he finds of himself with the mindset and behavior of his ex-yakuza life are what make this anime all the more hilarious to watch. I for one and really fond of the heart-warming and comical situations this so derides from and enjoy it all the more for it. had better animation?

But on the other hand, I just can’t bring myself to really say that I didn’t have any fun at all or that the anime didn’t make me curious in reading the original stories in the manga. But for now, I can give my own unbiased view on the show…The story of this anime feels just like a bunch of random situations that are cut together and sometimes do get referenced by later episodes. But...thankfully the situations are sometimes handled in such a over the top fashion that they do end up being pretty funny. Especially the jokes revolving around how different mundane situations are sometimes seen through the eyes of a yakuza are some of my favourites. But it does suffer from one fatal flaw…As some people already mentioned, the anime barely has animation. It feels more like manga panels, that are coloured and got voice acted over. with the only movement being the lips occasionally moving. And it just looks awful and only puts up the question, why doing an anime of it in the first place?(One thing I did find interesting is, it reminded me of Gokudoll, by the same director and studio, that also felt like just a bunch of coloured manga panels. But that show had at least good over the top reactions and its humor worked more with this type of…”not animation animation”)So yeah, the show definitely suffers from the lack of animation. But I would lie, if I say that it didn’t manage to make me laugh a couple of times. So yeah, fans of the manga will be really disappointed by this.

The same guys should be burning this anime for it´s barely to non existing animations. So feel free to criticize this anime for it cause it deserves it. I really still don´t...get it why a high rated anime studio produced such a crap. I´m used to much more greatness than this one from J.C. Staff. Who knows what their reasons were and who cares. It wouldn´t change a thing about it´s currently condition.This anime feels like an slideshow or an one man fanmade project than an officially manga adaption from an prestigious anime studio like J.C.

It was a lil drag to watch it to the end despites it´s short length.

Great concept. Just an inherently funny juxtaposition. Yakuza guy turned househusband, perfect, great.It's just not animated. The voice acting is all fine, the concept is great, but at the end of the day this barely passes for an anime and that's just really sad. A complete waste of everyone's time and talent. You still might laugh at a handful of jokes, because the source material is...inherently pretty funny, but it's just not....drawn.There's a trend in anime in general to cut corners with CGI or cheap animation when it comes to more difficult scenes, and while I do sympathize with the need to save money and time for often crunched production schedules, there's a very important aspect of all of this that seems to be forgotten. The reason people watch anime - cartoons in general - is to watch animation. That's the core of the medium, the art of animation. There's a reason why Nichijou is so fondly remembered, it's why something like Asobi Asobase is so funny. Animation alone can carry a show.When you make a whole show that is these weird stilted flash animations, it feels cheap and it feels like you're just moving a 2D paper doll. It kills a lot of jokes that rely on character movement or slapstick because its just not that funny to watch a flash animation in 2021.In the future, if your budget does not allow you to make full out hand drawn episodes, make them shorter and put the time and money in to the animation itself.

And in this case, it's not really their fault. The producer and mangaka basically asked for them to do this, and they did it, and it's not very interesting to watch.

It looks like a powerpoint where they try to animate a frame every 4-5 seconds. Ever seen those scenes in anime where they save money by having...a still frame and just move the mouths?

Fine being the keyword. Not good, not great, not bad either.

It was one of the few that stood out to me that day and the single standout that remained in my line of vision. Shortly thereafter I heard an anime was coming out, and then that there was already a live-action adaption that was praised. I told myself I’d return...to the manga someday but that I’d also watch the anime as soon as it came out.Netflix owned the rights to the show and I had high hopes for it.

This meant that we were going to get what we received and whatever we watch will be gone in a snap.Other ONA shows like Saiki K. and Aggretsuko were original broken up in shorts that were somewhere either a minute to a few each episode but when Netflix got a hold of them they banded those minute long episodes into a traditional, expected episodic length. Househusband didn’t have the luxury of providing 100 episode where each were just a minute long that could all be spread out into evenly typical lengthened episodes. It’s a shame because the source material is genuinely pretty great and what the anime offers isn’t that bad. It was just dealt a short hand, bricked with too few content.The animation gets the most flack for it feeling too half-assed, low budget, short cutting compared to mostly any other comedy (or just any other show) out there. Rather than an adaptation of its own suit, the anime is perhaps a bit too faithful. Scenes are not rife with movement. There lacks dynamism with each cut. There lacks an intriguing shot composition that animation is capable of enhancing. We are more or less receiving the manga, just with color, sound, minimal animation being done, and the privilege of not actually having to read it yourself (if you don’t count the dialog). Putting it that way seems like a win, right? Well, except it doesn’t, because again, the show lacks its own identity by way of failing to make use of the tools the medium gives.It’s still a fun show, and despite the criticism, I actually do not mind the animation style. Because that’s what it is: a style. A decision that was made by the director to make the most of the manga’s already rich material. It still works.

Would highly recommend the manga over this, as it's basically the same thing but you have more material to go through in the manga (as I'm gonna guess the show doesn't fully catch up to the manga in...it's 5 episode span). it's 5 episode span)."", ""I haven't read the manga yet but this show is amazing, the animation might not be for everyone but i feel like i'm walking from page to page with the animation style and i love it. The voice acting is quite good in the english dub and fit all the characters so well, the music and sound effects are perfect and make me feel like a retired yakuza just being a dork, i smiled like an idiot watching how the characters interect with the main character.Overall i'd like to say animation doesn't make an anime, the atmosphere does. It seems like a lot of people...dislike the anime because of its animation style... i'll just say this.... the manga creator liked this animation style so i approve as well. Come on! How can you not like watching a manga that reads itself with voice acting!

But it is not everyone\'s cup of tea. If you expect a traditional anime with a plot and straightforward storyline - well this is not the right one for you.The show is about an ex-yakuza who lives now as a househusband. In every episode, there are several stories from his daily life. But the stories are more like snapshots of some fun cliche misunderstanding or mixup of his old life and his new life and his way to ""beat the cliche"". It is more like a stand-up comedy than a typical anime....I think that the show is meant for people of working age because they can understand the humor and recognize the light sarcasm in it.That been said I enjoyed the show very much and would recommend it to everyone who wants something fun and relaxing after a stressful workday.

The concept is great and the main character is very likeable.

They basically used manga panels and moved them slightly to act as if they are ‘moving’.  It just does not look fluid.Art: 6/10I like the style.  It’s nothing too special, but I have a small inkling of enjoyment somehow.  While the animation is bad, I do think that the art style slightly ups the ‘nice’ factor.  The colors just mesh really good and it looks nice if you just pause it.Story: 6/10Nothing too special, again....Characters: 5/10There are multiple characters who are introduced, and we have no idea who they were previously, making it feel like they were written in at a short notice.

I understand that everyone\'s disappointed and even furious at the animation ""being just a slideshow"" or whatever, but that\'s 100% Netflix\'s fault (or at least Netflix outside of Japan) for advertising this as a fully animated adaptation instead of the motion comic that it is and that it was advertised as in Japanese. Motion comics are NOT fully animated. They are one-for-one panels of the original comic/manga with animated parts and sound/voice acting.With that being said, here\'s my review.STORY - 8I\'ve...only seen bits and pieces of the manga (I do plan on reading it eventually, though), so, from an anime-only perspective, I can say that I do really like it. There isn\'t a whole lot of overarching plot, just short ""stories.""

Overall, not bad though. After the first few minutes of episode 1, I wasn\'t even phased by the stills anymore.SOUND - 9Since there isn\'t as much animation, they have to rely on sound a lot, and I think they did a great job. The voice acting is fun, the background music adds to the silly nature of the show , and the sound effects are well done too.CHARACTER - 9I just love \'em. Not much else to it.ENJOYMENT - 8Like I said before, I quickly got over the fact that this is a motion comic within the first episode. The voice acting and the comedy carried me through the animation (or lack thereof) and made watching this show a very enjoyable experience.OVERALL - 7Had it been fully animated, I would have probably rated this a little higher, maybe not, who knows?

I mean the whole point of an anime adaptation is to give the same story in a different and more ANIMATED way than the manga.I also thought some characters were just really underdeveloped, like the wife Miku.

Why is SHE the person he loves, there\'s really no romance between the two, they act more like friends or siblings. I was hoping for some reasoning for the character\'s actions but we get none of that in the anime, which to me was worse than the animation.BUT on a positive note, the shows pretty charmingly funny, as a Canadian I often don\'t love comedy shows set in japan as comedy is so culturally tied, and I don\'t get all the jokes. But here the jokes were pretty universal and it was funny to watch the silly scenes and they were pretty lighthearted which I enjoyed.As well the English VA isn\'t too bad although I would recommend the Japanese ver.The show was really short, I watched it in the morning and it felt like it ended abruptly like there was no planned ending...Overall, if you like shows like Dragon maid, Nichijou, Lucky star, etc then this would probably be enjoyable. It has a lot of wasted potential but that doesn\'t make it bad, it just doesn\'t make it amazing.

Tatsu, a former yakuza boss, is followed as he attempts to adjust to life as a househusband after retiring from a life of crime.The animation is average, with simple character designs and a colour palette that matches the series' lighthearted tone. The soundtrack is also average, with a cheerful score that adds to the series' comedic atmosphere.The characters are well-developed, with distinct personalities and quirks that distinguish them. Tatsu is a particularly strong character, navigating the difficulties of housework while also dealing with his...past.The plot is consistently amusing, with a mix of action sequences and comedic skits that keep you entertained from beginning to end.

The Manga looks pretty good and is well designed. But the Anime on the other hand is so poorly animated, I cant even explain. Every episode seems to include just barely enought frames to call it anime. Its like watching a manga, and every panel is one frame. Sometimes they just show one panel and voiceover this one panel with several phrases. Its really bad. I really like most of the characters and I love the Protagonist.

The story isnt interesting at all and most of the jokes just arent as funny as in the Manga. And as I said the Animation is Dreadful.

However most jokes still deliver really well and Gokushufudou is likely to get some laughs out of you.It feels like there was potential for a great watch here, but the sparse use of animations and overall short run time kills a lot of what could have...been.Maybe it would be more appropriate to call this a high budget manga ad, than a low budget anime adaption.

Which is an odd choice for an anime adaptation, and made people even more concerned.Now it is out, and I could form my own opinion:At the worst of times, it\'s a drab motion manga.At the best of times, it\'s in the realm of ""Cromartie Highschool"", which also works with limited animation, different screen ratios and panels on screen.Overall, it could...be worse, it\'s still presentable and I laughed a lot. The manga is one of my absolute favourites, and I hope this will give the original work more exposure and mainstream focus.But there is no denying that most of the weight is pulled by the voice acting, writing and comedic timing alone. Big kudos to all the voice actors, especially Kenjirou Tsuda, he was BORN for this role. If the animation was on par now, and this was a full length series, I think this could have been an absolutely stellar anime and an alltime classic.

Gokushufudo, aka Way of the Househusband is a show that I feel like would work better if it was just a short that was released weekly on Youtube or something. Almost all of the comedy in this show is basically ""Oh no, Tatsu looks like he\'s doing gangster stuff but he is actually doing normal things"" and this frequency of comedy can be nauseating especially since each episode is made up of many shorter episodes. Don\'t get it twisted tho, when i say almost, i mean almost. I think the funnier...parts of the show for me is just the more relatable parts of the show that involving Tatsu, watching his crazy ass face as he does Yoga and go shopping for his wife. Also some really absurd moments, and the weird faces on all the characters.Those parts kinda got to me. I liked how people like Tatsu and others are just trying to be normal despite their history with the Yakuza, kinda like a sweet and sour scenario. It does have some charm. Also, this anime needs to have a cookbook made because the food in the show looked gorgeous.On the technical aspect, the show\'s budget is super low but in an intentional way. It acts less like an anime and more like an animated manga. Because the only thing that constantly moves is the character\'s mouths and nothing else. I kinda didn\'t mind that and i feel like at some points the show used that aspect to their advantage. One thing , i do really mind is the over the top and loud ass Jojo sound effects to make the comedy more funny. I understand that loud sounds can make things funnier, but when the sounds are so ridiculously loud that sound like sound effects from Fate Babylon, thats a bit overkill. What\'s even weirder is that the show is only five episodes, and the length for those episodes aren\'t even 20 minutes, like i said before I feel like the show could ve reached its full potential if it wasn\'t Netflix.

It's basically a polished animatic. You know, the step in pre-production before you actually get to animating?That's all I'm gonna say about the the visual aspect.

I personally love what Netflix did with most of their anime: Devilman was a treat, Beastars and Aggretsuko gave me some of the best character studies, and Castlevania, even though it is an anime inspired cartoon, pulled most of my heartstrings and made my jaw drop with their top tier animation.Of course, Gokushufudou is none...of these shows, it is just a slice-of-life comedy, with the ridiculousness that can be compared with Nichijou’s.What really makes this series stand out from the rest of the comedy slice-of-life anime is the atypical  delivery of the jokes and the ridiculous situations that are somehow grounded and close to reality. The line between what is realistic and what is fantastic becomes really blurry somewhere at the middle of the story of the episode, and in this is the true charm of the series.The anime has 6-7 stories per episode, each one approximately 3 minutes, which is kind of enough, considering each chapter was 17-18 pages and the action is really fast paced.Now, about the animation, which seems to be the biggest downside of this series. The series was perfectly done for the manga format. I sincerely could not imagine how the manga could have been translated into anime so it would have not become a generic comedy anime. I also think because of this the studio went to the safe option so they decided to keep the manga format. The animation is MINIMAL. Cromartie High School level of minimal.

Yes, it is lazy, yes, it could have muuuuuuch better, but it was ok, because most of the jokes still delivered, the voice acting was top notch, and the soundtrack gave the energy the story needed.You can say the producers just left a the animation to the imagination.In conclusion, if you are a fan of the manga, you can give it a shot. It is just 5 episodes long, it is a good chuckle.

There are a lot of static frames with zoom-ins and outs that depend a lot on the drawing and the acting and both of them are great, specially Tsuda Kenjirou whom you might recognize his voice from other popular shows like Ogata in Golden Kamuy or Manji from Mugen no Junnin, he has a lot to offer as a retired Yakuza, both as a menacing character and as a comedic character, he is simply incredible.Although each episode consists...of three to two chapters and they have an auto conclusive nature, watching two episodes in a sequence was somewhat tiring, even when the episodes are only 17 min long. I believe that Gokushufudou works better as a 5 minute short anime because watching so many episodes in tandem could reveal its formula and get the feeling that the jokes are pretty similar or have a similar structure.Other than that I had a good time with Gokushufudou, it is filled with fun and well-designed characters interacting with the most mundane but ridiculous situations, so even when it isn’t the most fun show you’ll ever watch it certainly will make you chuckle here and there. of three to two chapters and they have an auto conclusive nature, watching two episodes in a sequence was somewhat tiring, even when the episodes are only 17 min long.

The jokes are well delivered and the final result is a short, cute comedy that you can watch in just one sitting.The main problem with the anime adaptation of Gokushufudou seems to be the...animation itself. Although it\'s true that at first it doesn\'t look too good, you\'ll soon get used to the ""coloured manga panel"" style. Maybe it isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea, but it is worth giving it a chance.

Well,...I went ahead and watched the 5 episodes, and let me tell you this: it was a waste of time. And coming from someone who will use any justification necessary to procrastinate on work - even when it’s done by watching the most nonsensical anime - that is saying a LOT. Anyway, this very short review of mine is based on that frustration.One of the main reasons a manga-reader would watch an anime adaptation is to see the characters ‘come to life' - and with Gokushufudou, there was so much potential. I’d say it’s kind of embarrassing that, to me, the manga seemed livelier - funnier, more expressive, punch-y, and yeah more ‘alive’ - than this… half-assed excuse for an anime adaptation. The only welcome differences were the good voice acting and the sound.It’s understandable if someone who hasn’t read the manga and/or doesn’t care about the low qual attempt at adapting it in this low-grade moving animation thing watches this and likes it.

I...think the anime doesn't really show the whole romantic side of the relationship which it's not like a big deal, but I feel they could have emphasized it more because I just think it's cuter but you know that emphasized the other things that I think are pretty good too. I just think it was a little bit rushed in under processed it's a word we could use for it. Overall I think it's a really good anime and it kept me engaged I haven't watched the last episode yet but I'm pretty sure I'll feel how I felt the other ones it's a good anime I recommend to watch but it's not like it's going to blow you out of the park or anything. Again read the Manga or watch the live-action though because those are both really good and are like a 8 out of 10 or a 9 out of 10 in the enjoyment scale. Happy watching, see you in the next review. think the anime doesn't really show the whole romantic side of the relationship which it's not like a big deal, but I feel they could have emphasized it more because I just think it's cuter but you know that emphasized the other things that I think are pretty good too.

I never heard about it but since a friend of mine talked about it, I saw the trailer and I was curious. So, I was really excited for this to come out. However, this disappointed me so much.First off, the format is weird. Throughout the episode we get ""mini-episodes"" that are just things that happen in Tatsu\'s everyday life and kinda ruins how fluid the show is for me. I don\'t mind not having a proper story, but at least make the episodic type of anime watchable.Second point is the fact that...the episodes are short. They could\'ve done this in a better way that would make the show more fluid and more engaging as well. I would rather watch without any ""pauses"" between each mini-episode and have 30 minute episodes than watching this format. It annoys me so much.Third point: the animation. What is this? It really feels like a joke to me. I know there\'s some people that think this type of animation suits the story better, but I don\'t think so. It just bored me so much and made everything so tedious.It\'s a shame because some of the episodes have funny parts in them and I really like the art as well, but the animation and the format just ruins it to me. the episodes are short.
