Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor: New OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1289/Kidou_Keisatsu_Patlabor__New_OVA,"['So, what to know about Patlabor is that it is a very atypical show. It is labeled as a mecha show but you won\'t get much action, it\'s rather a comedic ""slice-of-life"" thing, more of a chronicle of a bunch of cops. It\'s episodes go into diverse genres but the main interest is still to see how it\'s cast of ""wacky"" characters functions. But you won\'t get ultra complex or ""deep"" character development, or any troubled past. The show focuses on the very humain dimension of it\'s characters, and each episode is a new occasion to discover a new side of them. What it lost...from Oshii\'s cerebral long and time-consuming monologues, it gains in subtlety and humanity, and it is reinforced by the animation. If it is compared to the first ""Early Days"" OAV series or the movie as being inferior, it would be unfair to ignore that a lot of care is put on the character expressions : they are not as exagerated as the previous OAVs, it went for something more low-key.This second OAV series is an extension of the 47 episodes TV series, and should be watched after it. In the TV series, a lot more focus were put into the mecha, there were (a few) more action scenes ; more plotline about the development of new models of Labors, and about the SV2\'s missions with their Labors. All these plot elements were concluded in the last episode, without anything spectacular but still satisfying. Of course if you expect Patlabor to be a heavy political/action show, you will be disappointed. From the begining, the Patalabor animated series was about policemen being blocked in the godforesaken hole of Tokyo, wainting for some mission that ended up to be ""arresting drunk guy that seized a Labor to do something stupid"". The TV series already exploited that to the end, so here you\'ll get Patlabor mostly without mechas. The more this OVA series progresses, the less there is mecha action. The writers just wrapped up quickly the action arc known as ""Griffon arc"", still leaving some unresolved elements (a way to say that, even after the end of the series, the SV2 will continue their job and there will still have criminals to arrest) to go for the core of Patlabor : the bunch of various young misfits that compose the Special Vehicules Unit 2. It will go from completely comedic episodes (I found them hilarious), then, when you expect it the least, BANG! A serious episode about some members of the squad that gets awesomely intimist. Yeah, because Patlabor gets very intimistic when it wants, getting really into the character\'s life and all. But even in simple comedic episodes, there is still a way to show the character\'s personnallity, they always stays appealing despite their flaws. Those guys are average guys, which is rare in japanesse animation! They don\'t suddenly have specific abilities, what they can do comes from past experiences. If one is good with computer, it\'s because he was in informatics beforehand, for example, and never any of their character traits feels exagerated or forced, even when it is used for comedy. This is what makes them seem more humain.This was the writers last show before the end, so they ensured to have fun, but they never forgot to let their characters shine. Some of them doesn\'t feel like they were exploited enough and that\'s a shame, but they still had at least one moment during the whole series, whether it would be during the TV part or this part. It has it\'s flaws of course, but I can\'t put the finger on it, beside the fact that I felt a lot more could have being done. But at one point, it has to end. After that, the Patabor franchise would ""end"" on Patlabor 2, which didn\'t gave enough time to show a glipse of the charactes some years laters... Well, in an another continuity (the third movie being a spin-off, and even taking place before the second movie, can\'t count as an ""end""). This extension of the TV series is a goodbye, to those idiots working more efficiently than they seem, sometimes immature, sometimes desctructive, but full of wisdom and courage. Personnally, I\'ll miss them. from Oshii\'s cerebral long and time-consuming monologues, it gains in subtlety and humanity, and it is reinforced by the animation.

Patlabor OVA 2 re-affirms what Patlabor TV and the original OVA established, Patlabor can do anything and it will work. And no, I wasn't kidding, you will find all of that and more here despite the short episode count.As with previous Patlabor works, the strength of this OVA is mainly in how the characters are so enjoyable, the bizarre and often surreal direction of Mamoru Oshii, and the wonderful OST by Kenji Kawai. If you have seen...and enjoyed anything Patlabor related, it is likely you will enjoy this. However, it should be noted that this OVA is particularly ridiculous even for Patlabor standards. Aside from the first half that deals with more Schaft attacks, this is mostly pure comedy and weirdness. The series has never really sold itself on loads of mecha action, but for better or for worse, there is almost none here. The OVA is still rather enjoyable regardless though, and makes for a solid view after completing the TV series.Oshii's very deliberate and slow direction is in full effect. The comedy is reminiscent of his 1989 comedy OVA Gosenzosama Banbanzai, but perhaps not quite that level of full blown surrealism and absurdity. As previously mentioned, much of the enjoyment can come from how well developed the cast is. So it isn't a very good idea to watch this unless you are already rather familiar with Patlabor through the previous works. That isn't to say you can't enjoy this if you are not, but you will get more out of it if you already know the characters and have become attached to them. Much of the humor is derived from the awkward situations they are placed in and must deal with, and that will be lost if the viewer is not familiar with their personalities and the tone of the series. I would go as far to say that this was pretty much made to be a direct extension of the TV series, and it does in fact deal with specific events from it that will require prior knowledge to understand.Production values aren't as high as they are with Early Days and the movies, but they are right up to par with the TV series. Kawai's music is as awesome and fitting as ever. I love how much he utilizes bass and that shines through here left and right. It's not his best work ever, but it's still great. The artwork isn't as impressive as it is in Early Days and the movies, but it's right up there with the TV series. So, sadly there doesn't seem to have been a budget increase despite it being an OVA, but it still looks great for the most part. The mechs always look incredible, but you don't see them much here.Overall, definitely worth a watch if you are into Patlabor. Not the strongest entry of the series, but it delivers, especially if you are into weird Oshii works. The bulk of the episodes rely on off the wall humor and out there stuff, so if that sounds like your cup of tea you should enjoy it. Once the Schaft episodes are over it is pretty much a free for all of bizarre occurrences the Division 2 team members are forced to deal with, most of them ranging from fantastical to eerie or impossible. I would have liked to see something more in line with the movies and with more Labor action, but I can't say I was really displeased either, and I would watch it again. It gets bonus points for the Red Spectacles reference. and enjoyed anything Patlabor related, it is likely you will enjoy this.

This reason alone, if having seen the TV series, will be enough to justify watching New Files. However, the rest of the OVA series is random episodes in true Patlabor fashion as it follows the division 2 team on various adventures, work related or not. That is what makes up Patlabor The New Files.Director Oshi (previous Patlabor)...creates a slow paced environment and well developed characters to invent any situation imaginable ranging from getting lost in the sewer system, fighting in a bath house, or even to getting hammered (drunk) on vacation.When it came to the animation, nothing is new here. Unlike the TV series and the original OVA, New Files does not do anything to impress. It is still good, but the music is lacking along with almost zero action. This really is just another OVA series to give the viewer more of the team and their hijinks they get into. After those four initial episodes, the series falls flat in wanting more Patlabor action.Patlabor New Files is a fun watch if having already watched the previous iterations, and just want more. Otherwise, this is the weakest of the anime series, but still remains pretty enjoyable at the same time. creates a slow paced environment and well developed characters to invent any situation imaginable ranging from getting lost in the sewer system, fighting in a bath house, or even to getting hammered (drunk) on vacation.When it came to the animation, nothing is new here.

It would be the most important arc that this animated series has had. However, the rest of the episodes are simply isolated chapters that were removed from the main series as a sort of innocent fanservice. So this part is like a gift for fans that wanted to continue their lives, somehow. There's practically no more mecha action with Alphonse or any other Ingrams so don't be dissapointed...for this. for this.""]"
Mahou Sensei Negima!: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6050/Mahou_Sensei_Negima__Mou_Hitotsu_no_Sekai,"[""Esta review también está en español.This is the second series of OVAs that faithfully adapts the Mahou Sensei Negima manga, and picks up exactly where Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba (STAA) left. These OVAs (and it predecessor) are targeted only to the public who read the manga (it's not enough just watching any of the first anime series), so If you didn't, you will not understand what's happening here.Story: Ala Alba (plus Anya) arrives to Wales, and, after visiting Negi's sister (cousin actually), they head straight to the door that leads to the magical world, where the plan is to get as much info as possible...about Nagi Sprienfield.Unfortunately, once in Mundus Magicus, everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong: not only five students outside the group ended in the magic world, but, in that exact moment, the magical gate receives a terrorist attack led by Fate Averruncus (one of the villains of the Kyoto saga) and his evil minions. The result: Negi and company end up being sent to different parts of Mundus Magicus. This is when Negi's priority changes from getting info to find where the hell his students are, and return them to Japan safe. Although the task doesn't look easy, Ala Alba's badges have trackers that Chachamaru (the only member that ended in the same place as Negi) is able to locate, so there is hope. Besides searching and searching, Negi will enroll in a fighting tournament (with the winning prize he can release a few of his students), while trying to control Magia Erebea, a dark art able to increase power in a very significant way.The same way STAA meant Kotaro Inugami's debut, these OVAs bring us, once and for all, the almighty Jack Rakan. Despite not having much screen time, he manages to demonstrate his insanely powers and amazing craziness. Just for this, it worth the watch.Animation: Top notch, like the first part. With lot of detail and fluidity, this time we actually got various battles where the animation shines. And it couldn't be otherwise, people like Fate, Tsukiyomi, Kagetaro, Rakan and Evangeline demand great graphics ;).And just as there's more action (which means, more magic, explosions, special effects -or CG, like the characters would say- and blood), there is more fan service than in the first part. It bordering hentai a few times... but classy, though.Sound: The seiyuus of the first set of OVAs (and the first and second anime), are here, doing an excellent job again. Among the new voices, Rakan’s voice, Rikiya Koyama (Yamato in Naruto Shippuden, the second voice of Kogoro Mouri in Detective Conan) stands. As for the music, Love Drive is a song in the same line of Happy Material, that means is catchy and upbeat, with a very soft and pleasant entonation (by 3-A girls). The ending, Get Chance! is interpreted by Negi, Kotaro, Chisame, Eva, Chamo and Rakan voices, and also sounds good.Verdict: Like STAA, these OVAs are the best Negima things animated. This time, it animates a bigger number of events, and finally, finally, we have predominant action. Fights vs. Cosmo Entelecheia, Kagetaro and Eva were exactly what we needed, so once and for all Negima could be seen as a shonen with harem elements, and not the other way (at least in the anime territory, the manga proved this a long time ago). The bad point is that the jumps between chapters can be very large. Example: at the end of an episode, we had Negi and Kotaro training. At the beginning of the next episode, they already won 15 fights in the tournament, and were asking for Yuna and Makie to search for them! Just like that. This occurs several times (with boards that try to explain what happened), and it's annoying, because it omits some interesting parts. But hey, you are supposed to know what’s happening in these OVA, so is not that big of a deal. And don't let the opening fool you: half of the images you'll see won't be adapted (which is heartbreaking... if you pay attention you'll know why).In short, this is not recommended for fans of the Negima manga, this is mandatory. Hell, if you know someone who read the manga and didn't watch this OVAs, laugh and mock him (or show them that these chapters exist. I leave it to your discretion).... And if for some reason you read this review without having read the manga, I strongly recommend you to read it. It's one of the best mangas going around right now.--------Esta es la segunda tanda de OVAs que adapta fielmente el manga Mahou Sensei Negima y retoma exactamente donde dejo Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba (STAA). Estas OVAs (al igual que las anteriores) están apuntadas solo al público que leyó el manga, así que asumo que las personas leyendo esto lo hicieron.Historia: Ala Alba (mas Anya) arriba a Gales y, después de visitar a la hermana (prima, en realidad) de Negi, se dirigen directamente a la puerta que los conducirá al mundo mágico, donde la idea es conseguir información sobre Nagi Springfield. Desafortunadamente, una vez en Mundus Magicus, todo lo que podría haber salido mal, salió mal: no solo cinco alumnas ajenas al grupo terminaron entrando, si no que, justo en ese preciso momento, el portal recibe un ataque terrorista por parte de Fate Averruncus (uno de los malos de la saga de Kyoto) y sus secuaces. El resultado de esto: Negi y compañía terminan siendo enviados a distintos puntos de Mundus Magicus. Es entonces cuando las prioridades de Negi cambian de lleno a reunir nuevamente a sus alumnas, y devolverlas sanas a Japón. A pesar de que la tarea no pinta fácil, las insignias de Ala Alba poseen rastreadores que Chachamaru (la única que termino en el mismo lugar que Negi) es capaz de localizar, por lo que no todo está perdido. Además de buscar y buscar, Negi terminara inscribiéndose en un torneo de combate (con el premio podría comprar la libertad de varias de sus alumnas), al tiempo que intentara controlar la Magia Erebea, un arte oscuro capaz de aumentar su capacidad de forma considerable.De la misma forma que STAA significo el debut de Kotaro Inugami, estas OVAs nos traen, de una vez y por todas, a Jack Rakan. A pesar de no tener mucho tiempo, se las ingenia para demostrar su poder demencial y su locura inherente. Solo por el vale la pena ver esto.Animación: de primer nivel, igual que en la primera parte. Con mucho detalle y gran fluidez, en esta ocasión si hay varias batallas donde la animación brilla. Y no podía ser de otra forma, porque personajes como Kagetaro, Fate, Tsukiyomi, Rakan y Evangeline exigen los gráficos al máximo ;).Y de la misma forma que hay mas acción (lo que significa más magia, explosiones, efectos especiales y sangre), hay mas fan service, bordeando por momentos el hentai... pero con clase, eso sí.Sonido: Las seiyuus de la primera tanda de OVAs (y de los primeros animes) están presentes, haciendo un excelente trabajo nuevamente.

Y el ending, Get a Chance!, lo interpretan las voces de Negi, Kotaro, Chisame, Eva, Chamo y Rakan, y también suena bien.Veredicto: Al igual que STAA, estas OVAs son lo mejor que hay animado de Negima. En esta ocasión, se anima una cantidad de sucesos todavía más grande que antes, y por fin, por fin, tenemos acción de forma predominante. Peleas como las de Cosmo Entelecheia, Kagetaro y Eva son lo que hacía falta, para que de una vez por todas Negima pueda consolidarse como un shonen con elementos de harem, y no al revés (al menos en el terreno animado, en el manga lo había demostrado desde hacía bastante). El punto negro es que los saltos que pega entre capitulo y capitulo pueden ser muy grande. Ejemplo: al final de un capitulo tenemos a Negi y a Kotaro entrenando, y al principio del otro ya habían ganado 15 peleas en el torneo, y le piden a Yuna y a Makie que los busquen!. Así, de golpe. Esto ocurre varias veces (con las pizarras que intentan explicar que fue lo que paso), y es molesto, porque omiten partes interesantes. Pero bueno, se supone que el que está viendo sabe que es lo que pasa, así que no es muy grave. Y que el opening no los engañe: la mitad de las imágenes que ven no van a ser adaptadas (lo que es una puñalada al corazón, si prestan atención sabrán porque).En resumen: esto no es recomendable para los fans del manga de Negima, esto es obligatorio. Es más, si saben de alguien que valla al día con el manga y no vio estas OVAs, señálenlo y búrlense de el (o indíquenle que estos capítulos existen. Lo dejo a su criterio).Y no olviden ver el especial de Yue, que es lo último adaptado a la animación.... y si por alguna razón leyeron esta review sin haber leído el manga, recomiendo vehementemente que lo lean.

Es más, si saben de alguien que valla al día con el manga y no vio estas OVAs, señálenlo y búrlense de el (o indíquenle que estos capítulos existen. Lo dejo a su criterio).Y no olviden ver el especial de Yue, que es lo último adaptado a la animación.... y si por alguna razón leyeron esta review sin haber leído el manga, recomiendo vehementemente que lo lean. Es de lo mejor que hay dando vueltas en estos momentos.""]"
Minami-ke Okaeri,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5162/Minami-ke_Okaeri,"[""Since the 2nd season of  Minami-ke was a let down, this third season, Minami-ke Okaeri, was expected to bring back the enjoyment experienced from the 1st season. Good news is that it's really improved. The OP and ED is back to being good, and the show is now much more fun and interesting with the increased comedy and the cute developments. The character designs and animation has been modified again.  According to some news I read before Okaeri came out, the producers tried to bring it close to the look of the 1st season and I'm glad to say that it didn't turn...out badly. They also used the idea of strategically positioning the OP and ED in each episode, which is something I look for in anime, but I expect very creative and effective blending when producers try to do that, and it turns out as a so-so blending. Further going negative, the improvements were not enough to filter out all the bad things from the 2nd season. Some episodes were a bit boring, or maybe really boring but still, they have really good material in most of the episodes which greatly makes-up for it. You'll be expected to laugh here, very much on some parts, so it's a MUST WATCH specially for Minami fans. out badly.

As such, Minami-Ke: Okaeri sticks very strict to it’s layed back story formula. If you have seen the earlier two versions of this series, you will find pretty much the same kind of pacing and humor, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The jokes between the various characters are all present, however...it seems to be missing the charm that the first two seasons brought to the table. Being that this is the third installment in the series, I was really hoping that at least some of the character relations and/or friendships would have come to some kind of closure or resolve. Sadly however there really is little to none here. Many of the ""Kana vs. Chiaki"" scenes that were made staples are sadly missing, as is many gags from Hosaka and Makoto (however, what they do have by them is indeed funny). And really that has been what the series has always been about; comedy! There are some pretty clever bits in this version, many of which can be quite hilarious. Now that doesn’t mean you get all giggles, because there are some hit and miss episodes, or ones where it starts off very funny, then starts to come down a bit (and vis a versa). One thing that I have always praised about the Minami-Ke series for, was how the show never relies on one sol character to keep the storyline funny, and once again it delivers on that regards nicely, and each character adds their own humor as only they can do! So aside from some hit and miss episodes with the humor, it still remains an enjoyable title for the ""slice of life/comedy"" fans out there.Art: 6/10I still to this day don’t know why they had to change the artwork from the first season. I realize that it has since been done by a different studio, but even still, the earlier version seemed to work well enough for it! Well they ended up tweaking it again, and gone is the creepy looking faces the characters would get when they were annoyed and the like. The eyes have been made a little bit smaller, and the characters seem to look a bit more mature. The backgrounds were pretty washed out, and didn’t really eave much of an impression. It was really hard to adapt to at first, but I found myself getting use to it by episode 4. The art isn’t anything bad really, it just seemed so unnecessary to change it in the first place.Sound: 8/10All of the background music from the series has followed along nicely throughout all the seasons, all with a little bit of tweaks here and there, it still remains quite down to earth and relaxing, with many soothing instrumental pieces. The voice cast has all returned to fill their roles for all the characters, and once again pull it off very well. The opening and ending songs are much more lively when compared to the original Minami-Ke soundtrack, and are quite catchy with their happy upbeat sounds! A nice soundtrack for the ears!Characters: 8/10The characters (along with their comedy antics) have always been a staple to the series, and once again it delivers. I found the character chemistry between some of the various cast members to be a bit more planned out for this version. We get some funny and tender moments between Chiaki and Kana! Hosaka and Makoto, while not seen as often as in the last seasons, are still as funny as they ever were. We also get some humor from characters either not usually funny, or even shown that much. Such as Riko and Touma. Heck even Fujioka has plenty of good humor to give! I was happy that the characters remained as fun to watch as ever!Enjoyment: 7/10I really did enjoy what the third season had to offer, the comedy and character interactions were overall very fitting to the Minami-Ke franchise. However, due to the fact that the comedy also wasn\'t quite as funny as the last 2 seasons, I enjoyed this one a little bit less than the previous. Still, what it does have to offer is still very good!Overall: 7/10The anime seems to be keeping a solid pace for the franchise. I don’t think the series has been quite as good as it had been back with ""DAUME, "" but I still feel that fans of the show should indeed check this one out as well. The comedy is still there, the characters are still as charming as ever, and hey--it is more Minami-Ke! it seems to be missing the charm that the first two seasons brought to the table.

However, it is still early in the series, so it could get better!Overall (5/10)"", ""Minami-ke:Its basically a slice of life, comedy anime. Very chill.General Plot/Story:There is no overall plot or goal. No plot arcs. Just shows how 3 sisters live together in their apartment, go to school and have fun with their friends. Strictly episodic. In fact, each episode is kinda segmented too; dealing with a specific story. Story-wise its similar to Azumanga Diaoh. The only difference is that in Minami-ke, the minamis interact as a family whereas in AD its all about friends. Never felt the story dragged.Slice-of-life-ness:The slice-of-life part is done very well. Like very, very well. You know how many animes have the typical 'school...opening part' --> 'kareesames (Christmas) party' --> 'sports fest' --> 'field trip' --> 'emotional part (love confession etc)'. Well minami-ke doesn't do that. It does something a bit different. To me, i felt like, instead of understanding the characters based on their reactions to events, we get to know characters by their direct interaction with each other.The comedy:The comedy is quite subtle mostly. There is less of the ridiculous-looking, exaggerated faces expressing emotion. Less of the screaming, silly poses. Basically its less slapstick in nature. It adds to the slice-of-life effect.Characters:In my opinion, they were very well performed. There were a few surprises here and there which didn't make them seem robotic. Personalities are easily distinguishable without falling into common stereotypical types. So its not like we have a dumbass, a smartass, a disgusting ass (?), the well-endowed ass, the handsome ass, the mature ass, the average ass....u get my point, right?The variety of characters was also pleasantly surprising. The 3 minami sisters complement each other very well without developing a strict, rigid, 2D personality each.Soundtrack:Slow, soothing, matches anime genre. OP songs are awesome! My fav were 1st and 3rd. Note: 2nd season OP is supposed to be a parody of the serious slice-of-life types. Many ppl didn't understand tht and started hating on it.Overall:Very chill anime, nothing too exciting. Gives off an easy going feeling. Excellent for those who hate cliffhangers. Non-stereotypical characters. Main characters have some personality depth and are not like robots. Comedy is subtle and the not in-your-face kind.p.s= kana is boss :P lookout for the famous, pink t-shirt xD opening part' --> 'kareesames (Christmas) party' --> 'sports fest' --> 'field trip' --> 'emotional part (love confession etc)'.

However, since they didn\'t do a whole lot of changes, I won\'t have a very long review like I did with the last two.Right off the bat, they appear to have embraced the art style of the better season again! However, they unfortunately kept the redesigned characters of the second, so they all now just appear as though it were season one again. Even the backgrounds look more cheerful and colorful as they did in season one! Truly, this is a faithful new season in every good way.My only complaint with this new...season is that we had to keep those new designs, despite them even going on about how this season was to be faithful to the first. However, it\'s certainly more cheerful and colorful than the second and I enjoy it a lot. However, had it done a few things differently, it would have competed pretty well with the first season.The good side with it merging with the two season is that it kept that Kana and Chiaki bond where they were starting to get along better and they did it really well. They took every good element from both seasons and basically made a really fresh season, which is something I have NEVER seen an anime do before; going back to an older art style. It is quite interesting.So the question you are all waiting for: do I recommend THIS season? YES. It is a significant improvement and any Minami-ke fan will love it. If you loved the first season, you will enjoy this a lot as it is the true ""second"" season of Minami-ke in my book and you should not miss it. I even recommend the OVA as well, as it still retains the style of this season.Funnily enough, they actually tried changing the hair lines briefly in one PART of an episode where they had the classic across the hair, akin to season one; mixed with the new way they do lines. Then after that segment ended, they went BACK to the original art style they implemented. It was quite hilarious and occurs at some point, so look forward to it. season is that we had to keep those new designs, despite them even going on about how this season was to be faithful to the first.

There are many times of extreme laughter, as well as times when tears will fall. The storyline was pretty well-written and the characters were unique. Overall, I could only give it a 9/10 because many episodes were boring fillers (don't get me wrong, some fillers were actually pretty funny).Story: 9/10The story is a 9 because I've never seen one like it before.

However, some characters are drawn poorly or they look unnatural so the final score is a 9.Sound: 9/10The sound for this anime was great. There was pretty good music overall and the character's voices matched the character's personality. The quality was not bad and the music was all very original, however the music could get a little repetitive at times.Character: 9/10As stated before, all the characters are unique and have special personalities. I think that they are all funny and a key part to the anime. There was definitely a lot of thought put into each individual character. Some are a little annoying or unnecessary, though.Enjoyment: 8/10Unfortunately, I could only give an 8 for my overall enjoyment because the fillers became very boring and tiring to watch. They were unnecessary sometimes and very repetitive. The action-packed episodes were great though, and some fillers were making me laugh out loud, literally.Overall: 9/10For the above reasons, I gave this anime an overall rating of 9/10.

However, some characters are drawn poorly or they look unnatural so the final score is a 9.Sound: 9/10The sound for this anime was great. There was pretty good music overall and the character's voices matched the character's personality. The quality was not bad and the music was all very original, however the music could get a little repetitive at times.Character: 9/10As stated before, all the characters are unique and have special personalities. I think that they are all funny and a key part to the anime. There was definitely a lot of thought put into each individual character. Some are a little annoying or unnecessary, though.Enjoyment: 8/10Unfortunately, I could only give an 8 for my overall enjoyment because the fillers became very boring and tiring to watch. They were unnecessary sometimes and very repetitive. The action-packed episodes were great though, and some fillers were making me laugh out loud, literally.Overall: 9/10For the above reasons, I gave this anime an overall rating of 9/10. It was a very special anime to me and the ending was pretty exciting. The only part I really don't like is the ending that just leaves you hanging. Even so, I enjoyed this very much and I'm glad I decided to watch it."", 'This simply does not work well as an anime like it does as a manga. The only part that does work is Gash being cute due to the greatly innocent/cute voice. A big culprit in this is the slow pacing of everything - all the dramatic cries, the pacing of any fight, the way people move - which really takes the impact out of the comedy, the fighting, and the drama. It especially hurts the fighting, in which everyone always seems to have an incredibly long time to finish the opponent off, yet strangely never does so. They also cut off the entire last arc...from the manga, and change the previous to last significantly at the point Gash and Zeon meet, mostly by cutting out details, so it leaves you short of a lot of important plot.Maybe a specific scene to point to as a difference would help my explanation: in the manga, there is a page where Gash is cutely wandering to find what to play with,  has a close up :O moment, then it zooms out to him with a traffic cone; he has that on, then repeats the :O frame, then zooms out to a samurai headdress; finally, it is all repeated again with a dog as the newfound object. In the manga, the stopping gives it a firm, comedic pace, and everything just piles up as this cute and funny moment. In the anime, the execution is clumsy and I basically did not even notice the moment at all.The art is pretty much atrocious, and while it is not like I expected anything incredible, since the manga\'s art is below average as well, it hurts the anime more than the manga by making it feel much more like a kid\'s product. I am sure part of the consideration has to be budgetary/time, but there are soooo many still shots.Gash\'s voice acting is great, Kiyomaro\'s is average, and everyone else\'s is pretty much bad or hard to notice in a major role. Demons have fun voices sometimes though, like Umagon/Schneider and Victoreem. The music never does a good job, outside of the goofy songs, of doing anything particularly good or bad...just incredibly average. The goofy songs are pretty well executed, like Tetsu no Folgore is pretty typically funny, not annoying. The opening and introduction songs seemed to be a lot higher quality at the start of the series, but that might just be personal taste. The departure of Gash\'s normal, better voice actor for maternity leave is not really the series\' fault, so I am not holding that against it!There are changes to the plot and bonus stories. I think the bonus stories were a better idea than not, since what other reason do you have to keep watching a series this long (although I would advocate not watching it all the way...I really enjoyed it through about fifty episodes, but I was really bored the rest of the way)? I think some of the changes (especially the ending to shorten the story) weakened the story...matters were not really hashed out well toward the end.The manga is not perfect itself, but I think that it makes more sense, has a better pacing, and that the art is a lot more compelling to look at. The drama is less grating, what with the endless FRIENDSSSSSSSS! stuff going on, the fights are more cohesive, and you get the full plot, not the version which prematurely ends.However, saying all that, since it is a touching and extremely fun manga, it is fun to see it in animation, and it is fun to see Gash and Umagon especially in motion with good voice acting!(I know my ratings are ""higher"" than 4, but it is not like I suddenly hate the story or characters...so the art, sound, and enjoyment are more applicable here, at least to me). from the manga, and change the previous to last significantly at the point Gash and Zeon meet, mostly by cutting out details, so it leaves you short of a lot of important plot.Maybe a specific scene to point to as a difference would help my explanation: in the manga, there is a page where Gash is cutely wandering to find what to play with,  has a close up :O moment, then it zooms out to him with a traffic cone; he has that on, then repeats the :O frame, then zooms out to a samurai headdress; finally, it is all repeated again with a dog as the newfound object.

Moyashimon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3001/Moyashimon,"['If you\'re like me in that you tend to look for those quirky, odd, and oft times underrated anime, then rejoice, for Moyashimon: Tales of Agriculture may be right up your street.The original manga, created by Ishikawa Masayuki, began serialisation in Kodansha\'s Evening magazine in 2004, and in 2008 it won the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Grand Prize as well as Kodansha\'s General Manga Award. The anime adaptation, directed by Yuichiro Yano (Mujin Wakusei Survive, Patapata Hikousen no Bouken), and produced by Telekom Animation Film and Shirogumi Inc, was released in October 2007.The story takes place at an agricultural university in Tokyo (something which I\'d never...heard of before, and I was surprised to find that it does actually exist), and centres around a first year student named Sawaki Souemon Tadayasu, who is attending the university along with his childhood friend Yuuki Kei. Sawaki, who is from a family of tane-kōji-ya (mold-starters, or yeast producers), isn\'t really interested in attending university, and has simply tagged along with Kei (who\'s family runs a sake brewery, and are long time customers of the Sawaki family).They are taken under the wing of the highly eccentric professor Itsuki Keizo, and old friend of Sawaki\'s grandfather, and are given a crash course in fermentation on their first day (you\'ll understand when you watch the first episode).Now, one would expect this to be a normal comedy, however Moyashimon has one big difference - Sawaki can see and interact with microbes, germs, viruses and bacteria, and all without the use of equipment of any sort. Only a few people know of his ability and, as far as anyone is aware, he is the only person in the world with it.Cue the shenanigans.The character designs are very good in this show. Each character is very clearly an individual, however the real stars of the show are the microbes themselves. Their design was pure genius as they are both cute and funny at the same time (especially with their big cheesy grins). The backgrounds are nicely detailed, with the university environs having a strangely authentic feel to them. The animation throughout the series is very smooth, and the usage of CG, especially for the microbes, is almost seamlessly tied in with the normal animation.One thing I did like about the style of the show was that it wasn\'t afraid to go for the overly dramatic in certain scenes, and this actually enhances the comedic moments which often follow.Sound is another good area for this series. The effects are well used, and serve to enhance the various scenes. The thematic music is nice and quirky, and is often highly reflective of the fact that this show isn\'t really meant to be taken seriously. The OP, ""Curriculum"" by Ifu Sarasa, is an extremely catchy pop song, and I never get tired of watching the video that goes with it as it is extremely well choreographed. The ED, ""Rocket"" by Polysics, is just as good, just as catchy, and very well choregraphed too.The voice actors are very well chosen for their respective roles. Sakaguchi Daisuke does extremely well in the role of Sawaki, and manages to bring a certain long-suffering, and slightly bored quality to the character. The other seiyuu are also just as good, but then the cast for this show is extremely talented in the first place having worked in shows as diverse as Aria, Genshiken, .HACK//, Negima, Baccano! and Bamboo Blade. Almost every member of the cast has had a leading role in a popular series, and even the Aspergillus Oryzae are voiced by Touma Yumi (who plays Urd in Ah! Megami-sama).The characters are very good throughout the series. Sawaki is fairly used to disbelief at the start of the show, so it comes as a shock to him that other people are not only aware of his ability, but also accept it. A good portion of the show sees him being dragged along by events and other people, and while at first he seems like he has no backbone, one should remember that he finds it very difficult to trust people, and so tends to take the easier option of just going along for the ride. Kei has his own, more fundamental, problem to deal with, and as the show progresses Kei seems to fade out as a character (although once the reason for his problem becomes clear, then it all begins to make sense).The most memorable characters though, are definitely the eccentric and mysterious Itsuki Keizo, and the microbes themselves (who have their own quirks and prejudices too).Each of the characters is portrayed in a very realistic manner, and I found it ironic that many of the traits they displayed were as familiar to me as my own hand - as they may be to anyone else who has attended university, lived in a dorm, or had dealings with a professor who seems more than a little off-the-wall. .This is very much a comedy show aimed at a more mature audience, and I enjoyed it immensely. Younger viewers may not like much of the more subtle humour or the quasi-educational stance the show sometimes takes, although these are often amusing in their own way. This hopefully won\'t dissuade anyone from watching the show as, aside from the whole deal with Sawaki seeing microbes, this is one of the most realistic university based comedies I\'ve seen, and at times harks back to the classic Animal House.Moyashimon is a hugely underrated show for many reasons, but for those of you want something lighthearted, funny (in a sometimes surreal and nauseous way - you\'ll understand if you watch the show), and a little more ""real"" than the norm, then you should give this a try.However I would advise hypochondriacs and people who are obsessive about cleanliness to steer clear :) heard of before, and I was surprised to find that it does actually exist), and centres around a first year student named Sawaki Souemon Tadayasu, who is attending the university along with his childhood friend Yuuki Kei. Sawaki, who is from a family of tane-kōji-ya (mold-starters, or yeast producers), isn\'t really interested in attending university, and has simply tagged along with Kei (who\'s family runs a sake brewery, and are long time customers of the Sawaki family).They are taken under the wing of the highly eccentric professor Itsuki Keizo, and old friend of Sawaki\'s grandfather, and are given a crash course in fermentation on their first day (you\'ll understand when you watch the first episode).Now, one would expect this to be a normal comedy, however Moyashimon has one big difference - Sawaki can see and interact with microbes, germs, viruses and bacteria, and all without the use of equipment of any sort. Only a few people know of his ability and, as far as anyone is aware, he is the only person in the world with it.Cue the shenanigans.The character designs are very good in this show. Each character is very clearly an individual, however the real stars of the show are the microbes themselves. Their design was pure genius as they are both cute and funny at the same time (especially with their big cheesy grins). The backgrounds are nicely detailed, with the university environs having a strangely authentic feel to them. The animation throughout the series is very smooth, and the usage of CG, especially for the microbes, is almost seamlessly tied in with the normal animation.One thing I did like about the style of the show was that it wasn\'t afraid to go for the overly dramatic in certain scenes, and this actually enhances the comedic moments which often follow.Sound is another good area for this series. The effects are well used, and serve to enhance the various scenes. The thematic music is nice and quirky, and is often highly reflective of the fact that this show isn\'t really meant to be taken seriously. The OP, ""Curriculum"" by Ifu Sarasa, is an extremely catchy pop song, and I never get tired of watching the video that goes with it as it is extremely well choreographed. The ED, ""Rocket"" by Polysics, is just as good, just as catchy, and very well choregraphed too.The voice actors are very well chosen for their respective roles. Sakaguchi Daisuke does extremely well in the role of Sawaki, and manages to bring a certain long-suffering, and slightly bored quality to the character. The other seiyuu are also just as good, but then the cast for this show is extremely talented in the first place having worked in shows as diverse as Aria, Genshiken, .HACK//, Negima, Baccano! and Bamboo Blade. Almost every member of the cast has had a leading role in a popular series, and even the Aspergillus Oryzae are voiced by Touma Yumi (who plays Urd in Ah!

A highly original concept and a very strong cast of characters ultimately let down by a poor plot and a crushing lack of urgency.  It does get major plus points for having the balls to do something different, especially considering the anime environment at the time, rich in shonen action and school life shows.There is no denying Moyashimon is a highly original concept, the story follows Tadayasu Sawaki who has the ability to see microbes with the naked eye, as he enrolls at an agricultural university.  One of the...key theme of the storyline is manipulation as many of the characters only take interest in him because of his ability.  Unfortunately this promising concept is let down by a shoddy plot, that is paced terribly.  Over a quarter of the series is taken up by the Spring Festival arc that does next to nothing to progress the story.

This is shown best by the character designs, some characters lkike Sawaki and Harsegawa would fit into any realistic anime whilst others, Itsuki, Kawahama and Misato in particular are hard to even take seriously, the fact Moiyashimon is a comedy is no excuse for such extremities in character design.

After stumbling upon this show with the funny-looking creatures headlining it, I thought it was a poorly done children's show or something. Even reading the synopsis didn't help improve my hastily conjured prejudgment of the series. But, after watching it, I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised.Moyashimon had an interesting premise. At first glance, you may think it as a run-of-the-mill school slice-of-life anime, or worse, a poorly done microbiology lesson packed into an 11-episode series. To tell the truth, there were times when the show could have gone all the way to either direction, but I'm...sure glad it didn't. There wasn't any over-arching plot to it at all--just a group of friends living their college lives; with the clincher that one of them has a very unique ability. Many were complaining about that ''plotless-ness'' approach it had to its very enticing concept but frankly, that was the great thing about the show. Shows like Moyashimon don't really need an over-arching plot to tell their tales. Moyashimon is already strong enough to stand on its own, without the need for convoluted, cliche-stricken, and conspiracy-laced fiction. The show's story is robust in its simplicity. And, a dark and brooding feel would effectively ruin the show.Art-wise, the show could hold its own against its counterparts. It had good enough animation, fine settings, and lovely character designs. While everything else about it wasn't exactly things to write home about, the series' character designs were gorgeous. Especially the ladies. They all looked good. Even if they were based on the original manga's designs, they made their transition to anime very, very smoothly. I, for one, can't just stop myself from pausing for a few seconds just to take in the beauty of Hasegawa, Oikawa, and Mutou(Man, I wish they were real ;_;). Also, the different microbe designs were fun to look at as soon as you get used to them. They're very quirky and unique and I was pleasantly surprised that their appearances were based on real microbes; not just something pulled out of the artist's rear end.Sound-wise, there isn't really anything to write about, except for the awfully catchy OP and ED songs. The OP was full of energy and it suited the brilliant live-action sequence very well. It was just so full of life and spirit that it almost betrays the fact that the show itself was slow-paced. Meanwhile, the ED was equally vibrant, and with its unique sound, you could find yourself listening to it nonstop without realizing it.Moyashimon's characters were good as well. They filled their roles well and did their jobs for a comedic slice-of-life anime. Sure, they weren't completely fleshed out and only two or three were somewhat developed, but their quirks and funny antics more than made up for that lack of development. The whole dynamic among the two upperclassmen and Hasegawa for example, showed how funny a show about microbiology can be. Plus, there were hints of a pseudo-romance that were pulled off well without being overbearing. Some of them were very surprising--you'll know when you watch it--that could have been pulled out of the moon or something, but nevertheless entertaining. Moments of character fanservice were done tastefully--not showing too much nor too little--but they were still awfully hot and weren't out of character, unlike the gratuitous fanservice other shows throw around.The series, despite being seemingly grounded on microbiology, doesn't turn into a giant snorefest by drowning you in terms only PhD students can understand. It' safe to say that it's really not about science, but how the characters blend in with each other and how microbiology is just a device used to bind them all together in a tightly packed can of comedic slice-of-life. If you want to watch it for the scientific technobabble, this show is not for you. Character interaction is the show's strong point and ultimately the best reason for anyone to watch it.

The character designs could almost be called generic, but this is one of those rare cases where color choices make all the difference. The colors are toned down, almost a bit dirty-looking--perfect for an anime set at an agriculture university--but the character designs are still very easy on the eyes. Other than that, the animation is consistently fine, holding together when it needs to be serious and reserving its shortcuts for the sillier moments when they can be used well. Then there are the microbe designs, which...are kept simple, cute and marketable. It doesn\'t look great, but there\'s an earthy charm to it, and that\'s nice to see.Rather than the usual bouncy music I normally associate with slice-of-life, Moyashimon\'s soundtrack is a little more eclectic. It can get a little repetitive, but between the few pieces they have to work with I think it manages to span the show\'s various tones and scenarios quite well, ranging from folksy-sounding traditional Japanese music to a more modern-sounding triumphant anthem. College is a time for experiencing variety, and I think that\'s what they were going for. I have no complaints.When it comes to voice acting, the lack of an English dub means Japanese is your only option. Voice work and delivery are, of course, paramount in any comedy worth its frames, and that goes double if it\'s in a language you don\'t speak. Thankfully, the seiyuu cast here can belt out their lines with hilarious conviction. Of particular note are Tomomichi Nishimura, whose take on Dr. Itsuki is always a joy to listen to, and the talented Daisuke Sakaguchi, whose natural snark makes Sawaki\'s character a lot more fun.I cited this show back in my Tatami Galaxy review as one of the few anime that addresses college life, and if nothing else it\'s laudable for that (as a quick aside I\'ll mention that Moyashimon, Honey & Clover and The Tatami Galaxy were all noitaminA shows, make of that what you will). This series is quieter, humbler and simpler than its younger cousin, but it still gives a well fleshed-out look at college life and the plethora of experiences that come with it. Like The Tatami Galaxy, Moyashimon downplays the academic side of college to focus more on the element of self-discovery, and it makes for a nice breath of fresh air without coming across as escapist fluff.First and foremost, Moyashimon is a comedy. A few of the jokes in this show are a little too understated to have any punch, but for the most part the humor walks a fine line between down-to-earth near-believability and glorious bombast that makes it a delight. The art style is simple enough that it works well for their visual gags, the setting is distinctive enough to set up some scenarios you\'ve never seen in an anime before, and the characters are fun and genuine enough that they\'re easy to get behind even and especially when they\'re being complete buffoons. Dr. Itsuki in particular takes his passion for biological sciences to delightful extremes, and the cartoonish microbes themselves can take simple science lessons and make them a helluva lot more fun.Speaking of science lessons, the chemistry and biology in this show are well-researched, as are the elements of farming and business, so if you happen to enjoy getting a little trivia out of your entertainment they\'re a tasty treat on the side. If that doesn\'t interest you it might be a bit much to sit through, but they\'re generally kept brief, simple and funny. Even if you don\'t understand all the science and business talk, it shouldn\'t make the show as a whole any harder to follow.If there\'s one thing that really elevates Moyashimon, though, it\'s the characters. Dr. Itsuki isn\'t just a fun guy to watch, he\'s also a surprisingly insightful mentor and the guidance he gives his students may turn out to be more helpful than they realize. An upperclassman named Mutou is still recovering from a breakup when that relationship had more or less defined her direction in life. Kawahama and Misato, a duo of upperclassmen who initially seem like comic relief buffons only interested in money and sake, end up showing a surprising level of maturity and supporting Sawaki when he needs it most, and Sawaki\'s best friend Kei goes through an arc I dare not spoil; suffice it to say it\'s an issue rarely touched upon by anime. If there\'s one recurring theme throughout Moyashimon, it\'s that you need to find your own path and determine your own future, and college is the perfect time to discover just what that future might be, and Dr. Itsuki\'s assistant Haruka Hasegawa stands out as a particularly poignant example of this, though again I won\'t spoil why.Sawaki himself is a bit of a missed opportunity, unfortunately. There are hints at the beginning of the series that he used to really love seeing the microbes, and they bring that ""forgotten passion"" aspect of his character back for a heartwarming season finale while also raising the question of whether he has any worth outside his ability to see microbes, but between episode 2 and episode 11 what you see is mostly him being the straight man to all the weirdness that goes on around him. Does that make him unlikable? No, he\'s still a perfectly pleasant human being, if a bit weak-willed and easy to string along. I just don\'t think he should\'ve been the straight man, that role exists primarily to play off of others and Sawaki could\'ve been a much more fascinating character all on his own. There were still some nice little moments here and there, so I can\'t be too mad about it.I\'ll quickly mention that second season of the show does exist, and while I don\'t consider it to be as good as the first season it is still more of a good thing, same great characters and all, so if you enjoy the first season, I shouldn\'t have to tell you to give the second a chance. I may end up giving that season its own review eventually, though I can\'t say when. I do hope that if there\'s ever a third season it\'ll set things back on the right track. The source material is still ongoing, so it\'s definitely possible.Moyashimon is simple but effective look at college as a time to learn about yourself and find direction in life.

There is nothing wrong with that moreover it makes us to see the microscopic organism in the different way and Moyashimon showing what microscopic organism are and how useful they are in our everyday life. In this anime, you’re not just watching for entertainment but also learning about microscopic organism in the...fun way.Moyashimon story began when Sawaki and his childhood friend Yuuki Kei goes into agricultural university, he is not just an ordinary student, he is somehow can see the microscopic organism with his own eyes. With his unique skill, he joined with the eccentric Professor Itsuki Keizo to research more about microscopic organism such as germ, bacteria and other creatures.The story in this anime is really light-hearted and simple to follow, there is no overdramatizing or complicated matters that would make us scratch our head. The problem that occurs in this anime is usually what we’re always find in our real life (aside from Sawaki special skill) like how to deal with our friends, having fun in campus, etc. The comedy in this anime is good since its so subtle, they didn’t exaggerate and push the viewers to laugh. The comedy in this anime is enough to make us chuckles or at least smile when watching it. Anyway, they represent this story in slow pace and the way how this anime connects each scene to another scenes is really intriguing encourage us to watch more and more.Another aspects that we should consider aside the entertainment side is the education part. Like I said before, this anime also make us learning about microscopic organism. In every episodes, after the ending song they make a short animation where all the chibi organism like bacteria  interacts with each other and telling us what contribution that they make in our life. This is quite fun to watch since the chibi is really adorable and the voice is also cute and pleasant to hear. I bet the education system would be more better if they use this style.The art in this anime is quite top notch for anime that airing in 2007. Great detailed background, good settings, nice coloring, lovely character design and the CG are mixing well with the background though they just using the CG for the microbes. The transition between each scenes is also very  smooth. They really put the efforts for this section and you can really see it.If there is a reason why this anime great aside from the learning side, it’s the characters. The character designs are very well made, they all were gorgeous especially the girls  though its basically based on the original manga. However, the winner of this character designs is of course the microbe. They successfully makes something “disgusting” like bacteria turning into an adorable chibi creature. Its cheesy grins is really suitable with the microbe since the microbe in this anime portrayed as happy and energetic creature. Moreover, the microbe is usually shown in CG which makes third times more cuter. You just cant be helped to love this one.Sawaki, our protagonist is pretty much shown as slugger and always accepting what happens with him in this case being dragged by the people and events surround him. As the only people who can see the microbe with his naked eyes, he seems really doesn’t mind  and act like it was nothing due the past that many people disbelief with his unique skill. The other main characters, Yuuki Rei is shown to be as a nice guy and as to be told have feminime side.  As the son’s sake brewery owner, he is quite harsh if its about sake.  Though as the show progresses Kei began to fade out as main character due some “inner” problem that occurs to him.The other characters that really noticeable is of course Professor Itsuki, He is shown as the old guy  who have  infatuation with the microbes. Aside from his unique personality , he is also an insightful mentor and professor who doesn’t mind to help his student if they need a help. Last, Haruka. Haruka is Professor Itsuki’s assistant. She tends to use sexy outfit which pretty much looks like sadistic woman, the outfit itself really represent Haruka personality which shown as hot-headed and violent girls however later in the series, she is also a tsundere.Last, the sound. From the music, they have Sarasa Ifu for their opening with her song “Curriculum”. This song is quite catchy pop songs, her lovely cute voice and song is really suitable with the anime since the song is quirky and sounds fun which represent the anime itself. Aside from the music, there isn’t any problem with the voice actors. They really done well with their own respective roles especially Tomomochi Nishimura (Professor Itsuki), his voice is really suitable with Professor Itsuki, he really brings out the Itsuki personality.Moyashimon is surely one of the anime that I really recommend if you want to watch a light-hearted comedy anime. Great story, amazing characters, lovely music what else can you expect  from this series? Somehow I just don’t get it why this anime is so underrated, at least this anime need some more recognition. fun way.Moyashimon story began when Sawaki and his childhood friend Yuuki Kei goes into agricultural university, he is not just an ordinary student, he is somehow can see the microscopic organism with his own eyes.

I thought the concept was quirky and interesting. But now I\'m kind of wondering what my other reasons for finishing the show were other than \'it\'s only eleven episodes.\'The animation varies. It looks great in some places, okay in others, bad in some.The sound is good; the voice actors are talented and they do a good job while the background music was nothing special.Getting past the \'how is buying a super-special aphrodisiac, advertized as something will turn your intended target into a sex slave that will not be able to resist you,...any different than date rape?\'  question (no joke, the protagonist and a couple supporting characters actually pursue said aphrodisiacs for 2/11 episodes), the story is kind of all over the place. I enjoyed the bits on how it\'s like to go to an agricultural school and the science behind certain microbes and the process of fermentation. I just wish it focused on that... Instead we get this sort of runaround with supposed character development that never goes anywhere. What I learned from the last episode was that apparently I was supposed to be wondering about what the protagonist should do with his life instead of inherit the yeast business, which he never really raised an objection to in the previous episodes, so this internal conflict really felt shoehorned in, along with everything else. Usually character development hits you out of nowhere and then it ends which makes it feel like ""here, have this arbitrary excuse for us to tell you about this thing we forgot to mention early on."" These moments come to no real conclusion of epiphany so you end up just taking in this worthless info and moving on.  Something about all this worthless information made it hard to stomach when the show started to ask me to start caring or enjoy the fan service.But speaking about fan service, there\'s this elephant in the room I\'d like to address. Unfortunately I cannot talk about this without getting into .... spoilers (?) though one would assume you need a plot before you can spoil it. The protagonist gets kissed by his best friend (male) after he figures out the mysterious cute girl he\'s been seeing  around lately is said friend. I can\'t even fathom what the lead in to that moment was. I think I rewatched the part right before it about five times, and I still have no clue. Maybe it\'s my delicate North American sensibilities but, I usually don\'t kiss my best friends on the mouth as a joke, be them boy or girl. Usually I enjoy seeing guys or girls kiss; I won\'t deny that. But, then they never really address it, even though it\'s kind of important. Later on when one of the characters does comment on the guys kissing situation it\'s in homophobic rage, and the one who is going on that homophobic tangent is a girl who had a one-night-stand with another girl (she\'s not gay! It all the aphrodisiacs fault!). And all this is just one Big-lipped Alligator Moment stuffed inside another one.  It all left me kind of confused and pissed off at the same time. I was too busy trying to deal with these emotions to even enjoy any of it.So what I wanted was a quirky science show about life in an agricultural university ... what I got was How Not to Do Character Development the TV show.

It has a good grip on comedy but there\'s not enough of it going through the whole 11 episodes. There\'s some educational elements injected here and there but the lessons didn\'t attract my interest both in whatever they\'re teaching and the story itself. What did interest me is it\'s difference in whatever was being subbed at the time. Let\'s see, it\'s called ""Tales of Agriculture"". Yes. It sounded boring but it did pique my interest.The simplicity in both art and sound works for the anime for some odd reason. Almost everyone can...tell that they busted their budget on the OP which is the best thing going for this anime.The second best thing going for this anime is the lead character. The funny scenes usually involve him and something gross happening. The other characters are just there to fill up the screen so there\'s really nothing going for them.It isn\'t bad ""BAD"" but anyone can live without watching this unique piece of anime that seems to have lost its direction halfway through. However, if you\'re like me who has a tendency to lean towards the ""road less travelled"" then just try it out. It wouldn\'t kill you. tell that they busted their budget on the OP which is the best thing going for this anime.The second best thing going for this anime is the lead character.

However, if you\'re like me who has a tendency to lean towards the ""road less travelled"" then just try it out. It wouldn\'t kill you.', ""Rare ideas are few and far between. That sentence was redundant, and this one explaining it is supercilious. But at the same time, had I not said either, the concepts wouldn't have been introduced to your mind.Moyashimon works in a similar way. The idea behind the show is simple, innovative, and original. A first year university student is capable of seeing microbes and micro-organisms (even viruses), distinguishing them, and even picking them out. The art design of the microbes was cute, fun, and gay (I use that term under the classical definition), and the character that went along with the microbes was entertaining. The show...itself builds it's entire base around this idea, the characters themselves wouldn't even matter (aside form Itsuki), and this is probably Moyashimon's greatest flaw.See, there's no problem with the above statement, considering the focus of the show is on the microbes, it's alright to have a fairly generic cast, you don't mind it all that much. Beyond that, you have one or two main characters which dialogue can revolve around, and bring in amusing supporting characters like the microbe monster, or the two second years, and the show is pretty amusing, entertaining and enjoyable. Moyashimon however, failed to notice it's own setup, and was obliterated as a blast with a 10 mile radius was set off. It appears that the directors decided to plot bomb the series in the end to help finish the story in the short 11 episodes.Now, that too, I can appreciate. If you want to finish a story as it's meant to be told, if you want to report the appropriate ending as it's written in the manga (I haven't read the manga, I'm only going by the progression of the episodes, that we definitely missed some things in between), that's fine. But Moyashimon suffered from it. We weren't properly introduced to really develop empathy for the actual characters. The attention is on the microbes (though they say very little) and Sawaki, the boy with the gift. You can't just shove a bunch of problems in, completely unexplained by the storyline, and expect the viewer to empathize with their position, much less celebrate the resolution. To an outsider, it's just killing time.That being said, Moyashimon started out wonderfully. I eagerly awaited watching the next episode, I became endeared to the microbes and their personality, and the Kiviak in the first episode certainly left a lasting impression of Itsuki, and the experiences Sawaki and the others would experience in this university. The various educational experiences were friendly to an outsiders perspective, and one doesn't find themselves confused trying to follow what's going on. The show continued with much the same tenacity, and even when the reported plot bomb did go off (a seperate side-story for pretty much every character), the one important plot point (being Sawaki's and the microbes) keeps you interested and somewhat groan free. Beyond that, it leaves you satisfied and contented with the ending, and overall pleased with how you've spent your time.The soundtrack was poignant, the OP and ED were cute, the art style was great, especially considering the microbes, the story was palatable and the characters were generic but functional. Overall, you can enjoy this series for what it is, as what it is, is fairly enjoyable.See what I did there?

That's called going full-circle ;)"", ""In its everlasting quest to turn everything it possibly can into an anime of some sort Japan has now created a slice of life anime based around the ups and downs of a young man attending Tokyo's Agricultural University.Rating stories in slice of life animes are somewhat pointless, save rating the concept. The concept here is undoubtedly unique, I have yet to see, or even hear about another anime centered around agricultural shenanigans. The story basically comprises of Sawaki and his other first year friends attempting to fit into university, and meeting a delightful cast of characters along the way. There are small dashes...of pseudo-romance, but the main focus is comedy.On comedy, this show performs. It is absolutely hilarious, although somewhat mature at times, being subtle at points. If I were to have to put it into a category, it would be mature-slapstick. Slapstick with actual intelligence behind it. There are also inserts of educational information littered throughout the series. These are usually enjoyable, but it depends on whether one enjoys these quirks or not. Personally, I loved them, it is a great thing for one to have.Some other things that one may also find somewhat comedic are the microbes themselves, as they look ridiculous. They are basically personified, magnified versions of the biological selves. They have high-pitched, chibi-like voices and when I thought about microbes being depicted in this way I could not help but giggle.8/10The art is solid, but nothing special. It is not the focus of the series, but it does the job well enough and is not garish in any aspects that I should so bee inclined to find that it ruined the comedy or the atmosphere of any particular scene. The female characters are attractive enough, (leather anyone?) and the design of the faces makes for great facial expression.7/10The sound, was quite forgettable for me, writing this review some time after I have watched the series I must confess that I have forgotten practically all of its soundtrack and BGM. Although this isn't exactly a bad sign, it isn't a great one either. I did recall that the ED was somewhat ridiculous and included rockets of some sort.However, as I did not recall it failing the show in any capacity, I can safely say that the majority of viewers will not be irked by the soundtrack, nor BGM.7/10The characters, one of the shining, focal points of the series. The majority of viewer's favourites would be no other than the seemingly geriatric Itsuki, Keizou (who was apparently tinkering with potatoes all the way back in WWII). He is possess amazing athletic prowess, and great knowledge, and is, absolutely, amazingly, hilarious. A wise old sensei at one moment and a cunning deviant the next. An unpredictable enigma that takes orders from no one, but it is a kindhearted joker in a most unsuitable shell.Hasegawa, the apparent tsundere is actually not that. As they have no place in a pure slice of life comedy. Her leather outfit speaks rebellion and that is what she is. Initially rejecting Sawaki's ability and being a very badass slice of life character overall, accentuated by the metric tonne of makeup; femme fatal if I ever saw one.Sawaki, the show's protagonist is a young man who seems to have accepted people rejecting his ability and now in this new environment, whereby his ability is accepted, embraced, and thoroughly abused for the sake of science; he is not exactly overjoyed at all times, but one can safely say he is enjoying himself. His demeanor isn't bubbly or talkative, but can get extremely involved in particular things. Not so much a cynic, but almost, his early personality is quite laid back and simply follows along with whatever happens to be going on at the time. He later picks up and becomes a vey likable character,  his shining moment being at a festival.9/10In terms of enjoyment, I enjoyed it, immensely. The hijinks, the ridiculous university activities and quirks. The adorable microbes, all contributed to this fiesta of nonstop comedy. With aphrodisiacs, sake brewing, a 3 day festival involving paper fan beatings and the most disgusting food ever to grace this planet, one will be rollicking in their seat.A very, very enjoyable anime.9/10Definite recommendation! of pseudo-romance, but the main focus is comedy.On comedy, this show performs.

At times it was interesting, and enjoyable, yet at other times it made me question why I was even watching it.Like any slice-of-life anime, I feel the characters are the most important aspect, and the characters in Moyashimon are all written fairly standard. They're very much based around your standard anime archetypes... yet, most of them also have a specific trait that props them up, differentiating them just enough to keep them from being overly generic. Still, this only makes them slightly more interesting... changing them from one-dimensional characters to two-dimensional characters.The story...of the show tends to follow these characters in a new plotline with each episode. There is an overarching plot as well, but it's fairly light. The problem is, the series tends to place more importance upon the overarching plot than is needed, and that takes focus away from the individual episodes. Speaking of the episodes, they tended to be a mixed bag. I liked some episodes more than others, but by the end, I was left feeling pretty unimpressed by the majority of them. The story just feels kind of bland and uninteresting.The art seemed like an odd mix. Some of it seemed well done, with interesting looking characters, and a few really nicely animated moments... but then there's plenty of generic looking characters and some animation that verges on being sub-standard. Still, I'd say the art is above average, and it definitely gets bonus points from me for the designs of the microbes, which are all really cute, and iconic.However, I would say the soundtrack isn't very memorable or iconic. Despite that, it still fits the tone of the show, and works well enough for the moments in which it is used. They get a lot of mileage out of a small sampling of songs. The overall audio mix is pretty decently done, too.As for my enjoyment of it... I liked some parts of the show, but felt like there was also a lot of untapped potential in the characters and the story. It wasn't bad by any means, but the whole thing felt like it was very standard, and only had a few standout moments. It's a good show to watch during a lazy morning if you've got nothing better to do, but that's about it. I wouldn't watch it again, and I felt like some episodes were a waste of my time, but overall, I had an alright time with it. of the show tends to follow these characters in a new plotline with each episode.

This is the Tales of Agriculture with LOTS AND LOTS OF FERMENTED FOOD...Tadayasu Sawaki voiced by Daisuke Sakaguchi is an interesting main protagonist with an interesting ability, heck even his setting he\'s set in a breathe of fresh air, university, instead of high school and at that though he\'s the typical dense protagonist but this isn\'t a romance anime. Sawaki is the the narrative focus of the anime and the only one who can obviously see the talking microbes. Again, Sawaki\'s ability to see microbes is the most interesting thing about him especially...with how he could utilize it to make a few bucks while being in university, but what with Professor Itsuki and a few others already knowing about his ability, yeah he gets roped into a few situations from a few characters, because of this he\'s a much more a reactionary character, it\'s not bad as he does get a plotline in the latter episodes but nonetheless.Now for the hare- rest of the characters, we have Haruka Hasegawa voiced by Sayaka Ohara, one of the students who is at first extremely skeptical of Sawaki\'s ability and being the ice queen archetype of the cast, she was LA\'s favorite character (why, tsundere-a-la-ojou). She does get a certain plotline centreing on her, that of having a force marriage and  that her father will only start once she graduates...yeah it\'s cliche to hell and back but ehhh...LA can forgive it because of Haruka\'s character was still solid. Aoi Mutou voiced by Mamiko Noto is ""Miss Agriculture"" for dubious reasons but she has a running gag of being smelly due to Itsuki\'s errands and is the ditzy character of the cast and LOVES alcohol and as such...she was LA\'s second favorite character. Hazuki Oikawa voiced by Akemi Kanda is a germophobe and in the same year as Sawaki and Sawaki has some feelings to her and to be honest, LA sees Oikawa and Sawaki to be a better ship but nonetheless a great constrast to Sawaki and the rest of the cast due to Oikawa\'s germaphobic nature AND she doesn\'t know about Sawaki\'s ability.Next are the two butt monkeys of the anime, Kaoru Misato and Takuma Kawahama voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi and Noriaki Sugiyama, a bunch of seniors who at first utilize and kinda use Sawaki to get a quick buck, being poor university students and all. They are the butt monkeys throughout the anime and especially Haruka utterly hates both of them but they both get better trying to genuinely help out a situation, be it in for their own gain or not. Kei Yuuki voiced by Mitsuki Saiga is Sawaki\'s best friend and he\'s the voice of reason in the cast but he doesn\'t exactly get much screentime unlike the rest of the cast, somewhat justified in the latter episodes but character wise, he\'s just Sawaki\'s best friend who is also the son of a sake factory owner. Lastly is Professor Itsuki Keizou voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura and sorta kicks the plot with Sawaki and some of the smaller looser plotlines...at times. He is knowledgeable mostly about fermentation as well as giving advice to Sawaki, Misato and Kawahama as well and because of it, he\'s your ""wise old sage"" archetype.Moyashimon does look at university life, like Sawaki and Kei going through agriculture lessons, mostly on the gross side as well as special events that kinda overshadow everything *cough* Spring Event but nonetheless looking at knowledgeable and accurate agriculture information was done well and comedically making the information being relayed in a nice, fluid and non-condescendingly boring way. Moyashimon mainly because of Professor Itsuki is obsessed with fermentation and to be honest even looking into that is actually interesting and comedic way and again all the more accurate as well.The animation done by Telecom Animation Film and Shirogumi was pretty decent in all respects. Character designs and backgrounding was pretty good, though the costuming was particularly focused on Haruka...for ...obvious. reasons, though without even telling us, it kinda makes sense. The character designs also goes across to the microbes being ""anime-fied"" and they\'re decently cute. Yeah some CGI are used but reasonably so in some instances as they aren\'t suppose to be seen but personified so the CGI makes sense. The anime is mostly in the comedic moments and on Misato and Kawahama have the character facial animation to be chibified which makes sense.

Sayaka Ohara was great as the ice queen Haruka, Mamiko Noto as Mutou as the ditz, Katsuyuki Konishi  and Noriaki Sugiyama as the butt monkey Misato and Kawahama and finally Akemi Kanda as Oikawa...though with Oikawa LA first thought it was Rie Kugimiya who voiced her, then thought it was Kana Ueda...then both until LA found out who actually voiced her.

As such, it is, in a word, disappointing. Analyzing the story, let's begin with the positives- the first 8 episodes are funny, educational, and atmospheric in that peculiar way only anime from the mid-2000s can be. It takes its admittedly bizarre concept and forges something unique with it, making you feel intrigued by the nature...of microbial life as they encounter it each episode, and developing the setting of the agricultural university as something characteristic and alive, with its own cultural traditions and warm sense of community. The characters grow as people and grow closer as friends as they pursue various goals or overcome a myriad of challenges, be that brewing sake, trying out fermented foods, or coming up with some scheme to benefit their lab, as they all drink, work, and just generally have fun together. It all feels really natural, and pairs very well with the art style. Now, for the negatives- the show knows what it wants to be, and follows its delightfully oddball path, until about episode 9 or so. From then on, the story feels as though it is rushing towards an ending that nobody asked for or saw coming, one that makes no sense and unfolds in total disregard to the pacing and characterization set out by the rest of the show. There are jarring twists, nonsense motivations, shock value distractions, and, worst of all, a total abandonment of the foundation upon which the show itself is built- a focus on microbial life. These last three episodes do untold damage to the show, and bring it all the way down from an 8 to a 6. It almost feels like an entirely different anime. This represents a mournful waste of potential on the part of Moyashimon and its story. From what I saw of season 2, the new tone of the show follows this same scattered, unfulfilling narrative, and is ultimately not worth watching as a result. Indeed, I even decided against continuing with it, which is a decision I very rarely make. In short, the last few episodes are this anime's undoing. Everything else I have to say about this anime, however, is quite positive. The art is wonderful, with a distinct visual style that especially manifests itself in the character and microbe designs. The color palate is soft and inviting, the backgrounds are detailed and refined, and the animation itself is smooth. Overall, the art is the strongest aspect of this anime, and truly embodies the nostalgic, immersive aesthetic of mid-2000s anime, from the ambitious live-action CG fusion OP, to the gorgeous anime itself, to the claymation ED. The sound is very strong, with a fun, emotional OST, voice work that suits each character, and most of all the detailed sounds of life, from the humming of scientific machine instruments, to the sounds of natural microbial life activity. The characters are broadly wonderful, and really help to bring the story to life. They all feel like they break your average archetypes in fun and interesting ways, all the while feeling genuine, and their developing friendship between themselves as a group is heartwarming to watch. Of course, this gets seriously muddled towards the end, when nobody seems to make any sense anymore, which is why the characters aren't the strongest aspect of this anime, despite how strong they are for most of the show. Of them, my favorites are the hapless duo Misato and Kawahama. Falling into the classic 'fat man and tall man comedy duo' archetype, they provide ample comedic relief, all while gradually proving themselves to be well-intentioned, and genuinely good friends by the end of the story, which is really solid character development. Overall, Moyashimon could have been something special, and indeed WAS something special until the last few episodes. I don't know what possessed the people behind this quirky, oddball edutainment title to do what they did, but it took something that was fun and unique, and turned it into something utterly unrecognizable.

Nijuu Mensou no Musume,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3673/Nijuu_Mensou_no_Musume,"['I admit that I love a good mystery, especially when they\'re reminiscent of creations by Conan-Doyle and Christie. The suspense, dama and tension in those stories is sometimes breathtaking, however their on-screen adaptations are often a little more lacklustre.Enter then, Nijuu Mensou no Musume or, to give it a snappier title, ""The Daughter of Twenty Faces"" (I should point out that the show also has the unfortunate title ""Chiko, Heiress of the Phantom Thief"" for some odd reason - I prefer the middle title as it has a certain grandstanding, operatic quality about it which is more in keeping with the series).The story is loosely...based on the detective novels by Edogawa Rampo (the author\'s pen-name), in which the lead characters were often an eccentric but skilled detective named Kogoro Akechi, and his arch nemesis Kajin Nijuu Mensou (the Fiend with Twenty Faces). The anime version is an adaptation of the manga that was released in 2002.Where the anime version deviates from the works of Edogawa is in making the main character a girl who gets caught up in the exploits of the famous thief known as Twenty Faces. She views her ""kidnapping"" by Twenty Faces and his gang as a gift, and rapidly warms up to her new ""family"" - the reasons for this being made obvious in the first few episodes.The plot is very well paced throughout the series and, whilst the main story is split into two very clearly defined arcs, the method in which the story is handled is very subtly different in the second arc. The first arc is dramatic and mysterious, especially when Chizuko (Chiko for short), considers the mysterious man known as Twenty Faces. The second arc has an added sense of adventure which is brought about by the introduction of Shunka Koito. Although the second arc tries to maintain some of the same suspense as the first, it never quite matches up to it as the audience by then is well aware of Chiko\'s capabilities, and knows that she will find a way to come out on top.The animation is, for want of a better word, excellent. The characters move with a natural surety and sense of rythm that\'s wonderful to see, and this is not only prominent in action sequences, but in the quieter moments as well. Each of the characters is also very well designed, with a sense of individuality to them. One thing that I liked was the sometimes subtle changes made to each of the characters to show the passage of years.The backgrounds and backdrops are very well made, with an exceptional amount of detail in them. These make a very atmospheric and realistic setting upon which the action can take place. CG has been used to great effect in the series, and is sometimes almost indistinguishable from the normal animation.As far as the music goes, the show has a very atmospheric soundtrack that is reflective of it\'s post-war setting (i.e. 1950\'s). The OP is a very nice track called ""Kasumi"" that has a certain tragic yet hopeful quality to it, whilst the ED, called ""Unnamed World"", is a very upbeat ditty sung by Hirano Aya (who also plays the role of Chiko). One nice thing about the two theme songs is how reflective they are of the two story arcs without actually giving anything away.The effects are extremely well used in the show, and actually have a greater impact on the viewer than one would expect. The sounds are very atmospheric, and when added to the music, gives a scene a certain ""completeness"".As I\'ve already mentioned, Hirano Aya plays the role of Chiko, but this is no Suzumiya Haruhi typecast, oh no. Chiko is calm, capable, and very, very clever, and it\'s nice to see Hirano displaying a wider range of talents here than she is normally able to. The other characters are equally as well portrayed, however the main focus of the show is Chiko, which is one of the downsides to the series (not a big one though).It should go without saying by now that Chiko is an extremely well realised character in the series, and her growth and development is well handled in both the scipt and Hirano\'s acting abilities. Unfortunately, the series has a wealth of characters who I would have liked to have known more about. The original members of Twenty Face\'s gang for example, and the reasons why they joined him were things that could have been included. That said, I found it both surprising and pleasing to find that the mysterious Twenty Faces is actually rounded out very well come the end of the series, mainly through the use of flashbacks.I found that I enjoyed this series a lot. Whilst it does suffer from a certain transparency at times, it does have a lot of action and mysteryto keep you interested. The sub-plot in the second arc was actually more interesting for me as it went into more detail about the ""Great War"" that Twenty Faces alludes to in the first arc, and not even the antics of the ""Detective Girls"" could stop me from wondering what would happen next.What I found nice about the series as a whole was that it is clearly an homage to Japan\'s first mystery series featuring a recurring detective and nemesis, and the flavour one gets from the story is very Conan-Doyle, a fitting tribute since Edogawa was heavily influenced by him. The fact that Kogoro Akechi appears in the series, and is on the trail of Twenty Faces is great to see, however there are more homages to Edogawa\'s novels than just the obvious, one in particular appearing in the final episode (see if you can spot it, and if not, then just ask).This is a good series that just misses the mark of being great, primarily because of it\'s focus on Chiko. The lack of attention to the other characters (in comparison to Chiko that is), gives the whole series a slightly unfinished feel come the end. Whilst it does have the feeling of a classic detective story, it lacks that certain polish that comes with a cast of characters you actually care about.On the whole though, it\'s a very good homage to Japan\'s first great detective novelist, and it would be nice to see more mysteries of this kind. based on the detective novels by Edogawa Rampo (the author\'s pen-name), in which the lead characters were often an eccentric but skilled detective named Kogoro Akechi, and his arch nemesis Kajin Nijuu Mensou (the Fiend with Twenty Faces).

The other characters are equally as well portrayed, however the main focus of the show is Chiko, which is one of the downsides to the series (not a big one though).It should go without saying by now that Chiko is an extremely well realised character in the series, and her growth and development is well handled in both the scipt and Hirano\'s acting abilities. Unfortunately, the series has a wealth of characters who I would have liked to have known more about. The original members of Twenty Face\'s gang for example, and the reasons why they joined him were things that could have been included. That said, I found it both surprising and pleasing to find that the mysterious Twenty Faces is actually rounded out very well come the end of the series, mainly through the use of flashbacks.I found that I enjoyed this series a lot. Whilst it does suffer from a certain transparency at times, it does have a lot of action and mysteryto keep you interested. The sub-plot in the second arc was actually more interesting for me as it went into more detail about the ""Great War"" that Twenty Faces alludes to in the first arc, and not even the antics of the ""Detective Girls"" could stop me from wondering what would happen next.What I found nice about the series as a whole was that it is clearly an homage to Japan\'s first mystery series featuring a recurring detective and nemesis, and the flavour one gets from the story is very Conan-Doyle, a fitting tribute since Edogawa was heavily influenced by him. The fact that Kogoro Akechi appears in the series, and is on the trail of Twenty Faces is great to see, however there are more homages to Edogawa\'s novels than just the obvious, one in particular appearing in the final episode (see if you can spot it, and if not, then just ask).This is a good series that just misses the mark of being great, primarily because of it\'s focus on Chiko. The lack of attention to the other characters (in comparison to Chiko that is), gives the whole series a slightly unfinished feel come the end. Whilst it does have the feeling of a classic detective story, it lacks that certain polish that comes with a cast of characters you actually care about.On the whole though, it\'s a very good homage to Japan\'s first great detective novelist, and it would be nice to see more mysteries of this kind.', 'Nijuu Mensou no Musume (The Daughter of 20 Faces) is an Action, Adventure, Mystery, Drama that feels just like many of the classic detective shows. It consists of 2 story arcs, so expect changes during the transition between the 1st & 2nd arcs.The story follows a gang of thieves led by the infamous man known only as ‘Twenty Faces’, who one day decides to take a young girl with him (hence the name of this series). The beginning is nothing spectacular, it just sets the scene for this late 50s themed detective fiction, which focuses mostly on Chizuko. The series follows an episodic nature, with...each episode dealing with individual endeavours but unlike most episodic anime, the story actually progresses nicely from episode to episode. Though the endeavours the group undertake tend to be more geared towards anime theatrics than thought-provoking realism. This all changes once it reaches the major turning point, early on and the series goes downhill a bit, upon losing all direction it once had. Adjusting to the sudden change does take some getting used to and it doesn’t help that the once entertaining story of thievery becomes something too complex for its own good.What makes up the story has to be the large cast of characters; which 20 Faces’ gang, the important recurring characters of the second arc and the unimportant episodic characters make up. Chizuko (Chiko) is quite the remarkable girl because not only is she really intelligent in the beginning, she is also the only one that develops very well throughout the series. 20 Faces does prove to be quite the enigmatic figure however the rest of the gang just don’t seem all that important but that doesn’t mean they are any less entertaining.Just what you’d expect from Bones, the series features some great animation & sounds. This anime has some immensely detailed environments, aesthetic realism for the settings, appropriately used CGI & nicely animated characters that fit in well with it all. Overall it’s great but I did feel the animation could have been much better. The music on the other hand fit the theme it was going for perfectly, going for some suspenseful music to match the detective-fiction themed adventure.Overall this anime series is a very entertaining experience, as it’s full of action, drama & suspense then develops into something very mystifying. Though there are still numerous flaws, most of which are prominent in the second arc, when the story diverges and the ‘great war’ subplot becomes more apparent. It really isn’t clear what to expect upon watching this series, so it’s best to just watch and experience it yourself.Note: May edit if necessary. ^_^ each episode dealing with individual endeavours but unlike most episodic anime, the story actually progresses nicely from episode to episode.

However to properly explain this point, I have to spoil pretty much the entire plot. Bear with me though, because it's a damn good point.Daugh\xadter of 20 Faces is a Bones anime from spring 2008. The story is about a girl called Chieko who was freed from her hor\xadrible life with her evil step\xadmother by a band of thieves led by the cha\xadris\xadmatic 20 Faces. The band became Chieko’s sur\xadrog\xadate fam\xadily, with 20 Faces become a father fig\xadure to her. He taught Chieko tricks of the trade along with many other les\xadsons...about human\xadity and mor\xadals and so on. Chieko was a pretty tal\xaden\xadted thief in her own right even at a young age, many sug\xadgest\xading she would suc\xadceed 20 Faces to be the new leader. She became the ‘daugh\xadter of 20 faces’ so to say. That is, until shit got real in epis\xadode 6. I can’t quite remem\xadber the exact details, but basic\xadally 20 Faces res\xadcued Chieko and dis\xadap\xadpeared off on a burn\xading train, pre\xadsum\xadably to have died.This is the Death of the Tutor, a pretty stand\xadard trope in any mode of story-telling. Everything from Star Wars to Madoka Magica does this. The reason it hap\xadpens is to allow for fur\xadther devel\xadop\xadment of the main char\xadac\xadter. They learn the life les\xadsons from the tutor but they can’t move on while they live in the shadow of said tutor. The Death of the Tutor shocks them out of that sense of secur\xadity and forces them to develop them\xadselves. This is exactly what hap\xadpens in Daugh\xadter of 20 Faces. Chieko’s devel\xadop\xadment went from tal\xaden\xadted child under her evil step\xadmother to finally hav\xading the free\xaddom and guid\xadance to train these tal\xadents of her.

Lots of Aya Hirano going 'Oji-san'Character: See entire above reviewEnjoyment: Ended when 20 Faces came back"", ""The Daughter of Twenty Faces basically makes its own plot based on characters from the classic Japanese mystery novels written by famous Japanese author Edogawa Rampo, in particular the thief Twenty Faces and detective Kogoro Akechi to a lesser extent. The series centers on orphaned girl Chizuko becoming involved with the thievery of Twenty Faces and his gang with the first five episodes of the series focused on their world-traveling thievery. Some shocking events in the sixth episode, which I won't spoil here, completely change the focus of the anime in later episodes as it changes over to Chizuko trying to seek out Twenty Faces...and learn more of his past as two antagonists acquainted with him in the pasthave their own diabolical plans in store for the thief and anyone close to him.Daughter of Twenty Faces offers up an engaging focus on the bond between Chizuko and Twenty Faces as the former regards him as a surrogate father and the latter sees her as potentially being his future successor while teaching Chizuko the tools of the trade as a thief. The first five episodes are somewhat setup like Rupan Sansei with Twenty Faces being gentleman thief and focus on his international exploits stealing loot overseas from those who are better off without it, only without the perversion and slapstick comedy from Monkey Punch's classic series. The episodes are used to setup the bond that Chizuko and Twenty Faces develop with one another and it did quite well in having me believe that their bond was genuine. The shocking events that develop in the sixth episode made for a surprising and effective twist in the title's plot to change its focus from the thievery of Twenty Faces' group to Chizuko now having to reunite with him and learning of his past when she is returned back to Japan.The rest of the series goes into some retro-futuristic like developments in its focus on Twenty Faces confronting the elements of his past as the foes he confronts make used of advanced versions of technologies commonplace during the era in which the series is set. It does accurately depict the Showa era in Japan with the fashions and traditional norms of the era, as well as many folks still being on edge from the events of World War II during the time period. It also features Chizuko adapting to the sudden changes in her life as she settles into a somewhat mundane routine as a teen schoolgirl after being brought back to Japan, learn of Twenty Faces' exploits, avoid attempts on her life from both her greedy aunt and said antagonists of Twenty Faces and not being around Twenty Faces' gang.Many of Daughter of Twenty Faces' prominent characters are reasonably fleshed out as many of them carry tragic pasts they are trying to move on from. This fleshing out works well in either learning more about what connections said characters had with the past of Twenty Faces, how their lives were effected from the war or being exploited for the personal gain of the later antagonists confronted in the series.The animation to Daughter of Twenty Faces sports solid production values sporting vast and detailed scenery shots, nicely rendered CG animation used for some scenes such as the rendering of blimps and a good amount of fluid movement and solid choreography shown within the title's action scenes. The music does its part in adding suspense and drama to the title's revelations on the exploits of Twenty Faces and the actions of the various villains seen throughout the series, though there was nothing that stuck out too strongly for me.Despite its solid setup though, Daughter of Twenty Faces is muddled with a fair number of flaws. Suspension of disbelief is a requirement to get enjoyment out of a nice number of the various acrobatic feats from Chizuko and the abilities of other characters seen throughout the show as they are certainly not possible to pull off in real life. In addition, beyond the nice amount of depth many characters get in this series, a number of them still follow standard character archetypes you would find from older or more conventional anime titles. The later antagonists introduced get their moments of depth yet they also are a bit over-the-top at times with their behavior to the point where it was more laughable than serious. The plotting to the series also has its rough elements as there are some plot developments with supporting characters left unresolved thanks to the larger focus on Twenty Faces' past and the resolution to the conflict with the second villain from Twenty Faces' past was so contrived in its developments that it got a bit mind-numbing for me.Putting aside these flaws, Daughter of Twenty Faces still made for a somewhat solid and unique take to Edogawa Rampo's classic characters that believably depicted 1950s Japan alongside its addition of the retro-futuristic developments that come about from the title's later episodes. It's far from being the best anime I seen, but it still made for an entertaining watch nonetheless. and learn more of his past as two antagonists acquainted with him in the pasthave their own diabolical plans in store for the thief and anyone close to him.Daughter of Twenty Faces offers up an engaging focus on the bond between Chizuko and Twenty Faces as the former regards him as a surrogate father and the latter sees her as potentially being his future successor while teaching Chizuko the tools of the trade as a thief.

The remainder of the series is this girl fighting to hold onto the few bonds she has left, using the skills she took away from her first real ""family"".I rate this anime at 5.8The main character is truly depicted as super human, both...personality wise and capability wise, which ruined it for me. The plot is some what sluggish, and the side characters that surround the main character all feel fake and predictable.

You have to take a lot into consideration when making one. Is it satisfying? Is it smart? Is it entertaining? But most of all, do I care? Well I can say with an honest heart, that I cared about The Daughter of 20 Faces. I really, really did.the story is about a girl who gets ""kidnapped"" by the famous thief known as Twenty Faces, and begins travelling with him and his gang of fellow thieves. Instead of viewing her ""kidnapping"" as a curse, she instead views it as a gift and quickly warms up to her new comrades,...viewing them as the family she never had.For what it is, the story is very well paced throughout the show, and it never feels as though there\'s a dull moment. Now, the show is separated into two very distinguishable arcs, that are handled in two very different manners. The first is very fun, mysterious and a plain old joy to watch. This arc is important in establishing how Chizuko grows in strength and as a character, whilst also depicting how close the gang is and how they grow as a family. The second arc adds in a sense of adventure and drama with the inclusion of characters Koito and Tome. Although the second arc tries to replicate the same level of fun that is had in the previous arc, it never quiet matches up to the same level of enjoyment I had watching the first, but instead adds new things by making the story darker in tone to keep me interested till the very end.The animation is, for lack of a better word, fantastic. All of the characters have a natural sense of movement that really adds to the overall nature of the show. Where the animation stands out the most however, is in the action sequences. Never before have I seen an anime that has fights as smooth and well choreographed as this. The character designs, although not ground breaking, are really nice and unique. Every character is distinguishable and can be easily recognised by the viewer many months prior to finishing (probably).The soundtrack is one of my favourite things about this whole show. It gives off a very atmospheric post-war vibe that really adds to the overall quality. The opening song is a very nice song to listen to that gives off a certain feel of tragedy and, of course, a sense of mystery. The ending song feels as though it\'s the polar opposite, with a more upbeat, almost ""childish"" vibe to it. It\'s also worth mentioning, each song is reminiscent of the first and second arcs respectively.As far as protagonists go, Chizuko is amongst the best. She\'s a very well realised character that has a very realistic sense of development and growth. Both the script and voice actor have a very good understanding of who her character is supposed to be. I was also surprised to find that Twenty Faces is actually a really well rounded and realistic character whom you can sympathise with, through the use of flashbacks. However great these characters may be, I felt as though I would have liked to have seen more backstory and development given to some of the supporting cast. Although they\'re not bad characters in any way, I feel that giving the members of Twenty Faces\' gang a reason as to why they joined would have given the anime that extra push that would have made it that extra bit closer to perfection. This probably won\'t effect your enjoyment in any way, because I\'m just nit-picking at this point.On the whole, The Daughter of Twenty Faces is an outstanding anime with interesting characters, exceptional animation, a kickass soundtrack and most of all, a mystery I cared about.Hope that helped. viewing them as the family she never had.For what it is, the story is very well paced throughout the show, and it never feels as though there\'s a dull moment.

The story plays out in a most romanticized manner, as the thieves have their life’s goal to “liberate” beautiful items from those who don’t deserve them, as well as having a sense of adventure and freedom to do anything they like, liberated themselves from the constrains of their society. This makes the feeling of the show to be bent too much on emotion and ideals and less on pragmatism or reality in general. So in order for someone to enjoy the anime, he or...she must not try to rationalize too much whatever is going on in the story but rather take it easy and just enjoy the ride. Which is something I can say about all BONES anime; they always have great production values and premises and always mess up on the story development.The setting of the show is an alternative world, pretty close to our own but with its own history and countries. Although the thieves are traveling all over the globe, based on clothes and building architecture to the most part it will feel like it takes place somewhere between late 19th and middle 20th century central Europe. This rather exotic and uncommon setting helps the audience to emerge better in the feeling of adventure it emits. I personally found it to be something between Sherlock Holmes and Oliver Twist in the way it tries to depict its imagery. The overall production values are also very good, with consistency throughout the show, usually lively motions, basic choreographies in battle, and far more than a change of clothes to depict when the characters are growing older. Even the CGI feels like it fits perfectly with the 2D animation. As for the soundtrack, it is full of fitting easy going tunes and not extremely emotional J-pop or rock. They also fit with the overall feeling of the series, which is not aiming to make your heart go wild but to subtly portrait the characters and the setting.Although the band or romantic thieves is big, only the main two members of them are focused a lot and matter in the longrun. One is their leader, the Man of Twenty Faces, and the other is the girl he took under his wings in one of his missions, Chiko or the Daughter of Twenty faces. Their nicknames are based on the fact nobody outside the team knows how they look like in reality and they keep disguising themselves in each mission to make it even harder to have a helpful photo on their wanted poster. Truth is, Chiko is the only one who becomes memorable for her radical change from a weak girl to a dynamic woman (plus because she is voiced by Hirano, the voice actress of Haruhi). Other than that, they are both depicted as highly intelligent, extremely cunning, amazing at disguises and acrobatics. They give off an aura of security and superiority for acting and feeling completely above anyone else.The truth is though that they are just a bit smarter than the rest, plus the entire world of the series appears to be run by idiots. Although we can excuse it somehow by thinking this is happening in a previous century where most people were ignorant and gullible, you are still made to think that everybody can be fooled with tricks which are child’s play or completely see-through with modern standards. You just have to accept the fact the heroes can put on a wig and a mask and become completely identical to the friends and allies of their opponents. And no, they don’t even do it in a fancy hi-tech way like in the Mission Impossible series. They also have access to super powerful technology, super awesome spy gadgets, super cool disguise kits, and can move around the world in fancy cars or cool zeppelins completely unnoticed. Hell, they can easily destroy everything and buy new ones if they are ever discovered, so it’s like they have endless money and can easily replace anything they waste. So in a way they win most of the time because their opponents are idiots or don’t have equipment from the future. Makes it kinda cheap and anti-climactic to see them constantly winning with childish tricks, full of immature bravado and impractical uses of technology. It is even dumber when the villains constantly make the ridiculous James Bond mistake of trying to imprison the heroes just to explain their plan to them before killing them instead of just killing them. Or they leave the room and assume they will be killed by someone else, something which of course never happens. But as I said you are supposed to like the atmosphere and the characters and not the story and its plausibility. It’s just that in the longrun it makes most of the cast to feel neglected or stupid and thus they are thrown aside for being completely uninteresting to bother remembering.Speaking of the story, it never manages to be too exciting or memorable in terms of plot. The first part is episodic missions where Chiko slowly learns various tricks to use in their adventures. The second part is about an opposing team of also skilled villains trying to accomplish some devious scheme regarding the war that ended some years ago. Progressively the series becomes less mysterious (because Chiko is learning fast the basics of thievery) and far more action (because she now knows lots of tricks and so do the new enemies). In this regard, the initial feeling of excitement and adventure gives its place to something close to a dull fighting shounen. Although the story becomes more on-going, at the same time it feels like it moves way too fast without much payback in terms of action or character coloring. Especially the finale which is pretty much a snorefest.Although this anime is in overall very uncommon in the way it tells its story and not following the usual anime clichés too much, down to it lacks the most vital element of any series: Excitement! It doesn’t have much of it and when it attempts to do so all you get is dumb villains, shallow ideology, and dull fighting shounen. Chiko and Man are cool but they are simply not enough to keep you interested in watching for more than a few episodes without something great to look forward to. So nice try but not great in overall.SUGGESTION LISTBig OPumpkin ScissorsKino’s JourneyLupin the 3rdAlison and LiliaAnd now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10General Artwork 2/2 (interesting setting)Character Figures 1/2 (nothing amazing but consistent)Backgrounds 2/2 (detailed and with good CGI)Animation 1/2 (good but dull)Visual Effects 1/2 (good but dull)SOUND SECTION: 7/10Voice Acting 2/3 (good but rather cheesy on ideology)Music Themes 3/4 (fitting but not memorable)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 1/2 (cheesy)Pacing 1/2 (slow)Complexity 1/2 (too much focus on Chiko)Plausibility 1/2 (mentally challenged but there)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 7/10Presence 2/2 (bold)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (mostly for Chiko but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 4/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (small since most episodes are dull)Memorability 3/4 (generally memorable but could have been much better)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 3/10Interesting for awhile but the lack of excitement and capable idiots kills it in the longrun.VERDICT: 5.5/10 she must not try to rationalize too much whatever is going on in the story but rather take it easy and just enjoy the ride. Which is something I can say about all BONES anime; they always have great production values and premises and always mess up on the story development.The setting of the show is an alternative world, pretty close to our own but with its own history and countries. Although the thieves are traveling all over the globe, based on clothes and building architecture to the most part it will feel like it takes place somewhere between late 19th and middle 20th century central Europe. This rather exotic and uncommon setting helps the audience to emerge better in the feeling of adventure it emits. I personally found it to be something between Sherlock Holmes and Oliver Twist in the way it tries to depict its imagery. The overall production values are also very good, with consistency throughout the show, usually lively motions, basic choreographies in battle, and far more than a change of clothes to depict when the characters are growing older. Even the CGI feels like it fits perfectly with the 2D animation. As for the soundtrack, it is full of fitting easy going tunes and not extremely emotional J-pop or rock. They also fit with the overall feeling of the series, which is not aiming to make your heart go wild but to subtly portrait the characters and the setting.Although the band or romantic thieves is big, only the main two members of them are focused a lot and matter in the longrun. One is their leader, the Man of Twenty Faces, and the other is the girl he took under his wings in one of his missions, Chiko or the Daughter of Twenty faces. Their nicknames are based on the fact nobody outside the team knows how they look like in reality and they keep disguising themselves in each mission to make it even harder to have a helpful photo on their wanted poster. Truth is, Chiko is the only one who becomes memorable for her radical change from a weak girl to a dynamic woman (plus because she is voiced by Hirano, the voice actress of Haruhi). Other than that, they are both depicted as highly intelligent, extremely cunning, amazing at disguises and acrobatics.

However, I don't think this kind of story telling gives the viewer enough time to digest everything. I don't mean the story itself is confusing, but how the plot is executed compromises many scenes that could have been the defining moments. As a result, the story seemed really trivial. I don't think it's the fault of the content of the story, but how the story is told.Then the...characters...the main characters are very likable in my opinion. I can see why the anime glass mask is among one of the recommendations. The heroine and the hero in both series are very alike, and their relationship is similar. I won't spoil too much, but the heroine in nijuu mensou no musume doesn't care for love.Even now, I have a hard time deciding whether I liked this series or not. I was glued to the screen the whole time while watching, but I still think the show failed in its execution. It is entertaining enough, and usually I don't mind innovative execution as long as it doesn't compromise the story. In this case, I was disappointed. I haven't read the manga so I don't know how closely it follows the manga. The series has basically two nicely paced story arcs, but the themes are all over the place. In the end, I honestly don't even know what it's trying to say. That's another major disappointment.So overall, I don't think the series is organized well. I really do think it has so much potentials though. It's just so disappointing when I got to the end. I didn't like the ending either, but that's just my personal taste in closures. characters...the main characters are very likable in my opinion.

Perrine Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2549/Perrine_Monogatari,"['I love Japan\'s kids shows. Why? Because they have BALLS. What do I mean? To put it simply, the majority of their children\'s shows aren\'t just silly entertainment for kids or gigantic marketing commercials to sell toys. Just like with the majority of their adult and teenager aimed anime, their children\'s shows are refined and mature. They explore and discuss issues that most American children\'s shows don\'t even acknowledge! Not all of them are overly happy pieces of fluff meant to tell kids that all their dreams will come true. When things get serious in their kids shows, BY GOD DO THEY GET SERIOUS! Japan\'s...kids shows take their audience seriously, don\'t treat them like morons, have much more refined and lavish animation than other kids shows from other countries, they\'re not afraid to show the dark sides of life like death or hardships, and they\'re not afraid to test their audience\'s patience. Ever since I realized what anime was, I always wondered: are fantasy shows and super hero shows full of action and fighting all American children really need to enjoy something? Who says children can\'t enjoy drama or slice of life shows where not much happens? Unfortunately, we Americans are under the stupid concept that the only shows American children will watch MUST have action, fighting, monsters, and overly preachy morals about friendship and making dreams come true. The people who make or advise the production of most American kids shows are afraid that if their show has death, hardships, and other dark themes, parents will go mad and say ""we need to protect our children!!!"" Personally, I think Japan has the right idea about saying, ""Screw it!"" to what kids shows SHOULD be and just do their own thing no matter how many kids they traumatize! So what if they\'re darker and more compelling than usual? I think shows like these are what American kids need! Kids will undergo some kind of hardship in their life anyway, so why bother trying to hide it from them? Perrine Monogatari is just one of Japan\'s many children\'s shows that I really like for its willingness to push boundaries and not fall to common children\'s show cliches.Perrine and her mother start off on a journey, leaving India to go to a city in France called Maraucourt, which is actually the place where her father grew up. Unfortunately, Perrine\'s father, Edmond, died on the journey due to pneumonia, leaving his daughter and her mother alone to travel together. But things get worse, as Perrine\'s mother gets sick as soon as they arrive in France, and later dies herself. But not before telling Perrine about Edmond\'s family: his father, Vulfran, is vehemently opposed to their marriage and as a result, Edmond ran away, furthering his father\'s rage against them. She tells her to continue on her way to Maraucourt, but her grandfather may not welcome her, so she has to make him love her before he realizes who she is. Perrine manages to get there and get a job in her grandfather\'s factory. But Vulfran is blind, old, and known to be a cold and solemn man who may still be angry at his son for what he did, so she isn\'t sure if she can do it.The show\'s animation is very dated, but it\'s still very impressive for a 53 episoded anime of its time. It looks significantly better than shows like Heidi or Dog of Flanders, probably because they managed to get the budget they needed. Not only that, the producers really went all out in making this show incredibly detailed and realistic. Everything, from uplifting events to tragic ones, come off as really realistic, in both the dialogue, the scenario, and the way the characters are animated, and the show itself is ridiculously and meticulously detailed. Even simple things like working and buying food are given plenty of time to signify their importance. None of the drama comes across as artificial, like most anime do nowadays. Plus, there\'s a butt-ton of effort into building up into the actual story. From what I\'ve heard, everything up to episode 20 is anime original, yet, like Popolocrois Monogatari, all of these episodes are entirely character focused, detailing their journey from Bosnia to France and probably giving more background to Perrine and her family before the main events, and even when they get to the main story, the producers still take their time to further build upon the events leading up to them and make the journey as realistic and believable as possible during the time period the show takes place in. Kudos to you, Perrine! I especially liked the part of one episode where a character hurts herself when working in a factory and the managers say, ""Oh, you brought it on yourself! It\'s your own fault for not paying attention! It\'s not that bad!"" I learned a lot about factory workers in the 1880s back when I was young, and one thing I always remembered was that if someone was injured, the injury wasn\'t taken too seriously and they were told to just go back to work. If something like this happened in modern times, people would sue the factory like crazy! That really proved that these animators really did their research.However, much like many anime of the seventies, the music is unfortunately very dated and has seventies written all over it. However, it is significantly better than other soundtracks I\'ve heard, like the 1975 Dog of Flanders anime and the 1977 Nobody\'s Boy Remi anime. The pieces do try to set the mood and create an atmosphere well and at times they really hit hard, while other times they tend to miss and come across as a little overdramatic, though not as bad as Dog of Flanders or Remi, mind you. It still hasn\'t aged very well, though.The characters are where this anime really shines. Instead of being portrayed as cardboard cut outs, they\'re portrayed as actual people with quirks, charms, and flaws alike, and it\'s not limited to the main characters either. Not only that, the character development here helps with exploring its themes about the importance of hard work, honesty, and how being good to others will influence them to be good to you. I honestly felt Perrine was a great main character with her strong will, her wits, the way she copes with the hardships she faces, and her being able to do what she needs to survive by any means possible in a very believable way, and this was before anime began to be swamped with idiot heroes, spineless harem kings, bumbling perverts, tsunderes, and ditzy females. More anime characters need to follow her example! However, I can see some people accusing her of being a Mary Sue, mostly because of how mature she acts for her age and a lot of talents like sewing and cooking, though this was the 19th century, so they probably don\'t know that a lot of kids were expected to act differently then than they do now, and girls at that time were expected to learn how to cook and do needlework in any situation, so I don\'t see any problem with it unless it involved forcing her to be submissive to a husband and squash her own dreams forever, which thankfully doesn\'t happen here. The only other flaws I can find are that some coincidences are a bit too convenient for the sake of moving the plot forward, and the language barrier gets ignored in the first half, only because the rest of the series is so down to earth in its presentation.If you\'re looking for a great, down to earth, moving slice of life anime about traveling, then Perrine is definitely the anime for you! But you\'ll need patience though, as it\'s very slow paced and tranquil. It\'s not an anime for those looking for action and mecha battles. kids shows take their audience seriously, don\'t treat them like morons, have much more refined and lavish animation than other kids shows from other countries, they\'re not afraid to show the dark sides of life like death or hardships, and they\'re not afraid to test their audience\'s patience.

This became one of the most satisfying anime I've ever watched. It has a good balance of sad moments and moments that make you want to high five your invisible buddy.The voice acting was pinpoint in my opinion.The key thing to this anime is those eventful moments that make you feel good inside or when things are revealed, the anime really knows how to capture that moment....Some really memorable scenes that made me rewatch them many times over. Some really memorable scenes that made me rewatch them many times over."", 'English is not my language.This review I took some main points, it\'s not a detailed analysis of the work. It contains some spoilers.Perrine Monogatari is another classic anime from the ""World Masterpiece Theater"" framework, produced by the highly acclaimed Nippon Animation studio.After the death of her father, Perrine and her mother go on a journey to France. They go with a donkey named Palikare and her dog named Baron.Honestly, I thought this anime was going to be an extremely dramatic journey, just like Ie Naki Ko. Well, the anime doesn\'t have the overdramatic journey that Ie Naki Ko has, and this is one of the...most positive points in Perrine Monogatari.I don\'t know why MyAnimeList put one of the biggest spoilers on the synopsis. Well, I did not read the synopsis from MyAnimeList until a certain event that I will mention later. So, it had unexpected things for me, as I did not read one of the major spoilers of the work.The journey of Perrine and her mother, as much as it has its difficulties, has many joyful moments. And this is a real journey, with its happy and sad moments (right, Ie Naki Ko? Haha).Perrine\'s mother works as a photographer after the death of her husband, and Perrine helps her. She has some great moments on their journey to France.On this journey, after many things, they meet a boy named Marcel, who at first I didn\'t like very much, but as the episodes went by he turned out to be a good boy, and the best, a good character.Marcel has run away from his aunt\'s house because he would rather work with his parents in the circus than study. Perrine and his mother decide to help him find the circus while he is on his journey, and here Perrine and Marcel\'s friendship is born. It is all very natural how they become friends, and I like it.The biggest drama begins when Perrine\'s mother starts to get sick, and they don\'t have much money.I honestly thought that the journey to meet Perrine\'s grandfather, she would go with her mother, but as her mother didn\'t get better, she passed away and Perrine had to continue traveling with only her dog.I didn\'t expect her mother to pass away. As I said before, I have not read the synopsis here on MyAnimeList. This was a very sad episode. As I became attached to the characters, it was very dramatically charged.Obviously the anime revolves around Perrine, so let me tell you a little about her.It is impossible not to like Perrine, especially after her mother dies and she has to fend for herself.She is a very nice girl, too nice in some cases. Besides this, she gets by on her own with the little she has; for example, making her own clothes and getting by on what to eat.As I said, it is impossible not to like her. Perrine easily wins people\'s friendship because of her manner, but her personality also causes her to be deceived and robbed by others from time to time.Towards the end, you can\'t help but admire Perrine. She is simply one of the best characters I have ever seen.The anime has some unexpected things.One of those things was the revelation that Perrine\'s grandfather is blind. Also, Perrine\'s grandfather is not as bad as I thought he would be. As the episodes go on this becomes clearer.He holds a grudge against Perrine\'s mother because he thought she was holding her son back from going back to France, being that it is revealed that they were going to France and Perrine\'s father died while they were traveling.Bilfran, as much as he is a good character, he hurt Perrine without being his intention, as he did not know that she was his granddaughter. He is a good character, even more so when you start to understand him more.The ending of the anime is just fantastic.Perrine manages to win the love of her grandfather as naturally as possible. Perrine is wonderful!It is amazing how she was able to change her grandfather\'s perspective on many things just with her way of being.The technical parts of the anime are okay. It\'s nothing too much.The character design is good, it does its job well.The animation is ok.The OST I almost don\'t pay attention, it\'s a song or another that I really paid attention to.For those who want an adventure anime with a long journey, great characters and a very good story, you can trust that Perrine Monogatari will deliver something very good. The anime gets a bit long after Perrine arrives in the village where her grandfather\'s factory is located, but it is worth it. most positive points in Perrine Monogatari.I don\'t know why MyAnimeList put one of the biggest spoilers on the synopsis. Well, I did not read the synopsis from MyAnimeList until a certain event that I will mention later. So, it had unexpected things for me, as I did not read one of the major spoilers of the work.The journey of Perrine and her mother, as much as it has its difficulties, has many joyful moments. And this is a real journey, with its happy and sad moments (right, Ie Naki Ko? Haha).Perrine\'s mother works as a photographer after the death of her husband, and Perrine helps her. She has some great moments on their journey to France.On this journey, after many things, they meet a boy named Marcel, who at first I didn\'t like very much, but as the episodes went by he turned out to be a good boy, and the best, a good character.Marcel has run away from his aunt\'s house because he would rather work with his parents in the circus than study. Perrine and his mother decide to help him find the circus while he is on his journey, and here Perrine and Marcel\'s friendship is born. It is all very natural how they become friends, and I like it.The biggest drama begins when Perrine\'s mother starts to get sick, and they don\'t have much money.I honestly thought that the journey to meet Perrine\'s grandfather, she would go with her mother, but as her mother didn\'t get better, she passed away and Perrine had to continue traveling with only her dog.I didn\'t expect her mother to pass away. As I said before, I have not read the synopsis here on MyAnimeList. This was a very sad episode. As I became attached to the characters, it was very dramatically charged.Obviously the anime revolves around Perrine, so let me tell you a little about her.It is impossible not to like Perrine, especially after her mother dies and she has to fend for herself.She is a very nice girl, too nice in some cases. Besides this, she gets by on her own with the little she has; for example, making her own clothes and getting by on what to eat.As I said, it is impossible not to like her. Perrine easily wins people\'s friendship because of her manner, but her personality also causes her to be deceived and robbed by others from time to time.Towards the end, you can\'t help but admire Perrine. She is simply one of the best characters I have ever seen.The anime has some unexpected things.One of those things was the revelation that Perrine\'s grandfather is blind. Also, Perrine\'s grandfather is not as bad as I thought he would be. As the episodes go on this becomes clearer.He holds a grudge against Perrine\'s mother because he thought she was holding her son back from going back to France, being that it is revealed that they were going to France and Perrine\'s father died while they were traveling.Bilfran, as much as he is a good character, he hurt Perrine without being his intention, as he did not know that she was his granddaughter.

Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17249/Pretty_Rhythm__Rainbow_Live,"['If you like the pretty dresses, cute pets, magical dances, etc. in Aikatsu!, the first two seasons of Pretty Rhythm, and e.g. Precure, yet find the plots of those animes somewhat too childish, then Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live may be exactly the anime for you.  All the aforementioned elements are present, but there are also plenty of heartwarming (sometimes tear-jerking, yet never hopelessly depressing) drama involving friends and family, told with more depth than child shows but never mind-boggling.  And yes, there is a healthy dose of romance as well, not so much as to overshadow the other aspects of the show, but...still extremely satisfying.To me, one of the wonderful aspects of this season is its seven main girl characters.  While I would normally be satisfied with finding just one main character that I can identify with, in PRRL it turns out, almost magically, that all 7 girls have something in common with myself: one is the timid side of me, one is the childish side, one is the proud (and often stubborn) side of me in things I\'m good at, etc.  It is almost as if the different sides of me got decomposed, rainbow-like, into those 7 girls.  No, not exactly.  While each girl has her distinct personality, there are just enough little surprises (think the number of teddy bears owned by a certain girl) and subtle changes to make them believable persons rather than one-dimensional stereotypes.  The show encourages the girls to display their true selves, which can be far more variable than first impressions of their personalities.This season places heavy emphasis on the girls\' (and some of the boys\') families, even more than the first season, and the result is, in my opinion, extremely successful.  Unlike e.g. Clannad, here almost all the girls are only children, so all the attention is placed on parent-child relationships, which are in turn heavily influenced by the relationships between the parents.  Many different kinds of families are described, some happy, some sad, some stressful, and some utterly dysfunctional, and it is vividly clear how the girls\' personalities have been shaped by them.  Yet love does exist, however distorted, in every family, and it is hard not to be moved to tears when a family finally finds its proper path to happiness.Friendship among the girls has always been important in such animes, and PRRL is no exception.  There is the light-hearted kind among Happy Rain, the much heavier (but also closer) bond among Belle Rose, the sweet kind (yet with a little sadness in the background) between Naru and Rinne, but I think the most impressive kind is the friendship formed in the three duo teams, where the large contrast in personality and family leads to new bonds that is almost redefining the word ""friendship"".  Needless to say, episodes 36-38 focusing on these duo teams are also close to my favorite episodes.Like previous seasons, the boys play a small but significant role in this season.  As love interests and fanservice (I mean you, Hiro-sama!), they are pretty good, with gorgeous looks (unlike the somewhat awkward ones in the second season) and likeable personalities, and the girls\' friendship and love stories with them can be heartwarming, sad, sweet and fun at different times.  I feel more ambivalent about the interactions among the boys, which seem to be somewhat more frequent than in previous seasons; with the limited screentime they have, I sometimes feel that the boys talk too much without clarifying their intentions with enough real action (although there is a pleasant surprise near the end), making their words rather puzzling at times.As the title suggests, this season is about music, and both the BGMs and the numerous songs are simply gorgeous, far surpassing the (by no means low) level of the first two seasons.  Among the BGMs, my favorite is the one used in the middle of Episode 26 and reused in Episode 34, in two of the most memorable scenes in the anime.  Among the songs, perhaps the only ones I don\'t like that much are some of the OPs and EDs; it is almost impossible for me to find a favorite one because they are all so good in many different ways, but at this moment I think I like the song in Episode 37 best.  It is important to understand the lyrics of the songs, as they are closely related to the story, and in some cases rather well synchronized with the performances.Finally, the Prism shows themselves.  While the CG is basically at state-of-the-art level, similar to Pretty Rhythm\'s second season (and IMHO better than the first) as well as Aikatsu!\'s second season, there do exist some absolutely gorgeous shows and some slightly disappointing ones.  Speaking of the dance part, the two shows involving June are just perfect, better than anything I have previously seen: beautiful steps, shiny background, impactful camerawork, accompanied by two songs that are simply grand.  On the other hand, I find the solo dances of the Happy Rain girls a little too simple (perhaps because they are not as good at skating after all); the Belle Rose girls also have great dances, but I think Bell and Wakana\'s animations can be cleaned up a bit as it feels slightly unnatural at times.  The boys also have pretty costumes and good dances, but the animations could have shown a bit more strength.  As for the chained jumps, IMHO they may seem a bit bland (even with the Prism Lives) and repetitive (although the show does a good job avoiding most of that through the insertion of other scenes) compared to the great Prism Acts in the second season.  However, some of the new jumps are still very beautifully made, and while many of the jumps reuse those from the previous seasons, they do look quite a bit better after remake.  And the chained jumps in Episodes 43 and 48 are as impressive as the best Prism Acts from the second season.I hope you would go watch this show after reading my review.  Pretty Rhythm is notorious for starting slow but picking up speed in the second half and particularly near the end; PRRL is no exception, albeit to a lesser extent.  The first ten episodes might be a little childish sometimes, and somewhat depressing at other times (because many of the main characters are unfriendly at the beginning), but if you can get to like the story and the characters just a little bit in these episodes, the subsequent episodes (where everyone changes for the better) will likely make you fall in love with this season, and rewatch it again and again. still extremely satisfying.To me, one of the wonderful aspects of this season is its seven main girl characters.

Most anime is usually an extreme hit or miss with me. I usually love it or hate it. So I tend to rate generously. But Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live is absolutely worthy of a 10. Hell I'd give it an 11 if i could. I loved this anime so much. It's a really fun ride.This is my first review so please bear with me.STORY: 10The story takes place in a different universe from the previous Pretty Rhythm entries, so it can be watched standalone. It starts off very cheesy and tacky, I'll be honest. But Rainbow Live's story...is one of the most sophisticated, beautiful stories I've ever seen in an anime, let alone a kids anime. Almost every plot line gets wrapped up by the end, and with such a large cast, there are a lot of subplots, so that's really impressive. The filler episodes don't feel like filler even, because something significant happens in most episodes. Although it is a kids anime, it touches on some sensitive topics. Even the romance subplots, which I usually dislike, were amazingly well written, and blended seamlessly into the story.ART: 8Ok, ok. The animation budget isn't the greatest for kids anime, but I really do like the art in Rainbow Live. The art style really appeals to me, I think it's the eyes. Even the CG looks really good, especially when compared to the CG from Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream. The character designs are unique and really interesting, they're a bit over-the-top without being too crazy. Overall, I really liked it.SOUND: 9I loved every song in this anime. Each character has their own unique insert song, with each unit having one as well, and also a few duo songs. There are also multiple OPs and EDs. The seiyuus also did a great job here. The only thing holding me back from a 10 is that the BGM wasn't particularly notable.CHARACTER: 10I can almost guarantee you will love and feel for most characters. The devlopment the cast went through is amazing. Sad moments, happy moments, funny moments, this show does it all perfectly in character. Even the supporting cast felt human. My oner complaint is that the true antagonist's motivations are a little vague if you don't follow through with the King of Prism series.ENJOYMENT: 10This show should be in a museum. I would voluntarily write an essay on this show. This show was so unique and amazing that I don't think anything can quite live up to it.OVERALL: 9This show made me cry to a song who's first verse is just a mishmash of random english words. Please watch Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live. is one of the most sophisticated, beautiful stories I've ever seen in an anime, let alone a kids anime.

There are no reviews for this show yet and I think it really deserves one.So when you first see this anime, you look at the colorful characters, the sparkles, the whole idea of dancing singing and prism lives with sparkly music and sparkly well EVERYTHING.But don't give it up just because it looks like another childrens anime with transforming girls, because it's actually really interesting~It's INTERESTING okYou can't tell at all what's going to happen next, who's going to win the competition, and some of the characters have...some hidden past that you just CANT GUESS from their actions. Everythings not painfully oblivious or happy that makes you want to barf.It's not another childrens show, the characters overcome challenges, they grow, and on top of that they are so lovable, seriously lovable. Sure there's the happy/loli characters, but they're not... annoying i guess.The songs they use for prism lives are seriously catchy, they're typical idol songs but still, they're catchy.It's not super intense or anything, but it's entertaining, very entertaining and enjoyable. You will not feel bored. There are so many mysteries behind the characters (in a good way) and you just want to keep watching.Just give this show a chance, watch the first 3 episodes, and you will NOT be bored, don't judge it from the talking animals, colorful characters, and childish sounding storyline ^^ some hidden past that you just CANT GUESS from their actions.

I couldn't really write something about the story without spoiling anything so I would go further for the characters.Each characters are unique and it matches their type of music, what also makes this anime different from the other series, it is because the way they do their jumps. The jumps are set everytime so it doesn't really surprises us anymore.You cannot really hate the characters here because they later turn out to be...different or the backstory of that specific character will touch us. I really enjoy this anime, I really do, but there are some episodes where you will be really disappointed by how the story went and such. But I guess the anime creators really like to toy with us.As for the music, it doesn't have that much of a variety because each character have their own idol song, or whenever they are in groups that they will always sing the same song over and over. But believe once you heard their songs, it will be a while before it will go away from your mind.I hope this review is helpful for you guys. different or the backstory of that specific character will touch us.

Wanting a chill anime to watch, i picked up PR: Aurora dream and loved it, after they added more songs to the lineup and different dances. They dance sequences on the ice were captivating to the point of saying ""Fuck tradtional ice-skating, this is what ice-skating shouldve been, minus the prism jumps of course.Now to the reviewStory- 8. Up to ep 26, when they finally become a unit, it was the usual build up to it, i like the concept of Prism Live, playing instruments while you dance. The plot twist between...Ann and Wakara knowing each other, i really didnt see that coming. When both units did their trio dance, when Bell finally did her Prism live and the 4-jump combo, it was like her team had won already, but the story doesnt go like that, HAPPY RAIN just had to do a Trio-Prism Live/Jump which just blew me away because now they have become closer as friends as well as a unit.Sound- 9. The song pace is almost the same as the first season because having a new song each week just isnt realistic. There is going to be some repatition songs but it hasnt been so bad, if the song list goes over 25, thats like an average 1 song every 2 episodes.Character- 10. Each main character gets decent amount of screen time for their development. Naru becoming more reliable, Ann not being so stubborn and more friendly, Ito being more open and light-hearted(she and koji are an item), Otoha: she\'s just great regardless, Wakana forgiving Ann when it was actually herself who messed up. Then there\'s Bell, who at first was the perfectionist bitch who hated Naru for not being serious enough about Prism shows and not getting along with her mom all that great TOO being more loving about her teammates and seeing Naru as a rival when she shakess her hand at the end of Try Groovin. Rinne also, but with her memory loss, her development happens at different times, appearing when you least expect her to(she basically appears everywhere then dissappears just as fast).Enjoyment- 9. I am excited to see how the prism world comes into play in this season and what June is all about.overall- 9. Really looking forward to how this season ends, just wondering if Naru is going to get with someone or if shes going to stay alone, but with friends in every direction.updated to ep. 32. this phrase sums up everything from 26 to 32: its a mother******* rollercoaster thats not going to stop anytime soon. Also Hiro, he saw the biggest dick in the world and chocked on it, big time. Plus June, when you see her dance, its basically ""if someone tops her, it will be the last episode because she did ******* *******, a signature move. SOOOOO not fair.

After what happened with the ending to Pretty Rhythm Dear My Future, I thought that was it for Pretty Rhythm and Rainbow Live was going to muck it all up and make it unwatchable..  boy was I wrong! This series has kept with the storyline which starts a bit slow but once you see a climax happen, it happens fast and hard and leads into the next! Now as for someone that was and still is a shounen anime watcher, it has some elements that wouldn't be expected from this series from an outside view:1: The...character development is on an episode basis as in which one episode could be based on one character and then the next would move on to the next and so on and I liked that since it makes you learn more about the character and cheer them on as they do their episodic Prism Show2: As mentioned, each episode has a Prism Show (with exception with a couple) and give you something to look forward to at the end of an episode and some of them lead as a set up into the next episode and heightens the excitement of the story.3: The soundtrack is great and where there's a dramatic or sad moment going on, the music complements it and also, some of the previous seasons ost can be hear which is a plus.4: The characters look like they fit in a teen anime and the designs aren't that bad for a show that's main moments are for powerful story and exciting Prism Shows.Now as for the minus's:1. Sometimes I wonder to myself what they're trying to shoot for because with that episodic story, sometimes, the story changes and never goes back and characters are forgotten.2: It can be predictable to see who is better than someone by in the order that they appear which means that even though they look like they could do it, they won't because they're a secondary character and won't catch up to the main character.So with all that, Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live is in no means perfect but has the elements to be a blast even for someone that isn't used to watching these kind of shows. give it a try, you won't be dissapointed! :) character development is on an episode basis as in which one episode could be based on one character and then the next would move on to the next and so on and I liked that since it makes you learn more about the character and cheer them on as they do their episodic Prism Show2: As mentioned, each episode has a Prism Show (with exception with a couple) and give you something to look forward to at the end of an episode and some of them lead as a set up into the next episode and heightens the excitement of the story.3: The soundtrack is great and where there's a dramatic or sad moment going on, the music complements it and also, some of the previous seasons ost can be hear which is a plus.4: The characters look like they fit in a teen anime and the designs aren't that bad for a show that's main moments are for powerful story and exciting Prism Shows.Now as for the minus's:1.

Often they start off light to allow viewers to explore the characters of the story, dropping hints of crucial incidents about to come and then delve into a formidable trial in the second half which portrays both physical and emotional challenges beautifully....As an anime intended to be enjoyed for all ages, the creators include friendship, familial relationships and romance that define the struggles for both middle school students to adults.If you have never seen Pretty Rhythm and find Prism Shows- a new type of entertainment that combines singing, dancing, fashion and ice-skating, completely ridiculous, it's normal. It's one of the plot devices that can easily be overlooked.Art- 9/10The art style is colorful and not boring at all. They have pretty neat graphics and the shock faces are the best. The character designs allow us to easily remember them too. June's hair is already enough proof that they weren't lazy with the art.Also hands down one of the best CG performances that I have and may will ever witness.Sound- 10/10Perfect score. Even as an idol anime, there are in fact a variety of different genres that portray the image of each character effectively. Also, when multiple characters come together to create a new show, it's interesting to see the representation of their combined image through their music. With a variety of different styles, it's likely that you would take an interest in at least one song; however I actually loved them all.Characters 8/10The main character, Naru Ayase, is a ditz and the most asked question is whether she is portrayed as a typical shoujo main character. Not going to lie, yes she is, but there are still a few perks about her that is unique. Also, the other seven characters also end up getting a fair amount of screen time dedicated to their story, they are as much of a main character as Naru and there is something to gain from their point of view. All have flaws, but the point is that all the characters grow and soon learn to become better versions of themselves.The only problem is that the role distribution is a little strange and makes one question whether the main trio are actually the main characters. Although Naru, Ito and Ann have a lot of focus in the beginning, more supporting roles end up being crucial to the story; as such it's not quite a character-driven anime as it is story-driven.Enjoyment 10/10Ever since I finished Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live, I never got over it for years. I may have now but sometimes I go back to it and remember how good the story and performances were.Overall 8/10Before I finished the anime, I actually gave this season a perfect score because you can sense the heavy workload the creators must have incorporated into this series and up until the final few episodes and there was a huge suspense building into the actual climax as more and more CG performances were incorporated into the anime.However, upon actually reaching the last episode I ended up with mixed feelings. Many were unhappy with the outcome, while others thought it was more realistic and made sense. They didn't really follow the traditional conventions of a competition anime where the main character continually strives to be the best which wasn't desirable for most fans. Instead, they chose a more realistic outcome that focuses on each individual's priorities and intentions, and one that is free of plot armor which I believe will most likely trigger disappointment. There was nothing in particular that made the story worse, it was simply less enjoyable upon reaching the last couple of episodes.

Its clear that this is a shoujo anime who's target audience are young girls, however its the type of anime that'll generally leave you feeling really happyStoryI feel that the story is good but if you're looking for an anime with a lot of depth, this definetely isnt the anime you're looking for. This anime is aimed for young girls. This isnt the anime thats going to be that anime that makes you think this was the most amazing anime of all time. It's still a good anime however....Like i said before, the story is set up in a way to leave you feeling happy in a way which is why i would say its good. Girls in the target age would probably give this a 10i know i would if i was maybe......12 or below , however im 21 ^^;Like hamtaro, i really enjoyed it as a kid, and if i saw it now i would still enjoy it but not as much as if i were that ageArtAll of the girls are really cute. They're all look different and they're appearance match well with their characters. The penguins are all especially cute too. the figure skating and the spins are beautiful. I find myself feeling excited whenever the girls are about to have a prism show and im always excited to see new pairings with the girls and wondering what theyre prism shows will look like. I especially like the costumes. They suit all of the characters really well. I love the whole rainbow colored thing and even the boys are all cute. Im sure theyre there for little girl fan service. The jump from animated to 3d took some getting used to thoughSoundI love all of the songs that i've heard in this show. In the beginning of the song, all of the girls sing and dance to the same song and in exactly the same way. They go on later to have their own individual songs and each of their individual songs suit their personalities well like their costumes. I love all of their songs. I feel like each of the songs suits each of the girls really well as well as the musical instruments.CharactersFor a lighthearted show, the characters have a considerable amount of depth. The anime lets you know the background of each character which isnt particularly good for each character. For some characters, their family members are very fun and interesting. For other characters, they're families can have a negative effects it has on each of the girls and their skating. They're skating ability seems to be directly linked to their growth as individuals. The more they grow as people, the more spins they can do and the happier and more confident each girls is and the happier we feel as an audience for each charcter.EnjoymentI enjoyed this.

The music in the anime is not completely original especially the opening theme during few prism shows called Boy Meets Girl. Although the artwork and the sound are somewhat good, but what I am sick and tired of are the characters and the plot of the show. It’s stupid enough to combine figure skating and dancing in anime, but going overboard with flying penguins turning into musical instruments. The Prism Live part is where it really gone downhill as in playing musical instruments while ice-skating at...the same time is both reckless and even dumber than before. I would rather watch Aikatsu than something appalling like Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream and Rainbow Live. The only exception in Pretty Rhythm is Dear My Future just because Puretty is starring in it. And “yes,” I’m a big fan of Puretty after their debut and I even downloaded the Japanese and Korean versions of their songs.Anyways, let’s get back to the characters and plot where I hate the most. A mysterious girl who comes from another dimension called the “Prism World” lands smack dab into Earth. More specifically, Japan where a Naïve girl named Naru and the others lived in currently. Well to be frank, another world where there’s prism show 24/7 is the dumbest thing I ever heard. Speaking of Naru, the entire happy-go-lucky kind of girl is stereotypical and pathetic. While Ann is defying her dad to do prism shows and become a patisserie, but act as a slave to a talking penguin in a robot suit. Heck, even a deaf person will know something is off with the Prism Stone Owner. I also get annoyed by the DJ who always say cool ever time. That talking penguin ought to be stuffed and mounted as that thing is nothing more than three things, which are it is a pest, a parasite, and a nuisance. As for that Ito girl, she acts all antisocial throughout most of the show. Edel Rose staff and stupid are just extremely stupid into thinking ice-skating and dancing would be step one to stardom.Anyways, worst Anime that Tatsunoko has ever made. It is not exactly that studio’s crowning achievement.

He is a genius kid who finds great interest in researching new and bizarre phenomena. The film is structured quite well and uses a lot of metaphors through the animation and storytelling to represent the coming-of-age of his character. This film does have a bloated run-time of about two hours and it compromised some of my enjoyment. The dialogue is poorly written and attempts at humour in the film don't quite cut it. I do appreciate the representation of...the mystery behind the penguins and the phenomena as a metaphor to discovery, exploration, and learning. This film is good to analyse as it presents metaphors in an effective way to tell a story.The animation is decent for the most part. There are moments of extremely fast motion and travel that are depicted in this film which ends up being poorly animated. The animation in these select few scenes felt lazy and sloppily animated. The animation still deserves some praise.The soundtrack is quite good. I liked the transition from the introduction to the opening theme. The songs used throughout this film fit the scenes' moods and added a sense of joy. I love the ending theme as the credits roll after a satisfying ending.The characters were written and developed well in this anime film. The sense of the boy's determination and excitement of further developing his research is portrayed well. Some of the characters' actions felt a little forced but there was one scene where there was a conversation with the boy and his sister which tied up to the ending and connected all the dots. This film doesn't fully explain itself until the very end but it is satisfying to see the films ending scene nonetheless.To be honest, there were moments that I didn't enjoy watching but I did enjoy the ending quite a bit. The lead up to the ending wasn't enjoyable and this film takes its time to fully explain itself. The humour in this film along with a lot of the dialogue didn't feel like it quite fit in the film which impacted my overall enjoyment of this film.I'm not sure if I would recommend this anime to anyone but I do have to say that it's an anime film that has a lot of metaphors and imagery that can be analysed and interpreted differently to discover a completely different and beautiful meaning behind its message of growing up, the reality behind maturity, and overall life events that occur when maturing and growing up.

If you know you\'re going to see it, see it on the biggest possible screen, you won\'t regret it.That said its not without its faults, there is one overlying issue, and a couple less intrusive issues that mean my enjoyment does need to be qualified.First and foremost the art is easily 10/10. Just absolutely gorgeous graphical quality, solid animation, the framing occasionally questionable but that\'s an issue for later.The story on the other hand suffers heavily. I could just leave it at: ""This movie only exists for visuals"" but theres definitely a...lot to be said, its too bad there isn\'t enough committal to any individual theme. Through the story the themes that come up off the top of my head are: ""Scientific process,"" some level of ""Trusting others,"" ""Understanding love as one comes of age."" among othersThe first is in service of the mystery element in the plot, which is executed passably. While I personally didn\'t think it was a well constructed aspect, this is probably enough of a plot/conflict to tide over casual viewers.The second only comes up explicitly once or twice, its not given enough emphasis to feel substantial but it comes up often enough that it felt like it could be built on.The third is a lot more pathos appeal, I don\'t if I can judge it, its probably more up to the viewer if the pathos hits them towards the end. There is an issue stemming from this theme though, its used to justify a lot of male gaze, which definitely isn\'t a great excuseThere are a number of minor themes that don\'t really get worked through, like the use of chess and/or science to bridge the generation gap. Or bullying and redemption, and offshoot themes from there. Just generally speaking characters are not used all that well throughout the work, although they aren\'t egregious either.That lacking overall writing and theming being the biggest issue aside, in terms of smaller issues there are a number of tonally off scenes towards the beginning (some of which i suppose are meant to pay off towards the end but others are pretty straightforewardly out of place).

I merely thought it was disappointingly mediocre when I finished it a few weeks ago, but the more I\'ve thought about it, the worse it\'s become.Coming from someone who loves some of the previous works of the author (Tatami Galaxy, Uchouten Kazoku), I was pretty stoked for this. A more recent movie, The Night is Young, Walk on Girl wasn\'t my favorite anime movie of all time, but it had some decent pieces that was really just hampered by Yuasa\'s over indulgence in his artistic ego. I felt like a different director this time could really bring this movie to...life. And I love penguins; they\'re cute!Instead what I got was an incoherent plot, a vapid non-story that preys off people\'s inability to properly distinguish between an aesthetic story and a lousy package masquerading as such. It envelops itself with cute penguin art and good animation that laughably fails to mask its mediocre story and characters. The other parts of the movie are pretty unremarkable so while I wouldn\'t rate it any worse for its soundtrack or ideas, they certainly didn\'t add anything substantive.But honestly, the worst part about this film isn\'t the fact that its characters are just archetypal cut outs, poor renditions of some of Tomihiko Morimi\'s better works, or that it was needlessly long for how little of a story there was, or that I even lost my fondness for the penguins over the course of the movie. No, the worst part is that the movie is littered with a very feeble and perfunctory ""on the fence"" optimistic sheen about life and its circumstances, excessively abusing this veneer of optimism to give it more substance than it really has.

And I love penguins; they\'re cute!Instead what I got was an incoherent plot, a vapid non-story that preys off people\'s inability to properly distinguish between an aesthetic story and a lousy package masquerading as such. It envelops itself with cute penguin art and good animation that laughably fails to mask its mediocre story and characters. The other parts of the movie are pretty unremarkable so while I wouldn\'t rate it any worse for its soundtrack or ideas, they certainly didn\'t add anything substantive.But honestly, the worst part about this film isn\'t the fact that its characters are just archetypal cut outs, poor renditions of some of Tomihiko Morimi\'s better works, or that it was needlessly long for how little of a story there was, or that I even lost my fondness for the penguins over the course of the movie. No, the worst part is that the movie is littered with a very feeble and perfunctory ""on the fence"" optimistic sheen about life and its circumstances, excessively abusing this veneer of optimism to give it more substance than it really has.

The some translations are off and cause a ton of confusion. The original Japanese dialog is carefully crafted which is important because the witty responses are the main character\'s selling point. On the contrary, the English translations are basic and often grammatically wrong.One example of bad translation is of ""Onee-san"", one of the main characters of this movie. The closest translation would be ""Lady"" as it is written in the character list of this website. However, the English translation sometimes refers to her as ""the dentist\'s wife"" but no where in the Japanese dialog does it mention...that she is married. The English translation creates unnecessary questions like ""how did she get married?"", ""does the husband know his wife\'s history?"".Based on my second viewing of the movie, I would say 75% of the translation is incorrect, 25% being completely off. This is so unfortunate as the dialog is one of the strongest points of this movie.The movie itself is imaginative and visually pleasing. Most of the movie is in a style resembling modern Studio Ghibli with transitions to abstraction that minds me of Paprika. However, the quality of the visuals is not always consistent.

But those who will like it, like me, may well get such moral, intellectual and aesthetic pleasure from ""Penguin Highway"" which watching other animated movies will hardly bring. First of all, it should be noted that although this movie is about children, it is not at all for children and not even for most teenagers. Rather, it will resonate with young adults and mature people, especially with those who were or are fond of science fiction, and will immediately recognize the roots of “Penguin Highway” in Lem\'s “Solaris”, Lewis Carroll\'s “Alice in...Wonderland” and Heinlein juveniles. Probably fans of Satoshi Kon\'s surrealistic narration will also like “Penguin Highway”, although the drawing and the general mood here are not close to him, but rather to the creations of Studio Ghibli. As if opening the “door into summer”, this anime, along the mysterious penguin highway, will take you to a childhood full of miracles and aspirations, plunge into the atmosphere of a summer adventure, a fairy tale and a warm ocean of sincere love, accompanying your journey with excellent symphonic music filled with allusions to Bach and Bizet.For all its magic, ""Penguin Highway"" is full of subtle psychological observations and sketches related to the everyday life: protagonist\'s (Aoyama) childish curiosity and openness of mind to the new, encouraged his father, Aoyama\'s little sister\'s awareness of mortality, his inescapable absorption by the vortex of love, when Aoyama sits enchanted by the face of the sleeping Lady, feeling joy and marveling every tiny detail which makes it perfect, his boyish interest in his beloved\'s breasts (which he even turned into a kind of ""psychological anchor"", as thinking about these Lady’s charms helps Aoyama cope with anger and irritation), Aoyama\'s stoicism and gradually acquired ability to understand others, immature manifestations of Hamamoto\'s jealousy and Suzuki\'s love. Such a combination of realism and psychologism with surrealism can lead to the false conclusion that the ""Penguin Highway"" is a representative of magical realism. But it is not so - this is hard science fiction, which, like Lem\'s ""Solaris"", raises the question of the limitations of rational knowledge and, like Tarkovsky\'s interpretation of ""Solaris"" and C.S. Lewis` philosophical essay ""The Abolition of Man"", supplements it with the question of the ethical boundaries of scientific research and the significance of love and morality, their relations with rationality when confronted with the unknown.Perhaps the main asset of ""Penguin Highway"" is the wonderful characters, especially the couple of main characters. Aoyama, although a ten-year-old boy, is as far from your “ordinary schoolboy” or the stereotypical child in anime in general as possible. Our hero is a true follower of the philosophy of stoicism, like reincarnated Marcus Aurelius. He is confident, fearless, extremely intelligent, adamant and charismatic. His character is so vividly and boldly spelled out that the rest, even rather non-standard characters except maybe for his beloved Lady, noticeably fade against his background. Aoyama has strong logical mind, an irrepressible thirst for knowledge, a vivid imagination, a strong character and firm principles. He, as a real philosopher, is driven by love for truth and love for beauty, and also by love for the Other, which does not allow him to turn into a complete egoist. He is passionate about solving mysteries, although Aoyama\'s logical mind sometimes makes it difficult for him to understand the feelings of those around him. Thus he seems incomplete, lacking insight and empathy.On the example of the protagonist, the anime has a good moral message, including with regard to raising a boy who is not just a ""enthusiastic nerd"", like secondary character Uchida, but also quite a courageous, even fearless young man, who does not shy away from violence, if necessary, as well as a loyal friend and a principled person with an unshakable sense of dignity. He builds and orderly follows hierarchy of values, not wanting to compromise it in his pursuit for the ideal, putting all his love and reason into achieving it.To match Aoyama there is the aforementioned Lady (""onee-san"" in the original, which literally translates as ""older sister"" but in the context means Miss or Young Lady) - beautiful about 20-year-old girl with graceful hourglass figure, kind, cheerful and witty, who in her free from spending with Aoyama time, is engaged in fixing holes in teeth (she is dental assistant) and in the space-time continuum. Aoyama is utterly in love with her, deeply caring for the Lady, enjoying watching her face while also being passionate connoisseur of her magnificent bust. However, like Aoyama, she is also incomplete, being overly dreamy and carefree. The Lady often spends time with Aoyama, teasing him, chatting and training him to master the game of chess.There are also slightly more stereotypical secondary characters - Aoyama\'s friend, a timid nerd Uchida, the excellent student Hamamoto who is in love with Aoyama and jealous of the Lady, the hooligan Suzuki who is in love with Hamamoto and jealous of Aoyama, the wise father of Aoyama, Aoyama’s little sister - they all create beautiful backdrop, enriching and advancing the main narrative.The town in which Aoyama lives has already been studied by him, the surrounding world is logically ordered, and the plan for the future, in which Aoyama becomes a great man and marries the Lady, has been drawn up and is not subject to discussion. Interestingly, the beginning and end of the anime are accompanied by approximately the same, self-confident remarks by Aoyama which at first sound like empty boasting and yet perceived completely different afterwards.But then chaos bursts into the carefully built rational little world of Aoyama - in a town far from the ocean, Antarctic penguins appear from nowhere. Of course, this ridiculous event challenges the wunderkind\'s mind and worldview. He immediately rushed to hypothesize about the causes of the phenomenon - from lost pets or falling out of a zoo van, to mutated crows. However, events take on a completely irrational turn when it turns out that the penguins are created by the Aoyama\'s beloved Lady, and a giant sphere of oceanic water hanging in the air is found in a forest clearing outside the town. The Lady herself does not quite understand who she is, how she creates creatures and asks our little hero to solve this riddle. So Aoyama faces the real Mystery - at the same time his scientific and love interest, which can quench his thirst for knowledge and beauty.The novel (by Tomihiko Morimi) on which this anime is based as well as the anime itself have clear references to Stanislaw Lem\'s novel ""Solaris"" (Aoyama even mentions ""Stanislaw Syndrome"" at the dentist\'s) which has strict sci-fi narrative, questioning rational cognition. However the Penguin Highway novel was heavily inspired not only by the Lem\'s novel itself but by the Tarkovsky\'s interpretation of Solaris in his 1972 art film as well which is full of symbols and metaphors. “Penguin Highway” takes Tarkovsky\'s vision on the main problem (that the correct solution of the problem of relationship between the subject and the object of scientific research, the way to approach the Mystery, is to treat it not like a mere abstract object, but through empathy and love, applying high moral standards while doing so) and replaces Kris Kelvin (main character) who in the movie represents the right way to treat the Unknown but was tormented by guilt, with Aoyama - pure child with clear conscience. ""Penguin Highway"" basically deals with the same epistemological problem as ""Solaris"". This problem of limitation of rational cognition and ethical restrictions of dealing with the unknown is profoundly explained by Tarkovsky in his interview and by C.S. Lewis in ""The Abolition of Man"".Tarkovsky puts the main problem this way: ""The only thing that can be done is to try to take a critical look at the ways of our cognition: through the fight against stereotypes of thinking, with those blocks of logical stereotypes that often replace minutes of reflection for us. Facing something unknown will necessarily require strict moral discipline. That is why the father of our hero says that everything is very fragile there, meaning rather the inertia of human thinking, the way of human behavior in the face of this unknown: as yet unknown. And not for the purpose of preserving themselves, although this also matters, but for the sake of not injuring the unknown, which human thought touches for the first time"".C.S. Lewis deals with the same problem in the “The Abolition of Man”: “It is not the greatest of modern scientists who feel most sure that the object, stripped of its qualitative properties and reduced to mere quantity, is wholly real. Little scientists, and little unscientific followers of science, may think so. The great minds know very well that the object, so treated, is an artificial abstraction, that something of its reality has been lost… Many a mild-eyed scientist in pincenez, many a popular dramatist, many an amateur philosopher in our midst, means in the long run just the same as the Nazi rulers of Germany - Traditional values are to be ‘debunked’ and mankind to be cut out into some fresh shape at the will (which must, by hypothesis, be an arbitrary will) of some few lucky people in one lucky generation which has learned how to do it. The belief that we can invent ‘ideologies’ at pleasure, and the consequent treatment of mankind as mere υλη, specimens, preparations, begins to affect our very language… I suggest that from Science herself the cure might come… The regenerate science which I have in mind would not do even to minerals and vegetables what modern science threatens to do to man himself. When it explained it would not explain away. When it spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the “It” it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the “Thou”-situation”.One might think that a conflict cannot but arise when Aoyama falls in love with the Lady - the same phenomenon becomes both the subject of Aoyama\'s scientific interest and the subject of his love interest. Modern science had rejected many moral norms and is trying to remove the ""rigid fetters"" of any ethics, denying objective value and turning even man into ""nature"" - subject to dismemberment, study and modification. Sartorius in the “Solaris” argues that conducting experiments on “visitors”, including performing autopsy, is totally acceptable - he considers such behavior to be “humane” and in line with scientific approach he believes in. As Lewis describes this worldview: “we have been trying, like Lear, to have it both ways: to lay down our human prerogative and yet at the same time to retain it. It is impossible. either we are rational spirit obliged for ever to obey the absolute values, or else we are mere nature to be kneaded and cut into new shapes for the pleasures of masters who must, by hypothesis, have no motive but their own ‘natural’ impulses… A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery. Without the dogma of objective value, no power is possible except tyranny, and no subordination except slavery”.Aoyama faces with what sooner or later any inquisitive and honest mind faces - beyond a certain limit, that is limit of rational cognition, beyond the ""end of the world"" lies something unanswered, something which can not be reduced to rationally comprehensible object, and only choice left is either to believe that this Mystery is nothing, chaos, which has no meaning and value, or there follows recognition of the existence of absolute values, axioms that cannot be proven, but on which the Universe and logic are based. He came to the point where, in the words of one of the heroes of ""Solaris"" by Soderbergh, ""there are no answers, only choices"". Aoyama\'s choice was the recognition of the existence of axioms - the Lady, by herself, is more valuable than trying to solve her Mystery at the expense of harming the Lady. She is not a soulless subject of study, an abstract chaos of the primordial ocean, “nature” which is to be explored and tamed. For Aoyama the Lady is a person, self-containing value, and love for her, which is also rationally incomprehensible, means much more for him than thirst for knowledge or recognition in the scientific world. For Aoyama the Lady, in Buber\'s words, is not ""It"", but ""Thou"". He doesn’t want her to be harmed. Feeling the threat that other scientists may deny the Lady her self-value and turn her into an abstract subject of scientific research destined to be heartlessly dissected (as it happened with ""visitors"" in ""Solaris""), Aoyama first tries to dissolve his small research circle, so that information about the abilities of the Lady may not become known to other scientists, and finally refuses to reveal the Mystery of the Lady to Hamamoto’s father. Aoyama sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to become famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry.There is an anecdote told by Aoyama early on in the movie in which he compares the Lady\'s breasts and his mother\'s breasts, which are abstractly belong to the same category of objects, but in reality affect him completely differently. In fact that\'s how aforementioned epistemological problem may be simply illustrated: the subjects of scientific study should not be treated as abstractions, but rather as quite specific phenomena, to each of which, despite the quantitative similarity, a special, qualitatively different attitude should be formed. The object, stripped of its qualitative properties and reduced to mere quantity, is not wholly real.Aoyama\'s love, openness of mind and honesty with himself allows him to calmly go where many confined scientific minds stumble - either due to self-deception, or weakness of mind, or even maybe due to outright thirst for power and wealth. ""The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. but they were twins. They were born of the same impulse... There is something which unites magic and applied science while separating both from the wisdom of earlier ages. For the wise men of old the cardinal problem had been how to conform the soul to reality, and the solution had been knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both, in the practice of this technique, are ready to do things hitherto regarded as disgusting and impious... You will read in some critics that Faustus has a thirst for knowledge. In reality, he hardly mentions it. It is not truth he wants from the devils, but gold and guns and girls... In the same spirit Bacon condemns those who value knowledge as an end in itself: this, for him, is to use as a mistress for pleasure what ought to be a spouse for fruit. The true object is to extend Man’s power to the performance of all things possible. He rejects magic because it does not work; but his goal is that of the magician"".Aoyama is alien to such an approach - he does not seek to use knowledge in order to gain power over the Lady, to subjugate her, to use her for his own purposes against her will. In this sense, he is not a modern scientist, but rather a philosopher in the classical sense, a natural philosopher, or even a theologian. He strives to knowledge only in order to walk along the narrow, accessible only to a few, ""Penguin Highway"" to meet again with the one he loves - with the Lady, to return to the Mystery, beyond the ""end of the world"" - the limits of human rational cognition, where is ""God playing around"". So once selfless monks, exploring the world created by God in search of traces of God, laid the foundations of genuine science in Western European monasteries, which was only later profaned and made practical instead of formerly popular secular magic and alchemy, which were abandoned.Another layer of the ""Penguin Highway"" is the interaction between male and female, where the male logic of Aoyama is called upon to unravel and structure chaos - the “primal ocean” which represents feminine principle of the Lady, which is the Mystery, opposite to the light of Aoyama\'s Logos. After all, the Lady herself does not understand who she is, why she appeared and where she draws her strength from. Like the heroine of “Solaris” she doubts her humanity and reliability of her memories before her meeting with Aoyama - perhaps she is manifestation of the Ocean created out of Aoyama’s dreams. Although the Lady has the energy of the chaos, a huge potential for creation, she is not able to streamline and control it without Aoyama, who brings meaning, structuring the world and Lady\'s abilities.Tarkovsky said that ""Solaris, as it was, materializes the vilest thing that was in these people, as if it moves a mirror towards them, and they are forced to look at themselves... A man and the Ocean, roughly speaking, cannot understand each other for a single moment, because they have nothing in common. And we are talking about the fact that contact - if we can talk about contact - first of all arises here in the soul, in the spiritual sphere: for a man. But as they communicate, something else happens that Kris himself does not expect. From this ""scheme"" Harey - from communication with him - turns into human. She is animated as a result of this feeling of love and became real human being"".Indeed, even though Aoyama structured the chaotic nature of the Lady by his rationality (Logos) it is through Aoyama\'s love the Lady became real human being. Her imitation of Aoyama\'s strictly rational experimental approach to solving problems (by abstinence from food) leads her to creation of numerous Jabberwocky which ate penguins and thus enlarged the Ocean from which the Lady drew her energy. This ""rational"" yet selfish scientific approach of hers potentially may have lead to the catastrophe. However Aoyama\'s sheer love and worry for the Lady evoked reciprocal love in her. Love means so much for Aoyama that he even sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to became famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry. She in turn loves Aoyama so much that she sacrifices her presence in his world in order to protect it from destruction. Thus Aoyama\'s male rationality in interaction with Lady’s female chaos gave it structure and allowed her to understand herself, but it was Aoyama’s love for this alien being (the Lady) which aroused reciprocal love in her and led her to selfless act in order to save Aoyama (in a way, like Harey sacrificed herself in ""Solaris"" in order to save Kris). On the other hand, through love for the Lady, Aoyama is also ""humanizes"" in a way - he goes beyond the boundaries of his ego, overcomes the narrow limits of any egoism, even scientific, and puts Lady\'s well-being above his own good (when he gets sick, he worries about her more than about himself), learns to understand other people not only logically, but through empathy.Symbolically here both male and female became complete through their mutual love - the Lady learns about herself, of how to use her abilities and accepts her responsibility to repair the hole in the Universe, while Aoyama gains empathy and insight through his love for the Lady, realizing that rational analysis and theoretical hypothesis are not the same with reality, that abstract object is something different than particular phenomenon, that not all mysteries should or could be solved and that if they should, they must be treated carefully in order to avoid harm. He grew up through realization that answers he seeks for, including the answer to his love for the Lady, lie not in the field of rational cognition.The other characters of the anime reacts differently to the Ocean, which represents different approaches among humans to the Unknown - fear (Uchida), aggression (Suzuki), strictly abstract interest complicated by jealousy (Hamamoto), etc. But there is no dialogue between these different points of view like in the movie interpretations of “Solaris”. Aoyama does not seek to convince anyone of the humanity of the Lady, unlike Kris, who is trying to prove, first of all, to himself, the humanity of Harey. Aoyama, on the other hand, simply acts out of strong convictions. And the mood of “Penguin Highway” is completely different than that of “Solaris” - bright, similar to the sad joy of the last days of summer with the sound of “Summer Moved On” by a-ha.There are many psychological observations in this movie regarding childhood (first love, relationship with parents, openness of mind, dealing with bullies, awareness of mortality, etc.), but it would be a mistake to consider ""Penguin Highway"" as a coming of age story. Indeed there is no development of Aoyama\'s character - the anime opens and ends with the pretty much the same speech of the protagonist. In fact ""Penguin Highway"" represents idea which is opposite to coming of age. It is about returning to innocence, to child-like pure heart, open-mindeness and to the immediate perception of the world. The only scientist (Dr. Kris Kelvin) in the “Solaris” who managed to establish contact with the Ocean did it not through rational observation, but through empathy - he established emotional connection with Solaris through his deceased wife, recreated by Solaris. Yet as her death was his guilt (at least he blamed himself) this connection could not last long as both of them were tortured by Kris\' guilt. So the only solution for Kris to reach Solaris was to return to his roots, return to his home and innocence - to childhood. Solaris materialized his dream by creating his old family house and his father on the Ocean\'s surface - it was clear reference to the ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"". Tarkovsky\'s movie begins and ends on Earth, in the protagonist\'s house.We can find reference to this in the anime, when the Lady tells Aoyama in his dream that ""she has always been on Earth"" as well as river which ends where it begins and words that ""everything ends and returns to where it started"". ""If you go far enough, you return to where you started"" says the Lady to Aoyama, stating that she is on Earth despite Aoyama\'s travel to another planet. While saying good bye to him later in the movie, she hints that he\'ll be able to solve her mystery after becoming astronaut and going to space - ""then I want you to come and find me"". This also alludes to Kris\' returning to home from the space in order to reach his ideal, but in the same way this ""returning"" of Kris was symbolic as in reality he comes to replica of his home which was artificially recreated by Solaris as Kris at last become able to establish communication with the Ocean through empathy.Aoyama is virtually Kris which has returned to his childhood, with clear conscience, highly intelligent but still innocent. The Ocean (manifested in the Lady) and Aoyama also established connection not through rationality, but through empathy, through mutual love, which gave common ground to completely alien beings. For Aoyama the same ""returning to home"", returning to the Ocean by penguin highway (it is a path by which penguins go to and from the ocean), in other words reaching his ideal (the Lady), means to grow up ""good adult"" not just intellectually, but first of all morally, through realization of limitations of rational cognition. Thus Aoyama’s growing up lays through overcoming rational reductionism which in a way means returning to childhood when phenomena precepted immediately as particular and whole. The answer to the Mystery lies out of the reach of scientific approach in the rationally incomprehensible  sphere of human spirit and only through devoted love and determined strive for the Lady Aoyama may be able to reunite with her - the Mystery.However, the complex epistemological message of the ""Penguin Highway"" will not at all prevent you from enjoying watching this anime without understanding its meaning at all. Many will enjoy the bright, beautifully drawn summer adventure, the feeling of childhood, enchanting music and the atmosphere of a fairy tale, the psychological observations, the relationship between children and parents, not to mention the unusual, humorous and loving relationship between Aoyama and the Lady (however, in order to perceive this unusual relationship, many may need to experience the same level of struggle with stereotypes of thinking and accept openness to the perception of the unknown, as scientists in their study of Solaris). Someone may perceive this anime as a children\'s fairy tale or a coming of age story, someone as magical realism, a surreal adventure or a first love story - all these will not interfere with enjoying this wonderful masterpiece. This movie is so unusual and magical that it easily became my favorite anime. Wonderland” and Heinlein juveniles. Probably fans of Satoshi Kon\'s surrealistic narration will also like “Penguin Highway”, although the drawing and the general mood here are not close to him, but rather to the creations of Studio Ghibli. As if opening the “door into summer”, this anime, along the mysterious penguin highway, will take you to a childhood full of miracles and aspirations, plunge into the atmosphere of a summer adventure, a fairy tale and a warm ocean of sincere love, accompanying your journey with excellent symphonic music filled with allusions to Bach and Bizet.For all its magic, ""Penguin Highway"" is full of subtle psychological observations and sketches related to the everyday life: protagonist\'s (Aoyama) childish curiosity and openness of mind to the new, encouraged his father, Aoyama\'s little sister\'s awareness of mortality, his inescapable absorption by the vortex of love, when Aoyama sits enchanted by the face of the sleeping Lady, feeling joy and marveling every tiny detail which makes it perfect, his boyish interest in his beloved\'s breasts (which he even turned into a kind of ""psychological anchor"", as thinking about these Lady’s charms helps Aoyama cope with anger and irritation), Aoyama\'s stoicism and gradually acquired ability to understand others, immature manifestations of Hamamoto\'s jealousy and Suzuki\'s love. Such a combination of realism and psychologism with surrealism can lead to the false conclusion that the ""Penguin Highway"" is a representative of magical realism. But it is not so - this is hard science fiction, which, like Lem\'s ""Solaris"", raises the question of the limitations of rational knowledge and, like Tarkovsky\'s interpretation of ""Solaris"" and C.S.

The belief that we can invent ‘ideologies’ at pleasure, and the consequent treatment of mankind as mere υλη, specimens, preparations, begins to affect our very language… I suggest that from Science herself the cure might come… The regenerate science which I have in mind would not do even to minerals and vegetables what modern science threatens to do to man himself. When it explained it would not explain away. When it spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the “It” it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the “Thou”-situation”.One might think that a conflict cannot but arise when Aoyama falls in love with the Lady - the same phenomenon becomes both the subject of Aoyama\'s scientific interest and the subject of his love interest. Modern science had rejected many moral norms and is trying to remove the ""rigid fetters"" of any ethics, denying objective value and turning even man into ""nature"" - subject to dismemberment, study and modification. Sartorius in the “Solaris” argues that conducting experiments on “visitors”, including performing autopsy, is totally acceptable - he considers such behavior to be “humane” and in line with scientific approach he believes in. As Lewis describes this worldview: “we have been trying, like Lear, to have it both ways: to lay down our human prerogative and yet at the same time to retain it. It is impossible. either we are rational spirit obliged for ever to obey the absolute values, or else we are mere nature to be kneaded and cut into new shapes for the pleasures of masters who must, by hypothesis, have no motive but their own ‘natural’ impulses… A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery. Without the dogma of objective value, no power is possible except tyranny, and no subordination except slavery”.Aoyama faces with what sooner or later any inquisitive and honest mind faces - beyond a certain limit, that is limit of rational cognition, beyond the ""end of the world"" lies something unanswered, something which can not be reduced to rationally comprehensible object, and only choice left is either to believe that this Mystery is nothing, chaos, which has no meaning and value, or there follows recognition of the existence of absolute values, axioms that cannot be proven, but on which the Universe and logic are based. He came to the point where, in the words of one of the heroes of ""Solaris"" by Soderbergh, ""there are no answers, only choices"". Aoyama\'s choice was the recognition of the existence of axioms - the Lady, by herself, is more valuable than trying to solve her Mystery at the expense of harming the Lady. She is not a soulless subject of study, an abstract chaos of the primordial ocean, “nature” which is to be explored and tamed. For Aoyama the Lady is a person, self-containing value, and love for her, which is also rationally incomprehensible, means much more for him than thirst for knowledge or recognition in the scientific world. For Aoyama the Lady, in Buber\'s words, is not ""It"", but ""Thou"". He doesn’t want her to be harmed. Feeling the threat that other scientists may deny the Lady her self-value and turn her into an abstract subject of scientific research destined to be heartlessly dissected (as it happened with ""visitors"" in ""Solaris""), Aoyama first tries to dissolve his small research circle, so that information about the abilities of the Lady may not become known to other scientists, and finally refuses to reveal the Mystery of the Lady to Hamamoto’s father. Aoyama sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to become famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry.There is an anecdote told by Aoyama early on in the movie in which he compares the Lady\'s breasts and his mother\'s breasts, which are abstractly belong to the same category of objects, but in reality affect him completely differently. In fact that\'s how aforementioned epistemological problem may be simply illustrated: the subjects of scientific study should not be treated as abstractions, but rather as quite specific phenomena, to each of which, despite the quantitative similarity, a special, qualitatively different attitude should be formed. The object, stripped of its qualitative properties and reduced to mere quantity, is not wholly real.Aoyama\'s love, openness of mind and honesty with himself allows him to calmly go where many confined scientific minds stumble - either due to self-deception, or weakness of mind, or even maybe due to outright thirst for power and wealth. ""The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. but they were twins. They were born of the same impulse... There is something which unites magic and applied science while separating both from the wisdom of earlier ages. For the wise men of old the cardinal problem had been how to conform the soul to reality, and the solution had been knowledge, self-discipline, and virtue. For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both, in the practice of this technique, are ready to do things hitherto regarded as disgusting and impious... You will read in some critics that Faustus has a thirst for knowledge. In reality, he hardly mentions it. It is not truth he wants from the devils, but gold and guns and girls... In the same spirit Bacon condemns those who value knowledge as an end in itself: this, for him, is to use as a mistress for pleasure what ought to be a spouse for fruit. The true object is to extend Man’s power to the performance of all things possible. He rejects magic because it does not work; but his goal is that of the magician"".Aoyama is alien to such an approach - he does not seek to use knowledge in order to gain power over the Lady, to subjugate her, to use her for his own purposes against her will. In this sense, he is not a modern scientist, but rather a philosopher in the classical sense, a natural philosopher, or even a theologian. He strives to knowledge only in order to walk along the narrow, accessible only to a few, ""Penguin Highway"" to meet again with the one he loves - with the Lady, to return to the Mystery, beyond the ""end of the world"" - the limits of human rational cognition, where is ""God playing around"". So once selfless monks, exploring the world created by God in search of traces of God, laid the foundations of genuine science in Western European monasteries, which was only later profaned and made practical instead of formerly popular secular magic and alchemy, which were abandoned.Another layer of the ""Penguin Highway"" is the interaction between male and female, where the male logic of Aoyama is called upon to unravel and structure chaos - the “primal ocean” which represents feminine principle of the Lady, which is the Mystery, opposite to the light of Aoyama\'s Logos. After all, the Lady herself does not understand who she is, why she appeared and where she draws her strength from. Like the heroine of “Solaris” she doubts her humanity and reliability of her memories before her meeting with Aoyama - perhaps she is manifestation of the Ocean created out of Aoyama’s dreams. Although the Lady has the energy of the chaos, a huge potential for creation, she is not able to streamline and control it without Aoyama, who brings meaning, structuring the world and Lady\'s abilities.Tarkovsky said that ""Solaris, as it was, materializes the vilest thing that was in these people, as if it moves a mirror towards them, and they are forced to look at themselves... A man and the Ocean, roughly speaking, cannot understand each other for a single moment, because they have nothing in common. And we are talking about the fact that contact - if we can talk about contact - first of all arises here in the soul, in the spiritual sphere: for a man. But as they communicate, something else happens that Kris himself does not expect. From this ""scheme"" Harey - from communication with him - turns into human. She is animated as a result of this feeling of love and became real human being"".Indeed, even though Aoyama structured the chaotic nature of the Lady by his rationality (Logos) it is through Aoyama\'s love the Lady became real human being. Her imitation of Aoyama\'s strictly rational experimental approach to solving problems (by abstinence from food) leads her to creation of numerous Jabberwocky which ate penguins and thus enlarged the Ocean from which the Lady drew her energy. This ""rational"" yet selfish scientific approach of hers potentially may have lead to the catastrophe. However Aoyama\'s sheer love and worry for the Lady evoked reciprocal love in her. Love means so much for Aoyama that he even sacrifices his scientific curiosity and his chance to became famous in order to save the Lady from scientific enquiry. She in turn loves Aoyama so much that she sacrifices her presence in his world in order to protect it from destruction. Thus Aoyama\'s male rationality in interaction with Lady’s female chaos gave it structure and allowed her to understand herself, but it was Aoyama’s love for this alien being (the Lady) which aroused reciprocal love in her and led her to selfless act in order to save Aoyama (in a way, like Harey sacrificed herself in ""Solaris"" in order to save Kris). On the other hand, through love for the Lady, Aoyama is also ""humanizes"" in a way - he goes beyond the boundaries of his ego, overcomes the narrow limits of any egoism, even scientific, and puts Lady\'s well-being above his own good (when he gets sick, he worries about her more than about himself), learns to understand other people not only logically, but through empathy.Symbolically here both male and female became complete through their mutual love - the Lady learns about herself, of how to use her abilities and accepts her responsibility to repair the hole in the Universe, while Aoyama gains empathy and insight through his love for the Lady, realizing that rational analysis and theoretical hypothesis are not the same with reality, that abstract object is something different than particular phenomenon, that not all mysteries should or could be solved and that if they should, they must be treated carefully in order to avoid harm. He grew up through realization that answers he seeks for, including the answer to his love for the Lady, lie not in the field of rational cognition.The other characters of the anime reacts differently to the Ocean, which represents different approaches among humans to the Unknown - fear (Uchida), aggression (Suzuki), strictly abstract interest complicated by jealousy (Hamamoto), etc. But there is no dialogue between these different points of view like in the movie interpretations of “Solaris”. Aoyama does not seek to convince anyone of the humanity of the Lady, unlike Kris, who is trying to prove, first of all, to himself, the humanity of Harey. Aoyama, on the other hand, simply acts out of strong convictions. And the mood of “Penguin Highway” is completely different than that of “Solaris” - bright, similar to the sad joy of the last days of summer with the sound of “Summer Moved On” by a-ha.There are many psychological observations in this movie regarding childhood (first love, relationship with parents, openness of mind, dealing with bullies, awareness of mortality, etc.), but it would be a mistake to consider ""Penguin Highway"" as a coming of age story. Indeed there is no development of Aoyama\'s character - the anime opens and ends with the pretty much the same speech of the protagonist. In fact ""Penguin Highway"" represents idea which is opposite to coming of age. It is about returning to innocence, to child-like pure heart, open-mindeness and to the immediate perception of the world. The only scientist (Dr. Kris Kelvin) in the “Solaris” who managed to establish contact with the Ocean did it not through rational observation, but through empathy - he established emotional connection with Solaris through his deceased wife, recreated by Solaris. Yet as her death was his guilt (at least he blamed himself) this connection could not last long as both of them were tortured by Kris\' guilt. So the only solution for Kris to reach Solaris was to return to his roots, return to his home and innocence - to childhood. Solaris materialized his dream by creating his old family house and his father on the Ocean\'s surface - it was clear reference to the ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"". Tarkovsky\'s movie begins and ends on Earth, in the protagonist\'s house.We can find reference to this in the anime, when the Lady tells Aoyama in his dream that ""she has always been on Earth"" as well as river which ends where it begins and words that ""everything ends and returns to where it started"". ""If you go far enough, you return to where you started"" says the Lady to Aoyama, stating that she is on Earth despite Aoyama\'s travel to another planet. While saying good bye to him later in the movie, she hints that he\'ll be able to solve her mystery after becoming astronaut and going to space - ""then I want you to come and find me"". This also alludes to Kris\' returning to home from the space in order to reach his ideal, but in the same way this ""returning"" of Kris was symbolic as in reality he comes to replica of his home which was artificially recreated by Solaris as Kris at last become able to establish communication with the Ocean through empathy.Aoyama is virtually Kris which has returned to his childhood, with clear conscience, highly intelligent but still innocent. The Ocean (manifested in the Lady) and Aoyama also established connection not through rationality, but through empathy, through mutual love, which gave common ground to completely alien beings. For Aoyama the same ""returning to home"", returning to the Ocean by penguin highway (it is a path by which penguins go to and from the ocean), in other words reaching his ideal (the Lady), means to grow up ""good adult"" not just intellectually, but first of all morally, through realization of limitations of rational cognition. Thus Aoyama’s growing up lays through overcoming rational reductionism which in a way means returning to childhood when phenomena precepted immediately as particular and whole. The answer to the Mystery lies out of the reach of scientific approach in the rationally incomprehensible  sphere of human spirit and only through devoted love and determined strive for the Lady Aoyama may be able to reunite with her - the Mystery.However, the complex epistemological message of the ""Penguin Highway"" will not at all prevent you from enjoying watching this anime without understanding its meaning at all. Many will enjoy the bright, beautifully drawn summer adventure, the feeling of childhood, enchanting music and the atmosphere of a fairy tale, the psychological observations, the relationship between children and parents, not to mention the unusual, humorous and loving relationship between Aoyama and the Lady (however, in order to perceive this unusual relationship, many may need to experience the same level of struggle with stereotypes of thinking and accept openness to the perception of the unknown, as scientists in their study of Solaris). Someone may perceive this anime as a children\'s fairy tale or a coming of age story, someone as magical realism, a surreal adventure or a first love story - all these will not interfere with enjoying this wonderful masterpiece. This movie is so unusual and magical that it easily became my favorite anime.', ""Welcome to my review to the 2018 movie 'Penguin Highway'. It's runtime is almost 2 hours so be prepared for it. For this review I will try to limit myself from giving spoilers as much as I can. Before I forget it, this movie is done by Studio Colorado.Plot/Story: Aoyama is a very intelligent kid. He always looks for experiments and things he does not yet know. One day however, something very unusual happens. Penguins. In the middle of an empty field. As out of nowhere penguins appear everywhere in the city and Aoyama and his friends try to solve this experiment. Oh, and there...is also an older girl that is friends with Aoyama and asks him to solve a certain puzzle, a mystery for her.Now that the synopsis is out of the way, let's get this bread. This plot and movie is crazy. A lot of very weird and fascinating things happen and Aoyama and his friends get entangled into these mysteries. I won't spoil any plot-related things but it's a wild ride. That much I can say. There are also things that not necessarily make a lot of sense, even after the end of the movie. But that's okay. This movie is not immensely deep but it also doesn't want to be that. This movie exists to be a fun and weird movie. Something exciting and fantastic.Art: Outstanding. There are a large number of beautiful shots throughout this movie and you can feel how caring the guys behind this anime were. One certain segment at the end of the movie is just breathtakingly beautifully animated. It's a fest for the eyes.Sound: Very beautiful compositions throughout the movie. Not really heavy-hitting on the SXF side this movie proves its worth with good music and BGM underlining each moment. Also one shout out to the beautiful outro song.Characters: Let's start with Aoyama. An intelligent young boy, always striving for more knowledge. During this movie Aoyama experiences a number of events switching from normal to unknown, to hurtful. It is Aoyama who gets his whole share of emotions and strong moments, especially towards the finish line of this movie. The next import St character is Onee-san. She doesn't have a name and is just called Onee-san or the dentist's wife. I will call her Onee from this point on. Onee amrks the second most impactful and important person in this. Most importantly her relationship with Aoyama. It is very apparent that Aoyama likes Onee, even though their age different is....more than 10 years possibly. If some viewers might find this weird and unsettling I found it to be actually normal. It is perfectly normal at some point to suddenly be attracted to the opposite sex. Onee's importance in this movie is on the same level as Aoyama, heck they are both on the cover. The personality changes she gets throughout the almost 2 hours are significant and almost always, if not always affect also Aoyama. Other than those two we have Aoyama's male friend Uchida and the classmate Hamamoto. Uchida is a wkmp, that pretty much sums him up. At the end he does make one thing outside of his character symbolizing his growth, but since the focus is not on him at all he is pretty much irrelevant. Hamamoto on the other hand is I would say the next important character. She's really good at chess and is also very intelligent, just as Aoyama. Even thought she's also just a side character she does have a more significant role in this than  Uchida. But because of spoilers I can't tell. I can just say that she more or less acts human. As one should. There's also the class bully Suzuki but he's pretty unimportant in a lot of ways.Overall Enjoyment and verdict: Penguin Highway is an amazing movie. Exactly my kind of weird but beautiful movie. There isn't really a grand thing to get from this movie. The reason you want to watch this is because it is a fantastical experience of a pretty movie with likeable characters and a cool and freaky plot. I give this movie an outstanding 9,5/10!!!And that's it for me with this review.

See you in the next review!Bye!"", ""This is the first of these I've written, so it's less of a review and more of my own thoughts. Penguin Highway, on the surface, looks like a fun story of kids investigating a cute mystery in their town while dealing with the struggles of growing up. And it is, and a very good one at that. The artwork is great, the soundtrack is nice, and the story is easy to follow and intriguing as you peel back the layers. But if I could offer my opinion on what the film is about, I think it's there where the core of the movie is. Penguin...Highway is a movie about the mystery of life. The conflict is resolved by the end of the movie, but the mystery still goes on in a way. Not all the questions are answered, and I think that's the point. Life, which the film refers to a lot both as a journey and as a physical anomaly, isn't easy to understand. But it's when you start enjoying it, and really trying to figure it out, when its value becomes clear. I apologize if it seems like I'm rambling, and I'll end by saying: You should watch Penguin Highway; and when you're done, maybe take a few minutes to come up with your own hypotheses.

A obra pode ser dividida em três momentos, um primeiro momento espontâneo e de certa forma ingênuo, com os mistérios sendo trabalhados de forma divertida, praticamente uma brincadeira de criança.

The work can be divided into three moments, a first spontaneous and somewhat naive moment, with the mysteries being worked out in a fun way, practically child\'s play. A mystery that, if seen by adults, would be ridiculed, naivety reinforced by the protagonist himself being a child. The mysteries escalate their importance and threat over time. With the help of the experiments made by Aoyama, the universe is constantly discovering, reinventing and rediscovering itself, never leaving a moment where everything seemed to be resolved, if an answer was found, a new question was put in place.In a second moment, the universe is already consolidated, having its ideas shown and worked on, soon the narrative is no longer driven by a reconstruction of the universe and starts to have human emotions as its axis, it is at this moment where conflicts and fears will gain your spotlight. Hamamoto\'s jealousy towards Onee-san, Suzuki\'s feelings being exposed, Hamamoto\'s father interfering in the research, the ""sea"" starting to be seen as a danger, thus causing fear in the population, Aoyama\'s sister being frightened by the chance of losing his mother, Aoyama\'s concern for Onee-san will reach its peak, leading to Aoyama\'s nightmare, where the loose ends of his reasoning will connect, thus leading to a third moment.With the entry of the characters in the ""sea"", there is a kind of denial of everything that was worked on previously, the solved mysteries start to be something small compared to what they were facing, the universe starts to question even what is true or not, illustrated by Onee-san\'s conversation with Aoyama, where they argue about the veracity of their memories. A scene that takes on a special meaning given the messy world they are in, a world that seeks to disorient the viewer, there is no sense or logic about where the objects are arranged, they are just floating, dispersed in space. The ""sea"" is a world that has no rules, something that becomes clear shortly after entering this world, the water changes shape, at first it was a whale jumping, then it becomes a seagull, a unicorn, leading to Onee\'s reaction -san, ""it looks like God is playing"".In the face of all the illogical events it is possible to see a connection between penguins and the inexplicable, they are the epicenter of everything, where there were many penguins, the universe suffered a great effect, but if there were none, or almost none, the mysteries would made something plausible to explain. Another issue that governs the work is the question of the beginning of everything being the end, an idea represented by the course of the river, the place of appearance of the first penguin, will also be the place of disappearance of Onee-san, in addition to the final and initial monologue of the Aoyama, containing the same text, just adapting to the current situation.Penguin Highway does not intend to fully explain its universe, it prefers to completely take the viewer\'s understanding and disorient him, with beautiful and crazy scenes, using the penguins and Onee-san not only to connect the facts and recreate the universe, but also to allow this universe to have direct contact with the characters. está constantemente se descobrindo, reinventando e redescobrindo-se, nunca deixando um momento onde tudo parecia estar resolvido, se uma resposta era encontrada, logo em seguida já era colocada uma nova pergunta no lugar.Em um segundo o momento, o universo já se consolida, tendo suas ideias mostradas e trabalhadas, logo a narrativa deixa de ser movida por uma reconstrução do universo e passa a ter como eixo as emoções humanas, é nesse momento onde os conflitos e medos irão ganhar seu destaque.

Hamamoto\'s jealousy towards Onee-san, Suzuki\'s feelings being exposed, Hamamoto\'s father interfering in the research, the ""sea"" starting to be seen as a danger, thus causing fear in the population, Aoyama\'s sister being frightened by the chance of losing his mother, Aoyama\'s concern for Onee-san will reach its peak, leading to Aoyama\'s nightmare, where the loose ends of his reasoning will connect, thus leading to a third moment.With the entry of the characters in the ""sea"", there is a kind of denial of everything that was worked on previously, the solved mysteries start to be something small compared to what they were facing, the universe starts to question even what is true or not, illustrated by Onee-san\'s conversation with Aoyama, where they argue about the veracity of their memories. A scene that takes on a special meaning given the messy world they are in, a world that seeks to disorient the viewer, there is no sense or logic about where the objects are arranged, they are just floating, dispersed in space. The ""sea"" is a world that has no rules, something that becomes clear shortly after entering this world, the water changes shape, at first it was a whale jumping, then it becomes a seagull, a unicorn, leading to Onee\'s reaction -san, ""it looks like God is playing"".In the face of all the illogical events it is possible to see a connection between penguins and the inexplicable, they are the epicenter of everything, where there were many penguins, the universe suffered a great effect, but if there were none, or almost none, the mysteries would made something plausible to explain. Another issue that governs the work is the question of the beginning of everything being the end, an idea represented by the course of the river, the place of appearance of the first penguin, will also be the place of disappearance of Onee-san, in addition to the final and initial monologue of the Aoyama, containing the same text, just adapting to the current situation.Penguin Highway does not intend to fully explain its universe, it prefers to completely take the viewer\'s understanding and disorient him, with beautiful and crazy scenes, using the penguins and Onee-san not only to connect the facts and recreate the universe, but also to allow this universe to have direct contact with the characters.', 'We all have to leave one day.

The fact that we often feel that can\'t be logically described it is really amazing.', '*Spoilers*What even is there to say about this movie. A lot actually. Coming into this movie I was expecting a wholesome movie with good animation but nothing really special, but instead, I got a movie that could compete to be one of my favorites. This movie was beautiful in a lot of ways. The characters, the story, the animation, and the music were all so amazing that they outweighed the very little bad that there was. When I say there was very little bad I really mean it, I could only think of maybe one thing that I could call out as ""bad"" but in...all reality, it\'s more of a nitpick of mine. Let\'s start with that one bad thing, then move onto all the good things.Starting with the only nitpick I had with this movie. The relationship between the main Lady and  Aoyama was honestly a little strange for me. In this, I directly mean the way the Lady interacted with Aoyama. I think that her relation to Aoyama should\'ve maybe been expanded on a little more because the way it seemed was very weird. I assume from what is shown is that the Lady is some type of babysitter for Aoyama, but that just doesn\'t really make sense sometimes. If she were Aoyama\'s babysitter why doesn\'t she also take care of his sister? Also, it\'s shown multiply times that Aoyama\'s mother stays home, so why doesn\'t she take care of him? It\'s a very small detail but it can sometimes just be seen as weird.With that out of the way, I can move on to the many things I loved in this movie. I\'m going to touch on the characters, animation, and story beats.First off, the characters in this movie seem so based in reality and I enjoyed that aspect of them a lot. Starting with our main character Aoyama, he\'s just a boy that happens to be really smart. That\'s his character and I really love that. He tries to act like nothing bothers him and as if he\'s above everything but, in reality, he does get put down and put his place by the Lady and his bullies. When he\'s with the Lady is where he tries to flaunt and be big, but it\'s actually when he\'s the most childish. The Lady speaks on this when she compares him to the penguin in the photograph that puffing up its chest even though he\'s the smallest one in the pack. I think that was really smart for the writers to implement. I really loved how Aoyama was so invested in the Lady\'s chest. As a young boy obviously he\'s going to be curious about a woman\'s body, mostly with how beautiful the Lady is. Next, you have Uchida who is the comic relief character. There isn\'t much to say about him. He does his job as a comic relief character and I really loved him for it. He was so cute and funny when he was just being clumsy here and there. With Hamamoto, there\'s a lot more depth and a lot more enjoyment to gain from it. She\'s not as flat as Uchida but also isn\'t too deep that she competes with Aoyama for screen time. She is smart and is shown as Aoyama\'s equal and it\'s portrayed pretty well. She helped push the plot forwards and added a little side story with Suzuki. Talking about Suzuki, he was one of Aoyama\'s bullies that ultimately ended up helping him. There wasn\'t much to him, but as a bully character that\'s what I expected. I thought it was really predictable that he liked Hamamoto but it still added to the story\'s overall enjoyment. All the rest of the characters weren\'t really important.Onto the animation, it was amazing and beautiful for all of the 118-minute runtime. There wasn\'t one bit of this movie where I thought the animation could be better. I enjoyed this movie for its characters and writing but the amazing visuals really tied it all together. I would rewatch this movie without the subtitles just to see how pretty it really is. I have high respect for all the animators working on this anime.Lastly, the story was just as phenomenal as any other aspect of this movie. The story changed a couple of times but any good movie does that. It never had a dull moment with the changing mysteries and with the kids searching around their city. Even with the changing story it managed to all come together and give a satisfactory ending. One thing I didn\'t like at first but ended up enjoying was the idea of death and goodbyes. It felt abrupt when Aoyama\'s sister came crying to him about their mother\'s death but it added another layer to the overall story that by the end was necessary. Deaths are never an easy thing to portray in children\'s movies but I think this movie did an amazing job with it.Overall this movie was amazing I truly would recommend this for anyone and everyone. There\'s so much to enjoy in this movie and I wished I watched it earlier. Imma give this a 10/10, even though I did point out a small nitpick I had with this movie everything else in this movie vastly outways the small inconvenience that detail left on me. Go watch this movie with a family remember, a partner, or just by yourself, just make sure to watch it on a display that will show all of this movie\'s beautiful colors. all reality, it\'s more of a nitpick of mine.

The movie presents itself as if it were just one of those universally enjoyed movies, but the plot falls flat. I think the animation and music are great and very beautiful, but that's where my positives end.I think Aoyama is a really bad main character, not just as a character but as our lead. His being a super genius takes away the child-like wonder I think this movie tried to convey....There are very small moments where his theories are silly kid thoughts, but those are far and few in between. He lacks an actual personality outside of being smart, too. He never works off any of the other characters who, while they aren't anything special themselves, are leagues more interesting than him by comparison. And one of the only running gags is that he ogles the woman's boobs in almost every scene they're together... That's supposed to be funny?The plot is so convoluted and strange. I feel like the writers just took ideas and jammed them together and didn't bother to sort those ideas out concisely; they just left it as a mess. Things are never explained. Why could the lady make penguins? This pseudo-ocean's energy? Okay, but what even is that ocean? That's simply the name the kids call it. Is she an alien? Plenty of ideas are thrown out there, but nothing is stated. I feel like a part of that ambiguity is supposed to be a theme of the movie: to stay curious and have that childlike wonder. Well, I might be more inclined to have my own theories if you actually gave me stuff to work with. They just present information in a very confusing way and expect you to follow along whether it makes any sense or not.I don't usually watch any anime for the sake of cute animals or any moe really. That wasn't why I wanted to watch this movie, but they really aren't important to the plot of a movie called Penguin Highway. Yes, they spur the characters into action, and they help the characters get out of a few situations, but for most of the movie, they just kind of exist. You'd think that they'd be more relevant or have some deeper meaning, but no. I think this was easily just a ploy to get people to enjoy the movie more. Let's shove cute animals and the hints of a deeper plot and hope everyone just believes it actually was that.

It relies too heavily on the animation and beautiful art style it has, but the story falters quite a bit, specially in the middle part.The final act is cute, with some fantastic elements (very Ghibli like) and a pretty realistic representation of how a young boy may come to terms with stuff he can't really comprehend.I did find weird a few of the interactions between the young boy and the dentist woman. It's super understandable how he may feel about her and his way of processing their interactions, but it felt like she played along almost too much, which was a...little bit uncomfortable to see.Overall it's an enjoyable movie but I expected more. Half of my scoring may go to penguins. They're fucking cute. little bit uncomfortable to see.Overall it's an enjoyable movie but I expected more. Half of my scoring may go to penguins.

It was a kids hunt type of film solving a mystery and as a teenager it was a great thing leaving a tear in my eye at the end. The magic with penguins in Japan suddenly came there. One boy wanted to know how and why it happened. The animation was great plus with the art-style making a nice blend to the blender. The pacing was really slow, but you will manage to watch it. The voice acting from dub and sub were really good as-well. I prefer both. The soundtrack as-well...was really great and a blend with good music for the backgrounds. The movie was such a treat to watch. would recommend it to anyone who is new to anime and like slow pacing movies. was really great and a blend with good music for the backgrounds.

The parts, in the beginning, are hard to follow, but reaching the end makes things more clearer.If you wanna watch it, go in with an open mind, try not to figure out everything, the movie will make sure that you are satisfied with the ending. The overall mood of the movie is jolly and there are not a ton of emotional moments.Hiroyasu Ishida has got some great sense of 3 point perspective drawings, which turned me into an instant fan. Its aesthetics are great and the animation is beautiful. "", ""My rating 8/10. I loved the story at first its kinda confusing but then you'd later understand it over time. Its about a boy who loves science and experiments one day a bunch of penguins come out of nowhere and Aoyama tries to figure out whats happening. So far nothing adds up and then one day it hits him he goes to see the dentist who is also his friend and together try to connect the dots.the animation was really amazing and I don't regret watching it. I do however regret not watching it sooner. I do think it doesn't deserve a 10/10 its nothing...personal tho I just have a hard time giving them out... personal tho I just have a hard time giving them out..."", ""Here are a few of my thoughts: The most similar anime I've watched prior to this one was Hello World and to compare I felt more lighthearted and satisfied after credit rolled than with Hello World.The movie has a refreshing art style and fascinating objects of mystery for a fantasy world in the eyes of a bright and curious kid. the surrounding characters are portraited fittingly to the lyrical thoughts and attitude of the boy toward each of them.I like how the mysteries built up intensity with sensible pacing, convoluted, disentangled toward an end that felt very boyish and personal to the main character's view;...to which I'd feel it doesn't matter if I tended to find the conclusion non-sensical. In the end, in the shoes of the boy, I'd find the sense of melancholic wonder in the dentist lady.Overall it's a feel-good to watch if you aren't usually nitpicking after watching an anime. to which I'd feel it doesn't matter if I tended to find the conclusion non-sensical.

Taking a page out of Studio Ghibli's book, the artwork is phenomenal, with warm, bright colors taking center stage for the majority of the film. The characters are enjoyable and have subtleties all their own. Our protagonist, the young genius, is analytical and strange, but feels about as innocent as a kid his age would be. His supporting cast, including his dentist's assistant/neighbor, and rival/ new friend all play wonderfully off of each other and make them feel organic and lively.The environment plays an amazing role in making you feel right at home in a bizarre...sleepy town as events unfold. It's almost like I could feel the passion put into this project oozing out of the screen while I watched. If you don't feel charmed the first time you see a penguin appear in this film, I'd recommend seeing a doctor and making sure you have a heart. sleepy town as events unfold.

Just try watching its opening sequences or its climactic half hour or so without grinning ear to ear. It's brimming with youthful wonder, like Hosoda's Mirai dashed with generous helpings of Ghibli and sprinkles of Pixar. Fantastically written flawed MC and holistic perspective-taking from his viewpoint, great dialogue (comparing Aoyama to the penguin puffing out its chest- 'so proud for someone so small', Aoyama's faux-objective dialogue collapsing under the weight of emotions he can't process or admit yet, the motifs...and symbolism such as the titular 'penguin highway', etc.), outstanding micro-pacing due to slick direction. It's visually glorious, with absolutely gorgeous backgrounds, consistently fluid character animation, great attention to minute detail, and some exceptional sakuga.

I remember it being very well received but severely under watched by many. And now I come back looking at the score now and somehow it having a rating below 8. As of me writing this review, it has a rating of 7.64, something I was not expecting/ highly disagree with and will be trying to sell this film to you because it honestly does not deserve such a low score! (I will try to make this as spoiler-free as possible so don’t you worry!)Story - 8. What I like about the...story was that I was very metaphorical and up to interpretation, now if you don’t like doing that and just want something that is clear and not ambiguous then this movie most likely won’t be much to you, you’ll just bask in its beautiful artstyle, which I will comment on soon. However, for me, ambiguity is something I love to see in the media so I gobbled this up and left nothing behind! Penguin highway explored its themes subtly and masterfully for example:one of them was a global problem like sea level rise another being the wildness and wonder of childhood, which was a joy to see since these themes are relatable to anyone! Even though I may not be passionate about any of those themes, penguin highway made me feel a kindle of passion for both of them, granted only for a small moment, but a moment I found to be ponderous, fun and deeply engaging, which is an emotion many things in media attempt to recreate but fail. Now, personally, even though it’s story itself was amazing the only reason it is not anything above an 8 is because, story wise it wasn’t my personal favourite and there were a few places in the movie that were confusing even for me. But to be honest, an eight is still a high score and it wouldn’t have been such a high score if it wasn’t for all the other aspects of a movie that make a movie, a movie, next up being music!Music - 8. On the whole, the music accompaniment with what happened on screen was very fitting. There were no moments were it felt like it wasn’t meant to be there, rather it helped capture the feeling of the scenes and amplified them to a new level. The quality of the songs were on point! All of its songs were brimming with this vibe of playfulness and liveliness. The songs also didn’t feel generic. All of them were original and felt like it was specially made for Penguin Highway. One notable one is the song ‘Good night’ by Hikaru Utada. I think the movie was used to premiere her new song and honestly I loved the song so much I went to put it on my playlist after hearing it in the credits. You should listen to it! So I give props to the composer and sound director for its delightful OST.Characters - 8. I was originally going to give the character sector a 7 but then I remembered that the MC (Aoyama) is an oppai lover and I couldn’t stop laughing at that part xD but aside from that, even though I was going to give it a 7, that didn’t mean that the characters were bad, they were just not as spectacular as it’s Story or Art-style. The MC and the Onee-san with no name I thought, had a decent amount of depth and I liked them a lot. Their reactions to the challenges each of them faced felt realistic and together with the supporting characters made it a fun adventure. That said, I only felt an attachment to the main characters and one supporting character, that being Suzuki. He goes through a decent amount of depth as well. I also liked the penguins, they were cute! Everyone else I feel like was just there to fill in the gaps but nonetheless we’re still important since without them, the playful, childish and yet wonderful atmosphere penguin highway has, would not have been as powerful as it is. However, there is one outstanding feature about Penguin highway I have not discussed yet. Without it, I don’t think I would have put it on such a high pedestal than I do now, this being Artstyle!!!Art - 9. Studio Colorido is known for their vibrant, engaging animation and man! Did they do an incredible job, especially considering that the movie was partly animated by young animators wanting to make their debut on the anime world! Even just looking at the thumbnail of the movie, you already know it’s gonna be good. I truly adore the art in this movie. It is a true spectacle! Honestly, it is on the same level as Your Name and Violet Evergarden in terms of Sakuga! It is brimming with vibrancy and colour which I think is used to represent the wonderful minds and imagination MC and the other girl (sorry forgot her name) I remember just pausing to gaze at the scenery and elaborate detail of some of the scenes in Penguin highway because it honestly looked amazing! It definitely added to the sense of adventure the movie had. And there is one part of the movie that is notorious by the name of ‘the sakuga scene’ and honestly it lives up to its name! Anyway the art is probably the most notable feature for this film. It was absolutely phenomenal!Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which is why I give it an 9 for personal enjoyment. The art was aesthetically satisfying, the story was unique with its metaphorical way of telling a story. It is filled with so many complex yet engrossing themes that I was only able to fit in two in this review because if It simply wouldn’t fit if were to discuss all of them xD They were portrayed well with its great music and characters. Also I loved how it used penguins, which are probably one of my favourite animals and added to the movie’s whole aesthetic. I also remember watching this film purely because of its name, which I have never done before. I hadn’t watched the trailer prior to watching it neither had I heard anything about it apart from its name. Like ‘Penguin highway!’ Like the name itself, just emanates this sense of excitement and a playfulness that I didn’t know I was thirsting for! Now that I think about it, I don’t think I have been convinced to watch a whole film just based of its name, so I give it props for that as well!However overall, I’m giving it an 8 because I understand why some people did not like the film and also I came across slight problems character and story-wise. I also gave it an 8 because despite the all the fantastic things I have talked about, it isn’t my favourite movie of all time. But trust me when I say that, the good outweigh the bad. I definitely recommend more people to watch it because it is so underrated and under-watched by many and I will never understand why it has a score below an 8, like that honestly just boggles me.But anyway thanks for taking the time to read my review, this took me a long time and I know I wrote a lot so honestly thank you so much and I hope you have a good rest of your day ^_^ Goodbye! story was that I was very metaphorical and up to interpretation, now if you don’t like doing that and just want something that is clear and not ambiguous then this movie most likely won’t be much to you, you’ll just bask in its beautiful artstyle, which I will comment on soon.

I think the movie was used to premiere her new song and honestly I loved the song so much I went to put it on my playlist after hearing it in the credits. You should listen to it! So I give props to the composer and sound director for its delightful OST.Characters - 8. I was originally going to give the character sector a 7 but then I remembered that the MC (Aoyama) is an oppai lover and I couldn’t stop laughing at that part xD but aside from that, even though I was going to give it a 7, that didn’t mean that the characters were bad, they were just not as spectacular as it’s Story or Art-style. The MC and the Onee-san with no name I thought, had a decent amount of depth and I liked them a lot. Their reactions to the challenges each of them faced felt realistic and together with the supporting characters made it a fun adventure. That said, I only felt an attachment to the main characters and one supporting character, that being Suzuki. He goes through a decent amount of depth as well. I also liked the penguins, they were cute! Everyone else I feel like was just there to fill in the gaps but nonetheless we’re still important since without them, the playful, childish and yet wonderful atmosphere penguin highway has, would not have been as powerful as it is. However, there is one outstanding feature about Penguin highway I have not discussed yet. Without it, I don’t think I would have put it on such a high pedestal than I do now, this being Artstyle!!!Art - 9. Studio Colorido is known for their vibrant, engaging animation and man! Did they do an incredible job, especially considering that the movie was partly animated by young animators wanting to make their debut on the anime world! Even just looking at the thumbnail of the movie, you already know it’s gonna be good. I truly adore the art in this movie. It is a true spectacle! Honestly, it is on the same level as Your Name and Violet Evergarden in terms of Sakuga! It is brimming with vibrancy and colour which I think is used to represent the wonderful minds and imagination MC and the other girl (sorry forgot her name) I remember just pausing to gaze at the scenery and elaborate detail of some of the scenes in Penguin highway because it honestly looked amazing! It definitely added to the sense of adventure the movie had. And there is one part of the movie that is notorious by the name of ‘the sakuga scene’ and honestly it lives up to its name! Anyway the art is probably the most notable feature for this film. It was absolutely phenomenal!Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which is why I give it an 9 for personal enjoyment. The art was aesthetically satisfying, the story was unique with its metaphorical way of telling a story. It is filled with so many complex yet engrossing themes that I was only able to fit in two in this review because if It simply wouldn’t fit if were to discuss all of them xD They were portrayed well with its great music and characters. Also I loved how it used penguins, which are probably one of my favourite animals and added to the movie’s whole aesthetic. I also remember watching this film purely because of its name, which I have never done before. I hadn’t watched the trailer prior to watching it neither had I heard anything about it apart from its name. Like ‘Penguin highway!’ Like the name itself, just emanates this sense of excitement and a playfulness that I didn’t know I was thirsting for! Now that I think about it, I don’t think I have been convinced to watch a whole film just based of its name, so I give it props for that as well!However overall, I’m giving it an 8 because I understand why some people did not like the film and also I came across slight problems character and story-wise. I also gave it an 8 because despite the all the fantastic things I have talked about, it isn’t my favourite movie of all time. But trust me when I say that, the good outweigh the bad. I definitely recommend more people to watch it because it is so underrated and under-watched by many and I will never understand why it has a score below an 8, like that honestly just boggles me.But anyway thanks for taking the time to read my review, this took me a long time and I know I wrote a lot so honestly thank you so much and I hope you have a good rest of your day ^_^ Goodbye!', ""From the author behind masterclass pieces, Tatami Galaxy & Night is Short, Walk on Girl, Penguin Highway tells a coming of age story that is visually stimulating & enjoyable.The story basically follows a young 4th grader boy, Aoyama, embarking on research upon being curiously enticed by the mystery of penguins seemingly popping out of nowhere in their town. But the story is still not without Morimi's magical shenanigans as these penguins themselves are products of urban fantasy. It is in Aoyama's tireless & innocent pursuit of research in demystifying the penguins' true nature.The film teems everything with eye-popping artwork coupled with the smooth and seamless...animation—especially during the opening sequence when the penguin innocently travels around the town while showing background shots of the residents' reactions. Not to also mention that the soundtrack is top-notch which fits the mood with its childish endeavor while also being forlorn at serious moments.I love everything about Penguin Highway especially on some of its symbolism. Though it is still up to the viewers' interpretations but personally, I think the story neatly wraps up the usual motif in Morimi's works being positively determined.

Highly recommend!"", ""This is a slightly tricky one, I think. It's a little tricky to get a grip on because of both the things that work really well about it and the things that don't, the two combining together to make something that makes the 'mixed feelings' tag I've attached to this very appropriate.As far as those good things are concerned, it's definitely a fun idea overall. Penguins are cool, and the overall mystery side of the story, at least at the start, is a decent hook that is easy to find fun. As the story goes on, it adds a couple other important plot points,...trickles in a few other characters in a decently subtle way, so all of that is solid. And certainly, the plot is coherent enough. In purely mechanical terms, everything is there for a purpose, everything works nicely, there's a decent amount of set up and pay off, all perfectly good here. It also looks pretty great. A slightly Ghibli-esque character style, matched with generally very strong overall animation, and a few very interesting visual sequences, some very strong voice performances, and we're onto something that should be pretty good.But, while there was definitely enough that I can say was good, I also couldn't help but feel like my interest was dropping off as it went along. While the actual premise was a decent hook, a decent plot hook needs a decent protagonist to carry it, and 'Penguin Highway' doesn't make a great choice there, with a protagonist that isn't especially interesting and isn't especially likeable. But mostly, I think it was just a bit too long. There is a pretty phenomenal 1hr30, 1hr40 movie in here, but the 2 hour runtime just feels a little drawn out, creating what I found to be some pretty severe pacing issues. And that all came together into something that was definitely enjoyable, definitely looked incredible, but ultimately somewhat struggled to hold my attention by the end. trickles in a few other characters in a decently subtle way, so all of that is solid.

Both the anime films that I've watched recently, Penguin Highway and Ride Your Wave have both had such beautiful animation.The characters were interesting, and at times questionable and slightly unrealistic. Like Aoyama being a 35 yr old in a 10 yr olds body, and having an unrealistic fascination with breasts. But despite that, I really enjoyed the other characters.I love how different this film is to anything else. Like the Dentist's Assistant being able to make penguins, like, how cool is that?! I'd...love to be able to create Adelie penguins like that!And the whole sea storyline was also so unique, but very cool.

While indeed, by watching the trailer, it might wrongly give the idea of a simple kid-oriented anime, Penguin Highway instead tries to dig deeper into the life of a little boy who is next to face the teen-age.It will do so by presenting some new challenges which will turn his life into a less “idyllic” experience, with the introduction of some typical aspects of this age such as masculinity and sexuality for example, sometimes by even making use of a partial explicit language or scenes....I appreciated in this sense such contrast between the sweet visual style and the real plot concept, something which found myself unprepared and positively surprised, and that’s why Penguin Highway won me over and it’s an anime which I easily recommend.

He likes to indulge himself in pseudo scientific experiments that probably fuel his ego. One of his journals is entirely dedicated to “Geometric study of boobs”, now that’s a branch of science I can get behind. He has an ego, he treats others with reservation and sees himself as more than a child. To be honest… he’s annoying. Watching him is like watching...a dollar store ripoff of Sheldon Cooper from “The big bang theory” (and writing a worse character than him is a real achievement as his really badly written). His boring and a lot of his “deductions” are just an ass pull powered by deus ex machina. Shame because there is a solid foundation to make him organically come to the conclusions. But that would require some work.Aoyama has a pretty big crush on a buxom, pretty, mysterious young woman that works at the local dentist who he call’s Onee-San (Lady in English subs). She has a mysterious and fascinating power which gives Aoyama an excuse to get closer to her. She’s the most cliché character of the show. She only has one side and that is a laid back, kind side. Lady treats our little MC like a child seemingly not knowing, or more likely not giving a damn, about his infatuation towards her. If I have to point out the most wasted character of the story it would be her and that’s a problem because of her importance to the story.It might seem like the movie doesn’t have any good points but that is not true. The supporting cast is pretty cool. Aoyamas friend Hamamoto is probably the most 3D character of the show. Yes… it’s a bit cliché that she has a crush on Aoyama but due to the fact that she shows a few sides of her personality I can forgive it this time.The plot itself also has potential. Up to a point it’s pretty logical and organically grows the mystery. That said all that goes out the window somewhere around the 3/4 mark. After that the show relies too much on deus ex machina for my taste. I think the script writers wrote themselves into a corner. They wanted to explore a lot of themes and make us care about the main duo but had a time limit to the move. The movie could use another 30 minutes (at least) to nicely and organically round up the plot. The way it is… it’s just rushed and it shows.Despite all that, it's not a bad movie, it has a nice calm vibe in the beginning and the visuals are very well done. Aoyama is annoying but after about 30 minutes You won’t really notice it that much… I hope so at least, for Your sake. a dollar store ripoff of Sheldon Cooper from “The big bang theory” (and writing a worse character than him is a real achievement as his really badly written).

Ragna Crimson,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51297/Ragna_Crimson,"[""The anime leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Manga from skipped scenes, to missed dialogue, to changed dialogue, to changed action sequences, changed actions, etc leaving it with alright animation and questionable direction.

The author has...integrated politics quite well with magic and mythology, which are quite important aspects in Ragna Crimson, and offers a broader perspective on the world.The characters in Ragna Crimson are VERY STRONG, why do I say that? For me, it was enough to see Crimson wielding a weapon around and it made me believe that she\'s quite strong and carries the entire series, just kidding... the characters are quite well-developed, and they have their own motivations or aspirations.

A fine premiere – cunning and enticing. With a debut episode of 47 minutes long, although this critique’s premature, a lovely charisma floats nigh this anime.The narrative takes place in an antique epoch where Dragons roam the night sky, ruining and slaughtering humans, however the latter found the beasts’ weakest points (being sunlight and silver domains), and so, a hunting for survival began. Episode one suggests two main characters quite unalike. A little girl, Leonica, the record holder of Dragon slaying, and her companion, Ragna, being introduced as a feeble male character (with an obscure past) leeching off of her, yet...caring and living along with Leo, training hard and giving his best to follow and support her in every Dragon quest. Platitude? Jading shonen? Perhaps, but wait, because this is where things get interesting, when time travel’s embedded in the series – a future version of Ragna dawns to his past self in an oneiric fashion, foretelling a bleak future, where Leonica’s death is an irrefutable and painful truth, thus emerging a gargantuan demand of training, to conquer and attain dominant powers and arts to vanquish Dragons. With such mastery, future Ragna conveys all of his prowess to his past self, in order to save Leo. It’s a coiling of emotions and impetus.In a still mystifying realm, another compelling character pops up – Crimson. Revealing to future Ragna that a price needs to be paid, so hope of creating a world where Dragons are naught may exist. Prologue and epilogue collide as the story moves forward, quite fast so far, as a reborn Ragna tries to find Crimson in the present and gain her trust for a riddled journey ahead. Coiling again, as Ragna tells Leo that he wants to move on without her, with covert thoughts and covert tears, the story can proceed at different rhythms, with different canons. As a downside, one can say that the absence of the gore factor and cutoff constituents could yield this sombre fantasy to an early grave, notwithstanding, this tale’s constructed in a well-founded pier that may resist the trial of (yet) another never-ending anime, or worse – oblivion.SILVER LINK studios offered us before great titles, and Ragna Crimson might just live on to establish its own name, with a quite modern and appreciable art, combined with an honest string of music and OP, and last, but not least, the Seiyū that always pour their voices and hearts within each character.

Ragna Crimson has a fairly enjoyable story in theory. From the very get go, everything is stacked against Ragna and the humans in general. It has such a strong start in introducing you to the world and the state that it\'s in-- namely dragon hunting being such a main staple for how...much havoc they wreak against humanity.Ragna has suffered the dragons plenty throughout his life, despite being weak he survives. He counts on Leonica more times than not. Until the moment he can\'t. Suddenly there are superior dragons in the picture and they\'re on a whole other level. Catastrophic world ending kind of level. And suddenly Ragna realizes this is in fact a loop world. And that his future self had entrusted with him everything to right his future wrongs, with power that took lifetimes to achieve.This is when Ragna leaves everything he knows behind and instead partners up with Crimson who was his partner in crime in the future. They both know the true enemy at hand and are prepared to take them down once they\'re strong enough....Except you\'ll soon find out that Ragna goes against reason constantly. He could be on death\'s door and still stubbornly do the dumbest actions you could possibly conceive with given circumstances. All bones broken? So broken every orifice of your body is bleeding? Nah, he just keeps on going! And Crimson has to have pulled their hair out at least a thousand times for everything that\'s gone wrong because clearly his future self knew better.Won\'t go into too much more detail regarding later parts, but just know that the whole second cour stagnates to an unbelievably slow snail\'s pace. For an action-focused anime, you\'d really think they\'d put more love and care into the fighting. And they do to some extent. One can only guess the budget was low but they did what they could. Just like any other shounen though, they fight at the same location for multiple episodes. Long and dragged out. There are star moments where they truly shine when it matters, but those moments are few and far between.It\'s not an amazing story, but it\'s not a terrible one either. Ragna and Crimson are easily the most interesting characters, considering their future selves and the way their personalities bounce off one another. Crimson especially is just... this wild character of so many schemes and mischief that constantly gets ruined by Ragna\'s idiocy and protagonist syndrome of fighting literally anything that smells like a dragon. You might find yourself enjoying the enemy\'s stories more than you enjoy the \'good side\', because they get equal screen time if not more sometimes. If you can make it through the first couple of episodes, you may as well buckle in for the ride. much havoc they wreak against humanity.Ragna has suffered the dragons plenty throughout his life, despite being weak he survives.

There are star moments where they truly shine when it matters, but those moments are few and far between.It\'s not an amazing story, but it\'s not a terrible one either. Ragna and Crimson are easily the most interesting characters, considering their future selves and the way their personalities bounce off one another. Crimson especially is just... this wild character of so many schemes and mischief that constantly gets ruined by Ragna\'s idiocy and protagonist syndrome of fighting literally anything that smells like a dragon. You might find yourself enjoying the enemy\'s stories more than you enjoy the \'good side\', because they get equal screen time if not more sometimes. If you can make it through the first couple of episodes, you may as well buckle in for the ride.', ""The story is still interesting, it loses some of the impact that the manga has because of some slow pacing.The animation isn't impressive, which is a shame for an adaptation of a manga that is very action oriented. It can get saucy at times but for the most important fights the animation was extremely underwhelming. The art style also doesn't live up to the manga.If you absolutely don't want to or can't read manga for whatever reason, then this anime does adapt the story of Ragna Crimson well enough, it doesn't cut out all that much and the animatiom is acceptable. I would just recommend...reading the manga. reading the manga."", 'Occasionally long running shows will run out of ideas or writers will just give up resulting in a weird and out of place things to happen in series after which the quality starts dropping. To jump the shark, as we say in reference to Fonzie literally jumping over the shark in show called Happy Days.Bad shows sometimes start good, but most of the times they are obvious from the start. Whether it\'s stilted acting, poor animation quality or simply story that doesn\'t hold water... there\'s usually an indicator of sorts. Not so with this show. It actually starts somewhat competently. Not high quality but decent....However! Never have I seen a show jump a shark after second episode. Up until this point we\'ve had a character who hated his inability to protect his loved ones so much that he managed to find a way to give power to his earlier self, in a bit of a novelty move when it comes to anime. So now we have a much younger character filled with emotions of regret and someone else\'s life experiences as his own in what I\'ve hoped would turn to be an interesting conflict which he\'ll have to overcome. But no, it\'s used as a poor explanation of how he got his powers. Then episode three came along and I kid you not, other main character pulled an M16 out of a magic door.That\'s it. That\'s the moment I knew show has jumped the shark. No matter how much they tried to excuse such a move or fit this idea into fantasy world in which magic supposedly exists it\'s beyond redemption because now every time there\'s a conflict you are bound to ask a question ""why not use a bazooka or a nuke"", ""where are the tanks"", ""why didn\'t you get poison gas""... If she\'s capable of getting things from a different dimension, why not get advanced alien depilator and use it to kill dragons. Hell, even simpler... why not get UV flashlights and give them to everyone since dragons seem to hate sunlight.

I LOVE THIS SHOW and if you like action/fantasy, some extremely entertaining romance, and a clever story line you will not dislike this at all. If you are not one of those people who nitpicks microscopic imperfections in...everything and screams on the top of a mountain how they ruin all enjoyment of living on earth then I think you will love this; it is AWESOME. This story is similar to Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer where there is really strong evil that seems hopeless for mankind so when protagonists finally come that can challenge it it makes it that much more epic. I think of this like the painting technique of chiaroscuro, which is if you make the darks in your painting darker, it will make the lights shine that much brighter.The music and some of the background music is haunting and mysterious while being motivational, so I love that. Many of the characters are really funny and have great and clever lines so this makes it really fun. One of the characters, Crimson, is like this and is so entertaining to watch.  The story is unpredictable and interesting andddddddddddddddOne of the biggest selling pieces for this show for me, is when a protagonist that gets very strong (that's the most I'll say without spoilers but trust me it is crazy awesome) and instills TERROR into strong evil it is so fulfilling (there may or may not be scenes that I've repeat watched like 60 times). In a world with problems and immorality everywhere, it is really refreshing to have art that depicts power very seriously opposing it to a delicious level.So in other words - IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOW; IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOW; IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOW; IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOW; IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOW; IT IS AWESOME JUST WATCH IT NOWLOL <3 <3 <3Have a nice day!!!! =) everything and screams on the top of a mountain how they ruin all enjoyment of living on earth then I think you will love this; it is AWESOME.

This world is dark and brutal as hell and the show does a good job of showing how no one in this story is safe. Death is always lurking around the corner and due to the strength gap between dragons and humans, human life feels so fragile and fleeting. The author doesn’t...shy away from killing off characters either. It’s gritty, dark and at times seemingly hopeless. That is, until we get to Ragna’s power up. One of the coolest things about the story is how Ragna’s future self and his present self interact and share knowledge and power. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like this before. Yea, we’ve had isekai and reincarnation stories where people bring knowledge from previous lives, but never one quite like this.An integral part of the story is the relationship between Ragna and Crimson which I loved. They’re polar opposites, but their shared goal of wiping out the dragons unites them and their abilities complement each other so well. The banter, slice of life moments and planning with them is so fun and they gradually influence each other as well. It really feels like a buddy cop dynamic with the good cop and the bad cop. While both are motivated by mutual desire for revenge, the story doesn’t get too edgy which is a testament to good writing. A lot of times stories like this end up being an edgelord’s fantasy.The abilities of each character in the story are so well thought out and useful in their own way. Definitely one of the more unique power systems I’ve seen. Whether it’s the Argentum corps or the dragons themselves, there’s a wide variety of power ups making the fights interesting. Ragna’s abilities in particular are unique since they involve silverine, to which dragons are weak. Can’t express how much fun I had seeing him wipe the smirk off the dragons’ face. After years of dominating humans and doing whatever they want, finally someone is able to stand up to them and give them a taste of their own medicine.That leads me into the one big problem I had with this show. The story, worldbuilding, characters and everything else are solid. But God, the production values are really bad in this, which is such a shame. There’s so many interesting fights in the show that just didn’t hit as well as they should’ve because they look like power point slides. I mean it even got to the point where the mangaka had to take to twitter to tweet out what he intended for the fight to look like, so that people don’t judge him for how bad it looks in the anime. I know animation is such a taxing profession and I’m sure they did the best with what they could, but this staff needed more time or better leadership because after the first couple of episodes things were rough. The character designs were solid, though. Some might point to the pacing as another issue, personally I didn’t mind it too much as cliffhangers keep me looking forward to the next episode, so I’ll never complain too much about those.I was hooked from the very first episode of Ragna Crimson and maintain that it’s one of the most underrated shows of 2023. Production issues aside, the story is well written, characters are fun and even with the bad animation fights still manage to be hype.

If you want your shounen to be entertaining without a crazy well written story , you need to go the JJK and Demon Slayer route. You need high production. The problem is the production had the budget of an indie film from the boonies. 7 Deadly Frames type of budget.For all the praise it got for being ""well animated."" It was TREMENDOUSLY disappointing. Bad CGI dragons. Frozen background characters.  Boring action sequences. Moreover , most of the frames have barely any movement in them. The illusion of...it being well animated comes from decent quality art , and most of the animation is just frames panning from side to side. Also , sound track wasn\'t special , neither were the sound effects.Right off the bat , hate the protagonist. Cliche character ""not strong enough to protect the ones I love."" Inorganic interactions between characters , dialogue that almost seem AI generated. Backstory is so average. Various jokes didn\'t land at all. Antagonists are terrible , feels like they are trying to copy the demon slayer demon hierarchy but replace it with humanoid dragons. That would have been fine if they managed to convince the viewer that the villains are scary or feel powerful, give the battles some sort of stake for character development or plot progression. Nope , no stakes at all. Why? the pity me personality protagonist solves his powerlessness through his future self time travelling back to give himself powers.

Terrible writing.', 'Ragna Crimson is an honest to god, top notch battle shounen that isn\'t afraid to shower us in blood and kill off characters like it\'s Game of Thrones.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 8/10-----------------------------------------------The quality of the animations varies a fair bit, but as a whole it looks good. At times even great. If it could sustain its best it could be a match for any shounen out there.Art is also clean and interesting. Character designs and scenery detailed....Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 9/10------------------------------------------As a proper double season show we get multiple great OP\'s and ED\'s that fit well with the show\'s high octane action and emotions. The tunes during the show are similarly top notch, with great battle themes and beautiful emotional pieces that emphasize the key moments.Voice acting is also good. Especially that of Crimson who is superbly done. Voice Acting an androgynous character who needs to sound both male and female or neither at the same time is quite the task, yet they pulled it off.Story - 8/10-------------The story seems basic at first, but quickly evolves into something a lot more interesting once the world building gets going and more characters are revealed.The premise features a young and talentless man who is part of a community of dragon hunters, beasts who are at odds with humanity and constantly fight for control of the world. Though he is talentless he tries his best and helps his friend, a young girl prodigy. When faced with the reality of losing her, he obtains the powers of his future self to change their fate.From there the story takes on the twist of an Overpowered MC going on a rampage to rid the world of his enemies and ensure he never has to experience the loss of his friend. However, despite his apparent overwhelming power, things are far from easy as we learn along the way.While initially seeming like a cookie-cutter ""kill all enemies"" shounen, the world building adds a lot of interesting twists and unknowns to make it a fun ride. The show bridges the genres between fantasy, contemporary and futuristic, building a world that has both advanced tech and magic. And dragons. Lots of dragons. It\'s fascinating if a little underdeveloped still. But the future holds promise should we get more seasons.Characters - 9/10---------------------Ragna Crimson\'s characters are its strongest suit. There are a lot of them, and they are all well written and horribly tragic. The death count in this show is astronomical and there is literally no way to tell who lives and who dies.In addition, the lines between good and evil become ever more blurred as both the heroes and villains are explored in depth. There are amazing motivations on both sides, and you can\'t help but to feel disgusted to the bone while being incredibly empathetic at the same time to both sides. By the end you can\'t help but to want to feel like things should have turned out differently for all those involved.Ragna, our main protagonist is a low confidence, talentless orphan, who after obtaining near ultimate power, becomes incredibly competent and capable in battle. Though he struggles with his morality and self esteem issues for most of the show. This can get tiresome at times, though his backstory does make it more understandable.Crimson, a key supporter of our protagonist is a much more complex of a character. Androgynous and morally questionable, it is hard to get a proper handle on them, which makes it all the more interesting. They might save one person, only to then have them kill another for the grand plan to work. Ruthless and seemingly unpredictable, intellectual genius. Their presence in any scene simply elevates it immediately.Additional cast could fill a list that\'s a mile long. Countless allies and enemies. Some mere decoration, others explored more in depth. Nobody is safe, people die, people live. You cannot predict it.Whether you love it or hate it, it leaves an impression.---Total - 9/10---Ragna Crimson touches greatness with its top notch shounen action, mixing it with more seinen like tragedy and gore. While it fumbles here and there with animation quality, the overall result is undeniably great.A must watch for any shounen fan.

Crimson was having a huge monologue on about deceiving Ragna and creating his/her own army using Ragna\'s silver ice powers. I honestly could not fathom why there is any need to keep talking about the same point over and over again. I was already confused why Leon attacked Ragna, that thought kept going through my mind while I continued watching 2 episodes of Crimson yapping.How could Leon suddenly attack Ragna, somebody who they treasure dearly? Especially someone who has shown to be quite level-headed. It was a...very sudden way to write-off or cast aside a support character. The slime was annoying as fuck. I had high hopes for this show due to Ragna\'s AOT-like devotion of killing all dragons.Ragna is dumb too, he keeps talking to Crimson like they\'ve known each other for so long and he ran along with that idea for way too long.

Which can make this a bit of an underdog story in parts, but is it really? When even...as we progress, are we truly following the good side? Are things even gonna work at all? There are so many questions, which will draw so many viewers in with it's content, that'll just want more and more. Sure, it takes a good moment to fully get engaged, but once you are hooked, you're really hooked.Lets face it, this show is really carried by it's other cast members than the MC Ragna themselves. Not that Ragna is a bad character, more that far other characters stand out for obvious reasons. A good example of this, is Crimson, who is head and shoulders the most stand out character of the entire show. You'll love them, or you'll hate them, for obvious reasons. A well written character in every sense of the word in terms of what they are as a character.Art and sound: 8The look of the show not only fits the vibe, mostly depressing vibe, but it really showcases everything of what it means to be a Dark Fantasy. As if in parts, even the brightest of colours, can look flat, but flat in a way that makes sense to the overall theme and plot.As if it's well polished to look the way it is on purpose, in order to truly stand out. Not to mention, following that up with a good sound deparment, that really carries this in many scenes. Sometimes even having little of, to really hit home this deep pit of sadness in your gut. Take the third and fourth episodes for example. There is a interesting selection of track being played, for certain events, and that really adds to it. Seriously well done.Ragna Crimson came with a bang with a big opening episode, and a interesting follow up afterwards. While sure, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, nor will it be for all in sense of it's writing. But if it's done one thing, is put the show on the map, so if it peaks your interest, you can always see the Manga afterwards, while you wait for the next episode to come. as we progress, are we truly following the good side?

It has so many main genres in it, that it took me by suprise, especially cuz it kinda switched between them pretty fast at some points and caught me off guard. It\'s a comedy, it\'s shounen, it also has mature content, it\'s big flashy fights, it (tries) to put some sad moments in it. Quite the catalog, if you ask me.In the first few episodes, it seemed to be kinda basic, but the rule of 3 episodes (+ a few more sometimes) doesn\'t let you down. It starts showing what makes this story unique, and that...for me was the mix of everything put together. It offered quite an unique experience to me. Of course, being it shounen, you can still see and guess some parts, but it still feels pretty fresh overall, at least to me it did.BUT, it is not a masterpiece. It has some faults, but I didn\'t watch to analyse it. I watch for fun, and it did bring me what I was searching for.The world and worldbuilding kinda lacks (and might seem to suck for some), but you gotta use a bit of your imagination to explain some stuff and just go ""okay, I\'ll accept it"". They do give you some pieces of info that you gotta put together.Story: 8The story isn\'t top notch. It has a few interesting elements in it, like dragons that seem to be like vampires and burn in the sun?! And they seem to have some of the most op powers ever?!?!? BUT WAIT, WHAT\'S THAT, A POWER UP?!?!?!?! Okay, you can see the gist of it, in one word: shounen. But it the kind of shounen that is digestable, because it also has some other parts in it, mainly the comedy and absurdity of some moments.The telling of the story is also not the very best overall... it tries to get you emotional at some points and for some characters and stuff, but ain\'t no way you gonna get emotional, only if you\'re down bad ig.I would say don\'t give up on the story cuz of the no explanation of some things, cuz it does give you pieces to put together the history of that world. It isn\'t something unique to this story, after all..Art: 8MAN, this studio kinda bit a bit more than it could chew. The first cour of the anime was pretty good animated, the second tho... it had so much action, but at least they decided instead of making every fight kinda crappy, they kinda choose which fights get the budget and which get the budget cut. Overall it is satisfactory. The end, you can see better what I\'m talking about, but you still won\'t be dissapointed.Music: 8Okay. The OST was pretty fire sometimes.Characters: 9Here, the anime takes quite the main part that makes this anime so interesting to me. The dinamic between the main characters. I did not expect them to be like that, but I am glad it was. Ig this is what the fresh part was for me. A MC that is basic af overall and you can find him in every shounen story, and another that is kinda like a joker of some sorts, that thinks that the end justifies the means and likes to have some... fun.

Ragna Crimson does all the hard parts of making an anime well, typically anime tend to struggle with making interesting powers, interesting conflicts, dynamic and deep characters and themes, and the like, but Ragna Crimson executes all these brilliantly. The characters feel so full of life and determination, the Argentum Corps is a beautiful example of the determination and life of the characters in the anime.However, the show is just so close. It just fails to fully execute the small things that are usually taken for granted...well. Notably, the animation, especially during the latter half of the show, is at times lackluster. That’s not to say there’s not great moments where the animation looks cool, but the brilliantly written characters, suspense, and power-ups can at times be let down by the animation.Another small issue I have with the show is the random cuts between action during fight scenes, which falls to direction. Sometimes a fight will be building up and building up and the fight is getting more intense and drawing the viewers in, only for it to cut away during an inopportune time to a less important fight at the time that can leave the viewer overall less interested in the fight they were just excited about a moment ago.Overall, I think the anime is definitely worth a watch if you come into it knowing these things and with low expectations. Personally, part of the reason why I enjoyed Ragna Crimson so much is because I truthfully had very low expectations coming into it, and was blown away by the characters and interesting plot with well written fight scenes to boot. well.

This list includes MHA S6 Dark Deku arc, High Card, Hells Paradise, Dead Mount Death Play, Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 and Undead Unluck. My opinion is very unlikely to change unless the next few episodes shit the bed hard but I doubt it since it keeps getting better and manga readers say the upcoming fight(Ragna vs Voltekamui) is top tier.I really like that this series really takes its time to set up and develop characters and events properly, rather than constantly rushing to ""cool"" fights and...spectacle like a lot of modern shonen. Every major fight or plot event holds a lot of emotional weight behind it as a result. The main duo are very interesting, have great chemistry and parallel in various ways such as hero vs villain, brain vs brawn, stoicism vs emotional. But despite those personality clashes they are forced to work together for a common goal. The main antagonist is enjoyable to watch and well written. Her more empathetic nature which makes her shy away from standard methods of killing(preferring to ""dissapear"" people instead) and fighting in general really contrasts well with her peers who freely revel in the destruction they bring. But then later on as it turns out, this ""angelic"" persona is somewhat of a facade. She is inexperienced and prone to emotional distress which makes her freeze mid battle. Outside of battle her failures eat away at her, stopping her from being able to use her time control magic. She isn\'t exactly ""pure"" either, she has proven to be just as bloodthirsty as the others when someone gets in her way. The main set of antagonists grow on you. They feel like a real family, not just a bunch of evildoers conspiring together. Character dynamics are top tier and the latest episode is a prime example of that where you have Woltekamui pep talking the main antagonist and Princess Starlia putting on a tsundere front as she is in love with Ragna but sees him as a potential liability to her duties and because his accomplice is basically the devil. spectacle like a lot of modern shonen.

The only good thing is the first chapter, and it is because it lasted 40 minutes where it had enough space to establish the foundations of what would seem to be a good story. Unfortunately, after the first chapters they decided to write the rest of the script with their feet and eyes closed. Generally I try to judge a work independently of its source material, but here it is...very difficult for me not to do so because everything that bothers me is precisely what the anime ignores about the manga.Of the first part, as I said, the only good thing would be the first episode and that meeting between Ragna and Ultimatia. From there on out, I would be surprised if someone tells me that they remember something that happened in those first episodes, because they were some of the most boring I found in the season. Regarding the second half, wow the anime tries hard to fall too low, when you think it would stop at zero, it surpasses itself and manages to reach negative five.This is where the comparisons begin, in the manga Crimson is an egocentric manipulator, without any type of limit where he will use and sacrifice the people that are necessary to achieve his goal. Manipulation, brainwashing, seduction, deception, he is a person who is made to make you dislike him and you know that making an alliance with him will not lead to anything good. In the anime, he seems more like a capricious child motivated by his only desire to win. They paint it as if it were a small defect, but in the end Crimson can be a good friend. Who in their right mind would want a friend like Crimson, that\'s the point of the character, that he\'s hateable, not half-likable.The fights, for the love of God, I would have more fun watching a political channel than watching these fights again. The fight against the dragons Olto Zora and Taratectora was one of the most anticlimactic possible, which is different in the manga where it is one of my favorite fights. This was a fight to show Ragna\'s true power, which is the will he has to keep going despite being on death\'s door. Let it be seen that even though his body is a mess, he continues to refine his art of fighting against dragons. Let it be noted that for Ragna, stopping for just a second would mean losing the meaning of the sacrifices that have been made for him. In the anime, they take a lot of time in conversations and you barely see Ragna with considerable damage to appreciate the superhuman effort he is making. I\'m not asking for it to be an exact copy of the manga, but at least it respects the essence of the characters.Now the ending, the anime is one of hopelessness, that no matter how strong Ragna is, he will always lose someone dear, close or a fighting partner. Ragna always has to continue moving forward, because if he settles in a place he would be afraid to put the lives of the people around him at risk. Whenever he leaves a place, he doesn\'t really want to, he just wants a quiet and peaceful life, something he can\'t have. In the anime, they gave it a hopeful ending with a moral of ""No matter how many died in the war, at the end of the day the sun will always rise."" I would be surprised if anyone on the staff seriously read the manga.In conclusion, this was more than a review, it was a rant, if you got this far, the only thing I can tell you is don\'t watch it, it\'s not worth it. very difficult for me not to do so because everything that bothers me is precisely what the anime ignores about the manga.Of the first part, as I said, the only good thing would be the first episode and that meeting between Ragna and Ultimatia. From there on out, I would be surprised if someone tells me that they remember something that happened in those first episodes, because they were some of the most boring I found in the season. Regarding the second half, wow the anime tries hard to fall too low, when you think it would stop at zero, it surpasses itself and manages to reach negative five.This is where the comparisons begin, in the manga Crimson is an egocentric manipulator, without any type of limit where he will use and sacrifice the people that are necessary to achieve his goal. Manipulation, brainwashing, seduction, deception, he is a person who is made to make you dislike him and you know that making an alliance with him will not lead to anything good. In the anime, he seems more like a capricious child motivated by his only desire to win. They paint it as if it were a small defect, but in the end Crimson can be a good friend. Who in their right mind would want a friend like Crimson, that\'s the point of the character, that he\'s hateable, not half-likable.The fights, for the love of God, I would have more fun watching a political channel than watching these fights again. The fight against the dragons Olto Zora and Taratectora was one of the most anticlimactic possible, which is different in the manga where it is one of my favorite fights. This was a fight to show Ragna\'s true power, which is the will he has to keep going despite being on death\'s door. Let it be seen that even though his body is a mess, he continues to refine his art of fighting against dragons. Let it be noted that for Ragna, stopping for just a second would mean losing the meaning of the sacrifices that have been made for him. In the anime, they take a lot of time in conversations and you barely see Ragna with considerable damage to appreciate the superhuman effort he is making. I\'m not asking for it to be an exact copy of the manga, but at least it respects the essence of the characters.Now the ending, the anime is one of hopelessness, that no matter how strong Ragna is, he will always lose someone dear, close or a fighting partner.

The problem comes in the last 6 episodes where is crammed more content than it could fit to at least one more series, some questions are kinda answered but raise much more question to which you do not feel the need for an answer. The ending is extremely cliche and poor mainly because there are so many storyline threads opened and close with no clear resolution and with a lot of questions in just a few...episodes. There are also characters that we are never told what happened to them or others on which we do not know about their motivation that are just left hanging. While to some it may be a reason to want a second season to me it shows how one can write itself into a corner. The main story is about beings known as dragons and how silverine ( some silver compound ) is the only thing that can destroy them as they see humans as lifestock. In the last episodes this turns into a completely different story we are not told almost anything about and which probably was never the intention to exist in the beginning. episodes.

The show able to balance between action, drama, and comedy quite well, I never felt any tonal whiplash like when I watched other dark show (ie Akame ga Kill) the dark moments have a reasonable tones and reasons behind it (it's not just evil for the sake of evil), while the comedic moments mostly happened during the calm time and never felt intrusive.StoryThe story of Ragna Crimson is simple, Ragna and Crimson want to kill all dragon. But from that simple framework the writer able to twist and turn...the plot into whatever they wanted without really butchering the main story, each episode felt like there is something new that got revealed which give me hooks for watching the next episode. 8/10ArtThe art and animation is clean and crisp, it's not quite unlimited budget level, but it's good enough for regular episode and turned amazing in a more high budgeted scene (episode 7 comes in mind). 7/10CharacterOnce again it is simple but working, Ragna is angry awkward protagonist and Crimson is an evil genius (emphasis at both evil and genius), they got amazing chemistry with each other and with other side characters.

If you decide to finish, be aware that this is all going downhill from here.After episode 18 until the end of this season, everything turned into a series of bullshit development, almost feel forced and as if all the build up to this point lose all meaning.Worse thing is the author keep forcing to feel sympathy for the villain, but the villain is so badly written I lost count to much I was muttering ""fuck you"" everytime ultimatia shared her ""pain"". While at...the same time not much development to our main cast, its the final battle, we should feel more motivated to see the mc winning so that we feel relieved, but no, we are forced to feel sympathy toward the badly written villain.The worst thing of all, almost everyone that dies, the dies for no reason, not even akame ga kill was this retarded. but then the author pull miracle out of his ass at the end scene, that was so bad.This review is probably just another way for me to share my frustration so that maybe some other people doesnt need to experience the same frustration since I genuinely think this series has a massive potential to be good.music: midanimation: mid afcharacter: badly writtenstory: has a big potentialVA: TOP, this is the only redeeming quality. the same time not much development to our main cast, its the final battle, we should feel more motivated to see the mc winning so that we feel relieved, but no, we are forced to feel sympathy toward the badly written villain.The worst thing of all, almost everyone that dies, the dies for no reason, not even akame ga kill was this retarded. but then the author pull miracle out of his ass at the end scene, that was so bad.This review is probably just another way for me to share my frustration so that maybe some other people doesnt need to experience the same frustration since I genuinely think this series has a massive potential to be good.music: midanimation: mid afcharacter: badly writtenstory: has a big potentialVA: TOP, this is the only redeeming quality.', 'IMO the storyline is interesting but super jumbled. Like abandoning the pink haired girl in episode 2 was weird, but then instantly getting attached to the princess was just sorta like whiplash, and I enjoyed the backgrounds of the dragon monarchs. But some of them just didn\'t make any sense. It felt like just a ton of ass pulls for no reason, no foreshadowing or buildup just..... word vomit. I honestly enjoyed everything up until episode 8, even 9-12 were pretty interesting. 13-17 was a nice and decently well thought-out battle with a couple nice twists, but 18 onwards was just..... confusing. Why was Ragna...so attached to the princess? just cause she saw how he got his power? I guess you could use that but it\'s pretty weak IMO. The stuff with the church was alright, but the final fight was just... terrible. Ass pulls left and right, the *ONLY* thing foreshadowed was the transformation of Elder, everything else was just ass pull here, ass pull there. Honestly it was jarring. The only reason this isn\'t a 3-4 for me is simply the relationship between Ultimatia and Kamui, that was genuinely enjoyable and pretty nicely done. However everybody else was just so..... 1 dimensional. and only characters that got any meaningful development was Ultimatia and Kamui, and how tf is Felbegoth? or ""Death""? why did they ONLY APPEAR IN THE LAST 2 EPISODES LIKE ?????TLDR; interesting premise, started off well, then fell into the deep end and started drowning HARD quite the letdown honestly. so attached to the princess? just cause she saw how he got his power?

And the characters aren't charismatic neither - most are just men-children - and plotholes plus poor worldbuilding are the nails in the coffin for Ragna Crimson.Besides all that, there is also a problem with stakes, as the mcs are too strong and it is quite clear they won't die during the first arcs of the show. The side characters are also not developed enough for us to care deeply about them, in part...because we expect them to be killed (considering the show's themes), and in part because they don't contribute much to anything.In the end, Ragna Crimson has very slow pacing, and the lack of production plus the mediocre writing remove most of the enjoyment one could get from the scene by scene. I don't recommend Ragna Crimson to anyone, I think Berserk 2016 is quite better and everyone was complaining about how bad that show was. because we expect them to be killed (considering the show's themes), and in part because they don't contribute much to anything.In the end, Ragna Crimson has very slow pacing, and the lack of production plus the mediocre writing remove most of the enjoyment one could get from the scene by scene.

Crimson was kinda boring but i see the vision now. Wind Dragon kkkkkk[7] Ultimatia was awesome.[7] Pretty cool, especially the origin of the conflict in Ultimatia's bizarre interpretation.[6] Interesting situation: both sides' plans went wrong but they all came out closer to their goals. Kinda ugly tho.[8] What an episode, consistent and engaging.[8] Completely amazed by the consistency of these guys, what a lesson in edgy anime. Crimson & Ultimatia are great charas, Ragna, Leo, Nebulim are...also good. Starlia is... well, complicated.[8] How? Great comedy, good power play, Ultimatia's arc. The stuff w the Silver Company is awesome too. Only problem was the overexposition at the start, and the somewhat weak production.[8] The perfect thing to fill the dark void of edginess in my heart.[7] I wish Ragna had a more natural growth curve, trying to make his body catch up to his hax.[7] Cool, specially the development with Starlia and Ragna.[7] Nice thematic fight and good character showings for the Princess. Big drop off on the OP, but the ED is very good.[7] Absurdly quick, but on a good way.[8] Crimson is so damn good, and the new fights and powers were fun and intriguing.[8] Super cool fight full of character moments for Lia and some snippets for her troop & Crimson. The production is weaker then before and the pacing feels a little off, but its still very good.[6] Oh that is SAD sad. Olto is a good character and he & Taratectra could be awesome w more connections to the plot & characters. The explosion freezing scene is weird and poorly made, even if it sorta makes sense in-universe. Lia getting all flustered soft declaring herself was cute.  But the worst is that Kamui's arrival and subsequent fight are utterly amazing in concept but the production could not do it any justice.[8] Back on the groove! They really can write the characters in difficult situations and show a lot of personality even while worldbuilding and sowing intrigue. Awesome use of the thick air after a huge battle and the unseltiness of the Solar Cult.[7] Weird editing or maybe the directing or storyboarding weren't able to make the scenes flow into each other well. All characters had good showings, but Kamui's bizarre insertion of backstory was very detrimental to the episode. Interesting new lore revelations that i can't judge just yet, but mingled w quite bad production value.[7] The conversations were great, but the production is dragging it down even against the hype moments.[7] All those fights are amazing in concept, but the execution makes it almost not worth it. Lia's death scene is the best of the ep, followed closely by Crimson's confrontation to Tia and the preceding attack on Nebulim.[7] One of the very few to do a final battle well, w good twists & turns, logic and consequences. Nice to get backstory on the troop and Tia, also some worldbuilding w seeds for future arcs.[6] You gotta do a lot of work to get me invested in DBZ-esque fights and w poor production no less i was not really invested at all. Seeing everyone have their moment and try their best is good but some of the power-ups and dialogue lost me, pretty close to jumping the shark. Tia's backstory is nice, if predictable, but Kamui's was weird.[8] Again, production is weak, but the script felt very good this time. Tia's switch to the dragon side was terrifying and her overall arc and send off was super tragic. The consequences of the battle were bleak but the protagonists managed to come out on top w some surprising tricks. Don't know if having Lia and Slime survive are the best outcomes, but makes me happy no less .Aggregate Score: 7.17 also good. Starlia is... well, complicated.[8] How?

Then, alongside a large group of like-minded and exceptionally strong characters (the Argentum Corps), battles against this oppressive force in an all out war that would decide the fate of the world.The animation was great, the fight scenes were well choreographed and the main cast was likeable, through their determination and unbreakable...constitutions.

It was good, funny, there was a lot of action and surprising moments. It had everything I liked.However (and this contains overall spoilers with specific situations and names)...After a war with Teratectora and Olto Zora (and even during it), it started going south for me. There was still more and more moments when I suddenly asked ""What the hell am I...even watching?""It just became a massacre with cutting limbs, random deaths and WTF moments. The MC just became a screaming idiot who couldn\'t think of anything, but killing dragons anymore. He just became the machine that even forgot how to speak properly.There was even a moment where his head got cut off and he just grabbed it and put it back on. It just became disgusting and turned from great fantasy to some random sci-fi.It\'s a shame because it had some potential. The characters were interesting and there was so much more it could offer. MC himself wasn\'t as interesting, but Lia and her squad was. Take Fu for example. He had some power and looked truly strong and interesting, but I think he could have done so much more! And also Nebulim. He just evolved to adult dragon and looked truly strong, just to become Winged Monarch\'s guard dog and be slurped by a slime in a second...Also there was this kind of chemistry between Woltekamui and Ultimatia, that kinda got forgotten about (but they at least gave us their backstory right at the wrong time now).

He just evolved to adult dragon and looked truly strong, just to become Winged Monarch\'s guard dog and be slurped by a slime in a second...Also there was this kind of chemistry between Woltekamui and Ultimatia, that kinda got forgotten about (but they at least gave us their backstory right at the wrong time now). I think that character development for many characters just got cut-off. And there is much more that disappointed me.', ""Unlike most, I watched Ragna Crimson until its most recent episode(21) because its just that good. Don't judge an anime based on a few eps, you will definitely regret it. I hate that the show feels like a guilty pleasure to watch instead of a work to admire because of the shallow reviews I've seen about how they dropped it at ep 3. I probably wont convince you why its great but I felt the need to write this review because I loved it.Animation: 9/10The action is so well animated showing many detailed panels in depth frame by frame instead of the typical slide...shows that are easily used in these high action animes. This anime is the only anime this year on par with JJK'2s animation in terms of fight scenes, complexity, and smoothness.Plot : 10/10This story captivated more than most anime plots this year. On one hand we have Ragna and Crimson who want to eradicate the dragon bloodline while the dragons and the progenitor want to destroy humanity. Each dragon creature symbolizes a different type of being, some mercilessly kill humans while the head Ultimatia is the purest of the bunch yet still evil. These different types of characters feel like bosses with variable abilities, traits, and personalities etc..  In the quest of war, the story expands its world effectively, introducing other groups such as the silverware princesses brigade who desire taking out the dragons aswell, even using many as cannon fodder revealing what is at stake. The show is punishing in killing off its characters, but you kind of like that because you want the MC to get stronger and angrier to defeat each dragon foe with rage. And when a dragon gets taken out, it's ever so satisfying to take that small victory. Additionally the story takes fighting to the next level by using interesting abilities that are the best things about this show such as the concept of time pausing. It was awesome to see Ragna overcome that ability with his power and also when crimson devises plans to prevent op abilities like that from being abused. Another one was the idea of flashbangs to deny dragons from using the time pause. While this anime relies on past tropes such as the infamous power up ability to go over 9000, it does a good job handling the power balance between characters and it's very badass to see Ragna get increasingly more powerful. It doesn't even feel like Ragna is an overpowered character due to how beat up he gets and how easily he is outplayed in multiple scenarios showing that he can only succeed with Crimson. Essentially, there is a difference between the savvy mastermind crimson and the overpowered brute Ragna where in working together they can succeed in their mission.It's possible that some may argue that the story requires further backstory on the characters, their past, training, skills, etc to get a better understanding of their ambitions so that the start of the show doesnt feel rushed and confusing, but I ended up enjoying the ride especially after the ultimatia introduction episode where things start to become chaotic, clever, interesting, and it leaves you wanting more. By no means does this story surpass some of the greats of its genre such as dragon ball, but in no way would an anime like dragon ball having to show every story arc humanly possible pass today which is why by todays standards this plot is one of the best in anime this year.Voice acting and sound design: 10/10Crimsons VA is elegant sounding, she doesnt sound out of place and she is either easily hateble or you want love her cynicism. Ragna's VA is spot on, and so is the silverware's princesses.Basically there are no annoying sounding characters or effects in the show.Overall score: 9.5/10 shows that are easily used in these high action animes.

The plot gradually becomes more and more interesting, presenting entertaining, well-structured and diverse characters.Ragna and Crimson are each other\'s opposites, with the former coming across as an almost anti-hero vigilante, focused on revenge, but never falling into the ""seen it all before"" or banality.

Ragna is, at best, a C-tier dragon hunter who devotes his life acting as nanny to a 12-year-old A-tier dragon hunter named Leonica, nicknamed Leo. To protect her from a particularly strong beginner dragon, Ragna joins forces with his future self.Acquiring OP-ness is a classic shonen trait, from One Punch Man to My Hero Academia. But what I like about how this trope is done in Ragna Crimson is that this OP-ness was already inside Ragna—just from the future. You often see a shonen protagonist work hard to make his future self stronger,...so getting the reverse is a fun treat. The blending voices from present and future, as well as the art from the future realm with all the gears, is also awesome.While the premise is cool, I'm not a fan of Ragna's character. Yes, shonen protagonists are meant to be simpler and often have one goal in mind. But Ragna takes that one goal and, as his future self puts it, idolizes and leeches off it. He exists purely in terms of serving Leo, whether it's as her nanny, companion, or self-proclaimed bodyguard. Even his marketing pitch when he convinces Crimson to work with him is based on how he simped for Leo. Hopefully, with more focus on his and Crimson's dynamic, he'll grow as a character independent of Leo.I also like the edgy soundtrack that plays in action scenes. It reminds me a bit of RWBY—which not everyone likes, so take it or leave it.Overall, I recommend this anime if you want basic shonen with tiny future waifu material. ^^ so getting the reverse is a fun treat.

Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33091/Planetarian__Chiisana_Hoshi_no_Yume,"['After nearly a decade of reading and watching Key\'s works, and now having finished Planetarian\'s unlikely adaptation, I think I have come to accept that Key does not appeal much to me anymore. I have aged and moved on since those times, as has the anime industry and its community, and no longer feel all too impressed by what their stories had to offer.At the same time, I recognise that not everybody began watching anime at the same time. Some people have only just gotten into the medium in recent months, and so they may not yet be acquainted with Key\'s works. For these...people, there is still value to be found in Planetarian, for it is actually a surprisingly well-produced, if brief and heavy-handed tale. I cannot feel much of anything towards it, but maybe someone, somewhere, will feel that same fire and emotion I did all those years ago.Planetarian\'s soundtrack, much like the rest of Key\'s catalog, is excellent, and the art direction, particularly during the projection scene, does a solid job of creating atmosphere and making time and space truly feel vast, with humanity\'s greatest achievements flashing before the Junker in the blink of an eye. Hoshino is also, fortunately, not treated as eye-candy or some sort of waifu fantasy, as her mechanical (and somewhat creepy!) eyes make it clear that she is a robot and not a living and breathing human being. She is cute, but she is also a genuine character with purpose in the story. While there are issues to be had with the content of Planetarian, the execution of said content (in the context of an adaptation) is certainly worthy of praise and difficult to fault. It\'s a very solid production all-around. All one needs to do to understand the difference in quality between a poorly-directed anime and a well-directed one is to compare Planetarian to Rewrite, the other ongoing (and perhaps somewhat abysmal) Key adaptation. Planetarian is leagues better, and is about as good as any fan of the source material could have hoped for, really.But I do not know if that is enough to sway most anime-only viewers. The story is a nice, heart-warming little thing, but there is not much there with regards to depth and meaning. You will watch it, perhaps get a little misty-eyed during its dramatic conclusion, and that is where it ends. You will move on, get on with your day, and find the next thing to watch. A good anime or visual novel-- indeed, even a good story in general-- should have something to say or give to its readers. I am just not confident that this short little tragedy qualifies as that something.Even though the conclusion is a bit more low-key and reserved than other Key works (particularly Angel Beats), it still falls much into the same issue of being too dramatic for its own good. It so desperately wants to make the audience cry, but with scenes such as Hoshino lamenting how she cannot shed tears (and the rain so conveniently falling into her eyes as if she were actually crying), it becomes a bit difficult to take Planetarian\'s cloying conclusion all too seriously. I loathe the term ""forced drama"" as it is not a valid criticism, but those who have used it to attack Key works in the past will absolutely find more reason to use it here. I would personally have liked to see a less artificial ending without so many unnecessary theatrics. The potential for a great story is here, with its bleak, post-apocalyptic setting, but Key overthrew and missed the strike zone with Planetarian.It was somewhat disappointing to see the protagonist in the anime being a young-- no more than twenty-five years old-- jaded dude. If Key really wished to drive the emotional punch at the end, with the Junker regaining part of his humanity, it would have been much more powerful were he an older man who has been through and seen a lot of the new world. The anime does not sell me on his character being an emotionally broken and hardened soldier-- he just seems like a bit of an ass most of the time.Planetarian would also have benefited from being a movie instead of an ONA series, as the gaps between episodes (even if it is only as much as clicking on the next episode and sitting through a couple minutes of logos and advertisements) make the experience feel rather disjointed. Planetarian is meant to be a single, continuous story rather than a series marked by chapters and episodes. If you ever have had to pause a movie in the middle of your viewing for hours or days at a time, you will know just how much it ruins the experience and how difficult it makes it to feel much of anything during the climax, what with all the build-up gone and wasted. This is what it has felt like for me to watch Planetarian on a weekly basis. Anyone with the privilege of watching the anime after its airing is highly recommended to do so in one sitting, assuming they want to get something out of it.I may have been more excited with the concept of a Planetarian anime were it not 2016. The decade of the 2000\'s is a part of the past, and both the anime and visual novel industries have moved on from when Key was in their heyday. They have not released a new story in over five years, and seem more interested in having anime adaptations and remakes produced instead of something fresh and new. So I have to ask: do they intend to be the new Type-Moon, endlessly reliving its glory days and refusing to move on, or do they wish to regain their status and become relevant once again?This is a world where visual novel masterpieces like Sakura no Uta and Full Metal Daemon Muramasa now exist. The industry has surpassed Key, and now Key needs to catch back up before they fade to dust.Will they? Can they?A part of me remains skeptical. people, there is still value to be found in Planetarian, for it is actually a surprisingly well-produced, if brief and heavy-handed tale.

The industry has surpassed Key, and now Key needs to catch back up before they fade to dust.Will they? Can they?A part of me remains skeptical.', '""Planetarian is an one in many futuristic possibilities of our world.""Humanity is almost extinct due to some type of biological attack 30 years ago. Out of the people left some are called ""Junkers"", who scavenge for foods and goods from the destroyed cities to survive. Now one such ""Junker"" Kuzuya is searching for supplies in one such ruined city called Sarcophagus City, escaping from some bots he enter into an old military facility where he meets a robot who has been on sleep for almost 30 years....The robot Hoshino Yumemi is a companion type robot who used to work in this Planetarian, she as a robot believes the Junker to be his first customer in 30 years and treats him accordingly but the machines being inactive for a long time have damaged so as it turns out Kuzuya somehow is trying to repair the telescope which Hoshino-chan lovingly call ""Jena-san"".So the anime is pretty much about the conversation between those two.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are 3 new rules of (my) reviewing-First rule- No anime is shitSecond rule-No anime is shitThird rule-You don\'t have to agree with me(even sometimes I don\'t agree with myself)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is based on the following parameters--1)What is good about it?2)(Probability of)Whom\'ll the anime appeal to?3)Questions that other reviews raised in your head.P.S.-If you don\'t want to read the whole, read the summary at the end of every question.======================================1)What is good about it?Some anime are made for pure enjoyment, to make us laugh and sometimes to make us cry but some anime offer you something more than enjoyment i.e. a thought.

It’s been far too long but now, it’s a reality. With that out of the way, fans should anticipate and expect this to be a neat clean series that isn’t too short or long to take all in. Taking place in a dystopian world nearly 30 years after the failure of the Space Colonization Program, Planetarian’s storytelling is pretty simple. Humanity is mostly gone and the main protagonist (a Junker, someone who scavenges for useful goods) seeks refuge at an abandoned planetarium. It’s there that he...meets a mysterious robot girl named Yumemi Hoshino. And it’s there where the real magic happens.As most Key series go, it starts off somewhat slow paced but introduces our main characters well. There’s only two main characters really – the protagonist Junker and Hoshino. However, their character chemistry is what will attract the audience. From the get-go, Hoshino is curious about Junker because he is what she refers as a “customer”. As such, it’s her job to provide service to him. In truth, Junker really has no reason to stay by her side but chooses to anyway and even help her repair the planetarium’s projector. The way these two characters’ interactions are played out is peculiar but also thought provoking. It really makes you wonder how far the two can connect as they seem to have nothing in common with each other. In the meantime, we get to see more of Junker’s personal insights about the constellation and stars although he makes some rather ironic statements about them too.A good part of the series also comes from the dialogues. Hoshino may be a robot but she doesn’t speak in a mindless tone. Instead, she has more or less of a graceful-like personality that makes you feel at ease. Even for someone like Junker, he seems compelled to learn more about her or at least what she has to offer. This leads our robot girl to explain the essence of the stars, constellations, mankind’s history, and other little bits of intriguing information. It may even feel like a science class with Hoshino being the professor. At the same time, it’s interesting to see how a robot like Hoshino explain more about her own interpretations. She talks about if robots and humans can share a heaven or even if they can have dreams. This provokes Junker to envision his own future about humans. Although in reality, their world’s humanity is nearly extinct and with acid rains falling out of the sky, it’s not a pretty sight.On the technical front, we have David Production handling the production. To my surprise, they did a fairly decent job at crafting the main setting. Of course, I mean this as the dystopia world where we get to see the desolate city like a wasteland. The planetarium itself is designed to look exactly as such with nothing fancy but still stands out between everything. Character design wise, it’s interesting to see how a robot girl like Hoshino can express human-like behavior thanks to her convincing model. The mysterious vibe of the series fills the air especially with the eerie atmosphere and I think the studio portrayed that quite well in the end. The additional complement of quiet soundtrack and melancholic tones adds even more to make it credible.  Finally, I have to give some credit for the voice acting. It’s not always easy to step into the shoes of a robotic character but for someone like Hoshino, it feels like her voice is very natural and just right.As a short series (some episodes aren’t even 20 minutes in length), it’s surprisingly effective in storytelling. With just two characters, it connects their dialogue and interactions with compelling chemistry. Meanwhile, the plot is pretty easy to follow with its themes and messages. Now I do have to say that the pacing of the show will feel slow and the audience may be tested of their patience. Furthermore, the series itself really requires an open mind as you try to understand its intentions. But once you get the flow of it, this will be a rewarding experience.

I\'m not usually a fan of the genre, but what got me is that the story set in the atmosphere is quite different compared to what we are used to see : here the survival or wandering parts are not the center, it\'s all about the encounter between a junker (human) and a robot that has been waiting for years for a customer to come in the ""planetarian"", it\'s workplace.Kuzuya, after years of wandering in this dangerous environment, will come to the planetarian and meet yumemi, a robot...who is here to take care of the customers. Since it\'s not an AI, it can\'t realize the environment is different from what it was 30 years ago, and will treat the junker more or less like an ordinary customer.Kuzuya didn\'t have social interaction for years, so even if Yumemi is a robot, we can guess he is really pleased by the encounter. In this planetarian he can talk with someone without being suspicious, there we can see him fall asleep without trouble because he feels safe. And here is one the important thing of this story in my opinion, this planetarian is a safe haven in this hostile environment, and how it is set up is truly beautiful to me. For both our main characters, the time they will spend together is a bliss and a heaven in a world of ruins and chaos.Since the anime is magical, I feel like I would be too clumsy describing it anymore, so I will just tell you this to end the review : eventhough this show is quite short, it has more beautiful gems in it (from the unordinary relationship between a human and a robot, to the splendid scene where we see yumemi\'s presentation) than many other longer shows. I recommend to watch this show in high quality, since the animation and art are great.""I am a starteller"" who is here to take care of the customers.

She simply accepts it as an error on her part.Then we have Kuzuya who only sees the world as trash with a few salvageable parts scattered around.But what truly makes it is the chemistry (not love) between the two. Hoshino\'s inability to see the world as broken eventually gets to Kuzuya. She...shows him the beautiful sky, an eternal thing that cannot be shaped by war and destruction. She tells him the story of astronomy, mankind\'s treasure of curiosity. He is able to forget the current state of the world, even with just the sound of her narration. But what really got me, what really stood out, was that at the very end, he did not define himself as a junker, but as a starteller. He threw out his belief of a garbage world full of only scrap and replaced it with the beauty of the stars, a place of vivid imagination and timeless wonder.Story: 8/10   Planetarian is an anime that shows the current state of a now dystopian world.

I mean when a video game to movie adaptation turns out horrible, everyone is united in declaring its poor quality. And when a JRPG to anime adaptation turns out horrible, the fans cry about how it ruined the game and that anyone within a ten-mile radius of their tears should play...the damn thing and ignore this tarnish on its legacy. But whenever a visual novel to anime adaptation graces our presence and follows the game\'s story closely (preferably with decent production), suddenly the fans ignore the obvious faults that come when you remove the player interaction and the casuals hate the company itself for being involved.And I don\'t understand why. Visual novels are video games as well. They still require player interaction to get through them, and most of them make ""you"" the main character so that you can sympathize with what\'s going on by default, even if what\'s going on is a padded load of balls and the only interaction you\'re doing is a bunch of mouse clicks. If we concede to the common train of thought that all video game to movie/anime adaptations suck, it should stand to reason that all visual novels going through the same motions will suck too. And the reason why they suck should be obvious. It\'s because they remove the one powerful link between man and machine that allows us to overlook the fact that XCOM\'s story at the end of the day is just another man vs. alien conflict in the process of getting adapted. I\'m sure the Plastic Memories visual novel will be barrels of fun, much unlike the atrociously awful anime we got, since we\'re actually playing as Tsubasa in that and thus are able to sympathize with...bwahahaha! Yeah, not happening. Not unless they incorporate Mario Galaxy controls into that thing.So let\'s focus on the visual novel (technically kinetic novel) anime I\'m looking at this time. Planetarian is part of Key\'s attempt to get their remaining games adapted into anime now that every single one of their major titles has had a chance to shine (most of them, twice), and whilst Rewrite ended up getting the full series treatment from the morons who brought you Grisaia, their much smaller work was handed off to David Productions\' non-Jojo team presumably because they were the only major studio around who still has a small team in the first place. The original source material is actually pretty damn short given the original gaming novel could be finished in the same amount time it\'d take to get through Fate/Stay Night\'s prologue, and whilst expanding on it is clearly an option that most anime studios would do in order to get on broadcast TV, I think the recent reaction to Batman: The Killing Joke\'s adaptation has shown that even legendary (if very old) source material can get really easily ruined when you go that route. So instead, Planetarian gets five episodes (and a movie adaptation of that light novel that I know nothing about and thus can\'t judge in any way until it comes out) of varying lengths released on the net, and I\'m reviewing another summer 2016 anime when the season isn\'t even halfway done.The plot is focused on a nameless human known as a junker as he tries his best to survive in a post-apocalyptic world of constant rain and robots that will massacre you on sight that has formed as a consequence of humanity\'s constant hunger for war, depletion of natural resources, and all that other shit Trump denies is a problem in his platform. Whilst exploring a ruined city one day for supplies, he discovers a moe robot girl named Yumemi in a domed planetarium that still has a limited supply of electricity, and despite the world going to shit for more than three decades, Yumemi\'s programming makes her unable to comprehend that people aren\'t exactly going to be lining up to join her tour anytime soon and the scientists who made her probably look like they went through the third world war at this point in time. As such, she constantly pesters the one human she\'s ever going to have contact with, and said human is eventually going to have to cave into her demands because moe is a rare thing in a dying world (unless said dying world is Danganronpa\'s I mean).I\'m sure most of you guys know my problems with visual novel anime by now. In a non-interactive medium, they\'re just a bunch of disjointed set pieces and an overloaded cast strung together by a tissue-thin plot that\'s more focused on introducing these elements rather than telling a story with momentum and pacing we can\'t control. I don\'t care how likable the characters are or how interesting the world seems to be. I will not accept character-building/world-building on their own terms as acceptable substance, and unfortunately the majority of anime fans seem to have no problem with that, which is a large part of the reason why stuff like Clannad (as well as a lot of anime and live-action shows in general) gets the acclaim that it does, and the business practice gets to stay as a result. As such, I never go into these things with any enthusiasm, resigned to the fact that these writers don\'t understand their stuff is not made for the non-interactive crowd, and continue lambasting the results on this blog until they learn to take a hint and stop blighting the animu with their presence. Of course, I\'m going to have to eat my words a little regarding Planetarian, because it\'s actually quite good.The phrase ""less is more"" really helps to define this show\'s quality. Because of the nature of its release, each episode can be as long or short as it needs to be, ensuring that the pacing will never be a problem whilst detailing each self-contained chapter of the tale about a handsome-looking soldier and his moe robot companion. And whilst the show is very dialogue-driven like all anime based on computer novels, Planetarian actually does a pretty good job of making the dialogue contribute to the story rather than just build it up. Every single conversation between the only two characters in this show actually has interesting things to say regarding finding the last remnants of humanity in a world run by artificial intelligence, as well as defining the limits of what artificial intelligence can actually do given their programming amidst the character-building banter in order to give things a certain amount of weight. You won\'t find any anime meta-humor or dreary slice-of-life in these moe-infested ruins. You\'ll just find bleakness and attempts to fight it.The visuals in this show are also pretty impressive. They\'re not the most expressive things in the world, but given David Production\'s usual luck with animation quality, I\'m surprised they put as much effort into this as they have. The actual projector scene that\'s apparently supposed to be one of two highlights of the original novel (you know what the other highlight is) is not only beautiful, but it really did a good job of sucking me into another world of lavish emotions and escapist freedom to the point that I could probably write an entire post on that scene alone. I\'m not kidding when I say that that one scene serves as one of the few reminders regarding why I prefer animation above all other mediums despite my preference towards the noticeably higher quality construction that goes on in the live-action scene (especially these days). My love is rooted all in the unique forms of expressions the medium is capable of, and before people get smart, I don\'t mean the ""funny"" kind that Shonen Jump has popularized. Oh, and thank god that Planetarian never goes for facial gag humor either. I\'ve already punched enough holes in my TV monitor trying to block out the exaggerated faces in Rewrite.I am a bit iffy on Yumemi\'s clumsiness throughout the show. It can be a bit repetitive, and I have a hard time picturing that a robot can actually trip as often as she can. Also, there\'s no real reason for her to be moe in the first place other than because of fan appeal. I understand she can\'t be a female version of Bender because her character is supposed to be a hopeful counterpoint to the Junker\'s entire lifestyle, but there\'s a difference between being a clueless saint and being a clumsy fool. Yes, believe it or not, those aren\'t synonyms for each other. I know, I\'m shocked too.Also, this is a Key anime, so of course the story ends in tragedy. And before people question me further, I\'m referring to the perma-death tragedy that can\'t be resetted because magic doesn\'t actually exist in this universe unless you count the circumstances the writer contrives to get us to that conclusion. Without wishing to spoil anything, let\'s just say that the penultimate episode sets up so many death flags that it outnumbers the number of flags you\'d usually have to trigger to get on a certain visual novel girl\'s route, and you can apply the ""Thanks Obama"" meme to the incident that causes events to spiral out of control. Murphy\'s Law actually rears its ugly head several times throughout the series so at least it\'s consistent on that front, but if the early episodes have that rule attacking the characters with a slap, the later episodes have it attack with a submachine gun.I can\'t say I felt much tragedy in that final episode personally, and not just because I saw it coming a mile away. I don\'t know if it was the direction\'s fault or the fact that I never found Yumemi all that interesting a character, but all I could do when ""that"" event occurred was nod my head whilst thinking ""is it me, or is the music kinda happy? And boy, this scene is kinda long."" There wasn\'t anything wrong with it on a writing standpoint per say and I get what the production team was going for in terms of when and when not to play the music, but it felt like they were holding back too much on the feels (which is ironic, I know), trying so hard to convince me that everything was going to be okay that I ended up buying it completely. I guess there\'s only so much potential in tears you can wring out of your premise when it involves a happy go-lucky robot and a nameless soldier whose head we don\'t get into too much. Or maybe I only feel for tragedies when it involves lovers, which our two leads were definitely not.At the end of the day though, I\'m surprised by how much I enjoyed Planetarian. It\'s not exactly a mind-blower in terms of post-apocalyptic drama and stories regarding AI, but it\'s solid as a rock in all the important ways to the point that it feels fresh enough, and it serves well as a champion in regards to how to fight the format limits that plague most anime - particularly the broadcast ones - let alone as how to make a video game to anime adaptation that feels natural even if the end goal is to make fanboys cream their ""Key coffee""-patterned pajamas. I know a lot of people haven\'t actually watched this show for reasons that I\'m not quite sure of, so if you\'re one of them and you\'re mildly curious, give it a shot. I mean the whole package is only about a hundred minutes long. By the time you\'re finished with it, your younger cousin that you\'re trying to convert to anime-ism still won\'t be done with The Boy and the Beast. the damn thing and ignore this tarnish on its legacy. But whenever a visual novel to anime adaptation graces our presence and follows the game\'s story closely (preferably with decent production), suddenly the fans ignore the obvious faults that come when you remove the player interaction and the casuals hate the company itself for being involved.And I don\'t understand why. Visual novels are video games as well. They still require player interaction to get through them, and most of them make ""you"" the main character so that you can sympathize with what\'s going on by default, even if what\'s going on is a padded load of balls and the only interaction you\'re doing is a bunch of mouse clicks. If we concede to the common train of thought that all video game to movie/anime adaptations suck, it should stand to reason that all visual novels going through the same motions will suck too. And the reason why they suck should be obvious. It\'s because they remove the one powerful link between man and machine that allows us to overlook the fact that XCOM\'s story at the end of the day is just another man vs. alien conflict in the process of getting adapted. I\'m sure the Plastic Memories visual novel will be barrels of fun, much unlike the atrociously awful anime we got, since we\'re actually playing as Tsubasa in that and thus are able to sympathize with...bwahahaha! Yeah, not happening. Not unless they incorporate Mario Galaxy controls into that thing.So let\'s focus on the visual novel (technically kinetic novel) anime I\'m looking at this time. Planetarian is part of Key\'s attempt to get their remaining games adapted into anime now that every single one of their major titles has had a chance to shine (most of them, twice), and whilst Rewrite ended up getting the full series treatment from the morons who brought you Grisaia, their much smaller work was handed off to David Productions\' non-Jojo team presumably because they were the only major studio around who still has a small team in the first place. The original source material is actually pretty damn short given the original gaming novel could be finished in the same amount time it\'d take to get through Fate/Stay Night\'s prologue, and whilst expanding on it is clearly an option that most anime studios would do in order to get on broadcast TV, I think the recent reaction to Batman: The Killing Joke\'s adaptation has shown that even legendary (if very old) source material can get really easily ruined when you go that route. So instead, Planetarian gets five episodes (and a movie adaptation of that light novel that I know nothing about and thus can\'t judge in any way until it comes out) of varying lengths released on the net, and I\'m reviewing another summer 2016 anime when the season isn\'t even halfway done.The plot is focused on a nameless human known as a junker as he tries his best to survive in a post-apocalyptic world of constant rain and robots that will massacre you on sight that has formed as a consequence of humanity\'s constant hunger for war, depletion of natural resources, and all that other shit Trump denies is a problem in his platform. Whilst exploring a ruined city one day for supplies, he discovers a moe robot girl named Yumemi in a domed planetarium that still has a limited supply of electricity, and despite the world going to shit for more than three decades, Yumemi\'s programming makes her unable to comprehend that people aren\'t exactly going to be lining up to join her tour anytime soon and the scientists who made her probably look like they went through the third world war at this point in time. As such, she constantly pesters the one human she\'s ever going to have contact with, and said human is eventually going to have to cave into her demands because moe is a rare thing in a dying world (unless said dying world is Danganronpa\'s I mean).I\'m sure most of you guys know my problems with visual novel anime by now. In a non-interactive medium, they\'re just a bunch of disjointed set pieces and an overloaded cast strung together by a tissue-thin plot that\'s more focused on introducing these elements rather than telling a story with momentum and pacing we can\'t control. I don\'t care how likable the characters are or how interesting the world seems to be. I will not accept character-building/world-building on their own terms as acceptable substance, and unfortunately the majority of anime fans seem to have no problem with that, which is a large part of the reason why stuff like Clannad (as well as a lot of anime and live-action shows in general) gets the acclaim that it does, and the business practice gets to stay as a result. As such, I never go into these things with any enthusiasm, resigned to the fact that these writers don\'t understand their stuff is not made for the non-interactive crowd, and continue lambasting the results on this blog until they learn to take a hint and stop blighting the animu with their presence. Of course, I\'m going to have to eat my words a little regarding Planetarian, because it\'s actually quite good.The phrase ""less is more"" really helps to define this show\'s quality. Because of the nature of its release, each episode can be as long or short as it needs to be, ensuring that the pacing will never be a problem whilst detailing each self-contained chapter of the tale about a handsome-looking soldier and his moe robot companion. And whilst the show is very dialogue-driven like all anime based on computer novels, Planetarian actually does a pretty good job of making the dialogue contribute to the story rather than just build it up. Every single conversation between the only two characters in this show actually has interesting things to say regarding finding the last remnants of humanity in a world run by artificial intelligence, as well as defining the limits of what artificial intelligence can actually do given their programming amidst the character-building banter in order to give things a certain amount of weight. You won\'t find any anime meta-humor or dreary slice-of-life in these moe-infested ruins. You\'ll just find bleakness and attempts to fight it.The visuals in this show are also pretty impressive. They\'re not the most expressive things in the world, but given David Production\'s usual luck with animation quality, I\'m surprised they put as much effort into this as they have. The actual projector scene that\'s apparently supposed to be one of two highlights of the original novel (you know what the other highlight is) is not only beautiful, but it really did a good job of sucking me into another world of lavish emotions and escapist freedom to the point that I could probably write an entire post on that scene alone. I\'m not kidding when I say that that one scene serves as one of the few reminders regarding why I prefer animation above all other mediums despite my preference towards the noticeably higher quality construction that goes on in the live-action scene (especially these days). My love is rooted all in the unique forms of expressions the medium is capable of, and before people get smart, I don\'t mean the ""funny"" kind that Shonen Jump has popularized. Oh, and thank god that Planetarian never goes for facial gag humor either. I\'ve already punched enough holes in my TV monitor trying to block out the exaggerated faces in Rewrite.I am a bit iffy on Yumemi\'s clumsiness throughout the show. It can be a bit repetitive, and I have a hard time picturing that a robot can actually trip as often as she can. Also, there\'s no real reason for her to be moe in the first place other than because of fan appeal. I understand she can\'t be a female version of Bender because her character is supposed to be a hopeful counterpoint to the Junker\'s entire lifestyle, but there\'s a difference between being a clueless saint and being a clumsy fool. Yes, believe it or not, those aren\'t synonyms for each other. I know, I\'m shocked too.Also, this is a Key anime, so of course the story ends in tragedy. And before people question me further, I\'m referring to the perma-death tragedy that can\'t be resetted because magic doesn\'t actually exist in this universe unless you count the circumstances the writer contrives to get us to that conclusion.

It is the shortest VN in their library of works which includes such greats as Clannad, Kanon, Little Busters, Angel Beats and Rewrite.Now the main difference of this anime that most people will probably notice right away is that it consists of a story that has only two characters.As a huge fan of Key’s storytelling and someone who has watched every anime based on their VNs, I was excited when it was announced that Planetarian was being made into an...anime.So how does this adaption by David Production measure up? Here are my thoughts on this ONA series…StoryIt’s thirty years after the collapse of the Space Colonization Program. Humanity is nearly extinct from the deadly rain that falls on the Earth. Men known as “Junkers” scavenge goods and artifacts from the ruins of civilization. One day a “Junker” decides to enter the dangerous ruins called Sarcophagus City, in the middle of this broken down city he stumbles into Flowercrest Department Store with a planetarium on the roof. It is here that he meets Yumemi Hoshino, the attendant robot who is awakened once a year for 168 hours when the stores back up power activates. To her he is the first customer she has had in thirty years and greets him with a smile and attempts to do the job she was created for by showing him the stars. The projector turns out to be broken and annoyed with her constant chatter, the Junker agrees to repair it so she can show him her presentation.CharactersThis story consists of two characters “The Junker” and “Yumemi Hoshino”, though we do meet other characters through flashbacks they are never really there in the current day. Both characters were animated and voiced well which makes them relatable and likable.Yumemi is a robot who was designed to look like a teenage to early 20’s female, she was programmed to be an attentive, friendly and helpful to the customers visiting the store and planetarium. Due to this programming she is very talkative and is filled with a wealth of knowledge about the surrounding areas of the store. She calls the Junker “Mr. Customer” throughout the story as he never gives her his name.The Junker is a man that appears to be in his mid 20’s to early 30’s that is living the life of a scavenger to survive this dystopian world that he lives in. He seems to have a rough personality and gets annoyed very easily by Yumemi’s programming. Later on he seems to develop a fondness for her and doesn’t want to leave her behind in the empty and lonely city.Voice Acting and AnimationThe original voice actors from the game and drama CDs are used in the anime. Daisuke Ono once again gives a touching and heartfelt performance to his character (The Junker) and makes him easily relatable and gives him a great range of emotion. Keiko Suzuki once again makes Yumemi sound so alive and human. The range of depth in her emotional ending speech hits you just as hard in the anime as it did in the game.For a studio who hasn’t done a huge amount of anime, they did a great job with the animation and character design. The dystopian and broken down world looks amazingly real and the planetarium is nothing fancy, but gives you the sense of being in one. The character design is also done well as Yumemi’s actions are so human-like that it shows how advanced her robot design was when she was created.Sound/OSTThe ED song used was “Twinkle Starlight” by Sayaka Sasaki which is beautiful and fits the theme of this series well. The background sounds and the music fit each scene well and draws you in. The presentation at the planetarium is a prime example of this, I actually felt like I was there myself watching the presentation.Overall EnjoymentPlanetarian is a story that will touch you from the beginning to the end. The flashbacks from when the world was alive to the current state of the world will make you feel like you are there along with the characters. The chemistry between the two characters is what sets this story apart from other anime based on VNs. Yumemi’s inability to see the world as Junker does it what gives the story heart, and what lets him take a break from the real world and forget his troubles.My Personal ThoughtsAs someone who played the Kinectic Novel on Steam, I knew what the story was about from the beginning to the end. I also knew how it would play out and even with that knowledge, I was hooked from the first episode. Even though the the game had a lot of emotion and a great story, seeing it played out in an anime adaption was amazing. Every episode touched me and I shed as many tears watching this is a did reading it in the game. The characters gave so much life to the story that it seemed like I had only played the game yesterday and not two years ago. I was skeptical about how the animation would be handled at first as I was unfamiliar with the work of David Production, since I have only seen one other anime by them at that was Hyperdimension Neptunia which is also based on a video game. My skepticism was short lived as from the very first episode, I could see how much work went into adapting this into an anime. I was in awe at how well every scene looked, and at how well the character animation was done. Everything felt so alive!My only complaint about the whole series was at the end, the song that was played in the game when Yumemi is giving her final speech was missing and I think that they should have used the song “Perfect Human” while that scene played out. I still cried my eyes out, but I felt something was missing and after viewing the last episode again with that song playing during that scene I knew what it was.If you like touching stories, this is a must watch series!Overall I gave this a 9/10! I also recommend checking out the Kinetic Novel on Steam. anime.So how does this adaption by David Production measure up?

Perhaps, will it be one where we can no longer look up at the sky and gaze at the stars during the night? The anime I\'m reviewing started out as a visual novel (a kinetic novel, to be exact) from Key, and I actually played it over a year before the anime adaptation was even announced because I just love Key\'s works; although it started off as a bit of a disappointment, it gradually got a lot better and left me close to tears in the end. With how short it was, however,...I thought it would never get an anime adaptation, and when it was, I thought for a second that it was a joke, since it WAS April Fool\'s Day. However, it turned out to be real (albeit in the form of an ONA), and luckily, it ended up being enjoyable.Ladies and gentlemen, my review of ""Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet"", or ""Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume"" in Japanese, awaits you! (To read it, that is.)Planetarian, as it shall hence be referred to, takes place 30 years after the failure of the Space Exploration Project has brought an end to the world as we know it. Some men, known as ""junkers"", seek resources required to survive in this kind of world. One such junker (or Kuzuya, as I shall be referring him to, since he doesn\'t really have a name) ends up finding his way into a planetarium and meeting a robot named Yumemi Hoshino. Yumemi, unaware of what has happened to the world, attempts to show him a projection of the stars in order to commemorate the planetarium\'s 2,500,000th customer (although it\'s actually less than that), but the projector, Miss Jena, stops working. Albeit reluctantly, Kuzuya decides to stay at the planetarium and fix Miss Jena. From here, a heartwarming story unfolds, and Kuzuya ends up finding beauty in the stars that Yumemi shows him.As with all of Key\'s other works, this story is one that, at one point or another, will tug at your heart strings and, even if you don\'t cry, leave you on the edge of doing so. There may be only two characters in Planetarian (or at least only two notable characters), but they both manage to keep this anime\'s story going. Kuzuya is quite an interesting character; he started out very coldhearted, but considering the conditions of Planetarian\'s world, I can\'t say I blame him. The development he gets is quite excellent, too. As for Yumemi, one may see her as an annoying character due to how talkative and oblivious she is, but she\'s actually a very interesting character, as well. I simply cannot picture this anime without her.The animation, done by David Production.... well, I haven\'t seen a lot of their anime (other than this and Ben-To, which I\'ve currently only seen two episodes of), but their animation in Planetarian is simply BEAUTIFUL, even for an ONA; it\'s a good match with the story. The voice acting was great, too; Daisuke Ono and Keiko Suzuki did well in their respective roles as Kuzuya and Yumemi. I noticed that Yumemi\'s voice was a bit deeper than I remembered hearing her in the visual novel, but since it has been over a decade since the visual novel was released, I don\'t see it as an issue at all. This anime goes without an opening theme, but since it\'s an ONA with somewhat-short episodes, I can let that slide. The ending theme, ""Twinkle Starlight"" by Sayaka Sasaki, is a solid song that I\'ve actually listened to countlessly even before this anime\'s first episode aired.Overall, Planetarian was a very good anime. I\'d recommend this anime for Key fans or fans of heartwarming stories in general.

Kuzuya starts out not caring about that ridiculously cute robot at all, but ends up staying in the planetarium anyway, slowly growing fond of her. We all know that feeling, things that shouldn\'t grow on us (a car, a house or other things) and we have a hard time letting it go. If that ""something"" is a friendly humanoid robot, it\'s even easier to understand why Kuzuya can\'t just leave her...as she is. It\'s a beautiful little story about a man opening up his heart in this heartless world.9/10Art:The starry sky in Yumemis projection is simply beautiful, a stark contrast to the outside, which is grey and cold. The planetarium feels like a different world. Yumemis character design is very moe, which of course makes her easy to like and care about. And finally the CG effect of the tank robot is very smooth and well done.9/10Sound:The soundtrack is (you guessed it) beautiful and strenghtens the emotions of the scenes. However, the anime is just too short for any of the pieces to become truly memorable. Both voice actors do a good job and the sound effects are pretty good too.8/10Characters:If you don\'t like Yumemi you must have no heart. She\'s kind of like a helpless child and I really, really, really wanted her to be saved. What I especially liked, was that she behaved like an actual robot. She may understand what emotions are, but she does not have them. Everything she does and says is based on her programming and she does not magically become human. Kuzuya was a relatable guy, who of course does not care about either the stars or the robot at first, which makes sense, after all he is struggling for survival. But by pitying Yumemi and his actual love for stars, that he almost forgot, he becomes more human again, even though he never fully forgets the harsh reality.10/10Enjoyment:I loved Planetarian. It felt like a futuristic fairytale and of course it had the Key Feels Seal of Approval. 5 episodes was enough to tell this story, though it may prevent a lasting impact for some. I don\'t know if I will come back to watch this anime again in the future, but the memories of it will always be fond.9/10Overall:9.0/10 as she is.

The synopsis spoke of war, a ""Sarcophagus City"" where ""Junkers"" would scavenge for lost artifacts, and a glorious planetarium worth repairing to see it\'s wonders. During the series, we get the littlest snippet of only one of these things.Story: This story is a snooze fest. The main focus of this story is boring and ultimately doesn\'t pay off at all because of how long it takes to come to ahead. Other scenes, including the series conclusion take what feel like...ages to finish and don\'t nearly reach the emotional payoff it was looking for. Everything feels disjointed, and alot of potential was wasted on these drawn out scenes. I wanted to see more of this city, I wanted backstory on this war, I wanted to see more about Yumemi\'s creators and what happened to them. I wanted to learn why Kuzuya was a ""Junker"", and what led him to live this life. I want to know why it\'s constantly raining. I want to know why there are robots on the street that attack people as they see them.Characters: Seeing as though there are only 2 characters that get significant screentime, It would be very important to develop these characters into people you care about, people you want to see succeed. Unfortunatley, Planetarian woefully misses on this point. The lead character Kuzuya (who\'s name I had no recollection of whatsoever) is a dull, boring character who\'s decision making skills are as bizzare as his attitude. In the first episode, he is entirely and thoroughly annoyed by our other lead character, Yumemi. Despite showing utter disdain for Yumemi for the entirety of the episode, he decides to stay and help fix the Planetarium she has been residing in for over 30 years. They develop a ""friendship"" that feels entirely forced for the sake of giving the viewer something to care about when the series comes to a conclusion. Yumemi gets a pass for me. She is a robot dedicated to assisting customers that come to the the planetarium. She spouts off information as if it were another day, blissfully unaware that there are no people left to come and see her presentation. Her actions and motives make sense, which is enough to make her OK.Art: The art is the best thing about this series. It\'s clean, has good rain effects, and the Planetarium scene is well done enough, however short it was for the amount of setup it took to get to that point. The character design is effective enough for the setting.Sound: The sound effects were realistic, with special attention to the constant rain during outdoor scenes. The music was serviceable, but not very memorable. The main characters VA work was good. Jill Harris and David Matranga fit their characters well. There wasn\'t anything that stood out, save for a few lines from that Matranga that impressed me.Planetarian\'s only saving grace is it\'s clean art style and decent voice acting. The story and characters are dreadfully executed and extremely forgettable. You\'d be better off avoiding this one. ages to finish and don\'t nearly reach the emotional payoff it was looking for.

Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume is a anime adaption of a little visual novel wich steam recommended me. Solely because i read all this positive feedback i threw an eye onto the anime.First off, the story. I couldn´t really decide wether it should be a score of eight or nine but i decided myself for the worse. Not because something negative came in my mind but rather because i figured i shouldn´t let myself be blinded by the first impressions, as...it only has four of presumably twelve episodes yet.The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world with humanity being on the verge of extinction and robots hunting the remaining survivors. It isn´t something impressively new but it´s not overused too, making it a relatively original storysetting.  The story itself revolves less around the world but more on the two main characters, or rather solely around those. Though it may not sound like much it is in fact really interesting and the way it progresses you really want to go on watching, but sadly there is just one episode per week.And secondly, the art. I gave nine points on this one because i really liked the artstyle. But that surely isn´t enough to justify such a good score, is it? Well on one side there is the coloring of the whole anime, its surroundings and the characters. Everything is perfectly fitting, the world is grey and colorless, the main character really looks like he has a hard time but then comes Hoshino Yumemi, the second main character. You can tell on the first sight that there is a contradiction. While everything is rather grey she really shines with colors wich are outstanding in the scenery. On the other side however is the way everything is drawn. The surroundings, the ground, the walls. every object looks like it actually is old and abandoned but then again there comes Hoshino, designed totally frilly with a lot details and decorations at her and completely clean and pure. It becomes obvious that she is supposed to be highlighted and focused on.The sound was actually not that outstanding but still fitting to every minute of the anime. May it be the music or the effects or the voices, everything fits together. The man, annoyed and cold, Hoshino, always apologetic and friendly. Overall very well done but nothing to win a reward for.Ahhhh, the characters, while there are only three in total (as of today) only the two main characters are introduced properly. But since there just the two characters to take care of, they really are getting a personality wich become clear gradually. The man firstly taking no interest in the AI Hoshino but later becomes affected to her, though a love interest is not implicated. It was really interesting to see how they cope with eachother and slowly getting along.Now my favourite Part : My personal enjoyment. I was honestly surprised how well absolutely everything fits together. But also how well emotions and feelings are delivered directly to the viewer. If you follow the happening a dark mood comes up, sort of implicating what will happen. And considering how the game ended it will cause me and surely many others a waterfall from the eyes onto their keyboards while crying about the sadness wich is going on. Even the four episodes almost made me cry a little bit because it is not really displayed directly but it simply is so damn sad if you think about what is going on. Though the single aspects of this anime are not perfect, everything is pasted together just perfectly creating an awesome result.What is there left to say about this anime? I don´t really know. If you like what i described or want to make your own opinion i highly suggest you to watch this anime. However if it sounds too sad for you then i guess you watch it too?

I am a Starteller"" This was one of those what if anime for me at first but grew on me after the first episode.. Its always raining and he happens to here about a girl robot in this town from his master and she shows him a world he never saw... It was a good watch even with its 5 episodes its really great and the ending just made me burst into tears... Its defiantly one of those shorts that actually have so much to it that you can\'t get enough of.Though I do say if you have not...watched this yet its very good.. Not too much action, but it does make up for it in so many ways.... watched this yet its very good.. Not too much action, but it does make up for it in so many ways....', 'Key, you did it again. You made me cry again in the end of fifth episode. Now, I have no regrets picking up this series. Now let\'s get back to the review.What do I love from this series? It would be all of them. I mean look at it. Look at the animation. It may not too impressive but it\'s great enough to make me say that the animation is very good. I mean look at the combat sequences. The fluid movements of the combat robots were great. And Planetarian nailed it with combining those great things with a great character development and music.Planetarian did...the character developments smoothly enough to make me want to cry in the end. With only two characters to develop, they dedicated their time to maximize the character developments. They give the feel of hope to the desperate MC with a small help from the robot, Yumemi. Oh yeah, have I said that the MC himself didn\'t have an official name? Well, I think it\'s a bit tricky to make it stay like that and Planetarian did it flawlessly by making Yumemi called the MC with Mr. Costumer (Kokyaku-sama in Japanese). That let us to imagine who the MC is freely. Even we could make him as a character came from ourselves. Personally, because I love seeing stars, I could relate my feeling to the MC. I knew these days we could not see stars in the city so I need to go to a very distant place just to look into the beautiful stars that I love so much.The music, well I really wanted to say this. It sounds like one of my country\'s national songs called ""Ibu Pertiwi"". When I watched this anime in my home\'s living room, anyone who came across the living room would say that. Well, I heard that the soundtrack itself adapted from a Japanese folk song. Nevertheless, the song itself made this anime more alive. When I heard the soundtrack, I felt myself sitting on soft green grass beneath the starry stars of the lovely clear skies of night which is perfect when you think that this show is revolving around a planetarium. It gave me the sense to understand the characters more and more.Overall, I would like recommend this series to all of you who loves tears shedding shows. I never regret to pick this one up even it was a little bit late. the character developments smoothly enough to make me want to cry in the end.

The story was great, characters were great, and I overall enjoyed it a lot seeing as how I watched through this anime in one sitting.The story was very well done. It showed us how robots are built for one thing and they can't adapt to others unless we program them to do so. The characters were great even though it really only had two characters. One character knew what the world had become while the other was completely lost. She...did not know what had happened and was still doing what she was suppose to be doing. Then the guy starts to grow on the girl even though she is a robot and wants her to live. The ending is truly sad, I am impressed this anime could pull off something like that so quickly.I highly recommend you watch this anime. It's only 5 episodes long. There is also a movie set to come out later this summer and I know I will be watching it. did not know what had happened and was still doing what she was suppose to be doing.

Unlike the company\'s most famous visual novels, Planetarian is fairly simplistic and very short. However, that doesn\'t mean it\'s bad and it also comes with the advantage of being extremely easy to adapt. While it may have been somewhat overshadowed by Rewrite this season, the difference is that this is actually a good adaptation.The story takes place in a dystopian future world in a seemingly ruined...city. Hostile robots guard the streets and all human inhabitants have long since abandoned the place. It is here we find our nameless protagonist: a middle-aged soldier trying to scavenge the city for supplies whilst trying his best to avoid the sentient droids patrolling it. His search eventually leads him to a wrecked planetarium where he\'s shocked to meet an innocent-looking young girl who welcomes him to the building. At first he thinks she is an enemy, but before long finds out that the girl, called Hoshino Yumemi, is actually a broken robot. Not the kind that aggressively roams the city outside, but rather an old humanoid service robot working for the planetarium, left inside all alone for decades ever since the city was abandoned. And so begins the melancholic story of Planeterian, where a scarred old war dog finally gets a new chance to reflect on his life and find something to give it some meaning rather than just trying to stay alive.The soldier (generally just referred to as ""Mr Customer"") takes shelter in the planetarium for a while, but Yumemi, being ecstatic over her first customer in ages, is very enthusiastic to show off all the attractions the establishment has to offer. I think it can be pretty easy to get annoyed with her overwhelming in-your-face attitude, but at the same time you have to realize that she is in fact an AI, and as she admits herself, a malfunctioning one at that, and with that taken into account I think she\'s a fairly realistically portrayed character. She has no idea of what has happened in the outside world, nor is she capable of properly understanding that there is anything wrong with the current situation, despite her awareness of the fact that she hasn\'t had a customer in years. Her constant cheerful demeanor, unwavering enthusiasm to service her customer, full obedience of anything he tells her, and inability to properly adapt to unexpected events all feel very natural for a robot. But it also works very well due to the enormous contrast Yumemi is to the protagonist. He is tough, cold, stoic, distrusting and very rarely shows any signs of emotion. While not much of it is actually told to the viewers directly, it\'s clear that he\'s been through a lot of grim and depressing things over the years.Speaking of which, regarding the whole state of the world itself, very little is actually told. You get a brief explanation of what has happened at one point, but it\'s not very detailed. However, I don\'t really think that\'s detrimental to the show as a whole because it\'s not really a necessity for what the story is actually about, and sometimes leaving things up to interpretation can actually be a good thing.Despite the dystopian sci-fi premise, I would honestly say Planetarian is more catered to fans of iyashikei anime due its slow-paced and simplistic yet melancholic and reflective narrative themes. Most of the show consists of the duo simply talking with each other inside the planetarium, trying to repair some of the broken equipment, and Yumemi narrating about the stars. Rather than having any deep story in the outside world itself, it instead tries to showcase how a person can be affected by their direct polar opposite when put in such a lonely and desperate environment. It\'s the kind of show which allows you to simply lean back and reflect on yourself and perhaps make you appreciate what life actually has to offer a little bit more. And then in typical Key fashion, it eventually all culminates in a rather dramatic and emotional climax, though whether that\'ll actually make you feel anything or not is of course entirely individual.Overall, Planetarian is by no means a masterpiece, but just like how I thought the game was one of the best short visual novels I\'ve played, I\'d say the adapted version is also one of the better short anime I\'ve seen. For what is actually nothing more than a 5-episode ONA series, it\'s hard to find something of equivalent quality to Planetarian. city.

I kind of knew what I was getting myself into but at the same time, I had no expectations because for the past few years, KEY anime has been disappointing the hell out of me due to poor handling and how rushed they were. Well did Planetarian disappoint me? The answer is.......No! It did not disappoint me and it\'s been a...while since a KEY anime has made me cry. Hell, this series wasn\'t even rushed. It was short but it still successfully manage to do what it needs to do, in KEY\'s style, of course. If you\'ve watched KEY\'s shows before or even played their VN then you know their style. Spend time with the characters then once you warm up to said characters, the real tragedy comes in and that\'s where it hurts the most.The story is basically simple. The show takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the human race are nearly extinct and the remaining people called ""Junkers"" roams the lands and salvages the remaining goods. One Junker managed to enter a dangerous city called ""Sarcophagus City"" and he found a pre-war Planeterium where he met a female companion robot.Honestly, the story was really predictable and I knew what direction the show was going to head. Was that necessarily a bad thing? For some, probably yes, but for me, no. This is a KEY anime, after all so I knew how this was going to end but this was still an emotional story for me. What I really loved about the series is learning all about the world before and after the tragedy occurred and watching the chemistry grow between the two characters. Seriously, the latter was just amazing to watch and it reminds me why I love how KEY manages to break your damn heart.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)For an ONA series, the visuals and character designs looks surprisingly great. The visuals looks beautiful and at the same time, managed to capture that lonely and post-apocalyptic world. The animation was also surprisingly consistent. I used the word ""Surprisingly"" a lot because ONA\'s don\'t have that much budget but this looks like a TV series compressed into 5 episodes.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)The only OSTs that stood out to me was when Yumemi was presenting the beauty of the stars and space in the Planetarium. The OST fitted so perfectly and it made the presentation look more beautiful. My only complaint with the soundtrack department was that they didn\'t use any insert songs during Yumemi\'s death scene. I really wished they used one to maximize the feels. I did like the sound of the rain in the background though. It made the death scene more dramatic and it reminded me of that ending scene from Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. Now the ED theme song.The ED theme song is “Twinkle Starlight” by Sayaka Sasaki. In my opinion, this is one of the best ED\'s I\'ve heard this season. It\'s tone sounds calm but with a happy tone. It\'s like the ED is trying to tell us that Yumemi had a happy life before the apocalypse happened.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (8.5/10)There\'s only two characters in the series, and a bunch of characters from Yumemi\'s flashbacks.Yumemi Hoshino is a companion robot that works in the Planetarium. She is a very friendly and helpful robot but at the same time, she\'s annoying. I didn\'t mean that in a bad way though because the show is fully aware that she\'s annoying. Well, she was programmed that way so just like the MC, I found her quite annoying at the first episode but also, just like the MC, I got used to her constant talking.Then there\'s Kuzuya, the main character of the series. Based on his appearance, he\'s in his mid 30\'s and it\'s very refreshing to see an older mature MC. He\'s basically a Junker and Yumemi calls him ""Mr. Customer"" because he never told Yumemi his name. I really love Kuzuya\'s short but sweet character development. It\'s one of the main reasons why I was able to sympathize with him when Yumemi ""died"" at the end.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8/10)I really enjoyed this short ONA series from the start till the end. I never felt bored and even when they decided to expand the time from 15 mins. to 21 mins. in the 3rd episode, it still felt short.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]I didn\'t know shit about ""Planeterium: The Reverie of a Little Planet"" until FUNimation announced their Broadcast Dub Lineup. I was like ""Hey, Look! A KEY anime being dubbed by Funi. I might as well give this a shot"". I\'m glad, I did. The show is short but the story was good and it was very easy to invest myself into the characters. Even though I already knew about Yumemi\'s fate, being a KEY anime and all, I still cried at the end. Honestly, I just couldn\'t believe that I cried over a dying robot. The show just did a great job making Yumemi feel more like an innocent human being. If you\'re a fan of KEY anime stories then this is a must-watch.[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)Pros:+One of the best KEY anime I\'ve seen in a while+Short but emotional and heartwarming story+Watching the chemistry grow between Kuzuya and Yumemi was great.+Amazing Soundtrack during Yumemi\'s presentationsCons:- while since a KEY anime has made me cry.

Key is a company that makes visual novels that are centered around ripping your heart right out of your chest and tearing it to shreds, while burning it to crisp right after beating it into the ground. In other words, they're good at making you cry. I've been a fan of Key for a LONG time. I discovered them by accident and I am forever grateful for it. My first...Key anime was Air, a show that is very dear to my heart. I then proceeded to watch their other works. First Air, then Angel Beats, then Clannad, and then Kanon. Every single one of these is a masterpiece and is legendary for its masterful storytelling and absolutely perfect visuals.Ever since finishing those shows, I would check the Key Wikipedia article, to see when the other Key Visual novels got an anime adaptation. A few years later, a new Key anime released, called Little Busters. And it definitely lived up to the legacy that the shows before it had created. And just a few weeks ago, a new Key anime called Rewrite has begun airing. Needless to say, I was extremely excited to see it. But there was one Key visual novel that I didn't think would ever get an anime adaptation, simply because of how different it is from all the rest. And that is Planetarian. I actually didn't know that this show had even gotten confirmed to become an anime, until the day of Episode 1's release. When I finally heard the news, I flipped out. I was SO excited! But because I absolutely adore these Key shows, I waited until the anime had finished, before watching it. Thankfully, Planetarian is only 5 episodes long, so it wasn't a very long wait. I just watched all 5 in one sitting and just like all the Key animes before it, Planetarian has left me in complete awe, amazement, and sadness.So like I said, this anime is only 5 episodes long. Making it the shortest Key anime. Considering the type of show that it is, 5 episodes is plenty of time to tell its story. I could totally see them adding to it, and expanding the universe even a LITTLE bit. Not as in a sequel, but if they had added some elements into the story right from the get go, they could've easily made this a 12-13 episode anime. I know they could've done it, considering how masterful Key stories always tend to be. But I am still 100% satisfied with what I got. Now, the animation for the first 3 Key animes were done by the lord and savior of anime, Kyoto Animation. However, after Clannad, Key has been jumping from company to company, when adapting their future visual novels into anime series. Angel Beats was animated by P.A. Works, Little Busters was done by J.C. Staff, Rewrite was animated by 8-Bit, and Planetarian was animated by David Production, whose other works include Soul Eater, Code Geass, Black Butler, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. This is actually my first time seeing any of David Production's work, believe it or not. And what a wonderful show to start with. Planetarian was beautiful, to say the least. If there's something I can promise you with every Key anime, its beautiful animation. For the most part, it's just really above average. But there are some instances where they just knock it out of the park, as Key tends to do. Honestly, there were several times where I went rewound parts or paused the episode, just so I can look at the scenery, in all its details. Congratulations, David Production. You've won me over in just one show.Another thing I can always promise you with every Key anime is that it'll have phenomenal music. Absolutely beautiful tracks that add so much to the scenes that they're in. There's no other way of putting it. Planetarian's soundtrack is just as wonderful as all the rest. The only complaint I could come up with is that there's actually no opening theme to this show. Since it's technically not a full fledged anime series, being only 5 episodes, I guess they didn't think it was deserving of one? The show does have an ending theme, though. Unfortunately, the ending theme is drawn in a less detailed, chili art style. It's ok, and the song is alright, but I definitely would've loved to see a full blown opening for this show. Especially considering the openings for other Key shows are some of the best openings in anime history. Like I said before, this show is VERY different from other Key visual novels. This is actually the only one that doesn't take place in a high school setting. I'd elaborate more on what the show IS about, but I think it'd be best to discover it on your own. I will say that because of the type of show that it is, there is a very small amount of main characters. Or rather, there's a very small amount of characters, period. When deciding whether to watch this show in sub or dub, the first episode is all you'll need to watch, in order to review every character's voice in the show.Speaking of the sub vs dub debate, which one do I prefer? Well to be perfectly honest, one thing that Key animes don't have a very great reputation for are its english dubs. Personally, I'm actually a fan of the english dub of Air and Angel Beats. But for Clannad, Kanon, and Little Busters, I can't say I'm a fan. Planetarian was given the red carpet treatment by Funimation, as soon as it was released. The first english dubbed episode is already released for you to check out. Like I said, that'll be all you'll need to watch, to decide which dub you like more. This one sounded alright, and I can honestly recommend watching the english version simply so you can look at the visuals for longer periods of time. Here's hoping that the rest of the english episodes can do the show justice, when they release. But for now, all I can promise you that the Japanese version did its job perfectly.I was a bit hesitant to give this show as much praise as I wanted to, at first. It's only 5 episodes long, so does it really deserve to be held in such high regard as one of the best anime that I've seen? Honestly... yes. Yes it does. Even if it was only 5 episodes, I enjoyed this show just as much as any other Key anime I've seen. I even liked it more than Kanon, which is 26 episodes! This show has the perfect music and animation that Key is always known for having. The characters are very likable and you'll love just seeing them interact with one another. I especially love characters that don't really mix well together, but wound up together simply because of the current circumstance. The small moments where things are happy, even if it's just a general conversation, they always manage to make you smile. And just like every other Key anime, it'll manage to slam a meteor of sadness, plummeting right down into your soul. Only 5 episodes? That's all the time they needed, to leave their mark. There's not much else I can say, really. It's a Key anime. Key is and always will be legendary, and held in the highest regard as one of the greatest storytellers of all time.Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet gets a 10/10 Key anime was Air, a show that is very dear to my heart.

The point of the series is to show how people connect with each other, and become attached to one another through simple action and conversation. There are really only two characters in this series, but that only makes this premise all the more visible. You really get to feel, and understand these characters, not only through their interactions with the other, but also in how they behave. While...one is hopeful, and optimistic about the future, the other has seen the realities of the new world they live in, and has a much more cynical view of things. Even though they have their differences, each character looks towards the other for guidance and for company. The two characters end up relying on the other for something to hold onto, and something to validate their existence. It isn't until the end that this realization comes to the characters, and is this realization that changes them.This show is certainly a tearjerker, and the impressive use of atmosphere only emphasizes this fact; rain is more than what you think it is. one is hopeful, and optimistic about the future, the other has seen the realities of the new world they live in, and has a much more cynical view of things.

It isn't until the end that this realization comes to the characters, and is this realization that changes them.This show is certainly a tearjerker, and the impressive use of atmosphere only emphasizes this fact; rain is more than what you think it is."", ""I'm writing this review mostly as a counterpoint to all the praise this show has been receiving, so be forewarned, my opinion of this show is not very positive. That being said, I'm not writing just to complain, either.First of all, I think it's fair to say that at it's heart, this show has a story to tell, and it wants to get a message across. It's a work of passion, that much is obvious. However, it utterly fails to communicate anything because there simply isn't enough time to say anything it wants to say. The plot is barely existent, consisting of a dystopian...world where a scavenger runs into a robot hostess who is still alive and functioning at a planetarium, wherein he takes a few days off to help her repair the observatory and listen to her endless chatter about her life prior to the cataclysmic event that turned the city into a wasteland.The clear push of the story was to have the audience connect to this jaded man and innocent robot girl as we see him begin to take a liking to her, going so far as to stick around to hear her commentary on the stars that she would normally tell to an auditorium full of customers, and even repairing the projector for her. However, the juxtaposition of the innocent robot girl--who talks very optimistically about her managers returning one day and about hoping to see more customers come back eventually--and the reality that the world is broken points to some greater tragedy that will most likely occur later on. Spoiler alert, a tragedy does occur. They're all typical Key story elements really, i.e., innocent girls, jaded guys, sad conclusions, etc.The problem with all of this is that we aren't given enough time to connect to these characters so as to feel for the tragedy that is to come. Tragedy in a show makes you feel like you lost something, i.e., you lost a fictional character, or a fictional character had something horrible happen to them. However, you can't lose something you never had in the first place. Comparing this story to something such as Key's other work Clannad, they are not all that different in the emotional goals of the plot. The innocent girl slowly warms the heart of the jaded guy, but then tragedy strikes at the worst time possible, and then tears and spoilers ensue. However Clannad has a massive 40-something episodes all together, and takes a lot of time showing its characters in comical settings, it has them go through copious amounts of dialogue with each other in various settings, and there are many different story arcs that each focus on different side characters. Once all that is over, the real tragedy finally strikes in the latter half of the second season, AFTER we've had plenty of time to feel like we've gotten to know these characters as if they were real people. That's how we get to know characters, after all. We have to see them laugh, cry, scowl, sigh, smile, scoff, smirk, grimace, and a whole host of other emotes that indicate a human personality.In Planetarian, we get to see about 10% of the jaded guy's personality, and probably about 75% of the innocent girl, since she's a robot with a very clear operating procedure. It's not hard to insinuate that her personality is fairly linear. However, even though we know after only an episode or two exactly what kind of person the robot girl is, we still haven't spent much time seeing her interact with anyone, and the only person we have seen her interact with is a very inexpressive loner-type who rarely talks. Combine that with short episode runtimes and only 5 episodes total and you've got one of the worst combinations for trying to create an emotional connection I could possibly think of.It's got heart, I have to give it that. But there is just no way to care about these two people when you've only spent around an hour getting to know them. I started a job working at a daycare when I was in highschool, and one month into the experience, I got a call before work one day saying that the teacher I was working with had just committed suicide. That's pretty tragic, right? Well you know what I felt? Shock, surprise, and then I moved on. Why? Because I'm heartless? No, because I barely knew the woman, that's why. There was no connection to be severed, so there was no pain. It was a loss of human life, yes, but there just was no depth of connection with this person to feel anguish over. That's what this show suffers from. It's trying to rush you into a really serious relationship without taking the proper time to set things up and ease you into anything before suddenly telling you about all the hardships its gone through in an attempt to bring you to tears over its tragic backstory. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm sorry, you have just not given me enough time to care about anything you're saying, Planetarian. That's all I can say.P.S. Art is great, sound is great, ending song is catchy, final ending credits song is really really pretty. Visual novel was probably better, wouldn't know, but that's usually the case in these situations. world where a scavenger runs into a robot hostess who is still alive and functioning at a planetarium, wherein he takes a few days off to help her repair the observatory and listen to her endless chatter about her life prior to the cataclysmic event that turned the city into a wasteland.The clear push of the story was to have the audience connect to this jaded man and innocent robot girl as we see him begin to take a liking to her, going so far as to stick around to hear her commentary on the stars that she would normally tell to an auditorium full of customers, and even repairing the projector for her.

However Clannad has a massive 40-something episodes all together, and takes a lot of time showing its characters in comical settings, it has them go through copious amounts of dialogue with each other in various settings, and there are many different story arcs that each focus on different side characters. Once all that is over, the real tragedy finally strikes in the latter half of the second season, AFTER we've had plenty of time to feel like we've gotten to know these characters as if they were real people. That's how we get to know characters, after all. We have to see them laugh, cry, scowl, sigh, smile, scoff, smirk, grimace, and a whole host of other emotes that indicate a human personality.In Planetarian, we get to see about 10% of the jaded guy's personality, and probably about 75% of the innocent girl, since she's a robot with a very clear operating procedure. It's not hard to insinuate that her personality is fairly linear. However, even though we know after only an episode or two exactly what kind of person the robot girl is, we still haven't spent much time seeing her interact with anyone, and the only person we have seen her interact with is a very inexpressive loner-type who rarely talks. Combine that with short episode runtimes and only 5 episodes total and you've got one of the worst combinations for trying to create an emotional connection I could possibly think of.It's got heart, I have to give it that. But there is just no way to care about these two people when you've only spent around an hour getting to know them. I started a job working at a daycare when I was in highschool, and one month into the experience, I got a call before work one day saying that the teacher I was working with had just committed suicide. That's pretty tragic, right? Well you know what I felt? Shock, surprise, and then I moved on. Why? Because I'm heartless? No, because I barely knew the woman, that's why. There was no connection to be severed, so there was no pain. It was a loss of human life, yes, but there just was no depth of connection with this person to feel anguish over. That's what this show suffers from. It's trying to rush you into a really serious relationship without taking the proper time to set things up and ease you into anything before suddenly telling you about all the hardships its gone through in an attempt to bring you to tears over its tragic backstory. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm sorry, you have just not given me enough time to care about anything you're saying, Planetarian. That's all I can say.P.S. Art is great, sound is great, ending song is catchy, final ending credits song is really really pretty. Visual novel was probably better, wouldn't know, but that's usually the case in these situations."", ""This anime is dreadfully boring and is plagued with plot holes and inconsistencies. The main character, who finds a robotic girl working at a planetarium, finds that she is only able to operate for a few hours a day because the power grid has gone down. Yet robot quadruped tanks, that are abandoned left over dregs from a war that ended 29 years ago, have an unending supply of energy. The robotic girl is in some scenes is totally devoid of human emotion like talking to Microsoft Sam but in other portions is suddenly endowed with profound human emotion and intellect. The post apocalyptic setting...is very generic and doesn't add anything new to the genre. The pacing is slow and meandering which is a shame because all that wasted time could have been used to answer the many questions I have. Like how do the junkers exactly sell their goods? Do they trade them for money at the market? Is there money or is it a barter system? Where is the junker market? Where exactly are the survivors of the war if major cities are being bogarted by quadruped robot tanks? Why is the robot girl seemingly the only one that ever existed? Overall this anime is bland and lackluster. I would skip it. is very generic and doesn't add anything new to the genre.

I remember loving it to death and always wanted to see a movie adaptation of this, since I didn\'t really think it\'d fit for an anime. And here we are with an...anime adaptation of planetarian. While they did manage to execute this fairly well, I still think a movie version would\'ve been better.Regardless, let\'s get into the review.I will not be spoiling anything, I\'m gonna give my thoughts and nothing else.--STORY AND CHARACTERS--I\'m really surprised to say that David did not seem...to cut any corners with the planetarian adaptation. If you\'ve read the VN, the anime is pretty much a one-to-one retelling of the VN. The same emotional story that was in the original translated well in this adaptation in my opinion and overall was executed just as well as in the original VN. For a 5 episode series or roughly a 3 hour visual novel, the story is great. I have nothing to nitpick on, really. Not even the main characters. Normally I would complain about the main male character being the way he is in the anime and VN, however, given the context - it\'s perfectly understandable. And can I say that Hoshino Yumemi is still one of my favorite robot characters of all time? Because she is.But yeah, the story is short and sweet, easy to get involved and invested in and easily watchable in 1 clear sitting in less than 2 hours.--ART AND SOUND--I\'m personally not a fan of David\'s animation. In my opinion, the same generic animation issues from their adaptation of Hyperdimension Neptunia still persist in their adaptation of planetarian. And while, yes, their animation works for the most part in this adaptation, since there isn\'t a lot of action going on throughout the majority of the anime, when it gets to the more ""intense"" scenes is when I feel that David seems to struggle with, since they don\'t really look that great.As for the sound - I have NO complaints here. I just love how they reused the beautiful OST from the game rather than making their own remakes, which added a bit of a slight nostalgia trip for me (even though I read the VN 2 years ago) as well as Yumemi\'s and the main character\'s voices were done great. While I do wish that they reused the original voices from the VN for Yumemi, I still think that whoever voiced her in this adaptation did a very good job at doing so.--OVERALL--This is one of the best VN anime adaptations I\'ve seen, personally. Short and sweet without cutting any corners and with pretty much no change in tone or characteristics from the original VN. David Animation - you definitely outdid yourselves with this and honestly - round of applause to you, good sirs.Do I recommend to watch this? Just as with the Visual Novel, my answer is a very solid YES. You really have nothing to lose, the VN is just as short as the anime, so either one will do you great justice. planetarian still remains one of my favorites even after 2 years of being an otaku. to cut any corners with the planetarian adaptation.

That changed with Planetarian, a 5 episode series based on one of Keys Visual Novels. Does the run time bring too many hurdles or slump mid way?The plot is as described above and in more detail than the anime itself surprisingly. I like the setup here, a dystopian-esque world with as much mystery as anything. Unlike one point I will get onto later I kind of like that there was no detailed background...into how the world got this way, there was a brief explanation by the Junker but that was it. It adds to the gloominess of the setting.There are only two characters here with a few shown in flashback. Yumemi is the one with which we feel the most for. A robot built and designed to help people and to show off their attraction: the planetarium. Having been in what is effectively slumber for so long she doesn’t take in what has happened to this world. Every day she goes to the doors to attempt to attract customers.This goes further as well as she calls for help, apologises to the Junker for being unable to get that assistance, asking him how his day was, what he does, what he will do. It is heart breaking to see her act like this seemingly oblivious to the fate of the outside world with her optimism that those who created her will come back for her.The Junker on the other hand is what you’d call a gentleman. He is very savvy, knows full well how to survive in this world. He eventually offers to help her desire to show him this presentation and before he knows it begins to care for Yumemi as he sees her as more than a simple robot. It is common to see feelings like these in shows with robots but the execution here is what makes it stand out from the crowd and make it absorbing. We know he has suffered in this world but Yumemi offers him a glimmer of hope and respite from that world. It is truly heart warming as their relationship grows.Whilst the relationship is strong here I wasn’t as emotionally invested in the series as I could have been, sure I was sad at the end but nothing more. I put it down to not knowing much, if anything about this unnamed Junker. We had Yumemis side which was engaging and sad but not the other half and this was what I felt was lacking here. An episode or two more to give a bit more on him would have elevated this series to the heights it so nearly reached. Its strange as we are shown he is not a means to an ends, that there may be something about him but it is never explored.Another issue I did have with this was that the warning signs were all too obvious what kind of ending this was going to end with. You could tell that with every piece of knowledge we gained on Yumemi it was leading to this ending. It felt too obvious and along with the above lessened the impact of the finale somewhat.Visually the show has some really, really beautiful moments and when set against the depressing, gloomy world outside the planetarium these shine through much stronger. That gloomy world though is what you’ll mostly see throughout the 5 episodes. With the incessant rain, abandoned and decaying buildings we’ve become accustomed to in post apocalyptic lands it works well. Sure it’s not particularly pleasant on the eye but it isn’t supposed to be, this world is bleak and tough for everyone who lives, the planetarium provides not only small respite but also us, the viewers.The scene when Yumemi is showing the Junker the actual presentation is wonderful full of incredible detail and bright, vivid colours. It takes you into their world for that moment, away from dystopian real world. Its impact is so much stronger because of this, the slow build up to it and the stop start nature of getting it to finally run.It is quite educational in the sense that it goes through some of the constellations in detail whilst providing some back-story with how they came to be. I found this fascinating and coupled with the visuals was really immersive. I have always wondered who teaches people about constellations and such as it was never touched upon in my schools but here it gave me something informative and actually made me want to know more about the stars because this has shown me that they can be stunning.The animation for the most part is par for the course. There are a couple of action scenes that look good but otherwise there isn’t that much that is impressive. It kind of doesn’t need to be either as the setting, what happens and the characters are going at a relaxed pace, there is nothing hectic here to animate, nothing excessive and that is fine.For a 5 episode series it has surprising impact on you. It leaves out too much for my liking though and it harms the series because of it. A couple of minor flaws aside though it does not stop the series from shining. I thoroughly recommend watching this.

The background setting of this anime is an important factor of its success. Post-apocalyptic world is a wonderful stage to show love and devotion. A tiny ordinary spark will create a surge in luminosity in absolute darkness. The cruel order of nature gives an ascension to the values of qualities of figures in the dooming world. The fantastic plot is the dominating factor of the success of this anime. The story is about desperation and hopefulness. The...daily scenes of building up of emotions, the climax of devotion, and the passing on of the Hope, are harmonically compactly brought out in the episodes. The transition of the attitude of the main characters and emergence of their emotions and devotions are miraculously presented in the short 5 episodes. With only 5 episodes, this anime deeply touched the hearts of the audience and granted them the hope to keep going.The animation and action presentation of this anime does not belong to the absolute top class of all anime. But for this anime, whose core is story telling instead of cute characters, the current level of animation and action presentation is enough._________________________________________________________|May the SeeD of hope could germinate in the brilliance of the future.|——————————————————————————————————Plot: 7 of 7 pointsAnimation & Art: 2 of 2 pointsFight/ Action scenes: 1 of 1 pointsTotal: 10 of 10 points FULL MARKS daily scenes of building up of emotions, the climax of devotion, and the passing on of the Hope, are harmonically compactly brought out in the episodes.

I saw that it was only 5 episodes long so I decided to watch it. I thought there was no harm there. But there was. As soon as I finished watching it it left me emotional. It was only 5 episodes long too but of course it was because of the robot AKA Hoshino Yumemi. The surprising part of this anime was that it went from happy or at least peaceful to completely dramatic in like 1 episode.The story was good for a 5...episode anime and it was worth the watch (Some action too)There was some character developing if not a little. But I still loved the characters and even the MC.All in all if you like the ""guy meets robot"" types of anime then watch it.

You won\'t regret it (I hope)', '""I pray that you will never forget this starry sky.""--Yumemi HoshinoOne of the first works that visual novel titan Visual Art\'s/Key ever published, Planetarian is near-universally loved for its brief and yet evocative story of a broken planetarium inhabited by an adorable android and discovered by a cynical junk-collector. These two are all alone in a post-apocalyptic world covered in eternal rain. It\'s a story that you can finish in an afternoon, but will stick with you well beyond its running time.12 years have passed since its release, and it finally gets an anime adaptation. This is one of two Key works getting an anime...this season (Rewrite), and although Rewrite is far from finished at the time of the review, Planetarian destroys it in its level of faithful adaptation and raw quality. For the uninitiated, this short story is gorgeous and impactful. For those familiar with the source material, this is an opportunity to see the characters and events animated with the level of quality reserved for movies. In the spots where it takes liberties with the source material, it does so in a favorable direction, giving the Junker some much-needed depth and accentuating Yumemi\'s adorable lack of common sense.The music is largely pulled from the VN. It\'s gorgeous, as is most Key music, and punctuates the scenes marvelously. Keiko Suzuki returns to voice Yumemi Hoshino, the aforementioned robotic planetarium employee, and Daisuke Ono puts together a gritty performance as the previously-unvoiced and nameless ""Junker"". The sound effects and voice acting in the climactic finale are on point throughout, bringing the entire performance to a grand conclusion that will leave you pining to see more. And wouldn\'t you know it, there\'s a movie continuation coming out in September 2016.My only issue with this adaptation is that it took so long to come out, and admittedly the brief run time leaves little time for the audience to connect with the characters on the level needed to maximize the emotional impact of its dramatic conclusion. For that reason, it doesn\'t quite leave its mark the way most Key works do, but it\'s still worth your time if the premise intrigues you. If you\'re a diehard Planetarian or Key fan, you owe it to yourself to see what a great job David Production have done with this beloved work.Until next time, please go visit your local planetarium.

How would they ensure their survival? And do they even have hope left? All these questions and more are addressed by Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume, one of the best Key adaptations to the current day.The story is set in a dystopian future after a nuclear world war, where the towns are lonely places and people have to collect everything in those places, that could further ensure their survival. Many dangers still lurk around after the war,...that could lead to a quick death instead of more resources. In this setting, the main character ""Junker"" comes to one of the abandoned cities which are still pestered by post-war issues. After dealing with one of them, he meets a robot, Yumemi Hoshino, in an (again) abandoned planetarium.This robot is against all expectations not hostile, but one of the last remaining supporters of humanity. While being ticked off by her initial cheerful behavior, the protagonist slowly accepts her as being an individual and not just additional luggage. Not only that, but through her special show, he slowly finds another meaning in life besides simply surviving and wants to give his newly attained hope to other people as well. Talking about Yumemi, she appears to be broken because she stutters the same sentence every time the protagonist doesn\'t care or know an answer. She also can\'t comprehend the changes in the environment after the war, thus being completely oblivious to the outer world and just having the planetarium as last. But she also has some background story as to why she is broken or probably not as broken as one could think and a pretty logical reason which could in some cases apply to humans as well.So this anime features a good deal of the hope-despair theme in a dystopian future, how it could look like and what post-war damages it could contain, and the further meaning of life other than simply survival. Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume is an excellent adaptation of the VN and grasped my attention every second I watched it. Perhaps some aspects could have been better explained, but it left me satisfied and is a story worth to remember whenever someone thinks about a possible world war, which might happen in the far (or not so far) future. It captured the theme well enough to be a realistic possibility.Despite this anime being very good, it has also some small issues like the pacing which becomes a bit inconsistent during episode 2 and 3. Besides from that, it was consistent and didn\'t have any particular swings in episode 1, 4 and 5. Furthermore, it\'s kept pretty simple, which could make it an issue for some people, but that is also the beauty of this short series. It doesn\'t rely on fancy stuff to support it and trying to sugarcoat the world, it features only this particular small story around two people (well, one robot and one human) and how their interaction ultimately ends up changing each other. The world building is also kept to a bare minimum.The art and animation looks very beautiful and adds to the sad atmosphere of the anime, while the music makes it downright depressing. Although the ending is not on the same level as the other OST in the anime, the music left a positive impression on me and added to the anime instead of being an issue for me.

The ending is a typical Key ending that tries to tug on the heartstring in the cheapest ways possible. Not only does the ending come off as a complete non sequitur (that is a fancy word for asspull), but the ending also undercuts the whole message of the show.The characters are not too bad, but not very interesting either. The design of the girl is servicable as cute moe girl and the guy...looks like every anime dude ever. He is the typical asshole character that softens up and she is the typical naive clumsy girl. The characters have quirks, they have backstories, but it never really goes deeper than ""he is grumpy"", ""she is naive"". These are character traits, but never really add up to full fledged characters.The animation is nicely done though, and the little details make some shots really stand out.There isn\'t all that much to talk about in the sound department. Most scenes have either no music or generic soft piano music playing. There is some variation, but it all sounds a bit too generic to stand out in any meaningful way.The voice acting is nothing special, the monotone voice of the robot girl can become a bit grinding, because you will be listening to it a whole bunch, almost uninterrupted.Overall this looks nice, but the story is just a cheap excuse to deliver people some ""feels"".If you are someone sensitive to that sort of stories, I highly recommend this anime. Just realize that this is the pulp of sad emotional stories.If you are someone looking for a good story, with an interesting premise, good character development and a satisfying ending, that takes you serious as a intelligent human being, I would skip this one. looks like every anime dude ever.

There is some variation, but it all sounds a bit too generic to stand out in any meaningful way.The voice acting is nothing special, the monotone voice of the robot girl can become a bit grinding, because you will be listening to it a whole bunch, almost uninterrupted.Overall this looks nice, but the story is just a cheap excuse to deliver people some ""feels"".If you are someone sensitive to that sort of stories, I highly recommend this anime. Just realize that this is the pulp of sad emotional stories.If you are someone looking for a good story, with an interesting premise, good character development and a satisfying ending, that takes you serious as a intelligent human being, I would skip this one.', ""As Yumemi says the planetarium is a time machine. It takes us back not just to see the stars but to experience a time where people can tell stories, memory banks full of smiles and best wishes, an innocence and ignorance to the plights of now that have never existed in simpler times. The reason why it rains forever in that city is that the audience's tears have soaked through the floor and fourth wall'd into the anime! There is too much praise I can offer Planetarian Chiisana Hoshi no Yume is short, only five episodes. Each of those episodes is filled with emotion and...the thoughts of a broken robot in a broken world. The main character being a junker to make ends meet could have done a myriad of awful such as scrapping her or just abandoning the waste of time but instead wastes his food, efforts, and risks his life to help her chase that hopeless dream. There's cute and happiness, plenty of it! However no happy endings ... which can do in the heart of others as it has done mine. That's it! The only complaint that keeps this anime from getting a 10, my selfish ass wants a happy ending... :') the thoughts of a broken robot in a broken world.

What was present is here no longer, and can never be brought back. It\'s a word laced with tragedy, and is synonymous with the sands of time and inevitability.And if there is any one word that I\'d associate with Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume (Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet), it is ""gone"". Planetarian takes place on a post apocalyptic Earth, 30 years after a failed Space Colonization Project has failed and a deadly rain continuously falls upon the few humans who are left alive.But the meat of what makes up...Planetarian is not the setting, it\'s everything else. From the moment the Space Colonization Project is introduced, it\'s very clear that Planetarian has its heads in the clouds. More specifically, it\'s seemingly in a constant state of gazing up at the stars like the giant projector Jena that the character Yumemi Hoshino operates.Yumemi Hoshino is one of our main characters, along with Kuzuya, a junker. While Kuzuya is where our story begins and ends, it\'s his experience with Yumemi that defines Chiisana Hoshi no Yume. Yumemi represents everything that Planetarian is at its core: optimistic, pessimistic, realistic, stubborn, air-headed, and another tragedy at the hands of time.What I mean by that is that Yumemi was left behind by her creators when the bombs fell, left to attend to the Planetarium by herself. But what makes this situation tragic is that she cannot grasp that the world has basically ended. She continuously welcomes the rare person that walks by and tries accessing databases that have long since cease functioning. She\'s somewhat air-headed if you discount the fact that her programming prevents her from moving on. She\'s a relic of the past and represents what is ""gone"" when an entire society comes to and end.When Kazuya comes across her, he initially assumes that she\'s just another relic of the past that only serves to annoy him and remind of what humanity lost. But in rummaging among what was left behind, Kazuya finds something inside of this lost robot. The relationship that develops between Kazuya and Yumemi not only improves them as both humans and robots respectively, but also serves as a metaphor for one of the underlying messages of the show: technology (robots) was meant to benefit mankind, even if it can also doom it (the very bombs and security robots that occupy the streets and try to kill survivors).Yumemi frequently states that ""I am a little broken"", which is a pretty fitting statement for the dualistic message of optimism and pessimism the show employs: we as humans are flawed and imperfect by nature, but we\'re capable of overcoming that and growing from any mishaps we create. Life goes on and time stops for no one, not man nor machine.As far as visual novel adaptations go, I\'m usually not a fan. However, Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume is a fantastic exception. Studio David did an excellent job here, from the very solid animation to the heartfelt and incredibly atmospheric score.

If you guys don't know, this anime was adapted from a visual novel of which I read long, long ago at least a year or two old. Both being really similar, but not exactly alike. It's a great plot, the characters are well made, background, and for being such a short story I'm impressed at how good it is, truly.That being said, I have two things I would like to say. The first, is that I hope they come out with a sequel, the plot has a great foundation for it to expand into...an actual, full-sized anime. The second, is that I'm a little disappointed on how they adapted the anime, its good, but the major difference in the visual novel compared to the anime just left me slack-jawed. If you want to know what it is, you should go play the visual novel. (Don't worry its short.) I personally, after watching the anime, like the VN better. Its a tad bit more detailed, but hey, that's because its the original.Anyways, all in all. The anime was great I give it an 8/10. an actual, full-sized anime.

It was released over the Internet on November 29, 2004 for Windows PCs, and is rated for all ages. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, as well as to mobile devices. Key defines Planetarian as a ‘kinetic novel’, since its gameplay offers no choices or alternate endings: the player proceeds through the story solely by reading. In 2016 the visual novel receives an anime (which adapts the main game’s story) and a movie adaption. The author describes Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no...Yume as ‘A certain woman's story’ and Planetarian: Hoshi no Hito as ‘A certain man's story’.Hoshino Yumemi is the robot working at a shopping mall. She was created by a group of scientists to advertise the planetarium she was working in, as well as to help customers. One day, however, the humanity shows its true color and the world we know no longer exists. Humans still exist, though, but it will take you awhile to find even one. Anyways, the poor robot still fulfills her duties, but does it rarely, since electricity is quite a big rarity. However, this dead city still has many valuables and because of that, The Junker chooses this city. Running away from the robots that still protect the city, he finds himself in the planetarium, where Hoshino Yumemi works. At first, he regards her as a threat, but after some time he reconsiders his attitude towards her and even stays to help her repair the projector.It is quite a task to give a good description of the story-line of this anime without giving away spoilers. But I must say that it is surprisingly well-written; you are given all the information you need. It has never been annoying and it surely will not be boring, since there are just… TOO MANY DISTURBING THINGS about it.Animation wise, it does its magic well. The world of Planetarian is very dark and gloomy and the animation perfectly depicts the emptiness of the dead city. The anime also has some good character designs and pays attention to many small details. Sound wise, the ED song ‘Twinkle Starlight’ by Sayaka Sasaki fits the theme of the series well. The background sounds and the music fit each scene, too. Most of the time you will hear The Junker’s monologues, who is voiced by Ono Daisuke, by the way. Do I even need to add anything?Character wise, there are two main characters: The Junker and Yumemi Hoshino. Yumemi is a robot who was designed to look like a teenage girl. She is programmed to be helpful to the customers visiting the shopping mall and the planetarium. The Junker is the protagonist and also the narrator of the series. He wanders into the dead city trying to find some valuables and food. There, in the dead city, he meets a robot. He is living a very difficult life and because of that he has quite a problematic personality. However, as the series progresses, he undergoes some awesome character development.Before finishing my review, I would like to explain one thing. You should only evaluate Planetarian after finishing BOTH the movie and the ONA. Without its continuation, the OVA is average. However, after finishing the movie, you will have a good understanding of what Planetarian really is. Planetarian is a great sci-fi series, which depicts a situation that might also happen with the world we live in; there is a probability that it might happen. Aside from the realism, the anime offers a very dark story with some great drama, which is never forced, or overused.All in all, this title deserves 8/10. The only problem that I have with it is that it becomes boring sometimes; Key’s fans you are ready, though. That said,   Planetarianit is still a very unique picture with a grain of realism.

It doesn\'t matter wheater it\'s a fantasy or a dystopia that\'s being constructed. Worldbuilding will always be bounded by the same difficulties. For instance, sci-fi may spend its time cultivating the latest gadgets to please our curious minds. Doing so is more than acceptable. After all, maintaining what makes fiction intriguing is key to storytelling. But if it were to waste time with its exposition, it\'ll waver in an attempt to locate the essence which it was trying to portray. Which reveals a factor in bad worldbuilding; the tendency to cautiously avoid the dreaded influence of...The Real World. Ironically enough, a balance between, say, exhilarating magic and reality must be maintained. Said magic just seems conspicuous if no interweavings of the latter are placed. A break from reality can\'t be deemed as such until the imaginability of fiction shows a hint of creative reality within itself. It\'s what allows us to confidently cling onto the suspension of disbelief and connect to that enthralling ride beyond our dreams.The anime adaption of the original Key visual novel, Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume, just so happens to be building its own worlds. Being abundant in demolished buildings, skies being engulfed by darkness, and a sheer lack of inhabiting humans, the setting which it\'s trying to emulate should be evident. The post-apocalyptic setting, a goldmine of a setting for dramatic characterization and thought-provoking themes. Such a premise should come off as striking when put alongside its Key predecessors. The dismal atmosphere shatters any chances of there being anything remotely like childhood promises or magical orbs.  Planetarian is only comprised of deteriorated roads, all which lead to a single, abandoned planetarium that awaits for no one. But the setting alone isn\'t the only eye-catching difference. Planetarian narrates its entire story in just the duration of five episodes, an unconventional length for most modern anime. With how grandiose and insightful narratives of its setting can get, combined with the notorious reputation its predecessors have, Planetarian has some burdening exceptions to dispel. Its terse length, in this case, seems to add more fuel to the fire. In particular, it arouses worries relating to pacing and all the storytelling factors dependent on it.On the first inspection, these worries definitely manifest their influence on the narrative. Characters are devoid of complexity in favor of more simple outlines. Similarly, the world they struggle in is never provided with an insightful background. In most cases, attributes that can alarm a red flag. Fortunately, the directing in Planetarian acknowledges that its length binds it with these limitations. To achieve coherency, said limitations attempt to optimize themselves within the context of the story. And boy does Planetarian execute this well. By being largely consistent and subdue in its presentation, depth is created by framing the narrative with the developed realization of it being within an apocalypse. All done despite the trigger of such scenario being inexplicable at best. For Planetarian, crafting the scenario at its most basic level is what allows ambiguity to sweep in. A trait which is most intriguing for a post-apocalypse, wherein mysterious elements surrounding the world are likely to induce engrossment.Now, utilizing minimal exposition, if any at all, may sound a tad bit too convenient. It conveys slight vibes of the minimalism just being a perfunctory excuse to accommodate for the minimal length. However, once such ambiguity is used as less an aspect ""for enjoyment"" and more an integration of the narrative, it\'s anything but. Planetarian\'s storytelling is constantly dependent on the value of its ambiguity being built upon by its two characters. With these two characters, Planetarian is in no need of an omnipotent narrator to guide its viewer on what\'s going on. Instead, it makes sure to characterize these two characters enough so that their actions alone exemplify worldbuilding. Arguably, this approach to worldbuilding could be considered disfavorable. Focusing on the meticulous details of the apocalypse could have made for a more sophisticated story. But that would have taken away the more personal engrossment which one feels when they partake with a story\'s characters. The naturality of the two characters\' dynamics furthers the compelling nature of their interactions with their world. All while creating a subtextual observation of the implicit themes which their surroundings contain.Planetarian\'s use of characterization as worldbuilding is made clear in just the introductory episode. Particularly, it\'s done so by having them set the stage of their world towards the audience. The human protagonist of the story, for instance, happens to be portraying the status of humanity in his introduction. Although he manages to briefly narrate prior events, his sheer actions alone ameliorates what could have been blank exposition. He\'s placed as being seen frantically running away from inexplicable robots.  The appearance of these robots is abrupt enough to raise a few questions, but Planetarian makes sure to move the audience\'s attention from this. Instead, it focuses on what they\'re doing and to whom. A clear relationship between the robots and the protagonist is made through displaying them in motion. The protagonist scurrying from the peculiar robots signifies of his abject struggle for survival. A survival which is now his only notion for living. Through his pitiful purpose, the protagonist\'s is made indicative of him representing an annihilated humanity. A humanity which, in the context of the story, is forcefully overtaken by their instinctive need to survive. His thematic stance is furthered by his lack of a proper name, going instead by the default terminology of ""The Junker"". Thus, in his mannerisms, The Junker is simple. He\'s played the rogue survivor archetype straight without unnecessary quirk attachments. Yet, within the apocalyptic narrative, that\'s all Plantarian needs for a protagonist.Thankfully, with the thematic burden he holds, The Junker isn\'t just written to be humanity incarnate. It\'s the contrary that\'s what allows him to be representative. Because he is autonomous as his own character with his own wills and desires, because he isn\'t a glorified hero figure, he is able to nuance himself as the greater whole. A rightfully immersive trait to have. As he\'s tangible to natural change anytime throughout the story, Planetarian makes sure to build on his versatility as a character through the flow of the plot. A particular example of this being utilizing his own notions as a set-up to his confrontation with the other solitary character of the series, Hoshino Yumemi. Being a continuation of his introduction, The Junker is seen escaping in search of habitation. Eventually, he finds so in the form of  a planetarium. Navigating it, he shockingly encounters Hoshino Yumemi and juts out his gun onto her. Yet, Hoshino displays no concern. After having characterized The Junker as an apprehensive figure, Hoshino Yumemi\'s careless serenity in their encounter is a blighting contrast. Essentially, a formulaic aspect most common in Key works that note a female character as the ""heroine"". She\'s diligent in her nature, being attentive to any formalities, but all while being ignorant of her circumstances. In the dumbfounded eyes of The Junker, traits which simulate an irritation alongside her feminine demeanor.But she\'s a robot. A humanoid one designed in the likeness of a girl, but a robot nonetheless. Her moe appearance and occasional mannerisms might suggest otherwise, though. And yet, she\'s thoroughly consistent as what she\'s characterized as; a robot. Instances in which she could at any point burst out into one of the dere archetypes are downplayed. So much so that even such instances are used to further her depth as a character. Hoshino Yumemi is juxtapositional to the entirety of the world that unknowingly surrounds her. In serenity, Hoshino is an artifact left behind in the apocalypse. One that operates under the will of her programming without the slightest hint of complaining. With how a static life implies melancholy, one would think this were a trait meant to segway her into emotional development. Yet, it\'s completely the opposite. Instead, it develops her foil attributes to develop both her and the theme which she stands for. Had Hoshino been a human, she would have had an existential crisis at best. But since she\'s a clear robot, Planetarian switches her into, ironically, being a figure of hope.But due to its emphasis, Hoshino\'s juxtapositional status may seem to just construct her a plot device. Admittedly, she\'s definitely written purely to present a contrasting ideology within Planetarian–but there\'s nothing inherently wrong with. Much like how The Junker\'s character is malleable in any scene due to his human nature, Hoshino\'s artificialness is consistent with how effective it is in sustaining her character. Thus, making her as a delectable foil to have without the worries of thematic contradiction.  Moreover, it makes her an all the more emotionally encaptivating spectacle to watch, due to how her robot mannerisms trace back on the ambiguity of the apocalypse. Hoshino is, thus, formed into one of the more sentimental Key heroines. Even of the audience knows she\'s a robot.Incidentally, Hoshino wouldn\'t be half the character she was if The Junker\'s presence weren\'t with her. While the series is never interested in implying romantic interest between the two, they both share impactful influences on each other\'s character. The first confrontation between the two highlights this well. Whereas The Junker during the beginning is a being in acknowledgment of his own despairful attempts at surviving, Hoshino is incapable of perceiving anything she does or sees under the subjective lenses of desperation. These two states clash within their first encounter, particularly on the side of The Junker. And it\'s what kindles the start of a dynamic relationship that it itself is continuously developed by rich interactions.These interactions are the core of the narrative; thus, they take up a majority of the series. This doesn\'t pose itself as a problem, though. Quite conversely, it constantly shows itself to be the main foundation of the thematic development. So much so, that regardless of an instance of them not being in the same room, they\'ll still be interacting with each other due to the heavy influences which they inflict on each other. The opening episode showcases this in just its first few minutes and continues to build on them right up until the last few seconds. Which is where The Junker\'s fluid agency comes into play. All his interactions with Hoshino shed some light on a new side of his character. The stagnant Hoshino herself reflects the hope which The Junker had, now deteriorated, to grasp some meaning. Yet, out of his own initiative, The Junker continues interacting with her nonetheless. With each coming interaction, The Junker\'s lack of hope is reinforced and, often times, challenged. Through the course of simple, mundane actions such as fixing a light source, or viewing a galactic presentation, The Junker eventually shows gradual change. A change which repairs the deteriorated hope he had beforehand. The Junker\'s character through these situations is coherently developing himself one step ahead of his previous self by, not finding new things to despair about, but finding new things to hope on,Of course, the robotic Hoshino is incapable of changing as much as The Junker. But this attribute of their relationship shouldn\'t be disregarded as just being one-sided. The Junker is able to show growth—but only because he\'s perceived Hoshino in a new light beforehand. Through this, Hoshino\'s dull lines slowly adapt themselves to sustain more emotional depth once she\'s accompanied by The Junker. The predetermined content she automatically delivers is still intact, but the context in which she delivers them in changes everything from the ground up. And it\'s this subtlety to their interacting dynamics that makes them so natural, so intriguing to watch. Yet, Planetarian doesn\'t discard the dismal atmosphere of the land they\'re in, on the contrary, it completely recognizes it. But only because it is able to recognize the truth that surrounds them is it able to truly mold them as characters with hopes.Just like how its consistent writing prevents it from neglecting its apocalyptic setting, the visuals within Planetarian make sure to set the tone of the narrative right. Being painted with drastically downing dulls, the exterior of the apocalyptic world is forever made of evident of its depressive environment. With the rubbish remains of demolished buildings in the background, and meaningless displays of leaking, brackish water pipes, Planetarian\'s usage of destroyed human creations to signify a lost hope is definitely a bit on-the-nose. Not that it poses itself as a problem. The exterior world is fixed with grays for the sake of visually developing The Junker\'s character and, thus, his perception of the world. Once the planetarium is introduced, similarities of color schemes are kept within it, but a completely different feeling is attached to it. While still showing tinges of being abandoned, the interiors of the planetarium are painted with profound, sentiment reds. This change of tone fits how The Junker regains bits of hope within the safe haven of the planetarium but is still nonetheless aware of his alienated state. The sentimentality of the planetarium\'s color is then challenged by The Junker, now alongside a new Hoshino, when he ventures back into the unknown exteriors of the world. The usage of a setting\'s color to stimulate warmth only to then be subverted for a finale is by no means anything revolutionary. But it doesn\'t have to be. It\'s simple and subtle. And Planetarian has always been effective in that regard for its storytelling.It should come off as no shock that Planetarian\'s ending never frames itself as something grandiose. While it still manages to sew in some Key Melodrama™, under the subsided presentation beforehand, it\'s best conveyed as the aftermath of a build-up of emotional characterization and themes. Planetarian\'s characters don\'t bawl themselves into rivers of tears nor discredit their previous development. They dare to confront their despair to find fragments of hope and, thus, remain strong under the gloom of their sky. All done before fading themselves out in the final credits as individuals who have lived. Which is where Planetarian\'s biggest strength comes in; utilizing the brevity and, at times, the triviality of its plot and characters to craft a dynamic story of hope. It is in no need of expositional padding nor groundbreaking character writing to create a great story. All it does is take the standard apocalypse and carefully subvert into something that\'s comforting. Planetarian reminds us of the often-forgotten statement that sometimes less is definitely more. \u200bAnd, hey, a good visual novel adapation for once! The Real World. Ironically enough, a balance between, say, exhilarating magic and reality must be maintained. Said magic just seems conspicuous if no interweavings of the latter are placed.

It conveys slight vibes of the minimalism just being a perfunctory excuse to accommodate for the minimal length. However, once such ambiguity is used as less an aspect ""for enjoyment"" and more an integration of the narrative, it\'s anything but. Planetarian\'s storytelling is constantly dependent on the value of its ambiguity being built upon by its two characters. With these two characters, Planetarian is in no need of an omnipotent narrator to guide its viewer on what\'s going on. Instead, it makes sure to characterize these two characters enough so that their actions alone exemplify worldbuilding. Arguably, this approach to worldbuilding could be considered disfavorable. Focusing on the meticulous details of the apocalypse could have made for a more sophisticated story. But that would have taken away the more personal engrossment which one feels when they partake with a story\'s characters. The naturality of the two characters\' dynamics furthers the compelling nature of their interactions with their world. All while creating a subtextual observation of the implicit themes which their surroundings contain.Planetarian\'s use of characterization as worldbuilding is made clear in just the introductory episode. Particularly, it\'s done so by having them set the stage of their world towards the audience. The human protagonist of the story, for instance, happens to be portraying the status of humanity in his introduction. Although he manages to briefly narrate prior events, his sheer actions alone ameliorates what could have been blank exposition. He\'s placed as being seen frantically running away from inexplicable robots.  The appearance of these robots is abrupt enough to raise a few questions, but Planetarian makes sure to move the audience\'s attention from this. Instead, it focuses on what they\'re doing and to whom. A clear relationship between the robots and the protagonist is made through displaying them in motion. The protagonist scurrying from the peculiar robots signifies of his abject struggle for survival. A survival which is now his only notion for living. Through his pitiful purpose, the protagonist\'s is made indicative of him representing an annihilated humanity. A humanity which, in the context of the story, is forcefully overtaken by their instinctive need to survive. His thematic stance is furthered by his lack of a proper name, going instead by the default terminology of ""The Junker"". Thus, in his mannerisms, The Junker is simple. He\'s played the rogue survivor archetype straight without unnecessary quirk attachments. Yet, within the apocalyptic narrative, that\'s all Plantarian needs for a protagonist.Thankfully, with the thematic burden he holds, The Junker isn\'t just written to be humanity incarnate. It\'s the contrary that\'s what allows him to be representative. Because he is autonomous as his own character with his own wills and desires, because he isn\'t a glorified hero figure, he is able to nuance himself as the greater whole. A rightfully immersive trait to have. As he\'s tangible to natural change anytime throughout the story, Planetarian makes sure to build on his versatility as a character through the flow of the plot. A particular example of this being utilizing his own notions as a set-up to his confrontation with the other solitary character of the series, Hoshino Yumemi. Being a continuation of his introduction, The Junker is seen escaping in search of habitation. Eventually, he finds so in the form of  a planetarium. Navigating it, he shockingly encounters Hoshino Yumemi and juts out his gun onto her. Yet, Hoshino displays no concern. After having characterized The Junker as an apprehensive figure, Hoshino Yumemi\'s careless serenity in their encounter is a blighting contrast. Essentially, a formulaic aspect most common in Key works that note a female character as the ""heroine"". She\'s diligent in her nature, being attentive to any formalities, but all while being ignorant of her circumstances. In the dumbfounded eyes of The Junker, traits which simulate an irritation alongside her feminine demeanor.But she\'s a robot. A humanoid one designed in the likeness of a girl, but a robot nonetheless. Her moe appearance and occasional mannerisms might suggest otherwise, though. And yet, she\'s thoroughly consistent as what she\'s characterized as; a robot. Instances in which she could at any point burst out into one of the dere archetypes are downplayed. So much so that even such instances are used to further her depth as a character. Hoshino Yumemi is juxtapositional to the entirety of the world that unknowingly surrounds her. In serenity, Hoshino is an artifact left behind in the apocalypse. One that operates under the will of her programming without the slightest hint of complaining. With how a static life implies melancholy, one would think this were a trait meant to segway her into emotional development. Yet, it\'s completely the opposite. Instead, it develops her foil attributes to develop both her and the theme which she stands for. Had Hoshino been a human, she would have had an existential crisis at best. But since she\'s a clear robot, Planetarian switches her into, ironically, being a figure of hope.But due to its emphasis, Hoshino\'s juxtapositional status may seem to just construct her a plot device. Admittedly, she\'s definitely written purely to present a contrasting ideology within Planetarian–but there\'s nothing inherently wrong with. Much like how The Junker\'s character is malleable in any scene due to his human nature, Hoshino\'s artificialness is consistent with how effective it is in sustaining her character. Thus, making her as a delectable foil to have without the worries of thematic contradiction.  Moreover, it makes her an all the more emotionally encaptivating spectacle to watch, due to how her robot mannerisms trace back on the ambiguity of the apocalypse. Hoshino is, thus, formed into one of the more sentimental Key heroines. Even of the audience knows she\'s a robot.Incidentally, Hoshino wouldn\'t be half the character she was if The Junker\'s presence weren\'t with her. While the series is never interested in implying romantic interest between the two, they both share impactful influences on each other\'s character. The first confrontation between the two highlights this well. Whereas The Junker during the beginning is a being in acknowledgment of his own despairful attempts at surviving, Hoshino is incapable of perceiving anything she does or sees under the subjective lenses of desperation. These two states clash within their first encounter, particularly on the side of The Junker. And it\'s what kindles the start of a dynamic relationship that it itself is continuously developed by rich interactions.These interactions are the core of the narrative; thus, they take up a majority of the series. This doesn\'t pose itself as a problem, though. Quite conversely, it constantly shows itself to be the main foundation of the thematic development. So much so, that regardless of an instance of them not being in the same room, they\'ll still be interacting with each other due to the heavy influences which they inflict on each other. The opening episode showcases this in just its first few minutes and continues to build on them right up until the last few seconds. Which is where The Junker\'s fluid agency comes into play. All his interactions with Hoshino shed some light on a new side of his character. The stagnant Hoshino herself reflects the hope which The Junker had, now deteriorated, to grasp some meaning. Yet, out of his own initiative, The Junker continues interacting with her nonetheless. With each coming interaction, The Junker\'s lack of hope is reinforced and, often times, challenged. Through the course of simple, mundane actions such as fixing a light source, or viewing a galactic presentation, The Junker eventually shows gradual change. A change which repairs the deteriorated hope he had beforehand. The Junker\'s character through these situations is coherently developing himself one step ahead of his previous self by, not finding new things to despair about, but finding new things to hope on,Of course, the robotic Hoshino is incapable of changing as much as The Junker. But this attribute of their relationship shouldn\'t be disregarded as just being one-sided. The Junker is able to show growth—but only because he\'s perceived Hoshino in a new light beforehand. Through this, Hoshino\'s dull lines slowly adapt themselves to sustain more emotional depth once she\'s accompanied by The Junker. The predetermined content she automatically delivers is still intact, but the context in which she delivers them in changes everything from the ground up. And it\'s this subtlety to their interacting dynamics that makes them so natural, so intriguing to watch. Yet, Planetarian doesn\'t discard the dismal atmosphere of the land they\'re in, on the contrary, it completely recognizes it. But only because it is able to recognize the truth that surrounds them is it able to truly mold them as characters with hopes.Just like how its consistent writing prevents it from neglecting its apocalyptic setting, the visuals within Planetarian make sure to set the tone of the narrative right. Being painted with drastically downing dulls, the exterior of the apocalyptic world is forever made of evident of its depressive environment. With the rubbish remains of demolished buildings in the background, and meaningless displays of leaking, brackish water pipes, Planetarian\'s usage of destroyed human creations to signify a lost hope is definitely a bit on-the-nose. Not that it poses itself as a problem. The exterior world is fixed with grays for the sake of visually developing The Junker\'s character and, thus, his perception of the world. Once the planetarium is introduced, similarities of color schemes are kept within it, but a completely different feeling is attached to it. While still showing tinges of being abandoned, the interiors of the planetarium are painted with profound, sentiment reds. This change of tone fits how The Junker regains bits of hope within the safe haven of the planetarium but is still nonetheless aware of his alienated state. The sentimentality of the planetarium\'s color is then challenged by The Junker, now alongside a new Hoshino, when he ventures back into the unknown exteriors of the world. The usage of a setting\'s color to stimulate warmth only to then be subverted for a finale is by no means anything revolutionary. But it doesn\'t have to be. It\'s simple and subtle. And Planetarian has always been effective in that regard for its storytelling.It should come off as no shock that Planetarian\'s ending never frames itself as something grandiose. While it still manages to sew in some Key Melodrama™, under the subsided presentation beforehand, it\'s best conveyed as the aftermath of a build-up of emotional characterization and themes. Planetarian\'s characters don\'t bawl themselves into rivers of tears nor discredit their previous development. They dare to confront their despair to find fragments of hope and, thus, remain strong under the gloom of their sky. All done before fading themselves out in the final credits as individuals who have lived. Which is where Planetarian\'s biggest strength comes in; utilizing the brevity and, at times, the triviality of its plot and characters to craft a dynamic story of hope. It is in no need of expositional padding nor groundbreaking character writing to create a great story. All it does is take the standard apocalypse and carefully subvert into something that\'s comforting. Planetarian reminds us of the often-forgotten statement that sometimes less is definitely more. \u200bAnd, hey, a good visual novel adapation for once!', ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSSince this is a very short anime and there is only one important matter to discuss about it, I'll keep my review short as well. There is no doubt that Planetarian is absolutely top-notch in the graphics department, audio is also good. The setting is interesting, though not very original, we've seen it all before - and not just once. If the story was equally good, this show could have a really nice score, at least 8/10. Unfortunately, it fails at the most important part.What is that important part, then? It's the revolving question of how human Yumemi actually is. Key isn't...trying to reinvent the wheel here, ever since Blade Runner works regarding the humanity of androids keep popping up. There usually are some slight suggestions that, despite being artificial constructs, androids aren't actually that much different from humans - even to the point of having a soul, if you believe such things.Unfortunately, this is where Planetarian fails. Not once within the 2 hours or so of the show have I felt like Yumemi is anywhere close to a human. I have not played the VN, maybe she is portrayed better there, maybe more time was required to show the human part of her, but I'm judging the anime version alone...  And there, she is just a robot. That's it. There is nothing human about her, she is acting according to her programming at all times, and that is unforgivable in an anime that is trying to tackle this subject. Yes, she is cute, she is adorable and fun, and her death was crushing, but it's the same kind of sadness I'd feel if a tree fell on my car during a storm. I have felt that the MC also thinks this way. He hadn't really started personifying her, he just considered her as the last link to the lost world and that was what he was mourning in the end - he definitely wasn't mourning Yumemi as a human being. Maybe I'm wrong about him and the upcoming movie will prove it, but as of now, that is my opinion.I have actually rated Planetarian 8/10 at first, since I have enjoyed if quite a lot, but when I thought about it a bit more while writing this short review, I couldn't help but start thinking it by no means deserved such a score. I think the most objective score would be 6/10, but since it's a Key anime and I'm a fanboy, I should rate it 7/10. It's short and it's definitely not a waste of time, but IMO it fails in the most important department. If Yumemi had a lot more screentime, it might have helped her case.Or well... maybe I'm completely wrong and the writers weren't trying to make her look human. In that case, they've succeeded. trying to reinvent the wheel here, ever since Blade Runner works regarding the humanity of androids keep popping up.

After reading the summary and some Steam reviews it started to sound interesting but I didn\'t buy the game. Couple years after I finally watched this anime and it was different than I expected but because I misunderstood the plot summary.Story was nice and simple and well-fitted for the unusual 5 episodes long visual novel (or ""series"" as I would say). Plot was simple at first but at least for me it started to create small questions I would have had an answer...to, like how was Hoshino\'s life during those years before meeting Kuzuya or why he decided to stay there in the first place.There were some CGI scenes to make the art look even more pretty, but half of them were completely unnecessary and could have used for something else instead.Music was pretty silent at first but in some scenes it really started to play and sounded good. Also, the sound effects were loud and kinda awesome at times.Characters were nice and somewhat classical: overly talkative and positive person and slightly more silent and even grumpy one. Mixing two extremities usually brings interesting situations and interactions with one another. Their relationship with each other can get predictable, however.Enjoyment was surprisingly nice because seeing this being ONA kinda got me worried about its quality as an anime in general but luckily, for me at least, it didn\'t. It would have great amount of material for finding all the mistakes, the big and the small ones, though. Part of me says that the series was too short that ""I would have wanted to see what happens next"" but the last scene kinda tells the viewer how it would end up afterwards.Overall this was kinda nice and short anime to watch and I might look forward to get the game as well, if it comes on sale. The 5 episodes still had plenty of content in them and can get you to seek out more information of what\'s happening or have happened. Perhaps the game could tell some more then. Have to admit that Hoshino is adorable for being a robot. to, like how was Hoshino\'s life during those years before meeting Kuzuya or why he decided to stay there in the first place.There were some CGI scenes to make the art look even more pretty, but half of them were completely unnecessary and could have used for something else instead.Music was pretty silent at first but in some scenes it really started to play and sounded good.

If you've enjoyed their other productions you'll likely enjoy this too.There's a limit to how attached you can get to a character in an hour and a half, so the length, while obviously by design, does have its drawbacks.

Planetarian: Reverie of the Little Planet is an anime which manages to make life seem meaningful.Story – 8/10In a world destroyed by war people have to scavenge for supplies in order to supplies. These scouts are called ‘Junkers’ and make a living from scavenging the environment for supplies and trading said supplies. One such Junker has a life changing experience when entering the remains of a simple planetarium. It is a simple boy-meets-girl series done right. What makes the plot so engaging is the interaction between the...characters and the world in which they live. During the apocalypse hope is scarce and the will to live even more so. Yumeimi is Kazuya’s salvation as her caring nature and innocence shows him that hope is never lost, regardless of your situation in life. Sorry if I seem biased, but Planetarian is exactly the type of anime everybody should watch. It is childishly idealistic, however watching an inspiration and heartfelt tale is never bad for even the most cynical among us.Art – 7/10Even though I believe that animation shouldn’t be important when rating an anime, I do however believe that it shouldn’t be neglected and instead of being the main focus of the anime, it should be used to further enhance the viewing experience. Planetarian doesn’t have the best art style nor does it have the worse. Using shades of black and grey made the world seem even more desolate. The set pieces were desolate and bleak and worked perfectly with an apocalyptic setting. Yumeimi’s character design was cute and was fitting towards her personality. Kazuya was just another averagely designed male MC.Sound – 6/10Nothing much to write about here as Planetarian’s sound design was forgettable. There weren’t any songs on the soundtrack which stood out to me and the soundtrack felt neglected. The majority of tracks did their job adequately in helping build atmosphere for the particular scene, but never does it improve further than the standards from previous tracks. I happened to watch Planetarian’s English Dub and I enjoyed the two main voice actors. I feel that the voice acting captured the personalities of Yumeimi and Kazuya well enough.Character – 7.5/10Even though there are only two characters in the OVA, Planetarian had more than enough personality to go around. Yumeimi is a sweet kind-hearted individual who simply wants to bring joy to the world – mainly because that is her primary directive in life. It was really cute to see Yumeimi being overly chatty with the contrasting personality of Kazuya, who just wants to get some booze to escape from reality. The journey which Kazuya undertook as a character really moved me. He is relatable because he accurately depicts the downcast personality which the majority of humanity would have during the apocalypse. Seeing Kazuya grow attached to Yumeimi, was cute because of his personality. He is someone who just wants to make it through the day and Yumeimi - on the other hand - wants to live every day with purpose. The two of them are fantastic characters which have a polarising effect on one another.Enjoyment – 8/10Planetarian invokes some fond memories of Girls Last Tour for me as both series are set during/after the events of the apocalypse and both of these anime revolve around the central protagonists being content with their situation in life. It has this relaxing air around it which is strange considering the dark atmosphere of the series; however it makes complete sense whenyou think about the positive messages the anime wants to convey.Overall – 7/10Planetarian is the type of anime everybody should watch.

It\'s a kinectic developed by key\'s novelist Suzumato, the author who also writes the Kotomi\'s route in clannad and the ""Summer Route"" in air. It\'s the fourth project developed by key, and ranked on the 4th...place besides the famous clannad, rewrite, and little buster on VNDB. Most importantly, although it\'s short, it does earn widely praise from both VN readers and non-VN readers like me and generally considered as the gem-star made by key itself. Readers appreciate the inspiration they earned from this novel, and, most critically, the thought. If you read planetarian carefully and interpret different plots, you will surely learn different aspect from this novel and evaluate this novel differently. That\'s how planetarian VN looks like, a classic and charming novel.However, I do not really expect it to be animated, In other words, planetarian itself does not fit pretty well in the anime industry. First of all, novel and anime are two different methods for loading the information, To read something, reader cares more about the usage of words and what they can learn from those words and those quotes made up by those words in order to judge the novel itself. By contrast, while watching anime, the childish entertainment, people more care about the frequent change of different scene and sufficient actions created by anime characters for acquiring visual satisfactory before they judge and evaluate the story itself, planetarian is good to read, but not good to watch because it is too short and the majority part of this novel is dialogue and monologue, which can not satisfy the visual satisfactory of audience as an anime and lower their impression at the beginning before they get involved into analyze the story and judge them. So, planetarian does have some disadvantages as an anime.How about the adaptation itself? Well, I have to say that it\'s a very good and straightforward adaptaion. The 3rd episode enable my emotions and drive me to place myself into the story and enjoy the lecture being delivered by Yumei. Those gorgeous legendary and those exploration of mankind for their future development and civilization inheritance does strike me so hard and makes me almost cry. However, the problem is that the adaptation is so straightforward and David Production merely copy from the original source and cut a lot of important monologues. So, VN fans will enjoy the anime. General audience? not really because while they are looking for something fun and frequent change of scene, they fail on discovering it. Plus, the design of Yumei does not fit the world proprietate. She is supposed to be a robot, and a pathetic robot, not the moe girl like general dispissed harem anime, which somehow makes people feel sucks. Additonally, David Production should cut some quotes from Yumei and just briefly introduce Yumei instead of adding tons of ""I am sorry"", Those apologize works pretty well in the novel because it helps reader know Yumei better. But in anime, nobody really wants to hear those pointless apologize, it just annoy them. Plus, The monologue of junkers in the VN is pretty important because it makes readers to think and dig out the depth, the thought behinds his monologue. however, I rarely find those details in the anime. So, how does planetarian make audience think? A big question. Finally, the ED makes me feel disgust. It ruins all the atmosphere thoroughly, the volume of OST of last episode is too low to encourage audience associate their emotion and compassion with the story itself.Overall, I still enjoy this anime as a fan of original source. However, there are a few critical issues makes me disappointed. Planetarian is like a high-quality and gorgeous status being hidden among the general VNs. It only needs to be engraved a little bit before people can witness the shine of this artifact. Did I witness the shine being glowed? Not really.Another thing I want to complain about is key itself. Starting announcing the adaptation of planetarian is only two months before it is played. I know planetarian is not very hard to be adapted, but if key really wants it to become good and makes audience praise it, why don\'t they announce planetarian adaptation earlier and give DP more time? As far as I know, planetarian\'s director really squeeze his time for adapting planetarian. No matter how hard he try, the time is always limited, the quality will not be as good as I expect. place besides the famous clannad, rewrite, and little buster on VNDB.

Plus, The monologue of junkers in the VN is pretty important because it makes readers to think and dig out the depth, the thought behinds his monologue. however, I rarely find those details in the anime. So, how does planetarian make audience think? A big question. Finally, the ED makes me feel disgust. It ruins all the atmosphere thoroughly, the volume of OST of last episode is too low to encourage audience associate their emotion and compassion with the story itself.Overall, I still enjoy this anime as a fan of original source. However, there are a few critical issues makes me disappointed. Planetarian is like a high-quality and gorgeous status being hidden among the general VNs. It only needs to be engraved a little bit before people can witness the shine of this artifact. Did I witness the shine being glowed? Not really.Another thing I want to complain about is key itself. Starting announcing the adaptation of planetarian is only two months before it is played. I know planetarian is not very hard to be adapted, but if key really wants it to become good and makes audience praise it, why don\'t they announce planetarian adaptation earlier and give DP more time? As far as I know, planetarian\'s director really squeeze his time for adapting planetarian. No matter how hard he try, the time is always limited, the quality will not be as good as I expect.', 'Antes nunca tinha feito uma avaliação mais esse fiz questão. Uma indicação do próprio MyAnimeList no inicio fiquei meio receoso em assistir pensei que seria chato e tudo mais e então esses dias resolvi da uma chance e foi um dos melhores animes que assisti pra quem e apaixonado por astronomia vai se encantar cena da projeção da sala juntamente com a historia e simplesmente incrível. Num mundo pós guerra numa cidade totalmente devastada conhecida como cidade sarcófago conhecemos primeiramente Kazuya ou como nós é apresentado como lixeiro depois a Yumemi um robô carismático que trabalha num Shop Center. Esse anime te faz refletir de...varias formas como foi mostrado Yumemi continuou exercendo suas atividades nesses 30 anos decorridos mesmo sabendo que ninguém cliente viria ela entende que isso poderia ser algum erro em seu sistema. Eu como expectador pensei na Yumemi como uma criança que perdeu seus pais na guerra e mesmo assim aguarda o retorno sem entender o ocorrido isso fez a historia ganha uma carga emocional muito grande. Kazuya a meu ver e aquele jovem que cresceu em meio à guerra e tem aquele ar mais fechado mais com decorrer da historia e a interação com a Yumemi ele acaba mostrando um lado mais brando ""Legal"" gosto de como ele se desenvolve ate o final e falando em final esse foi o mais dolorido pra mim essas duas frases doeu muito ""Enviei solicitação de reparo! mais não obtive resposta. Sinto-me solitária!"" e ""Não havia nada errado comigo! O mundo que estava errado!"" Puts impossível não se emocionar com essa cena, pra mim esse anime me fez repensar bastante sobre tudo talvez uns ache exagero mais digo dê uma chance a essa obra se você tiver a mesma linha de visão e pensamento que a minha não vão se arrepender não ligue muito para as outras criticas, não vou dizer que e uma obra fantástica e tal mais conseguiu entregar a devida mensagem.

No geral uma nota 8,5/10', ""Hope of the Stars: The Story of a Lost PlanetariumWARNING: This review contains mostly things related to the visual novel.In a dilapidated city, there is an old planetarium building that people have forgotten about. This old building is used to present the dream of the stars and we meet Yumemi, a cute robot guide who tries to give people hope. The main character of the story is Kuzuya, who comes from two different worlds and embarks on a journey to discover the power of hope and an emotional connection. Actually, in the visual novel there is only Yumemi and we are Kuzuya, or Junker. In...the anime, though, they gave Kuzuya a personality and I really liked that. I'm not going to make the review too long or divide it into topics such as characters, dynamics because I have no idea how much I can write for short anime.Planetarian is a really impressive Japanese visual novel and anime series for me. I laughed at times, I was surprised at times, and I was moved at times. The bond between Yumemi and Kuzuya was woven with a really nice harmony and depth. The moments they lived together in this post-apocalyptic world drew me in with its atmosphere.Yumemi's past memories caused her to be alone in an inhuman world, and these memories make up one of the most touching scenes for the audience. The secrets the characters discover about their past increase the depth of the story and draw the audience in even more. As the series progresses, the relationship between Yumemi and Kuzuya grows stronger. Their devotion to each other and their mutual understanding reinforces feelings of hope and friendship. Viewers witness the development of these characters and how they deal with the challenges they face together, and witnessing this bond is an emotional experience.As expected from a Key production, Planetarian's finale will make many readers cry, as the final scenes bring the emotional intensity of the story to a peak and give us more information about Yumemi's past.Since it is a drama visual novel/anime, I can't not mention the soundtrack. The soundtraccks fits well with the atmosphere of the story and supports the emotional tone of the scenes and accompanies the audience fully. In fact, there is not much OST in the visual novel/anime, but even if there is a little, it is well chosen and I like the OSTs.To sum up, Planetarian is a beautiful Key visual novel/anime that captivates the audience with its emotional moments and atmosphere. I definitely recommend you to read it so that it doesn't take much time to finish it.  If you don't want to read and/or play the visual novel, you can watch the anime directly and you won't miss much. To see what happens next, you can watch the movie Hoshi no Hito by skipping the flashbacks. But again, I recommend you to take a look at the visual novel because I would like to say that it is deeper than the anime. the anime, though, they gave Kuzuya a personality and I really liked that.

It was just kind of cheesy, dumb and sad.The only thing you can really get out of it is the realization that People sure get attached to things which look like vulnerable girls very easily, even the attachment is for an unfeeling machine that merely imitates feeling which humans have.While nothing is particularly bad in terms of production, the writing just feels ham fisted, sloppy and preachy....You could even call it manipulative, trying to get you to cry. It plays on basic human psychology without actually giving you anything.Just like a machine, the experience is soulless and hollow. You could even call it manipulative, trying to get you to cry.

We meet our jerk with a heart of gold protagonist as a scavenger in a post-apocalypse near-future city. While looking for supplies he stumbles on a still-functioning android that was left behind by the last humans to live there, and she keeps trying desperately to get him to come see the planetarium. As a side note, I found it mildly amusing as a Christian that they used...a traditional hymn as the main theme, as those songs have different musical connotation in Japan and are used more like how we use any European classical music. The name of the tune is ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus,"" but shout-outs to fellow Mormons that know it as ""Israel, Israel God is Calling.""Anyway along the way our hero gets slowly sucked in just as we as the audience do and his heart grows 3 sizes when the robot girl sacrifices herself to save him from the evil military attack drone. I\'m using flippant language that makes it sound like I didn\'t care to hide how much I\'m crying on the inside. It was really one of those moments where suddenly all those little personality quirks the mildly annoying character had are brought up again in a different context and suddenly it\'s sad. It\'s also all done in a nice and tight package with no filler and anything unnecessary trimmed out. I liked it.

It's about a female robot who informs people about a planetarium and a man, military looking, who is trying to get to a certain place.

Planetarian has a lot of the characteristics that reveal its VN roots, like well-written dialogue, intriguing story concepts, and interesting music. Though, it also harbors some of the notable drawbacks, like flat characters, basic motivations, and sometimes rigid animation. Beginning with the story, it starts with a simple yet engaging concept about a postapocalyptic world where humans are very scarce, and a planetarium robot which still manages to function. Of course, when the first...customer in almost 30 years shows up, it leads to a unique interaction between the two. The story that ensues is pretty simple, but that simplicity works really well and the anime is better for it. By episode 4 I was already more invested than I thought I would be. Even if it isn't genre-defining, it will be something I think about every now and then. The art is pretty good, meeting all the standards of quality, and even if it doesn't demonstrate visual mastery or anything, it uses the level of artistic talent it does have to great effect, producing a rather immersive atmosphere. Though, the character designs are pretty basic, and the animation thereof is pretty lacking, save for the planetarium scenes. The sound is great, with an ethereal, mysterious score and detailed sounds of life, which is itself a feat given the sound of the constant rain. The characters are, like their designs, thoroughly unremarkable, but not bad by any means. They serve their purpose well within the story, though I feel that these characters worked better in their VN, as the player is able to fill in the blanks in that context that here are simply laid bare. Overall, Planetarian is a short, simple, pretty anime that doesn't really excel in any regard. I still enjoyed it, and if you liked the visual novel, or enjoy planetariums, it's a definite recommend. Though, for everyone else your mileage may vary. customer in almost 30 years shows up, it leads to a unique interaction between the two.

Though, for everyone else your mileage may vary."", ""As of 2024, I have now seen a total of four anime based on Visual Arts/Key's properties: Air, Kanon (The 2006 version, not the Toei version), Clannad, and Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet. I have no plans to watch Little Busters or Rewrite, nor play their visual novels at the moment. Planetarian is based on Key's kinetic novel of the same name. Unlike a regular visual novel, a kinetic novel offers little to no choices or branching paths that affect the plot in any way, and its narrative is completely linear, being more like a digital picture book with music and voice acting...than a game, though that's not to say kinetic novels are bad. Planetarian got adapted into an anime in 2016 by David Production and for the most part, it was pretty well received. I actually did watch the first episode years ago, but because I was deep in anime burnout, I didn't watch the rest of it until this year. I do wish I could have watched this a lot earlier, as this is a pretty sweet, heartwrenching anime that's a pretty faithful adaptation of the game.In a dystopian future, mankind has fallen. In their hubris and greed, they brought calamitous destruction down upon their own civilization. Now only embers and wreckage remain, and what few humans survive eke out a meager existence in the ashes of this empire. The Junker is one such survivor, scavenging among dead cities for usable junk. But when he stumbles across a planetarium in an abandoned apartment store, he meets Yumemi Hoshino, a robotic assistant who is somehow still functioning. Yumemi knows nothing of the destruction outside; sworn to her duties, she still advertises for a starry performance that will never come. At first, the Junker is put off by her constant talking and nearly leaves her alone...but he has a change of heart to the point of offering to repair Yumemi's projector. Their unlikely meeting will reveal that no matter how dark our skies become, there is always starlight beyond.Remember when Kyoto Animation used to adapt Key's games into anime? I clearly remember when it was first announced that JC Staff was going to adapt Little Busters and fans went absolutely apeshit over it. Not really sure what prompted KyoAni to stop, but luckily, unlike with Little Busters, Planetarian's animation was handled by David Production, and from what I can tell, the reception to this decision hasn't been anywhere near as bad. I'm only halfway through the game myself, but the anime does a pretty good job of bringing this slice of Planetarian's ruined world to life. The faded backgrounds give the crumbling world a stark dreariness about it, and provide an effective contrast to Yumemi's overly ornate cute moe girl design and cheerful recitations of screening times and special events. The actual planetarium segments and the background imagery that pops up when Yumemi goes into her actual presentation are nothing short of beautiful and manage to do their job well. The animation itself doesn't really rise above functional; not so limited that it becomes a slide show on the level of The Way Of The Househusband, but isn't strong enough to elevate the characters and the source material. The same goes for the soundtrack which, while nice to listen to, isn't very memorable.That being said, Planetarian's strengths come from both the main characters and the narrative. The cast for this is small, focusing only on Yumemi and the Junker, and we get plenty of time to get to know them and what drives them to do what they do, making their relationship convincing and their inevitable fates all the more tragic. The fact that this show is only 5 episodes long, with said episodes ranging between 10-16 minutes long, demands it tell its story as efficiently as possible, and I'm glad to say Planetarian pulled it off with aplomb. Another reason Planetarian's overall story works so well is that it shows quite a bit of restraint when telling it and its themes. It doesn't feel the need to constantly hammer you with the sadness of its setup, such as with overlong monologues or melodramatic scenes showing the characters crying all the time; Yumemi's optimism contrasted against the dilapidated state of the world around her does that already. Everything the show does plays on contrasts and contradictions: At one point, when Yumemi is doing her presentation, her exaltation of humanity's wish to go into space has a brief image of Icarus falling out of the sky, an acknowledgement that what makes humanity great is also what makes us terrible. Not every story needs a grand, epic, sweeping narrative in order to be good. Sometimes even simple stories can be genuinely great if you know what you're doing. On that note, I'm not gonna watch the movie, because most of it is just a recap of the show, and what little new footage it does have, while providing a good epilogue for the show, doesn't justify spending more time with the movie than you should.So yes, Planetarian as an anime isn't the strongest story out there, and its production is middling at best, but its fundamentally strong storytelling and characters are able to overcome its limitations. Granted, I know others won't agree. Some may find it great, others might find it to be cynical and emotionally cloying or manipulative. Honestly, I think Prima Doll fits those descriptions far better than Planetarian ever could, mainly because Planetarian isn't completely banking itself on cute moe girls, and its writing and characterization is far smarter and nuanced. Yeah, I'm still not over just how bad Prima Doll is. Though for all I know, if I were to rewatch stuff like Kanon and Air nowadays, I might feel differently about them compared to when I was younger. I will say that I'm glad I saw Planetarian because it does manage to be good on its own merits, VN adaptation or no. I ought to finish the VN while I'm at it. than a game, though that's not to say kinetic novels are bad.

Yes, another tale of disgruntled veterans of the violent Meiji Restoration, coming back for blood!  Such concepts work in the series (see the second arc) because of well-developed characters.  Even the most simple plot idea can be made epic by a cast we care about!  Almost all of my enjoyment for this movie was derived from my existing fangirl obsession for everything Ruroken.  When viewed as part of the larger Ruroken story, this movie is certainly good for an afternoon...of enjoyment, but that\'s it.  Romantic tension and Kenshin\'s internal struggle are two things, for example, that shone in the series, due to the large episode count and the time spent on developing these ideas.  But, uh, I\'m completely repeating myself!My verdict is simple.  If you\'re never seen any Rurouni Kenshin, please stop now and go watch the OVAs and the series.  But, if you\'ve already proved yourself to be uttered devoted to our cross-marked ex-assassin, then you must watch this to satiate your addiction, you sick little otaku.  ^_~x of enjoyment, but that\'s it.

And so I saw the OVA\'s and the 2012 ""kyoto arc movie"" first, I...was dragging along on watching this, it will be boring, I dont want a story that is not written by Rurouni Kenshin mangaka, I have had enough of fillers!I already knew Kenshin begginings, middle life\'s days to its last days, days of the samurai whose dark past, made him treasure even more, the future!!The one who protects the weak with his warm smile, his sword and his life, clearing a way towards a better future using his blade to protect the people, not slay them!So despite being an original story not written by the mangaka, I was very pleased and astonished with the movie. It fits very well on Kenshin universe.The story was a bit cliche, but it wasnt bad at all! I found the story to be well paced, with some of greastest characters of the series appearing again, since Kyoto\'s Arc (Saito for example, his absence was very missed in the filler\'s arcs!)). The new characters that show up are great on their own, nothing too special but for a movie(1 h 40m), they filled well the roles each was given to achieve, along with the classics of the series, of course!!The movie belongs to 1997, and for that time the art and design was great, it is on pair with the great quality of the anime, and IMO it has aged well enough to still be pleasurable enough to watch.With great characters, and their past stories and conflicts of those bloody war\'s days, resurfacing, especially kenshin, his past is one that seems predestined to chase him till the end... I was never bored, like I said I was very surprised... the movie captured very well the Rurouni Kenshion spirit,  I soo much enjoyed while watching the anime, yes Makoto Shishio arc and story are better, but that said, this movie wasnt a filler for me, it was much better than the whole filler arc (that had ""some"" not so bad moments to it too...)!!And watching the movie now, it was really a great time, a reminder of some of the stuff I loved so much before filler\'s arc! I wanted to watch classic kenshin (the OVA\'s shine at a different light, great on their own, but dont have that classic feeling to it) MORE, but I didnt knew it, I though what a bother, but now that the movie ended, I say it filled that ""unknown need"" of mine. This is a great movie, a great story to take its place at kenshin\'s universe!I reccomend all kenshin fanbase to give this a try, you will find it worth of your time. was dragging along on watching this, it will be boring, I dont want a story that is not written by Rurouni Kenshin mangaka, I have had enough of fillers!I already knew Kenshin begginings, middle life\'s days to its last days, days of the samurai whose dark past, made him treasure even more, the future!!The one who protects the weak with his warm smile, his sword and his life, clearing a way towards a better future using his blade to protect the people, not slay them!So despite being an original story not written by the mangaka, I was very pleased and astonished with the movie. It fits very well on Kenshin universe.The story was a bit cliche, but it wasnt bad at all! I found the story to be well paced, with some of greastest characters of the series appearing again, since Kyoto\'s Arc (Saito for example, his absence was very missed in the filler\'s arcs!)).

Therefore, I have no score on Enjoyment and you wont find any section called Enjoyment in this review. I think you will do fine without it, though. ^^Story 8/10Since the Rurouni Kenshin movie is produced in the middle of the production of the Rurouni Kenshin series (henceforth referred to as ""the series""). I usually watch related series/movies in chronological order, so I wasn\'t sure when to watch it, but I decided it would probably be best watch it after I had completed the series.This movie...is not what I would consider an actual sequel to the series, despite taking place two years after the end of the storyline of the series. The movie is not depending on the series, so it is fully possible to watch it without having watched the series in it\'s entirety.The first minutes of the movie shows a fighting scene from the Bakumatsu where Kenshin fights and eventually kills Takatsuki Gentatsu.Following the intro and titles, Kenshin meets Takimi Shigure, friend of the late Gentatsu. Since the day of Gentatsu\'s death, Takimi has taken care of his sister, now 18 years.As the synopsis states: ""Takimi blames himself foolishly for his friend’s death, and vows to take revenge upon this corrupt Meiji government who wasted Gentatsu\'s sacrifice"".So, as the majority of the enemies in the series, Takimi plans to overthrow the government and Kenshin tries to stop him.Is this story like the multitude of poor arcs in the series? No. Actually, I\'d consider it as one of the better ones, if it was a part of the series. Once again, you will experience some good moments with an enemy doing what he believes is right, not realizing the consequences of his actions.Animation 6/10Like the series, this movie is made by Gallop, sharing the same style of animation, though with some minor differences. Focus is put on aesthetics instead of realism. The Rurouni Kenshin movie is animated like many action movies are filmed, with interesting cuts, angles and perspectives. It\'s as if the creators tries to make the fights awesome, in that way that any 12 year old boy would think ""Woow! I want to be a samurai!!"" when watching.I don\'t think that it\'s very bad, but I\'m not sure sacrificing realism is necessary — just look at Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen.As for the differences between the movie and the series in terms of animation, I notice a somewhat different character design and generally stronger colours. As an examle, the blood in the first scene is almost self-luminous. The strong colours further increase the aesthetics and decrease the realism.Some might like it this way. I don\'t dislike it, but I don\'t really like it either.Sound 5/10The sound effects are the same as in the main series, with the weird cutting-flesh sounds and the sound for clashing blades resembling that of a tuning-fork. The sound effects gives a very synthetic impression. In what way is it supposed to represent the real world? I don\'t like it at all.What saves the sound section from disaster is the music. The music lifts the series, and helps creating emotional moments. The opening song isn\'t really that wonderful, but the rest of the soundtrack is very nice. At the emotional peak of the series I almost, almost, shed a few tears. Almost.Characters 8/10As I stated in the story section, I get a feeling of understanding for Takimi Shigure. That is the case with quite a few of the characters. I don\'t want to repeat myself, but the depiction of people that aren\'t really bad, only making wrong choices, is very convincing.I can\'t find anything in particular to complain about. Takimi Shigure develops in the movie and that\'s good, but he may be the only one. In any case, this is a movie, hence not giving that much place for character delevopment. All in all, I\'m satisfied.Overall 7/10I get the impression that The Rurouni Kenshin movie, not being a sequel, is not really made for the fans of the series. The opening and first scenes hints that the movie is made more like a short version of the story made to attract Kenshin fans that haven\'t watched the series — or completely new fans for that matter.Like the series, the movie seem to sacrifice much of the realism (in both story, animation and sound), trying to give a more aesthetic and cool impression.The final line is that the movieis much like the series — the good parts, that is.

Introduces new characters with stock personalities and motivation which ties into...3. Recycles themes and stories expressed in the main series without any attempt at one-upping them.In this feature length film, Kenshin and the rest of the gang go on vacation or something for no real reason and discover Shigure Takami, yet another...ghost of the Bakumatsu who has a bloodstained vendetta against the current Meiji government.

I guess it\'s because it feels more like a prolonged episode of the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" series than a movie, in style, production quality, as well as content.But though it feels like just a normal episode of ""Rurouni Kenshin"", at least it feels like one of the better ones, as personally I enjoyed watching it, even if it is somewhat forgettable.Storywise, it\'s about a samurai, who, in addition to not being happy with the outcome of the revolution (surprise...surprise), also has a personal grudge against Kenshin (shock horror). Remember when I said this was just like another episode of ""Rurouni Kenshin""? Anyway, the build up is pretty slow - aided by copious amount of repetitive flashbacks - but the pay off at the end is satisfying. The story even succeeds to be quite touching at times. The humour they attempted sucked though.While movies generally have noticably better animation than their series counter parts, the same cannot be said for the Kenshin movie - it\'s about on a par with the series. It\'s actually worse in some respects - for some bizarre reason, the colour contrasts seem a little messed up. Reddish colours such as Kenshin\'s hair colour and also blood seems overly bright.The action sequences are good but falls short of great. Kenshin uses this jump attack (that I don\'t remember seeing in the series) that looks pretty cool. The makers must have thought so too, cos if I remember correctly (I watched this a long time ago), they had Kenshin use that move over and over till it got a bit boring.Last but not least, there are two things in the main series that puts a tingle down my spine: one is a badass Hajime Saito cameo, and the other is when Kenshin lets his inner manslayer takes over. This movie has both of those, which is a nice bonus.Overall, ""Rurouni Kenshin - Requiem for the Restoration Royalist"" doesn\'t add anything new to the world of Kenshin, but it can be a very entertaining watch for established fans.

This is basically a stand-alone filler episode to cash in on the franchise. The story is a essentially rehash of previous arcs of the series.

Only redeeming aspect of this is the brief flashback sequence of Kenshin in action which you'll be very..familiar with by the end. "", ""I was on the fence about watching this movie for a long time. I loved the show and the two specials, reflection and trust and betrayal. I can honestly say I wish I had never seen the movie.Story: 7/10The story was the only good thing about this movie. It fit into the plot and didn't feel out of place for a second.Art: 4/10Honestly, I understand it is pretty old but it doesn't match the art from the show at all. Of course, it's done by a different team so it wouldn't have the same art, but the quality in the movie is actually lesser than...the show despite the fact it is more recent.Sound: 3/10I didn't feel like the sound was done very well at all. Some things had sound effects when they shouldn't and some needed sound effects. The voice actors didn't really fit their characters and I'm not sure why. They're the same from the specials mentioned above but it still didn't feel right at all.Character: 1/10I don't even want to get into this. Kaoru and Sanosuke didn't feel right at all and I'm not sure if it was their voice, artwork, speech, or a combination. The new characters didn't make me feel attached to them at all and I was actually happy most of them died or left.Enjoyment: 1/10I would give this a negative number if I could. I didn't enjoy one second of this. Nothing felt right at all and honestly this movie is a disgrace to the name Kenshin Himura.Overall, if you want to watch it for completeness, then that's on you. I will never watch it again and I'm still contemplating whether or not it's worth keeping on my HDD. They could give me the movie for free and I would just send it back.

It\'s very unique for its genre and the first 3 episodes have been very entertaining so far. Keep in mind I have not read the manga for this, so I have no idea what\'s to come.Basically, the ""monsters"" started invading earth 13 years ago and the Divine Dragon Keepers need to put an end to them. Eventually, the monsters got handled and they were forced to bring out one per week so that the Dragon Keepers could defeat them in front of a large crowd. One monster (our MC)...is sick and tired of putting up with this charade, so he decides that he will take down the Dragon Keepers from the inside. This is the premise.I find this concept to be quite interesting as the audience has no idea what\'s going on, and as the monsters have had to put up with this farce for over a decade, it would make sense that some of them would be tired of it and would want to rebel against their opressors.Characters: The cast of Go Go Loser Ranger is quite enjoyable. Seeing the perspective of the ""bad guy"" for once and actually rooting for the villain (MC) to win is a lot of fun, because before I watched the show, I thought the MCs would be the Dragon Keepers, however they are simply supporting characters. Additionally, Yumeko Suzukiri and Hibiki Sakurama are enjoyable characters, even though we don\'t know much about them yet. Their dynamics and interactions with the MC are a lot of fun, and you call already tell they are multi-layered characters.Score: 9/10Sound: The sound in this anime is great, From the insert songs mid fight, to the sound effects and voice acting, Go Go Loser Ranger! has really gotten this right.  The VA cast is quite stacked too. Yuusuke Kobayashi is voicing Fighter D, Yuuichi Nakamura voices Red Keeper, Kensho Ono voices Yellow Keeper, and Kousuke Toriumi voices Green Keeper.Score: 9/10Animation: The animation on this show is very good. Yostar pictures are a studio known for doing gacha-game adaptations, so when I saw them on a big project like this one, where the manga is very beloved and well known, I was a little skeptical. However, once I saw the trailer as well as ep 1, my concerns were immedietaly lifted. The animation is fluid and crisp. Character art is great. There is actually some cgi used here and there, but it\'s blended very well with 2D and is barely noticeable imo.Score: 8/10OP and ED:Probably the weakest (and arguably least important) part of the show. The op is performed by Tatsuya Kitani, and while it certainly isn\'t his best work, it\'s not bad by any means. The visuals are fun and the song is upbeat. I\'ll probably start skipping it from this point on, but it fits the vibe of the show well.The ED is pretty catchy, but not really my type of song.

There are so many aspects of it where I feel it has incredible potential, but it just falls short each time. I'm still enjoying watching it for what it's worth, but I feel a strong sense of loss and yearning for what it could've been every time I watch an episode. It somehow has dark undertones, but they're too muted and the series feels like it lacks seriousness overall. If I had to compare it to other series that successfully capture a distinct back-and-forth between serious/relaxed, I'd point to One...Punch Man S1 or Madoka Magica. That's the level I felt this show could've reached, but I digress. It's still an enjoyable watch if you can overcome the thought of what it failed to achieve. Punch Man S1 or Madoka Magica.

We follow Fighter D, who seeks to break free of the oppressive truce decided by humanity after they defeated his monster leaders.

Sentai Daishikkaku emerges in the midst of this generalization with something truly original, the anime uses a different premise from anime about ""Ranger heroes"", where the villain and the hero switch roles from the viewer\'s perspective, when analyzing the narrative that accompanies each side. Perhaps this is one of the most underrated animes of this 2024 season.And I will try to convince you during the review....HistoryThe main strength of the anime is the story. The anime has the proposal of show something never made before, show how much the villains in this anime are in a deplorable situation, whether due to a lack of physical strength, or also a lack of a stance against the agreement to which they are subject. The villains of this anime are immortal beings and weak in terms of combat, and the ""heroes"" of the anime are the total opposite. The narrative is as follows: the rangers after defeating all the ""bosses of the villains"", enter into an agreement with these immortal beings in which they spare themselves from using the divine artifact (this artifact can eliminate even immortal beings), but these beings  must fake fights in front of the public against the rangers, for the pure entertainment of the human public, who stereotyped them as ""evil"", despite being weak beings and harmless. It is in these fights in which the villains must pretend that they have a ""force"" against humanity, that the rangers ridicule them to the point of using them just as a way to entertain the narrative that ""heroes will always fight evil"", although ""evil"" does not necessarily re-present a threat to humanity. The plot then places the Rangers as beings who command the force on earth, and the villains only have to obey them if they want to stay alive. This agreement continues for a long time until "" fighter D"" decides to go against this logic and reveals himself against humanity, trying to stop being a puppet controlled by the rangers. With the support of some humans, throughout history fighter D will obtain human forces and allies, these humans, because they disagree with the proposed plot so far, decide to go against ""the rules of peace established human and rangers"" and then to partner with D to to change turn  in what seemed to be already established in the story from the beginning, bringing moments of conspiracies and twists to the plot throughout history.With this new premise, the story follows D\'s attempts to achieve freedom in the face of a society idealized to one utopia what in which good must always fight villains, and thus eradicate evil. What seems like an ideology of peace, ends up in the anime being approached more as a form of entertainment, just as in fighting rings, the public is entertained by the fights, in the anime it is the same thing only that the result is always the same. As a result, in a way the anime brings a ""philosophy"" that the public currently only cares about with entertainment and, often, neglects others social factors, being egocentric enough to only think about rooting for the side that has the advantage. Yes, maybe I\'m the only one or not, but I see this story that way, as a way of showing the twenty-first century society, which values \u200b\u200bmoments of entertainment despite being momentary and leaving aside reflection on other social factors that in the anime would mean recognizing both sides, this idea is somehow represented by the character Sakurama Hibiki, who even as a human tries to understand fighter D\'s side throughout the episodes, even though he is introduced to religious ideals by his parents, he believes in both the rangers and the ""villains"", creating his own opinion about society.Overall, this story is excellent not only because it is unique in the way it unfolds, with unpredictabilitys and schematized actions, the characters always try to calculate what should be done and always aim at an ideal specific to each. Although there are tense moments, the story also has a dynamic that, in a way, can lead to comedy in some interactions between the characters, but always placing the disagreement between ""villains"" and ""heroes"" in the plot.9/10CharactersThey are truly unique characters, whether because they are on opposite sides than predicted by villains and heroes, or by the conviction that each one has, are intriguing enough to make the anime interesting throughout the narrative.Now talking about some that have been notable so far, fighter D is a character who fights against something already established, which seeks a different result from that expected by humans and rangers, by revealing itself against peace and remaining faithful to its role as villain, from this one can already imagine an incredible psychological development of the character, despite not having any strength physically, he still refuses to accept his cruel destiny, fighting against humanity until the end.The main Rangers, on the other hand, also have a unique ideal, that ""peace"", even though it is false and designed for entertainment, must prevail until the end, this narrative suggests in some way that they will do everything possible to stay on this idealized path without worrying about end results demonstrating that they are cold characters and that in front of the public they present a ""false sympathy"" as a hero to hide their intimate desires.Besides them, the anime contains unique characters like Suzukiri Yumeko and Sakurama Hibiki, where both help fighter D on his journey ahead of the made with the Rangers. Suzukiri Yumeko has an intriguing personality, who truly desires a necessary ""evil"" for the world to leave everything more ""interesting"" from his own perspective, Sakurama Hibiki, as said before, tries to believe in what he has established throughout his life, even though full of faith imposed by his parents, he continued believing in the Rangers and later listened to the fighter D\'s side and formed his own ideal.It is remarkable how much effort the author put into these characters, adhering to unique stories, development and personalities. With interactions that always result in progressing the anime\'s narrative, which helps to make the plot interesting enough throughout the episodes, due to this originality of the author.8/10Animation/sound/scenarios/FightsAlthough the animation is not incredible, it is quite acceptable. The opening and ending are great, with engaging songs and perfectly matching the atmosphere of the anime.The dubbing is good, most of the characters and their voice actors match perfectly. The soundtrack leaves nothing to be desired, despite not being that significant.The fights were mostly good, although the special effects are a little strange (like the smoke, or the movement of a character from one place to another), but I also find acceptable as they are not enough spoiling the experience. The anime still has an urban setting of a big city, even though it\'s not the main strong point of the anime, it doesn\'t come to be bad. The studio somehow did well in the adaptation, I don\'t see enough bad factors to ruin the overall experience of the anime, but I still think the studio could have done better with the anime.6/10PleasureOverall, I liked the anime, it\'s engaging enough to make you stick with the original proposed narrative. In addition to the narrative, the characters are, for the most part, memorable and interesting for the overall experience.The story and characters are really specific to this ""Ranger heroes vs. villains"" kind of animation idea.Very reminiscent of Power Rangers, but with a different plot and unique characters from a series that involve twists and play opposite roles of common villains and heroes.In general, it\'s a good anime, and it\'s underrated enough for many people, thinking it\'s a copy of Power Rangers, though it is something new and engaging even if it uses similar parameters.7/10I recommend this anime to anyone looking for something unique, exciting, and engaging. Even though it is about heroes and villains, this anime is not boring due to the plot developed in the course of the anime. Give it a chance and give yourself completely to something original and underestimated by some but that may surprise you in the way it develops everything that is proposed to the viewer, you won\'t regret it. ^~^|| Final grade/average rating in the review: 7.5/10 || HistoryThe main strength of the anime is the story.

I started watching it on a recommendation, and I couldn't stop watching it once I started. Among all the isekais and shounen mainstream offerings each season, this is such a refreshing watch. The story is a nice mix of mystery, action, and comedy. I've heard the story compared to The Boys on Amazon. I haven't personally watched The Boys, but Sentai Daishikkaku's narrative of a duplicitous and dark superhero culture does make it seem comparable to The Boys.The first few episodes introduces us to the characters and the world they live in, but once things got rolling, the...story had me hooked. The battles actually have stakes and characters aren't winning them by purely overpowering their foes with strength or with arbitrary level-ups mid-battle, which are annoyingly common tropes.This is definitely an underdog story. The protagonist has to resort to more creative measures to overcome obstacles and that makes for a substantially more compelling watch with more twists and turns. At 8 episodes in, I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the story goes.ARTThe art style is refreshing and I quite like it. I also like the stylized animation. The studio did a pretty good job of blending 2D with CG animation. I've watched my share of CG and CG/2D hybrid animations, and this is actually quite good.CHARACTERThe series has a fun eclectic cast of characters, which reminds me of my favorites like Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Golden Kamuy. The protagonist is so entertaining to watch, and I absolutely enjoy watching how he overcomes obstacles given his limitations.ENJOYMENTI couldn't stop watching once I started. 12 episodes in this season is too short, and I sincerely hope they continue this adaptation. story had me hooked.

There are similarities between them. Which only makes for a more interesting concept. Think of that love one from a few seasons ago. That alone will bring more attention to this show.

And not all actions of heroes are good ones, shining a light exposing the industry that was created benefiting from the whole ordeal between the two parties, selling that to the normal people in their world that are unaware of it.Such a show needs a good cast of characters that can make or break the story now that they have introduced the premise.

There are decent at least, nothing amazing, but solid... And that's about itBut story wise... Oh boy. This is one of those rare shows that somehow manage to COMPLETELY fail ANY sort of exposition and storytelling! I'm not quite sure how such an epic fail in basically the most important component of any media (story) was achieved, nor how it got this high a score as a manga and became popular enough  to make it all the way to an anime.To put it simply, there's absolutely NO story to go around on for about...HALF WAY into the show, and worse than that, not a SINGLE character that raises any interest or anyone would ever want to root for no matter the circumstances... Everyone's the bad guys, and not the charming, 'special', 'misunderstood' or otherwise interesting type of bad guy either, but the most generic type of bad guy, including MC. There's no redeeming qualities to any of them, or any endearing aspects to go on...So what would keep you watching? My answer - nothing, hence this is a must drop in my book, 4.3/10, just for the production quality.

Shakugan no Shana II (Second),https://myanimelist.net/anime/2787/Shakugan_no_Shana_II_Second,"['*A wonderful sequel to a fabulous series.*It is highly recommended to complete the first season of Shakugan no Shana before watching this. This is a DIRECT sequel, so prior knowledge of the series is expected from you.Shakugan no Shana II is sometimes viewed as a ""filler"" season due to the plot trailing off from the light novels where it originates from. It also received numerous ""bashing"" from fans of the previous season who complained that the first half of Shakugan no Shana II lacked actions. Personally, I really liked how they began Shakugan no Shana II so I have nothing to complain about. But many...who prefer actions over character developments would be rather disappointed in this season, but a real Shakugan no Shana fan should actually be happy that the anime is spending time explaining the mysteries and/or unclear relations between certain people or things.Story:Continuing from where the first season left off, Shakugan no Shana Second as it is officially called start us off in a very noglistic way. Summing up most of the main events in season one in half an episode (not to mention a battle is going on at the same time) is quite innovative. Shana II, unlike its predecessor, does not have a lot of flashy battles. Instead, it focuses much more on bringing out each character\'s unique characteristics and their relationship with one another (more about the characters later).Art:Those who are familiar with the first season should be able to jump right into Shana II as the production crew practically used the same graphical engines to animate the show. This means 2 things:1. the animation crew got lazy and presented us a 2005 quality anime2. it is still animated on par (if not above) most of the 2008 animationsSound:The same singers were asked to perform the OP and ED for Shana II so fans shouldn\'t have much to complain. As stated from my previous review on Shakugan no Shana, it is packed with many bright and talented seiyus. Excluding Shana and Kazumi who were already covered in the past review, we also haveMamiko Noto (Kotomi Ichinose in Clannad, Yuka in Elfen Lied, Anna Liebert in Monster) performing the role of Hecate and Fumina KonoeHitomi Nabatame (Unchou Kan-u in Ikkitousen, Mikoto Suou in School Rumble ) voicing for Margery DawShizuka Itou (Himawari Kunogi in xxxHOLiC, Lenalee Lee in D.Gray-man) performing the role of Wilhelmina CarmelLast but not least, we have Marina Inoue (Tsukiumi in Sekirei, Yoko in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Tsukasa Kiryu in Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka) voicing for PhelesCharacter:This show is flawless when it comes to characters. The production crew did an amazing job at creating the characters in such a way that makes them believable and in many ways demonstrated that they are not much different from us (ie. make them real.. not like some fantasy characters). I was simply dazed by how fabulously constructed the characters (both main and supporting) are in Shana II. Although the first season of Shakugan no Shana was already extremely well made, this successor is no doubt a level above (11/10?).Final Impression:Shakugan no Shana II expanded on what was lacking in the previous season (namely some explanation on certain issues and character mental growth for some minor supporting roles). However, because the crew had to cover these, they had to take out some attractive actions that the fans wanted to see in the beginning. Overall I would not say this is inferior or superior to the first season, but if I have to choose I will say I like this one slightly more (excluding the flashy actions). who prefer actions over character developments would be rather disappointed in this season, but a real Shakugan no Shana fan should actually be happy that the anime is spending time explaining the mysteries and/or unclear relations between certain people or things.Story:Continuing from where the first season left off, Shakugan no Shana Second as it is officially called start us off in a very noglistic way.

But i can\'t give it any more than this, when i overlay the ""4"" it says ""Decent"", and this second season (not the firs, and certainly not the novel) is WAY below decent. So i\'m sorry but it\'s what it is. A poor second season.I\'m not arguiing that the animation and sound is as epic as ever. My main complain is ""what the hell happened with the plot!?"". Maybe the plot died at the explosion in the end of the first season. Maybe the people in charge of adapting the novel...said ""Adapt the novell as it is?, pff that\'s for NOOBS, we are pro, we got mad skillz yo. We gonna get high and come up with a plot of our own, using the same characters as the first season"".You could give this piece of crap a higher score out of love / respect for the first season. Or maybe out of love for some of the characters. Yes you could, but please don\'t. If you give this abomination an 8, how could you give the first season a 10?, you would have to give it a 20 or else the scores won\'t make sense anymore.Character ""Development""More like character involution. During season one, the characters meet, they live a lot of things together, wich makes their relationship / feelings (not just romantic) evolve, change, as it happens in real life as you get to know someone better you like / dislike him / her more.There is no way you could say the relationship between Shana - Yuji - Yoshida is the same at the beg of the first season, than at the end.Great!, so why trun back the clock in season 2?. Why GOD WHY!?. Why start again with the whole ""should i teel him?, shouldn\'t i tell him?, what does he think of me?, what does he thinks of her?. Im going to ramble like this for 24 episodes, maybe i\'ll figure out the answer in season 3 or something... Yes sounds like a plan"".We were over this towards the end of season one, you had a frigging life /death experience, you can\'t get any closer than that.... But NO, let\'s just go back like we just met. AWESOME!.The last thing im going to say about character development in this show is abou the end, but don\'t worry it\'s not a spoiler. The only thing im going to say is that you will get three things:* The feeling that NOTHING CHANGED IN 24 EPISODES.* The urge to rewatch the first season, to remind yourself why you tortured your brains until the very end of season 2.* The wish that you could just ""unsee"" everything you just saw.CharactersOh yes, this is a whole new section. With the exception of Shana, and A BIT Yuji, all the characters become as intresting as a grapefruit.Yoshida, who already was as intresting as watching the grass grow, becomes even more ANNOYING.

The usual tension continues between Shana and Kazumi still exists...which pretty much threw a lot of people off from this anime; fans were pretty much in a state where it felt like they were watching the first season again... I know that because that how I felt, but if you do survive the first 5~6 episodes you will find some things starting to be answered that was left opened from season one which will keep you in this anime as well as other things.ART:Flashy opening, but pretty much the same style as the first season.SOUND:Same battle music as the first season, but as the anime goes on and fights emerges the music becomes perfect suspense maker which will keep you in your seats.CHARACTER:Let me tell you this... The characters DO mature!  OMG Finally!!!! Which is why I gave this section a perfect 10. I could not stand how Shana and Kazumi were acting like little kids in the first season; their rivalry got old pretty quick. The character development does start out like the first season, but &quot;everyone&quot; in this anime matures someway to how real people should be acting.ENJOYMENT:Enjoyment? Hmm... well like stated the story does start off slow, but then the story pretty much picks up and becomes interesting to watch.Fight scenes are awesome but not long enough... =/OVERALL:A great anime indeed. If you watched the first season then you must definitely watch this one. Like stated before, this season will answer some of the questions you had left over from the first.*hopes for a season 3* :D which pretty much threw a lot of people off from this anime; fans were pretty much in a state where it felt like they were watching the first season again...

(they were my highlights :D)Enjoymentnow that the stories gone back to the fight scenes and action, i am now definately complelled to watch the rest of the season, arguably by some of the more &quot;mature&quot; audience its a definate improvement of shana 1, but personally, i thoroughly enjoyed it going &quot;back&quot; to the action like shana  and hope it continues to do so.OverallGreat Anime to watch, definite for the romance/action audience out there, and definately for the people that have seen the first season2 thumbs up! and flows well with the rhythm of the anime itself, and later on in the anime this also becomes apparent during the fight scenes where you see shana's flame and  wind effects which in my opinion challange animations from kyoto animationsSoundnot much to say here, the music overall is very good throughout, creating ideal moods for the relevant situations in the anime. only disappointing thing is that there is no new opening after episode 13!CharacterComapared to the first season, this time round the beginning of the anime is totally based on character development, the audience can feel more connected with the characters, and they see quite alot of &quot;slice of life&quot;. you know eating, drinking, socialising, theme parks, school, w/e .Duriing this period you can really see shana and yoshida &quot;mature&quot; from the first season, instead of the constant bickering, they learn to understand each others situation and independantly try to gain yuji's love.in my own personal opinion, definately a bonus to see yuji learn to develop his skills at the beginning of each episode.

When it comes to action scenes this series can deliver some beautiful colours and some memorable attacks. Unfortunately they use cute-ish type character designs which often makes it hard to take some battles seriously, yes blood is included but its always left to the most brutal attacks which is often few and far between. Still animation on...a whole is impressive for a cute-ish style.SoundSound is pretty good no bad points here. Opening & Ending credits have decent songs not much to say really.StoryOne thing you will find consistent with all the reviews so far regarding this anime is the story has the lowest rating of all, why..because instead of bringing the story together and adding more pieces for understanding we get the exact opposite, MORE questions MORE lovey-duvey love rectangles and the icing on the cake NO resolution to any of these what-so-ever!The First quarter of this anime was like a totally different love shojo anime.The second quarter threw in some new twists/questions/random battlesThe third quarter was a mixture of the first and secondThe Last was a pointless built up bad guy which seemed like filler for Shana 3?Finally you have what seems like a rushed and unresolved ending…seesh!CharacterCharacters are somewhat interesting and do have potential. I liked the fact that you found out more about some of the other characters in this series which gave them more depth.I felt that most of the characters got more development and gained a little smudge of depth but a lot of it was tied up with love problems and figuring out their feelings for each other which made this series go off-balance genre wise.EnjoymentEnjoyment…..honestly……..very littleValueIf you enjoyed the flashy fighting scenes that made shana lovable the first time around you will get more of the same but i personally feel that this second series was a big drag-on with an extra added layer of love shojo theme which brought the potential shana had down quite a few notches, I mean there was many times I hit the fast-forward button just to see if my predictions of how things would turn out where true and on a episode by episode basis i was unpleasantly NOT surprised.Planet Tyro Rating: Low Watchableplanettyro.com a whole is impressive for a cute-ish style.SoundSound is pretty good no bad points here.

The general plot of the series follows Sakai Yuji, a torch (a replacement spirit of sorts for those who have already died) who possesses the rare Reiji Maigo (an item that replenishes Yuji's existence everyday so he doesn't burn out), and Shana, a Flame Haze (whose job is to keep the balance of existence from being blown out of proportions) as they discover evil plots devised by otherworldly invaders called Guze no Tomogara along with their...human and Flame Haze allies.Story: The second season of Shakugan no Shana focuses on what the Reiji Maigo really is and its origins as well as the mysterious Silver that Margery Daw (a Flame Haze ally of Shana's) is searching for. The villains of the first season, Bal Masque, return again in more devious plots to steal the Reiji Maigo.The plot starts off extremely slow for the first 10 episodes or so. It focused more on useless fillers and character development until it hits around episode 12 or so, where the plot finally starts revealing some information that everybody has been asking. I was tempted to give this a lower score but seeing as how epic the story turned out in the second half, it stays high.Art: The character designs are as expected from J.C. Staff and the effects are just simply amazing. From the revamped Fuzetsu to the spell insignias that Margery draws out, everything just looks superb in HD.Sound: The soundtrack pretty much remains the same as the first season but it does include several new pieces. It fits the mood of each scenario very well as well a few insert songs here and there. The OP/ED are superb works from Mami Kawada and Kotoko. Although personally, I didn't like the OP/ED that Kotoko has provided for this season.Character: Character development is most likely the show's strongest point here. From the main protagonist Yuji to the nearly non-existant Ike, everybody has their fair share of development, even if it's only a little. The love triangle of Yuji/Shana/Yoshida remains ever present and strong and they finally mature enough to get past their little squabbles. Keisaku and Eita also matures which also leads to confessions to other certain characters. Plenty of change going around so to speak.Enjoyment/Overall: The first half of the show was just plain slow and boring. It definitely redeems itself for the second half when we finally get to see the motives of the villains and shocking revelations and twists. Excellent show for action and romance. Although the ending seemed a tad bit rushed, it is still worthy of a nice looking 9.

(The reason for that is unknown.)Well, this time the story was glib. Over the half of the series only dealt with the Love-Triangle from season 1 and the schoolform of Master Throne Hecate, Fumina Konoe. (Well, it actually isn't a spoiler. You can tell it with...a brain of a six years old child, that Fumina Konoe is Hecate.). Though, the last part of the show was extremely rushed, especially in the last two episodes I got extremely disappointed because the second opening promised a lot of wonderful fights, but in the end you only got one really good fight. The end was almost the same as in season one, so nothing to wright hope about. Only some flashbacks and subplots were a bit interesting, but again nothing too amazing.Animation: 9/10The animations are well-made like in the first season. When you finally get some fight-scenes to watch, it's really worth the time you spent with the annoying filler. Silver fire looks like real silver and a tornado looks like you would be sucked in by it everytime you see it. The characters are good like always, same with the backgrounds.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack is nice, but for my taste, too many of the new themes are calm and happy. Instead of using new themes for sadness and like, they used the themes from season one. It's not a bad point, but it seems a bit unimaginative. :/The seiyuus are good, especially Shana's expressions are well spoken, so there isn't a lot to discuss here.Well, Mami Kawada again did a good job, but the OP &amp; ED KOTOKO provided, didn't fit too well with the show. The lyrics were ok, but the sound and the vocal were a bit too sweet in my opinion.Character: 7/10Well, the characters develop a lot here. Shana and Kazumi aren't brawling like in season one anymore. They learn to accept each other and become friendly. Every single character developes in season two, even the supporter(there are some exceptions though). The annoying things here are the new characters. Especially Fumina Konoe is a waste of time. She simply is a poor copy of Hecate that simply disappears around halfway the show. The introduction of beautiful whim Pheles was also only for story purpose. In the opening she looked interesting, but she turned out to be only a hunter of her lover Johan. In almost every scene, she mentions her beloved Johan at least once. With time, this gets REALLY annoying.Enjoyment: 5/10I enjoyed the second season only partly, because of the quantity of fillers.The fight scenes in the end were really good, but too short. Furthermore the OPs promised too much.Overall: 7/10Without the fillers and more story it would be more than mediocre. If you liked season one, you will like this season, too.

That way the story wll connect together and piece itself quite easily. (just a friendly reminder)!Shakugan no Shana II is a great anime to watch for those who wants action and some romance combined with it. Story revolves around the main characters Yuji, who is the male protagonist and is also the central character for the story's development. He is a Mystes, a dead sentient being who is kept alive with the power of existence (flame of life). He is also the most unusual...of the characters (this is due to the special artifact inside him, the reiji maigo that replenishes his power of existence every midnight). With this ability he can rejuvenate his life-force, and still live as an ordinary citizen though he is actually dead in real-life.Shana, the female protagonist is also the main lead of the story and a kick-ass flame haze. (Flame Hazes are powerful individuals who work under a secretive organization known as &quot;Outlaw,&quot; and the flame hazes' duty is to keep the world in balance by making sure powers of existence are still existent on the planet.) She is a powerful fighter who wields a flame sword (nietono no shana). FYI: Shana was named after her sword by Yuji. Her job is to fulfill her duties as a flame haze while protecting Yuji, the bearer of the reiji maigo, although it is revealed she is harboring strong conceptual feelings for him later in the story. (Romance kicks in)!Story: 8/10Not a bad story, but needs more development in the central plot. It seemed very rushed at certain points of the episodes, but decent storyline was put in play.Art: 9/10Nicely done artwork. Its not too heavily pixelated but the characters had some i guess watercolored features which is actually good because it provides deeper textures in the background of the city and the environment. Characters looked very traditional, and fashioned with good works of art.Sound: 10/10This is where Shakugan no Shana deserves the praise and admonition as an anime series!! Songs are performed by Japanese band artist Mami Kawada, and her songs are killer-good! EX: Hishoku no Sora (intro song)-this was intro from first season, Triangle, and Joint from second season ending theme song. All songs performed by Mami Kawada. Perfect 10/10 for masterpiece in soundtrack!Characters: 10/10This falls somewhat in the category of the artwork I described, but the characters overall in general have great features. Characters voice acting was performed well, and many of them had loveable personalities/characteristics. The only character I found irritating was that annoying, obnoxious nutty professor who always seems to get his plans ruined by the flame hazes.Enjoyment: 10/10I loved it. It was similar to my enjoyment of Fate Stay Night, but nowhere as near as good. Gets a 10 for satisfaction for viewer audience, and the rewatch value I'd have to say is pretty high in my books.Overall: 9/10Great anime series!

Basically, Shana and yuji continue to fight a lot of enemies that want the reiji maigo, and in the process they find a lot about its meaning. Between the fights, there are some episodes where relations between the characters are the main focus.As i said, its good, but i prefer the one from the 1st season..Art (9.0) - No big differences between the first season and the...second season. Well, the op/ed and some details look diferent, but no more than that, so i give it the same as i give to the 1st season.Sound(7.8) - Sound is a little better... this time the op and ed are better (in my opinion) , still nothing special, but enough better for me to pass from a 7 in the 1st season, to an 8 in the 2nd.Characther (8.3) - Well develloped, looking cool (some of them), but not much different from the first season, although this time a litle better but not enough to give it a 9.enjoyment (7.7) - Well, in the end it surely gets interesting, but the first part of the series was not so interesting as it should be..lots of episodes were basically just talking and little action...in the final it gets a lot better, true, but in overall, the 1st season is better in this aspect. But dont misunderstand me, its a nice series, i give it and 8, but its an 8 closer to a 7 ..(the 1st i gave 8 close to an 9)Overall (8.4) - Well, my opinion, basically is more of the same from the 1st season..in that aspect i think the producers should have done something better, but this one is also ok. However, i give this one an 8 instead of a 9 because story and enjoyment were not so good, and in some moments it gave me the idea the 1st was much better..well, in overall thats not true, but the mains point is that the diference between both is not big, but if there is 1 to be the best its the 1st season. second season.

I reviewed the First season of the show not long ago and it didn't do all to great from me but well enough to make me want to move on to the second season. The second seasons starts with the same issues that plagued the first season, it was really slow, the pacing of the show was really poor but what i will say in defense of the show is that as you go on toward the end of the season you begin to understand why they spent so much time in the first half of the season developing the relationship between characters but you could have had the same effect and only took up 3 episodes rather than 12. It was that slow at the beginning i nearly dropped the show but my love for Kugimiya, Rie as a voice actor kept me going strong.Alright i spoke about the slow pacing of the first half but once it hits the half way mark it goes 0 - 60 in two seconds. In fact to quote Marchosias (a supporting charater within the show) 'Damn all these things happening one after another. I cant keep up with it all'. That really does say it all. It goes from 12 episodes of filler and stuff that was really uninteresting to holy shit whats going to happen next, how did this happen, why is this happen. The latter half of the show is the saving grace of the show by a long shot. I feel like the show would have been better if A) it was a 14 episode season or B) they started the action around episode 6 and developed the action scenes a little more because they felt rushed at times and there was some much more they could have done if they gave themselves a little more time on the action.As for the characters my opinion has really stayed the same from my first review, ill give you the short version, Shana is still badass, Yoshida, Kazumi adds that extra twist and tension to the show, though as i said before pretty predicable how that 'love triangle' is going to turn out. Now my opinion of Sakai, Yuuji has changed a little. He is still a very good male lead and he's easy to follow and get behind, but in season two we finally see some weakness from Yuuji which was good to see, the second season did a great job of bringing Yuuji to the realization of the scale of the job that lies before him. Its not like he has a simple walk in the part ahead.Alright the ending don't worry i keep these spoiler free, talk about an anti climax. We see one of the arc's in the show end around episode 18 leaving 6 or so episodes to go, meaning that there is always something going to happen and its going to be big and you wouldn't be wrong. The previous episodes were action packed and filled with thrills, the last 6 episodes don't disappoint for the most part but again it just felt rushed. How it was going to play out was pretty obvious thanks to the 12 episodes of development we were forced to endure and it really just fell flat right at the end, i honestly though that the ending would be play'd out in a film or something because there was so much that could happen in the last 10 minutes of the show but nothing really super exciting happens. In the end it is all wrapped up with a semi neat bow on top, my reason behind 'semi' is there were a few unanswered question that i assume are going to answered in the third season. If the pattern stay's turn then i can already make out the outlines of how the shows going to finish and i haven't even started season 3 yet.So the big question, Should you watch this show? My answer if you made it though season 1 and are questioning watching season two, Do it, just grit your teeth and get though the first half of the season because the latter half is well worth it. I give the first half of the show a lot of flack but the fact is it was sort of necessary to fully understand the edge but as i said it could have done with being shorter.Hope my review was helpfulMurphy -Could have been Seen as boring form the start-Ending was a little anti climatic-Similar to First Season, A bit predicableMy OpinionAlright here goes nothing, i literally finish the second season of Shakugan No Shana maybe 5 minutes ago so this is as fresh as it gets.

But I saw season 3's first episode. Ahhhh, I wish I hadn't seen that episode, Yuuji has evolved again and I thought he couldn't be any worse than what he had been but now omg I can't describe this, this level is beyond words. I should have known that this was coming anyways, the way Yuuji...is introduced, it was kinda fishy and abnormal as if it was purposefully made to be hated and now that he is the antagonist it explains all.Anyways, Shakugan no Shana II started off with Yuuji revealing that he did not hear Shana's confession at the end of first season, it was a powerful start to the series but I did not lose hope knowing that the series is long so she has the chance to do that later and then somewhere around episode 12 her confession gets disturbed again. As I continued I noticed how Yuuji's behavior did not change at all and constantly gets saved by Shana and did nothing in return although he got stronger and able to spar with Shana during training but that is only during TRAINING. When confronted with enemies trying to steal his reiji maigo he only stood still and shouted waiting for someone to come and help him and that was when I finally realize why I could watch this series continuously without running out of stamina, at first I thought I was addicted to this series and that I wanted to see Shana in action but now I understand that it is more than that, the main reason was because I wanted to see Yuuji redeem himself and realize what kind of person he is already. I wanted to see him protecting Shana in return or do something for her in return but then Yoshida joining the party made the situation even worse, he could barely handle Shana alone and now Yoshida takes up her screen time even more and I was starting to lose hope in this boy.Suddenly, Yuuji finally rose in like the last few episodes and saying great edgy things making Shana proud and finally ends with a happy cliffhanger. My overall score from 7/10 rose to 9/10 immediately just from those few episodes which made me feel relaxed knowing that the continuous fighting/uprising of problems is finally ending and I can calmly enjoy the peaceful episodes that will be presented to me in the third season.I really wanted to put this series into my favorite list but it did not reach that level yet, season 2 was close but there were too many disappointing episodes than the good episodes. I really hope that season 3 can make it and that first episode is just something irrelevant to the main story. is introduced, it was kinda fishy and abnormal as if it was purposefully made to be hated and now that he is the antagonist it explains all.Anyways, Shakugan no Shana II started off with Yuuji revealing that he did not hear Shana's confession at the end of first season, it was a powerful start to the series but I did not lose hope knowing that the series is long so she has the chance to do that later and then somewhere around episode 12 her confession gets disturbed again.

I really hope that season 3 can make it and that first episode is just something irrelevant to the main story."", 'Generally, the sequel of a successful series, or any series for that matter, falls short of the fame attained by its predecessor. For the first half or so of the second season of Shakugan no Shana, I must say that I was slightly disappointed with the content. However, by the end of it, I believe that season two has more or less achieved the same level of success as season one. With that being said, there were some differences - both good and bad - between the two seasons. As with all second seasons, I tend to raise my expectations and score them more critically....Art (7/10)Despite airing two years after season one, the animation quality has not improved as much as I expected. The backgrounds still had that less-than-real feel to them and the lack of detail in the characters disappointed me the second time around. Still, like in the first season, the battle scenes stood out from the rest of the mediocre animation. A phrase that describes this season\'s animation could be: season one\'s animation in 720p.Characters (8/10)Last season, Yūji was totally useless, save for a few situations. Those who hope for the supposed ""main protagonist"" to play more of a role in the second season do get what they want. The development that Yūji undergoes in this series is astounding. However, most of it happens in such a short amount of time that many wonder about the sudden change in personality. Honestly, this was the first time where I questioned the benefits of character development. As for the other characters, I felt that the slow first half was necessary in order to give them the development needed to make the second half successful. As far as I can tell, Shana, Kazumi, Keisaku, Wilhelmina and Margery were greatly developed over the course of this series - some to a greater extent than others. One point of criticism I would like to make is that the lack of new characters disappointed me. True, one may argue that this may cause some unnecessary confusion, but I believe that adding more characters adds a sense of ""freshness"" to the season, allowing it to distinguish itself further from its predecessor (i.e. preventing the ""this seems so familiar"" thought from surfacing in the audience\'s minds).Sound (7/10)Understandably, the BGM and seiyūs of the first season are the same for the second season. With that being said, the only parts left to judge in this category are the OPs and EDs. Starting off with the OPs, I felt the first OP, ""JOINT"", was much better in terms of preparing one for the episode to come when compared to the second OP, ""BLAZE."" Like ""Hishoku no Sora"" (season one\'s OP), ""JOINT"" is also sung by Kawada Mami and it delivers the same sense of intensity that I enjoyed. Unfortunately, KOTOKO\'s ""BLAZE"" wasn\'t up to par with its season one counterpart, ""being"", and left me missing ""JOINT."" Moving on to the EDs, both were decent, just like in season one. Overall, this season\'s sounds were generally on par with last season\'s.Story (8/10)Honestly, I wanted to drop the series during the first half because of how slow the story was moving. When I first started to watch Shakugan no Shana, I expected a good dose of action with a pinch of romance/slice-of-life to spice things up; not the other way around. If I had wanted a romance or slice-of-life story, then I would obviously go watch a romance or slice-of-life anime. However, I am glad that I decided to stick with it and continue my way through the show. As the story started to pick up in the second half, I was instantly reminded of why I liked season one. The cliffhangers and twists really entertained me and it was good to know that there\'s a season three as I finished the last episode. It\'s surprising how a story can be this long and still be interesting.Overall (8/10)Two seasons down, one more to go. A generally successful second season leaves me with both doubts and hopes for the third. If given the choice between the first or second season, I would have to choose the first, simply because it entertained me throughout. This is not to say that season two was not good; it was just not as good as season one. Those who watched season one and enjoyed it will probably feel the same way about season two. Now it\'s now off to the third and final season of Shakugan no Shana! Art (7/10)Despite airing two years after season one, the animation quality has not improved as much as I expected.

As for the other characters, I felt that the slow first half was necessary in order to give them the development needed to make the second half successful. As far as I can tell, Shana, Kazumi, Keisaku, Wilhelmina and Margery were greatly developed over the course of this series - some to a greater extent than others. One point of criticism I would like to make is that the lack of new characters disappointed me. True, one may argue that this may cause some unnecessary confusion, but I believe that adding more characters adds a sense of ""freshness"" to the season, allowing it to distinguish itself further from its predecessor (i.e. preventing the ""this seems so familiar"" thought from surfacing in the audience\'s minds).Sound (7/10)Understandably, the BGM and seiyūs of the first season are the same for the second season. With that being said, the only parts left to judge in this category are the OPs and EDs. Starting off with the OPs, I felt the first OP, ""JOINT"", was much better in terms of preparing one for the episode to come when compared to the second OP, ""BLAZE."" Like ""Hishoku no Sora"" (season one\'s OP), ""JOINT"" is also sung by Kawada Mami and it delivers the same sense of intensity that I enjoyed. Unfortunately, KOTOKO\'s ""BLAZE"" wasn\'t up to par with its season one counterpart, ""being"", and left me missing ""JOINT."" Moving on to the EDs, both were decent, just like in season one. Overall, this season\'s sounds were generally on par with last season\'s.Story (8/10)Honestly, I wanted to drop the series during the first half because of how slow the story was moving. When I first started to watch Shakugan no Shana, I expected a good dose of action with a pinch of romance/slice-of-life to spice things up; not the other way around. If I had wanted a romance or slice-of-life story, then I would obviously go watch a romance or slice-of-life anime. However, I am glad that I decided to stick with it and continue my way through the show. As the story started to pick up in the second half, I was instantly reminded of why I liked season one. The cliffhangers and twists really entertained me and it was good to know that there\'s a season three as I finished the last episode. It\'s surprising how a story can be this long and still be interesting.Overall (8/10)Two seasons down, one more to go. A generally successful second season leaves me with both doubts and hopes for the third. If given the choice between the first or second season, I would have to choose the first, simply because it entertained me throughout. This is not to say that season two was not good; it was just not as good as season one. Those who watched season one and enjoyed it will probably feel the same way about season two. Now it\'s now off to the third and final season of Shakugan no Shana!', ""=-= Shakugan no Shana Second =-=Story : 8/10Well, unlike the first season, this one is focused on developing the characters more. Perhaps,too much.The first half of the show is mostly fillers.It actually reminded me of Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien.But, I suppose it wasn't that bad, because we got to know some of the characters' past and the sorts. BUT, the second half of the show kinda made up for it, because it was a lot better. It was almost as good as the first season....Art : 9/10The art is almost flawless in my opinion.Great graphics, characters are drawn nicely, as well as the environments. Not to mention the fighting effects such as the fuzetsu visual effect, the auras of the characters and all of that.Still it's not perfect, as I've seen a few series a tad better at this chapter.Sound : 10/10This is where in my opinion, the show shines. The first opening is one of my favorite openings of all time. The insert songs such as the &quot;dramatic&quot; violin tune are excellent. The second opening...not that good, but the first one was awesome. The voices represent the characters perfectly. The first ending was great as well (for an ending).The second one wasn't that good, but it did the job.Character : 8/10The characters seemed a bit stereotypical to me.Like Shana being a &quot;spoiled&quot; kid, Yuji a guy that doesn't know when to give up and doesn't accept things as they come that easily, Wilhelmina being the somewhat cold-hearted &quot;parent&quot;/maid-wearing person(P.S. I hate Wilhelmina) etc.My favorite character from this series, as well as from the first season is Tanaka.He rocks, and he's hilarious at some points.He knew what he wanted to do with his life and put everything aside, in order to achieve his goal.He's also not stereotypical.Enjoyment : 7/10The first season kept me watching it from episode 1 to 12 the first day I started it and the rest of it the next day.Well...to be honest, after seeing the first two episodes (which ruled), I thought it was gonna be that enjoyable until the end.But when the romance-school life thing came in (not that I don't like those kinds of anime, but I wasn't expecting it from this show), I kinda forced myself to watch it, 'cause I don't usually drop anime, unless they suck badly or they become extremely boring.But after the first chunk of episodes, it became fun to watch and worth spending the time to do so.Overall : 8/10Overall it was a good series, but I think that when I'll remember Shakugan no Shana, the first season will pop up in mind,because, in my opinion it was better than this one.Usually second seasons are better, but in this case it wasn't like that.Still, I don't want to make it sound like I didn't enjoy watching this one too.

It was good.Fun to watch at some points."", ""Alright let me just say that of the majority of anime I watched this was probably my tenth biggest disappointment ever in anime history not because the idea sucked but because the implication of the idea was half-assed (no other way to describe it). The first season while good left a lot of holes and unanswered questions I was fine with that at first because I knew there was going to be a second season where I expected to at least have some of my questions answered but no instead I got a bunch of filler (dang it if I wanted filler I'd just watch...bleach or naruto). The story did very little advancing and worst of all failed to answer any of the important questions. Luckily for us there's going to most likely be a third season (hopefully this time they don't just half-ass it and actually get to the point). If I don't read the manga to this and get an organized story I'll beat my head in with 2x4. Now that that's out of the way let's get to some quality looks at it.Story- As far the story that this anime is supposed to follow it's really good some people have underestimated it and called it just a beat em as they come storyline but in fact that's not entirely true villains are reoccurring and do not always die after the first encounter with them and the plots are pretty deep. The only problem with the story is that it's not organized at all (at least in the anime) things are choppy and thrown in and there are tremendous amounts of filler that take away from the story. *sigh* When will people learn to just stick to a dang storyline and not smear it with fecal matter until it becomes repulsive.Art- As far as art goes I was impressed this series is very well drawn the only critique I have is that sometimes the animation didn't flow right.Sound- Sounds are interesting to say the least not all of them are good but for the most part the sounds will match a situation. My favorite part is that the same person who voices Shana is the same person who voices Louise in Zero no Tsukaima (it made me smile every time she talked).Character- This anime did a decent job with character development I mean it's not like I needed to know about more than the main characters to begin with but hey who cares if you want to spend an entire episode focused on a character nobody cares about far be it from me to kick you down for it.Enjoyment- I was disappointed to say the least I expected great things from this anime when I first started watching it but as it progressively went on it became like that new shirt you thought planned on wearing until it was stained with ketchup (i.e-filler). I enjoyed battles in this as most were pretty interesting and I even enjoyed the romance aspect of it which is strange because at first I found the romance to be kind of annoying. So my advice is if you watched the first season just go ahead and watch the second season chances are if you like one you like the other. bleach or naruto).

The whole devlopment of yuji is great I believe and other characters start to bloom  more like yoshida because she finally starts to take a stand. The story kinda failed when focus so much on the bad guy when she was in the same school as yuji. This story I think though is setting up for season 3 because other than Yuji becoming stronger nothing really new happens.Art: Same thing as the first one, its really good...for its style. Go go good budgets right? The visuals were great and the fighting was vibrant but still the purple bear, BECOME MORE VICIOUS LOOKING!!!Sound: Everything flowed well except for Shana's voice. I didn't like her voice in the last one and I didn't like it in this one especially when complaining to yuji. The only good thing about her voice though is that she doesn't say &quot;Shut up&quot;x3 as much, which I personally thought was nerve wracking.Characters: Great as before except everyone as a whole grew....yes even detestable shana (she becomes more tolerable, kinda). I think the biggest growth though was Yuji's and Yoshida's. I especially liked Yoshida's growth and how she supports Yuji emotionally when he needs it. I think if she had Shana's power she would be ideal for Yuji, but that just wouldn't be fair for Shana right? Yoshida does offer a lot of emotional parts which I thought was great when dealing with Yuji. While his character doesn't change too much, Yuji becomes more reliable which is huge I think. Shana's growth is small. She still is too headstrong and very annoying when it comes to YujiIt did kinda bug me that Yoshida had to opportunity to become great by sacrificing herself OR turning into a flame herself OR whatever that trinket did, and actually become something great but instead acts like &quot;I'll Use it to SAVE HIM....nah, @#$% it I'll wait....&quot;Enjoyment: Same as the last series everything was enjoyable EXCEPT when it came to shana's voice and when it came to shana/yuji relationship time. SHana's voice drove me up the walls and her being too headstrong is nerve wracking which turned me off to the anime BUT her fighting in the anime was very cool.Overall: Putting aside Shana, this season is a great continuation to the series BUT completely useless because other than Yuji becoming stronger, Yoshida becoming more bold, and the explanation of the Reiji Maigo (I forgot if thats how you spell it) NOTHING HAPPENS.Same as the first one too, I would recommend it if you had nothing else too watch. for its style.

All of the characters introduced in season one are involved, and just as important. The plot is fresh, and brings forth even more dangers.I didn\'t start watching the English dub until episode 17, and I can honestly say the soundtrack is just as great as the Japanese. Justin Cook (Alastor), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Margery Daw), and Kent Williams (Marcosias) were a pleasant surprise to my ears, to hear voice actors from Funimation come into roles that they fit so well. I really did...love this.The story was almost perfect. The only things I dislike was Yuji Sakai\'s new-found rebellion in the series. It seemed that he slowly becoming a character that annoyed me. I am not sure if this is supposed to be the case, but I found myself shifting to want to see more Margery Daw near the end. Yuji does become a better character in terms of use, as a Mystes, but he also gains a new attitude that set me off.Shana is just as loveable, and I didn\'t hate on Yoshida Kazumi as much. In fact, the series made me love characters that I once hated. I really did enjoy the first eight episodes being about school life. The anime became more slice of life, and the plot came into play near the middle of the series.

There are battles taking place that we cannot see, between the protectors of balance and those who want to destroy everyone living on this planet. That's the basic premise of this show and there's not much more to it than that. Shakugan no Shana Second is incredibly basic when it comes to the setup, but it delivers an experience unique to itself.First thing anyone should know is that this series is the direct sequel to the first series, Shakugan no Shana. It is highly recommended to watch that before watching this series. The first series explains terms and...sets up the characters for this series and a viewer will be much less confused as to what's happening because this series derives directly from what happened in the first series.That being said, if someone's already seen the first series, then they know the story of Shakugan no Shana Second already, for the most part. Nothing's changed from series to series. Yuji Sakai is still a Torch and a Myste, and Shana is still a Flame Haze. Together, they are tasked in killing Crimson Denizens (Guze no Tomogara) who live in the Crimson Realm, the parallel universe that lies directly on top of the human world. There is little change to setup and the second series continues this trend. As expected then, most of the plot that drives the series along is focused on different Tomogara who show up at any given time and Sakai and Shana have to fight them off with assistance from their close friends.If you had any questions from the first series (you probably did) and were expecting answers. Well, the series may answer one or two, but you'll probably find yourself asking more questions by the end and you'll have to watch the next series to see if it answers your questions (It probably won't). There's not much more to add here other than the show does a good job of continuing what was started before and it introduces new plots and ideas that certainly build on the old.But Shakugan no Shana never really was about the strong story, was it? The characters are what make this anime shine. All of your favorite characters are back. Margery Daw, Wilhelmina Carmel, Kazumi Yoshida, Keisaku Satou, Eita Tanaka, Hayato Ike, and Matake Ogata all share a large portion of the show and the series mostly devotes its time developing these characters. Every character develops in their own way and that's the enjoyable part of this show. You find yourself attached to the characters as the anime goes on and as different situations happen, viewers become emotionally involved.That's where the strong point of Shakugan no Shana Second lies. The characters are all widely varied and they are all shown to have different thoughts and beliefs about what is happening in their lives. Different characters take different paths and not all of them are remotely close to what you might think they would do. Characters face turmoil and difficulty and are forced to make difficult choices. This makes the characters of Shakugan no Shana Second incredibly strong because the creators made sure to continue building them from the first series. They all change in some way or another and watching them change is the real  joy of this show. There is hardly a dull moment in the show as a viewer will care in some way about every single person on the screen at any given time.Animation is, of course, fantastic. All the characters are uniquely designed, every model looking different from the other. Fight scenes flow smoothly, and detail is incredibly high during intense moments. Shana's flame looks as detailed as it did the series prior. There are some moments where CGI is clearly used and it detracts heavily though.  It's usually in the middle of an intense sequence of events and completely throws off the feel of the moment, which is a shame. Other than that though, the only other issue is that the character's eyes are rather large and they seem slightly too far apart from one another, but after some time one gets used to it.The soundtrack is great as well. The soundtrack always sets the mood and accompanies scenes exactly right. During suspenseful action sequences, the music pumps out fast beats and matches the mood, while during a slow, emotional scene, the beats drop away to something more soft and quiet, drawing the viewer into the moment intimately.There's not much to be said negatively about Shakugan no Shana Second other than the rather disjointed plot that is really only there to drive the strong characterization of the characters. There's nothing deep or meaningful to be said in the story, but in reality, that doesn't matter in this show. Plot comes second to the strong characters that are the driving force behind what brings the viewers back. When a show can get a viewer to invest emotionally into its characters, then you know that a show is doing something right. sets up the characters for this series and a viewer will be much less confused as to what's happening because this series derives directly from what happened in the first series.That being said, if someone's already seen the first series, then they know the story of Shakugan no Shana Second already, for the most part.

Shana's flame looks as detailed as it did the series prior. There are some moments where CGI is clearly used and it detracts heavily though.  It's usually in the middle of an intense sequence of events and completely throws off the feel of the moment, which is a shame. Other than that though, the only other issue is that the character's eyes are rather large and they seem slightly too far apart from one another, but after some time one gets used to it.The soundtrack is great as well. The soundtrack always sets the mood and accompanies scenes exactly right. During suspenseful action sequences, the music pumps out fast beats and matches the mood, while during a slow, emotional scene, the beats drop away to something more soft and quiet, drawing the viewer into the moment intimately.There's not much to be said negatively about Shakugan no Shana Second other than the rather disjointed plot that is really only there to drive the strong characterization of the characters. There's nothing deep or meaningful to be said in the story, but in reality, that doesn't matter in this show. Plot comes second to the strong characters that are the driving force behind what brings the viewers back. When a show can get a viewer to invest emotionally into its characters, then you know that a show is doing something right."", ""Story:A continuation of the first seaon, Shakugan no Shana II, leaves us almost right where the first left off. This season covers more of the social aspects to the characters lives while still giving the intense battles (more in the latter part of the season) that we came to love in the first season.Art:The art is basically the same as last season with a few imporvements here and there.Sound:The first opening song for this season JOINT is by far one of my favorite songs ever and Blaze the second opening isn't bad.Character:This season focuses more on the character development that the previous season...does but not all the characters improve. Some actually get worse (if only for a short time period).Enjoyment:Its a good season.

MY REVIEW REMAINS THE SAME FOR SEASON ONE AND TWO, SO DON'T COMPLAIN!Well people we have come to another anime which is widely debated as either gold or fool's gold. Shakugan no Shana is all about a boy who meets up with a girl who poses supernatural powers. Then the boy discovers he has supernatural powers and begins utilizing it. Of course the two then start to realize their feelings for each other, but this only comes to light towards the end of season one and season two.Now I'll try to be neutral about this as much possible, I've seen the anime and...it's nothing special. The action was pretty good, but was often wrecked by the long dredge of the main characters' emotional problems. This anime's ending was also a little disappointing  with a cliff hanger ending coupled with a love triangle.Overall 8/10, just watch it. Nothing gained, nothing lost. it's nothing special.

First season was really good,there were a lot of fights, world building, character development. This season? Girls fighting for the MC, only 2 good fights, many things that appeared out of nowhere. Would you even consider this an action anime?Man, it felt like I was watching a generic slice of life.Art: 7/10This is the biggest improvement this season. The animation is slightly better and more detailed. It was a good surprise.Sound:9/10SNS still...excels here. Great OPs and good EDs.Character:7/10Probably,this is the best season in terms of character development. BUT, there are many characters that are useful for like,2 episodes. Sabrac was a good “villain”,but he came out of nowhere. Zarovee,too. Useless enemy. And,here is my biggest complain about this season. The “Konoe Arc”. God damn,this really is an annoying arc. There was no need to add that much forced drama and “romance”.Konoe was a BAD character, but like, REALLY BAD.Annoying,useless and stupid. I now she needed to exist so the plot can go on,but man, she was dumb.Enjoyment:6/10Slow-paced,boring,sometimes funny,but mostly annoying the way the implemented new characters or magic objects.Overall:6/10I’m not gonna lie, this season was boring.I even thought about dropping it. There was nothing that made me want to watch it during the Konoe Arc. After that arc it got kinda better but not too much.I am disappointed.I have huge expectations for the 3rd season. Hope the anime returns to the seriousness it had in the first season. The worst part about this season?You can’t not watch it cause there’s a lot of things you are not gonna understand the next season.Recommended:-Absolutely-Yes-Maybe->Meh(not recommended,but you need to watch it if you plan to keep watching this anime)-No-Complete trash-Bruh y u watching dis(Sorry for any English mistakes) excels here.

On the good side, you\'ll expect another season to continue the story. HOORAY! It\'s like ""It ends here.... for now, but SS doesn\'t end here"" if you get what I mean.The opening never fails. It really hypes you up to begin the episode. As you continue along, there might...be unexpected plot twists and the mood gets darker where MCs and other flame hazes get more serious as they strengthened their own powers and abilities. But after the twist, you\'ll be impressed how it\'ll all turn out as unexpected. The balance of the mood, roles of each characters and the development of each scenes is well-balanced (for me).I enjoyed a lot!!! The pairing of Yuji and Shana has been unleashed. LOTTA LOVE!!P.S I still don\'t understand Yoshida\'s role to be considered as MC -_- be unexpected plot twists and the mood gets darker where MCs and other flame hazes get more serious as they strengthened their own powers and abilities.

LOTTA LOVE!!P.S I still don\'t understand Yoshida\'s role to be considered as MC -_-', 'Okay, as always I want to preface my review with the three things I’m looking for in an anime: I want a really good story (+5), I want really good dialogue (characters/character development, etc.)(+3), and I want really good “technicals” (style, sound, etc.)(+2). Also, I’ll remind you my reviews generally encompass the whole series of an anime unless otherwise stated (That is to say that no more seasons are coming out). So let’s get to it!Shakugan no Shana… I feel that this anime had an enormous amount of potential. With a story revolving around the competing ’existences’, i.e. Flame Hazes vs. Crimson Denizens, who reside...on different planes of reality, the show hit’s the ground running with a really cool premise. Think about it, battles going on in an unseen world that you’ll never know about, yet the outcomes of which could and does effect your life in unimaginable ways. So much so that you could just be written out of existence! This was going to be the tragic fate of our protagonist, however, as it just so happens he’s not your everyday human. The story continues with his adventures trying to figure out his place now that this whole new unseen reality has been revealed to him. To me, that’s a goldmine of possibilities set up to work with.Earning 4 pointsHowever, the ending of this anime decides to throw all that in the garbage. Nearly the entirety of the last season is a mess of epic proportions. Instead of continuing with all the good things the first seasons had built up, the last season goes on its own into the wilderness of horrible endings. By introducing practically a whole new cast of characters, creating nonsensical plot drivers, and just plain ridiculous reasoning by the characters in terms of their decision making faculties, Shakugan no Shana goes out in a pyre of infamy. Frankly, I’m going to be watching it to appear on some top ten list of “Most Unexpected Anime Endings”, because I found it hard to swallow that something so good could become so bad.Deduction: -1.5 points----------------------------As for the dialogue and character development, I was quite pleased for the most part. The interactions and relationship between the protagonist and Shana were well executed and all in all, the characters were enjoyable. The romantic elements were handled to my liking, and, the protagonist does grow throughout the story as a character (as does Shana). There are some characters (especially towards the end) that are left high and dry in the character development department, but, all main characters have enough in my humble opinion to allow the story to progress relatively unhindered.Earning 2 points---------------------Technicals are solid. I truly enjoyed the entire OST of this anime, the style and animation were good too. No complaints.Earning 2 points---------------------Bonus points award goes to… having some really cool Flame Hazes out there! And some cool powers to come with them!Earning 1 point.--------------------Add it all up and we have a score of 7.5! If you want my advice, just watch the first two seasons only, then let your imagination make up what’s going to happen next. It’ll be better that way. Trust me, if I had done that, this anime would have been an 8.5 easy.As always, since I’m a critic, I’ll round down my score to a 7 because that’s just the way it goes. That way it’ll be better than expected when you watch it! Till next time on different planes of reality, the show hit’s the ground running with a really cool premise.

Shana was also about to have a rival in love too.But this was but a prelude of what was to come. New enemies, new allies, people whom you can't distinguish whether they're friend or foe.Yuuji decides that he can't let Shana fight on her own and so, with the help of the Specialist of Everything, he starts to wield the sword he gained from a previous enemy and learns how to fight so that Shana isn't alone.This...season was a lot more relaxed and was used to develop the characters a bit more but did enough to pump me up for the next season. season was a lot more relaxed and was used to develop the characters a bit more but did enough to pump me up for the next season."", 'A very disappointing season i would say.. there are  no new twist to it but rather a &quot;recycle&quot; of the first season. Toppled with pre-teen romance and ridiculous slice of life which brings this whole season down the garbage. As an experienced Otaku, i would say that only kids should be watching this. ', ""Shakugan no Shana was, at least in my opinion, a pretty good show – it had strong action and good characters.  I reviewed it previously (here: https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=287931) and most of what I had to say holds for Shakugan no Shana Second.  The difference is... there's a good deal less of the good stuff, and more of the mediocre stuff.  When we do get to the denizen-based action, it's really strong; the final arcs are possibly even better than the material in the original, but you have to sit through a lot of episodes of the teen drama with... not a ton of...stakes or a good handling of the characters involved.  It isn't terrible; certainly, there are still shows that focused on similar elements entirely and did worse than Shakugan no Shana Second does with its side dish here, but...Yeah, the show still manages to drag here.  And in that, it's weaker than its predecessor was.  Otherwise, they're fairly similar, new stories with the same characters and fairly similar stakes.  Is it worth watching though?  If you enjoyed Shakugan no Shana at all, absolutely!  For itself, it's... competent.  If you liked the first season, you'll find stuff to like here... but the more important part is that Final is coming.  As an entire package, the Shakugan no Shana series comes to what I consider to be an amazing conclusion, and Second is necessary to get there. stakes or a good handling of the characters involved.

I was expecting much of the same kind of action and plot and I got...meh. I felt like I was in a loop and the same thing was happening over and over and over. I know that this is common formula for a lot of shows in general, but I got bored and it felt really stale.Then came the last 10 episodes and it totally redeemed itself. It was absolutely what I needed to salvage this season. It's what I craved after the first season. The action and details and colors and...storyline we're all right on. It hit all the right points. I'm going to take a short break before I hit season 3. I think I need that spacer so I don't go in on a binge expectation like I had. I think that the binge is really a dangerous thing, a double-edged sword, if you will. There's cases where you can cover a lot of pleasure in a short period of time and then there are times like this that set me up with big expectations and it ruined it for me.

It does this by dropping all the action and only focusing on the love triangle between Yoshida, Shana and Yuiji which was beyond hard to watch. But at least near the end of the season you start to see more action and less Yoshida trying to steal Yuji.Animation 7/10The animation is pretty good its too bad it was wasted on slice of life drama anime for the first half.Sound 9/10Just as amazing as the last season.Story 4/10Honestly there is just to...much to complain about as I have already said the main chunk of this season was just focused on Yoshida trying to get Yuiji to notice her in the worst way possible. I also specifically remember this seen where Yuijis mother passes out and Shana runs to her in worry while Yoshidas first thought was to make them food to eat... Anyway the show gets  somewhat better around the middle of the anime but the final boss of the season is very forgettable. In my honest opinion I would just suggest you skip to season 3 as it is a lot better than this season where it felt like they just gave up.Enjoyment 4/10I could barely keep my self watching everything that I liked about the first season was not here. My enjoyment only kept going down as they introduced another love interest as if Yoshida wasn't already making me depressed enough.OverallIf you are a big fan of Shana and want more content then go ahead and watch it but if you are expecting something amazing you need to set your expectations lower. This season is mostly just drama over who Yuiji is gonna pick which ends up irrelevant anyway and makes Shana's character go down the drain. Anyway if you still want more Shana but don't wanna watch this snooze fest then just watch the last two minutes of the last episode of season 2 as that's all you really need too know too watch season 3 as things will be explained. much to complain about as I have already said the main chunk of this season was just focused on Yoshida trying to get Yuiji to notice her in the worst way possible.

It kind of felt as if the writers kept changing their minds about what is going to happen while they were releasing the episodes.  It begins with this love triangle that consists of almost all female characters. Konoe shows up and develops an obsession with Yuuji. Shana and Yoshida are inevitably upset that the second Konoe meets Yuuji they are spending all their time together and it seems like they have a thing going. So far so good, seems like it...is really going somewhere and that season 2 is going to be a love triangle. Fakeout! The second the parade went on you end up forgetting she exists, why? She gets replaced by Pheles the second she shows up. Konoe was interacting and around them nonstop then suddenly, she is gone. The next time we see her is when she gets sucked into Hecate. Now we have Pheles who is in love with Yuuiji's former self. Then shortly after we now have Tanaka sees Matake die, then right after they are lovers when the spell goes away. Seeing her die warrants him to want nothing to do with Margery because she accidentally killed Matake, then brought her back to life. Next we have that special seal in the middle of town. Now we see Yuuji thinking he is too cool to look after his mom and wants to run away with Shana. Next episode he stops looking at it like that. Yuuji! We didn't want to tell you this but you have an older brother All the while we have a character rolling up dressed up, having spikey hair. And then dies shortly after. Then Suddenly he isn't dead? And by this point, you've probably too confused to figure out what in the world is going on and stopped following. Big blue circle appears at the clock tower, Hecate shows up and steals Yuuji's heart. Funny that Yuuji puts no effort to stop her too. But it doesn't matter as he is still able to run around, and fight. Shorftly after he gets his heart back making it meaningless.Art 8/10The artwork isn't praise worthy, except it is not bad in anyway shape or form. For the most part it is what you would expect from any other anime.Sound 8/10Good voice actors that suit their characters. Audio is clear, and sound effects are goodCharacter 4/10Don't expect there we be any character development in this season as there is not much. And the characters become annoying, Tanaka is all about avoiding Margery because he doesn't want to risk her getting hurt. Not like that matters though as in the fights are full of explosions that end out destroying the cities multiple times. Satou's dialogue consists of him trying to figure out whether or not he wants to be in outlaw or not. Yoshida is just way too predictable, she is always talking about Yuuji and her love for him. Margery alcohol, talking about her grudge for the silver flame, talking like a complete know it all, and then asking if there is alcohol, I'm surprised she is not dead by now from liver failure or alcohol poisoning. Then the rest of the characters are okay, but don't be mistaken, okay is not the same as good.Enjoyment 4/10For the most part. you will find yourself sitting through the episodes and losing interest.

The second season brought a lot more emotion and drama that actually had me crying my eyes out at one point for three episodes straight. If you have already watched the first season, you should already have a good idea what's happening in this anime so I won't spend my time explaining about the details. But overall, it was a 7/10. The only thing that bothered me this season was to how oblivious...the main male protagonist was towards all the girls that shared feelings for him, otherwise, I think you should give it a chance :) the main male protagonist was towards all the girls that shared feelings for him, otherwise, I think you should give it a chance :)"", 'They are so back! When the season 1 was more of an introduction to the series, this season brings out the whole greatness of the series.There’s a long review coming……………About the STORYThe story is even better when plots are revealed. The mysteries and a lot of questions about the story are almost all answered. You are amaze even more with how the story unfolds. Let’s not forget how original and unique the story is, which make this series stands out a lot from others. From plot to terminologies to naming the characters, it is such refreshment. All this originalities makes me wonder if this...is my first time watching an anime.About the CHARACTERSOf course, the characters are also even better. Almost all the characters mature in this sequel. And because of that the relationship of characters are better. All the Flame Hazes are in good terms, the classmates are closer, Yuji and Shana’s relationship are improving, and even Shana is in good relationship with her rival Kazumi. Yuji’s family is also express more. But the most amazing are the maturity of the characters of Yuji and Shana. If Yuji seemed so weak not only physically but also personality wise in the previous season, Yuji’s character is way likeable and better in this season. He trains in combat in a more serious way and with a better resolve. And because of that, he becomes stronger and more capable in combat plus he is genius when it comes to strategies which make him more capable among the Flame Hazes. His personality matures also although he can still be so dense with regards the feelings of the girls around him. Shana on the other hand, in season one was somewhat irritating because her naivety led to a lot of misunderstandings but in this sequel, Shana becomes a lot human like and understands more with the things around her including her true feelings with Yuji. And so she can make her judgment of her own and make decisions in her own way. I still love her cute gesture of saying “URUSAI (Shut up!)”. Both of them are more likeable and memorable that can compete head on with the most amazing characters among animes of today.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDWith not much of a gap between the time the season one ended, the animation of this season is not that different but you can still see the little growth of it. The visual effects and graphics are one of the best nowadays. The fight scenes are also so exciting because it is made so great. The soundtracks and music are even better which is well incorporated with every scene. It gives an amazing final touch to every episode.With almost everything way even better from the previous one, it is no doubt that the sequel is a sure hit. Well, sequels are always should be better, if not no one will appreciate it let alone the previous season. This is one of those very few series that I just so want to see in anime form even more. Hopefully, it will continue like the animes that are very famous today which are still airing until now. is my first time watching an anime.About the CHARACTERSOf course, the characters are also even better. Almost all the characters mature in this sequel. And because of that the relationship of characters are better. All the Flame Hazes are in good terms, the classmates are closer, Yuji and Shana’s relationship are improving, and even Shana is in good relationship with her rival Kazumi. Yuji’s family is also express more. But the most amazing are the maturity of the characters of Yuji and Shana. If Yuji seemed so weak not only physically but also personality wise in the previous season, Yuji’s character is way likeable and better in this season. He trains in combat in a more serious way and with a better resolve. And because of that, he becomes stronger and more capable in combat plus he is genius when it comes to strategies which make him more capable among the Flame Hazes. His personality matures also although he can still be so dense with regards the feelings of the girls around him. Shana on the other hand, in season one was somewhat irritating because her naivety led to a lot of misunderstandings but in this sequel, Shana becomes a lot human like and understands more with the things around her including her true feelings with Yuji. And so she can make her judgment of her own and make decisions in her own way. I still love her cute gesture of saying “URUSAI (Shut up!)”. Both of them are more likeable and memorable that can compete head on with the most amazing characters among animes of today.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDWith not much of a gap between the time the season one ended, the animation of this season is not that different but you can still see the little growth of it. The visual effects and graphics are one of the best nowadays. The fight scenes are also so exciting because it is made so great. The soundtracks and music are even better which is well incorporated with every scene. It gives an amazing final touch to every episode.With almost everything way even better from the previous one, it is no doubt that the sequel is a sure hit. Well, sequels are always should be better, if not no one will appreciate it let alone the previous season. This is one of those very few series that I just so want to see in anime form even more. Hopefully, it will continue like the animes that are very famous today which are still airing until now.', ""I don't know why I keep watching _Shakugan no Shana_. It's not that great - Shana is a good character design, yes, but that kind of tsundere was done much better in _Toradora_ and the supernatural action is as unmotivated as the _Darker Than Black_ animes but more repetitive. If I could stop myself or someone else from wasting time on it, I would; but at least with season 2, I think serial boredom has finally convinced me to not look for the next series and find something better rather than keep hating myself for watching (Now I can start watching _The Tatami Galaxy_ guilt-free....Much better series.) Much better series.)"", 'This sequel manages to maintain the positive impression left by its predecessor, despite featuring elements that would typically irk me.Character development sees Shana and Yuji grappling with their feelings, while supporting characters like Margery Daw receive substantial backstory and growth. New additions like Fumina Konoe inject fresh dynamics into the ensemble, though the persistent love triangle subplot can feel tiresome.Plot-wise, it takes its time to unfold, with a significant portion dedicated to slice-of-life high school antics before delving into the overarching narrative involving the Midnight Lost Child. While the focus shifts from battling crimson denizens to internal conflicts and character revelations, pacing issues and continuity...lapses hinder the storytelling.The animation quality holds up well for a 2007 anime, especially when viewed in HD. Although occasional dips in background image quality are noticeable, they don\'t detract significantly from the overall experience. Character designs, while somewhat generic, are executed competently, with notable effort put into outfit design. Surprisingly, fan service is kept to a minimum, defying expectations associated with the ecchi genre.The soundtrack, particularly the opening theme ""JOINT,"" impresses with its energetic J-rock/pop fusion. The music throughout the series is aptly utilized, complementing various scenes effectively.Despite its flaws, Shakugan no Shana II offers an engaging continuation for fans of the first season, with expanded lore, character development, and a departure from conventional action tropes. While not without its shortcomings, it\'s a worthwhile watch for those invested in the series. lapses hinder the storytelling.The animation quality holds up well for a 2007 anime, especially when viewed in HD.

Gotta say, they resolve 1 issue, the emotion part, which fits for romance genre but it is hardly romantic. There are more major fights but it is quite a rush for the final arc, only 3 episode. They add more mystery to Reiji Maigo (dunno right spelling).It has a rush ending so hopefully there is one more season but it depends on the mangaka whether the manga has finish or not. ']"
Seitokai Yakuindomo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8675/Seitokai_Yakuindomo,"[""-This review has been updated after all the episodes were aired, and was first written while the show was airing.  It is meant to help the reader determine if it is worthwhile watching an episode or two to form their own opinions.-Seitokai Yakuindomo is a school comedy with little or no relevant story that focuses largely on verbal adult humor, generally avoiding visual adult humour. As with most shows of this genre, it isn’t mind-blowing or beautiful – throughout the show I found myself noticing little aspects that the show could have done without.However, at the end of the each episode, I looked...back and realized that I had laughed throughout. I had realized that the show may not be spectacular, but it was funny. The randomness and quick pacing of the humor is vital to the show's appeal, and the show begins to settle into a quick, smooth pace after a few episodes.What is important to note is that this humor will not be for everyone, and after two episodes the viewer should be able to decide whether or not they enjoy the type of humor enough to continue on with the show.Artwork & Sound: Average; nothing worth highlighting, nothing negative. It is worth mentioning that the Ending song is very catchy, however.Characters: The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo are not terribly unique. Each character can be summed up as having some of the usual generic characteristics normally found in anime. However, the characters fit into their roles well, and it is because of this the humor succeeds.Enjoyment: The enjoyment of this show is what carries my generally favorable review of it (especially as the show progresses into its later episodes). At the end of the episode, you may not walk away amazed, but you will walk away with a few good laughs. back and realized that I had laughed throughout.

Seitokai Yakuindomo.Thanks to clever wordplay, good writing and actual punch lines, Seitokai Yakuindomo manages to craft a sex comedy that avoids the pitfall of simply being crass for the sake of crassness and is all the more funnier for it. No matter how many jokes about ejaculation they make. By taking their sex jokes down the path of wordplay and and humorous misunderstandings, (instead of making shallow references to dicks and expecting the audience fall over dead from laughter), Seitokai Yakuindomo...almost manages to give itself a sense of class. Almost. But more importantly, this makes the gags actually funny.Needless to say, those who hate sex jokes, or the easily offended, probably won't enjoy Seitokai Yakuindomo. And yet somehow, the show manages to not be ridiculously offensive, despite containing gags that would make South Park blush. I think this is combination of the way the jokes are presented in an innocent, serious way (sort of like the characters are unaware what they're saying is inappropriate for the situation, if that makes sense) and the colourful cheery art style.This series makes no bones about what is is, that is, it's nothing more than a platform for a rapid-fire series of sex jokes, and at this, I feel it's a flying success. The show is absolutely hilarious, which is all it needs to be. As a result, there's very little I can criticize it for. It's only real flaw is the length, only thirteen episodes, which is average for most anime, but for Seitokai Yakuindomo, it feels like this isn't enough and it has more jokes to tell.If you’re looking for a decent plot or a nice story, go somewhere else. Seitokai Yakuindomo doesn't have either of it. Seitokai Yakuindomo is about an all-girls school turned co. The girls don’t really mind this though; it’s more like a dream come true for most of them. Through the whole series it’s one perverted joke after the other. Most of them you can see coming from a mile away, but they will make you laugh anyway.The animation often switches between normal animation and chibi mode. Usually I don’t like it when there’s too much chibi in an anime, but with Seitokai Yakuindomo I didn't really mind. Perhaps it’s because I put my mind on blank while watching this.Music fits the series perfectly, especially the dynamic, rhythmic and crazy, and a phenomenal opening and twisted ending. Because of the dialogue and humour it's difficult to pay attention to music in the background, but there are some good pieces. Very well emphasizes moral and peaceful moments in the series.I generally like the different characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I guess they’re actually not that different (they’re all perverted girls), but two of our main characters are normal people, trying to put some common sense in most of the school. The interaction between these is the main power of this anime.In conclusion, Seitokai Yakuindomo is an excellent comedy series, provided you don't find it's lewd subjects offensive, and you don't mind that there's very little story. Anyone who loves a well-written sex comedy should check it out.I probably only enjoyed this because of my young age and immaturity, that's right all you pedophiles.

COME AT ME BRO.I mean I'm a masochist.Wait what."", ""Let me start off by saying that Seitokai Yakuindomo is probably right up there on the top 5 anime to have me in hysterics every 5 minutes or so, if you're looking for an anime full of laughs, simple characters and no emotional story so there's no drama, this is EXACTLY what you're looking for, if you're looking for romance, ecchi, love triangles, drama, sadness etc, you should probably give this a miss, although there are vague hints of love interest.The story revolves around Takotoshi Tsuda, A male high school student who decides to transfer to an all-girls school simply because its closer to home,...he ends up being forcibly recruited into the student body council as a male representative. He is joined by three girls;Shino Amakusa - a second-year student and student body president, she is very serious and wants things done perfectly, she excels in academics, but all that is shadowed by the fact that she is a complete pervert, and the main reason she took an interest to Takotoshi was to 'examine' him in Health and Social class (Yep, you know exactly where i'm going with this), she is very self conscious about her breast size, and the fact her secretary, Aria, is well endowed, is the recipe for a perfect jealousy driven relationship between the two.Aria Shichijo - Also a second year, she plays the role of the student body secretary, she comes from a very rich family and just by appearance you'd expect her to be the most mature character...and if you make that assumption, you're horribly wrong.Aria is extremely perverted too, more than Shino is, she manages to twist and turn even the most innocent and simplest of sentences into a fanfiction-esque scene which appear in thought bubbles, because she is absurdly rich and well pampered, she often finds herself in completely ridiculous situations, such as standing blankly in front of a door expecting it to slide open, or standing on the bottom step of a staircase thinking its an elevator. She too is incredibly smart, and is ranked second, underneath Shino, of course, in her class midterms.Finally we have Suzu Hagimura, who is in the same year as our unfortunate protagonist, again, she is very smart and often brags about her ability to do 10 digit arithmetic calculations in her head to cover up the fact she's not really good at any physical activities, although she is 16 years old and considers her self to be superior to Takotoshi, she is often the butt of the joke when it comes to childlike appearance and height as she is less than half the size of the other three and in one episode, needs a chair to reach the top shelf of her own cabinet, this often causes her to go into a super-saiyan rage whenever her unnaturally small stature is brought into a conversation, and of course, Takotoshi is the straight man for them all.What i like about this show is that all the characters have their own traits , pros and cons which make them completely different from one another, although these characters aren't well flushed out with heaps of back story and social problems (they don't need to be for this genre of anime) the characters end up being likeable anyway, whether its for the witty banter between them in literally EVERY scene, or whether its the shear pervertedness of Shino and Aria (especially Aria, damn man) its definitely a must watch.I'd recommend this anime to anyone, especially to fans of K-On! or Lucky Star (although the themes in this are significantly more mature than anything in K-On! and Lucky Star)Thankyou for reading, message me an anime you want me to review and have a good day!-Matty he ends up being forcibly recruited into the student body council as a male representative.

For example: there have been at least 20 such shows involving at least 2 of the aforementioned tropes just THIS year. Count \'em.The reason that there are currently so many of these shows is less that they\'re a real ""work"" and more of a ""product"" designed and marketed specifically to an audience that consistently and routinely purchases their product in large...quantities. It\'s like the cigarette of anime. They\'re not good for you, but a lot of people really love them, and keep on buying it even though they know it\'s killing them.However- even the most cynical reviewers among us eventually realize that even the most recycled concepts and tropes can still make for an effective and enjoyable show... IF executed properly. Though Seitokai Yakuin domo includes all of the above with the exception of the last trope I mentioned, the writers took the established tropes and turned them upside down, adding some freshness to a nauseatingly stale formula. It\'s all about turning that ""girls can\'t be pervs"" trope upside down, and in that regard- a great success!Even though it\'s a comedy- I only laughed out loud one time at Seitokai Yakuin domo. It\'s kind of like The Big Lebowski (or any Coen Brothers\' film for that matter) in that it\'s not actually funny at all.It\'s entertaining.It\'s a chuckle comedy- not an uproarious, couch clutching, gasping for breath humor riot. They do tend to wear out the jokes after a while, and if you never found them funny in the first place (like in Prison School), then you\'re in for a long watch.If incessant panty shots and boobs are your main attraction to these shows, SYD is NOT for you.Art/Animation/Sound/Voice Acting: 7Truth be told, I really only watched this show because it was animated by GoHands, and it looks like most anime made in this decade: shiny, colorful, and pretty fluid. One thing I noticed (and liked about this anime) was that nobody had ridiculous hairstyles NOR did they have unnatural hair colors. Everyone actually looked like a normal human being, which, for a school anime, is a HUGE step. +1 for progressiveness.The voices are handled competently, veteran Yoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory) was great as Shino, and Satomi Arai plays the deadpan creeper Hata (She also portrayed Saotome from the more recent Shimoneta, a very similar character hmmmmmmmmm)Story: 6SYD was adapted from a long running 4 panel comic that\'s essentially just a collection of making fun of trope scenes from other anime, along with their own flavor of sex jokes. That said, it\'s difficult to take 30 or 40 four panel one liner jokes and turn that into a single episode. GoHands somehow manages to make it flow into an easy to follow comedy show about life in the student council with this pretty radical choppy pace coupled with segments that take the original jokes and expound upon them. They added a lot more context and setup, and then let it play out.You\'re actually shown the punchline as a commercial slide, and then the scene plays out, giving you something to chew on and wonder where this weird, out of context line comes from. It definitely helps with the impact as well- kind of an ""OHHHH"" moment for the longer jokes.The general premise of SYD is that Tsuda, our MC, is a newly accepted student to the formerly all girls Ousai Academy. On his first day, he makes the mistake of not tightening his tie, which attracts the ire of the Student Council President, Shino- who teaches him a lesson by fixing his tie, strangling him, and then forcibly inducts him into the Student Council. The rest of the show takes place over the school year, with the various holidays, sex jokes, outings, gross out jokes, and mischief that come along with it.Characters: 7There are four student council members, President Shino, VP Tsuda, Secretary Aria, and Treasurer Suzu. There\'re also four other characters of note: the creepy lady teacher Yokoshima, who is basically a pedophile and tries incessantly to get with the few guys attending the school, Hata, the monotone speaking newspaper club member who always shows up to take scandalous and incriminating photos of everyone, Mitsuba, the adorably innocent (of the horrible sexual things Aria and Shino say) Judo girl, and Kaede, who is man-phobic.Each character has an in show 4th wall breaking description: Shino, ""the perfect human"" (who is an incorrigible pervert), Aria, ""the multitalented princess with big boobs"" (rich girl airhead everyone fawns over, also a pervert), and Suzu ""IQ of 180"" (height of 4\'5"", terrible napoleon complex and hates being treated like a child). Tsuda, our MC, is basically the world\'s most legendary straight man. He serves for there to be a brick wall to hit for the endless stream of sex and poop jokes coming from Shino/Aria.Enjoyment: 6The actual content of the jokes is what I referred to as refreshing in the beginning. I have not seen an anime with such disgusting, foul content toilet jokes since Panty and Stocking. It goes so overboard with perversion of speech and dirty jokes + toilet humor that it\'s not even scandalous anymore, it\'s commonplace. You know, without a doubt, that everything that comes out of Shino\'s or Aria\'s mouths is going to be a) a bad sex joke, b) a women\'s hygiene gross out joke, or c) some ""accidental"" misreading/pronunciation of a normal kanji that then turns the meaning into something sexual.While these are fairly common in comedy anime, again, the degree to which they describe some of this stuff is pretty nasty, so +1 for edgy.Overall: 7Well, this ran a lot longer than I wanted it to- but it\'s important to see more formative shows in genre tropes- and one can see the obvious influences this show (and the comics before it) had on such newer titles as Prison School and Shimoneta.Aria: ""Wow, a whole year has passed. It only felt like a few months.""Shino: ""In an anime, that\'d be about 13 episodes!""Tsuda: ""That\'s a little too dangerous..."" quantities. It\'s like the cigarette of anime.

I usually complete an Anime no matter how bad it is, just so I can tell people ""Don\'t watch this Anime, it\'s terrible"" with a completely unbiased opinion. However, Seitokai Yakuindomo is SO BAD that I couldn\'t hold out for any longer...than episode 4.Seitokai Yakuindomo is the worst kind of Anime, pandering to the worst kind of Anime ""fan,"" a shallow ""comedy"" (I use quotations because it\'s not funny) that focuses on fanservice and repetitive sex-related ""jokes"" that only the most immature, sexually depraved teenagers could possibly enjoy.There is no comedy to be found here. Every single ""joke"" is pulled from the same gutter, oftentimes using the exact same ""joke"" multiple times in an episode. Then again, you can barely call them jokes. Here, let me rewrite this paragraph again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo\'s ""jokes"", to give you an idea of what to expect.There is no S&M to be found here. Every single penis is pulled from the same condom, oftentimes using the exact same penis multiple times in a vagina. Then again, you can barely call them dicks. Here, let me molest this virgin again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo\'s period, to give you an idea of what to fuck.That wasn\'t funny, was it? Why, that was offensive, wasn\'t it? It sounded like shameless pandering to perverted, immature teenagers, didn\'t it? Well, guess what? That is exactly what Seitokai Yakuindomo\'s dialog is like.

There\'s no way to argue it, you cannot possibly gain any sort of enjoyment from watching it.At least the opening and ending themes are pretty good. than episode 4.Seitokai Yakuindomo is the worst kind of Anime, pandering to the worst kind of Anime ""fan,"" a shallow ""comedy"" (I use quotations because it\'s not funny) that focuses on fanservice and repetitive sex-related ""jokes"" that only the most immature, sexually depraved teenagers could possibly enjoy.There is no comedy to be found here. Every single ""joke"" is pulled from the same gutter, oftentimes using the exact same ""joke"" multiple times in an episode. Then again, you can barely call them jokes. Here, let me rewrite this paragraph again below, in the style of Seitokai Yakuindomo\'s ""jokes"", to give you an idea of what to expect.There is no S&M to be found here. Every single penis is pulled from the same condom, oftentimes using the exact same penis multiple times in a vagina. Then again, you can barely call them dicks.

For boys and girls alike, wasn't your mind constantly filled with inappropriate thoughts? There wasn't much of a trigger to set you off; testosterone and estrogen are powerful little demons. So instead of marketing those stupidly impossible innocent anime girls other series seem so fond of, why not appeal potty humor to a wider audience that each individual has, at one point, experienced? I may not know much about how the opposite gender thinks, but for us guys, certain thoughts flit about our heads like angry bees,...never leaving us alone. This may all seem off-topic, Seitokai Yakuindomo delivers the highest of quality of sexual jokes, all while incorporating a storyline and masterfully pulling off a non-harem, hilarious and wonderfully executed anime.Story: 8/10The story is simple: an all girl high school recently became co-ed. STOP. Before you go further, isn't your first automatic judgement to insult another hentai-style slice of life anime? Of course! Any sane person would. A friendly, non-perverted guy by the name of Tsuda enters the school, unwittingly tripping off Shina Amakasu and the rest of the all-girl student. After some misunderstandings, randomness and hilarity, he is forced into the student council - with gratifying results.Now don't get me wrong, haters may understand that these sort of anime don't have a storyline. Most of the time, they're right. Here, it does apply somewhat; a frilly way to tell a story, so to speak. However, I had a wonderful time watching the student council do their every day activities - with a twist. These aren't your normal, typical, average, innocent virgin high school girls; these are some of the craziest anime girls I've ever come across. There seems to be no end to the jokes and innuendoes; and interestingly enough, TSUDA (THE GUY, FOR FREAKING SAKE) is the innocent one. What in all that is mighty in the anime world has this come to? A guy? As the sole non-perverted rock amid this flood of girls? This anime was so different, I was instantly hooked - and so should you be.Art: 9/10.The animation was gorgeous and bright. I typically don't like overdone scenes or underdone scenes, and this didn't disappoint me in the lease. There were times when they decided to go for the chibi look randomly and drew the characters innocently - an interesting juxtaposition, because while in chibi mode the characters decided to say funny little innuendos.... Ah well. Enough gushing. What I didn't like? Sometimes the artwork borderlined porn. No way out of that... I mean, it looked fine and all, but trying watching those scenes while there are young people around you! Geez, put some CLOTHES ON. But seriously, even then the artwork never dipped below par.Sound: 9/10The OP and ED. Wow. What an upbeat, fantastical way of starting an anime. The OP was perfect and catchy, on my ipod in seconds, and the ED was.....weird. Sorta serious, sorta not. The background music melded perfectly with the on-screen mood, but in and of itself I was not impressed as much. Though I know I repeat this in my other reviews, but seriously, pay attention to the voice acting. Try acting out those scenes by yourself. It's not easy; but when you can make perverted jokes into a mic without eliciting even a laugh, that takes some guts. The voices were spot on, serious and joking, warm and memorable.Characters: 9/10Lovely, lovely cast. Perfect for the story, each character represented a typical sort of archetype. Tsuda, the innocent one; Hagimiru, the tsundere, the list goes on and on. Each character had their moments and contributed a little more to the story; even Tsuda's little ball of comedy managed to get a good laugh out of me. But seriously, I loved each and every character, because they simply melded so perfectly. It's so hard to imagine a different cast or to introduce another main character, because the magic happened with this perfect combination. It wasn't perfect; there were some stupid parts (even the best cake may be too sweet for some people), but overall, it was beautiful to see the interactions take place. Though there wasn't much of a character arc at all for anyone, I enjoyed their daily banter nonetheless.Overall: 9/10Why is the average score so low? Many people looked past what this anime was really trying to go for (toilet humor) and just hit it with a low score and moved on. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy; if you watch the first episode and grudgingly try and finish it, you're experience won't be nearly as pleasant than if you were to go into watching each episode with enthusiasm and a piece of pie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this short but sweet little 13 episode anime. Don't look at the superficial, shallow characteristics; dig a little deeper, and what you'll find may actually not be a condom but a vibrating Christmas present... never leaving us alone.

It starts off seeming like a typical romcam/harem, but Seitokai Yakuindomo has its own unique genre of humor that sets it apart from the norm.As a show with constant references to dildos, cum, sex, incest, boobs, panties, dicks and literally everything dirty you can honestly think of, in a show about high school girls, you would think this would be ecchi, but it\'s not. It\'s a slice of life anime with some of the most creative and unique comedy I have ever...seen.The story revolves around the typical harem lead male surrounded by beautiful girls (The school is 95% women), but the great thing about it is that each girl represents a porn category/fetish. Notable one\'s include incest, extreme fetishes, innocent/amateur, voyeur, midget, and milf, but the list goes on. They all have amazing personalities that compliment their ""role"" in the show\'s twisted sense of humor.The writing is excellent, I find myself occasionally bored but more often than not I was laughing my ass off. The jokes are generally creative, and some scenes are almost impossible not to laugh. If you find immature humor funny, such as the type of stuff you might see in Gintama, this is a show made for you.On the flip side, arguably this shows weakest point is its lack of story. It heavily reminds me of something like Kiss x Sis in that regard, it has some minor plot regarding entrance exams but for the most part every episode feels like an OVA, and the episodes themselves are so fragmented that it can sometimes be hard to follow.In addition, as mentioned already there times where the humor does get a little stale, since it is basically sex jokes as far as the eye can see. Sometimes the humor feels forced and the jokes are word for word repeats of previous episodes. These are few and far between but keep this in mind.Anyway, by now you should know whether or not you\'ll like it. Perverted humor is not for everyone, but if you enjoy it, this show has made a science out of it. seen.The story revolves around the typical harem lead male surrounded by beautiful girls (The school is 95% women), but the great thing about it is that each girl represents a porn category/fetish.

No, I’m not talking about perverted stuff, but rather how they act. Most of us think that high school girls are shy, oversensitive and keep to themselves and that’s pretty much how they’re depicted in a lot of media these days, especially in anime. Seitokai Yakuindomo shows us a different side of modern teenagers and brings lots of humour and parody with it.Basically, Seitokai Yakuindomo is about a teenager named Tsuda Takatoshi who decides to attend Ousai Academy due to the fact that it’s close to his home, even though this particular high school...used to be a former all-girls’ academy up until recently. During his very first day at school, Tsuda meets a couple of girls who turn out to be members of the student council. Some of them are actually quite perverted and often spurt out the dirtiest jokes, but what’s worse is that they recruit Tsuda into the student council and even go as far as to make him vice-president. This all happens in a matter of minutes and our unfortunate hero has little say in any of it.During the thirteen episodes of Seitokai Yakuindomo you’ll be constantly bombarded with dirty sex jokes, perverted talk and unwanted information about the female body and their period cycle. There are little to no serious scenes in the entire anime and most of it comprises of convenient situations to score another sex joke or a dirty conversation, with Tsuda often used as a serious retort or an enraged response.There aren’t too many characters in the anime, though most of them are put to good use and no of them feel forced or useless. You’ve got the protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi who just wants to lead a normal life and high school but is constantly attacked by his fellow female students with dirty jokes and unwarranted accusations. Then there are the three other members of the student council, all female, obviously. Shino Amakusa is the president of the council and maybe the most perverted of all characters, always available when you need a quick dirty joke. Aria Shichijou is the mature rich girl, though her mind is just about as perverted as that of Shino’s. Last but not least, yet definitely the shortest, is Suzu Hagimura, the intelligent and silent girl. She is about the same age as Tsuda, but has the body of an elementary school student. You won’t get any dirty comments from her, but her short height will often be used as comic relief and target of several jokes.Seitokai certainly works well as a comedy and its non-stop approach at humour and constant verbal gags keeps every episode fun and entertaining. What the anime lacks in proficiency it makes up for with its engaging plot and easy-going nature. It’s definitely not a great series and apart from an episode that takes place on the beach or another one where our heroes celebrate Christmas, Seitokai Yakuindomo lacks diversity. Most of the anime takes place at the academy, namely inside a couple of rooms and on a corridor. Whenever our characters are taken in a different location, it’s often only so as to set up a joke or make a funny remark at something in that particular environment. Another weak point is that every episode seems to be cut down in short scenes, each about one minute, that feature some random dialogue between a couple of our characters followed by one or two dirty jokes. Every scene starts with a build-up to the future joke or gag and usually ends directly after its purpose has been complete and the laughs and giggles have taken place.It’s rather hard to predict if you’ll like Seitokai Yakuindomo or not. Some will be drawn to it by its simple premise and fast pacing while others are going to be turned off by the overwhelming amount of sex jokes and weird character interactions. I really didn’t know what to make this series during the first few episodes and I simply couldn’t connect with certain scenes, which in the ended left an awkward impression on me. I got used to it eventually and after a while each episode turned out to be even funnier than the last one. It’s not an anime that I’ll remember for too long, though. It all comes down to what you’re looking for: there are enough laughs to be had in Seitokai Yakuindomo and it’s rarely boring or changing pace, so you can hardly go wrong with it. If you’re looking for a little more substance, on the other hand, then I advise you to keep on searching. used to be a former all-girls’ academy up until recently.

When told ""this anime\'s best points are SEX JOKES!"" I am sure most people would lose interest. Yet, this anime somehow is able to put itself out there with other great plot filled tear jerking anime simply through the uniqueness it holds. The jokes are played well, the characters contribute well to the flow, and it seems to carry a universal appeal. Even if you don\'t understand the jokes, the art and music alone would be a good enough a reason to at least give it a try. Highly recommend to just about anyone! ', 'It\'s my second review, so don\'t be very harsh with me.I think you\'ll like it!ART: 10The art in this Anime is, of course, great. And in the biggest part that\'s because this is an Anime of 2010. You\'ll enjoy watching the art which is present in this Anime, because it\'s a very good one. All emotions and feelings are expressed very well on the characters\' faces.STORY: 9This Anime has a very original story and characters. There are no other Anime titles which have such plot. A guy, who recently changed his place of living, tranfers to a school which just changed from a girls\'...one to a co-ed and now it\'s still full of girls. Don\'t think bad about him! He\'s not a pervert. The reason he did this, is because that school is near the house he lives in. In the moment he entered the school, he is noticed by the Student\'s Council President and is enrolled immediatly in Council. The reason of this action was the thing that ""school needed a male\'s point of view"" and she wanted opinions from a male\'s perspective. And after this, he gets through a lot of events with girls. Oh, I forgot to mention, Student\'s Council consists of 3 girls. The two of them are so perverted! I couldn\'t believe my eyes! I have never seen such perverted girls in my life! You\'ll laugh a lot! It\'s so funny!CHARACTERS: 10As I said, the main characters are 3 girls from Student\'s Council and Tsuda that transfered there. Aria and Shino from Council are the most perverted girls you had ever saw. Suzu is a very wise one, but is considered to be a child because of her height and some of her habits. The main protagonist, Tsuda Takatoshi, is a normal boy like all of us, but not as perverted as some of us. I liked a lot how the President, Shino, behaves. She\'s so funny with all her erotic thoughts. If you like to watch comedy and funny Anime titles, then it\'s for you.SOUND: 9I can\'t tell very much about this part of Anime, because you\'ll not have time to notice such things, \'cause you\'ll laugh a lot at some scenes.The OP & ED are good and they were chose very good to this Anime. Sound great characterizes  events that happen and emotions/ feelings that characters experience at that moments. Sound environment doesn\'t bother you, but suits very good this Anime!!!ENJOYMENT/OVERAGE: 10This is a very funny Anime you must watch if you would like to see what happens in a girls\' only school with a perverted Student\'s Council President. You will laugh at her rules and actions. Also, in Anime are used uncensored words (like masturbation, anal/oral sex, vagina, etc.) that are censored due to the fact that it\'s a PG-13 rated Anime. I recommend you to watch Ayako release (the same I watched), because of some reasons:1) Words that are audio-censored in Anime, are translated in subs, so you\'ll read the real things that are said. I mean, subs translate to you those things and you\'ll laugh more than if you\'ll watch a Raw (I mean, those who can).2) This is a very good subgroup and you\'ll agree more with this after you\'ll watch this Anime.This subgroup translated all words with double-meaning (that are often used), where one meaning is perverted/erotic for sure. The fact is that the President, Shino, very often thinks about that one. Also, were translated all Japanese words that are related to Japanese culture/history and are known/used only in Japan. (For example, Nyotaimori is the practice using women\'s bodies as a serving dish, usually for sushi.) (would you like to try something like that with your loved one?  addressed to male part who reads this review).In conclusion, watch this Anime ([Ayako] 720p release) for a good mood and AMAZING Impressions!!!!! one to a co-ed and now it\'s still full of girls.

(would you like to try something like that with your loved one?  addressed to male part who reads this review).In conclusion, watch this Anime ([Ayako] 720p release) for a good mood and AMAZING Impressions!!!!!', 'There seems to have been a lot of recent anime adapted from 4-koma mangas recently, Seitokai Yakuindomo (SYD for short) is one them.====================*WARNING*======================If you are the type of person who are not into constant sex related jokes and innuendos, then you can stop reading now, this anime is definitely is not for you.====================*WARNING*======================With that said, let\'s move on.Story:The main character, Takatoshi Tsuda, is forced into joining the student council of Ousai High School, which was formerly an all-girls school, by the president Akamusa Shino, in order to have a male\'s perspective into issues surrounding the new now co-ed school.This being a 4-koma comedy, there...is pretty much nothing that you can call an overall plot whatsoever as the anime is based on the 4 student council members and the time they spend there.As mentioned above, at least 90% of the comedy in the series are all adult, sex-related jokes. It will be hard going into an episode and not hear the characters use words like cum, penis, vagina, dildo, masturbation, etc...you get the idea. The series tries to deliver the jokes in new and clever ways each time, but even then some people might find the show start to get repetitive and old pretty fast. That was not the case for me luckily.Art:While the art is not outstanding, the series shines with a bright and vibrant colour scheme. The chibi-deformed versions of the characters look adorable, and overall the animation is easy on the eyes.Sound:In terms of sound, the VAs do a respectable job in their roles, and with many well known voices in this series it all comes together nicely. In terms of BGM, its what you would expect from your standard comedy, high school anime, nothing really worth mentioning. The OP and ED themes however are surprisingly catchy and im still looping them even as I write this.Character:As far as character goes, I think it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of SYD. While none of the characters are really unique and they all follow common stereotypes (Tsuda being the tsukomi, Aria is the rich girl who is ignorant about common things, Hagimura is the loli with a complex over it, and Shino is just Shino), they manage to blend together nicely and produce plenty of humorous events throughout the series, mainly because 90% of the cast are pretty much perverts. The side characters as well give the series an extra boost in comedy and many of them are likable. While romance is not the main focus of the series, by the later half of the series we are shown a bit of possible future relationship between Tsuda and some of the girls, in a show were everything is adult related comedy, its a rather nice addition and it doesnt derail the series\' direction.Enjoyment:I will be the first to admit that I wasnt into the show for the first 3 or so episodes, I usually dont enjoy the animes that are mostly about perverted talk/actions (latest example: B Gata H Kei) but this show slowly won me over and ended up becoming the show I was anticipating the most this season for reasons I still havent figured out myself fully (maybe the characters). I can say for sure that this series does get better as it goes along, and it does not lose momentum from there (except maybe the last episode).Overall if you are looking for a series with a potty mouth, then you must not look any further than this. If you can giggle at jokes involving dildos, penis, erection, vagina, masturbation, etc...you will also find the comedy in this series to be pretty damn funny. And if you are not into this kind of stuff, maybe the small romance scenes in the latter half might keep you interested. Either way from the very beginning this series sets its target audience, and if you belong in this audience i doubt you will be disappointed. For those who just cannot enjoy a more ""dirty"" type of humour, then you are looking for the wrong anime. With hopes of a possible second season, I can say with confidence ""I love Ousai, I love SYD"". is pretty much nothing that you can call an overall plot whatsoever as the anime is based on the 4 student council members and the time they spend there.As mentioned above, at least 90% of the comedy in the series are all adult, sex-related jokes.

With hopes of a possible second season, I can say with confidence ""I love Ousai, I love SYD"".', ""I told myself I'd write a review for Seitokai Yakuindomo immediately after finishing it, but eh, a couple weeks later is okay, right?Story: 6Seitokai Yakuindomo's story is very cliché. A boy starts attending a school that used to be girls-only, he joins the student council, which has only female members--we've all heard it before etc, etc. If you're looking for epic plot and character development, look elsewhere, Seitokai Yakuindomo is good for laughs, not becoming a better human being, going on an adventure through anime, or other things like that; It's not even good for fapping. The reason I personally enjoyed Seitokai Yakuindomo was precisely...that. Seitokai Yakuindomo is perverted by all means, but it's in a different way than the majority of ecchi shows...It's actually funny. Throughout this 13-episode Seitokai no Ichizon lookalike, you'll actually laugh. The comedy ranges from simple comedic timing, to completely perverted jokes, to out-of-place 'wtf why is there a teddy bear with a ballgag?'. This show is a very fun watch, but I will tell you to steer clear of it if either of the following apply to you: 1) You're looking for something serious 2) You dislike anything remotely related to ecchi.Art: 7SYD's art is nothing amazing, but it's definitely nothing bad either. The animation is nice and flows smoothly and the characters are cute. Of course there is some censoring of certain.. objects.. but that doesn't take away from the show because you'll definitely know what they are. And it's not like there is any explicit ecchi content (as in naked people) to censor.Sound: 7In terms of Seiyuu, SYD has decently popular voice actors. Shino and Aria are voiced by Hikasa Youko and Satou Satoumi (the voices of Mio and Ritsu of K-On!), respectively. And, my personal favorite, Arai Satomi (Kuroko from To Aru Majutsu no Index/To Aru Kagaku no Railgun) lends her voice to the expressionless newspaper club member, Hata Ranko. There are no complaints to be made about the voice acting in SYD, and hey, I like the opening as well. Osai Girls and Boys~!Character: 8The characters really make the show for me here. Well maybe not the characters, but the things that they say. Shino: tall blunt school prez, Aria: tall, busty Shirley-lookalike Ojou-sama, Suzu: genius loli Nagi-lookalike with a Napoleon complex, Tsuda: generic too nice anime lead. I just gave you a good idea of the characters you will encounter when watching Seitokai Yakuindomo, I'm sure they sound pretty much as generic as possible, but if you watch the show, I think you'll find that with good, entertaining writing, even the most generic characters can become hilarious.Also, an honourable mention to Yokoshima-sensei, she's awesome.Enjoyment: 9This is what made me continue to watch Seitokai Yakuindomo throughout summer 2010 season. The writing on this show is hilarious. I liked this show because I never knew what the characters were going to say next, but I knew whatever it was, it'd be funny. I laughed through every episode and you will too, as long as you don't fall into one of the 'do not watch' categories I mentioned earlier.I recommend this show to anyone who wants something that will make them laugh, doesn't mind pervertedness, and has free time on their hands. This show isn't a total /must see/, but if you enjoyed what I said about it in my review, I recommend checking it out :) that.

Okay, so here goes...Seitokai Yakuindomo tells us about a normal-looking guy who\'s going to spend his 3 years of high school in a former all-girls school which has just gone co-ed. Suddenly he got recruited by the student council on the first day of school. Things went smooth for him, and then at some point, romantic flags comes appearing out of nowhere just like a cliched rom-com anime.If you think that\'s what going to happen in this anime, then you\'re a...hundred percent wrong.Seitokai Yakuindomo is actually about a group of student council of an all-girls school that has just turned into a co-ed school. This group consist of 4 people, 3 girls and a guy.We have a diligent, smart, athletic president whose sex orientation is a bit screwed up, Amakusa ShinoA beautiful, rich secretary whose having puberty problems just like the president, Shichijou AriaA tiny-looking girl who happens to be the treasurer, Hagimura SuzuAnd the normal, straight-man, main character, and also the vice president, Tsuda Takatoshi.Everyday in the student council room is day full of Tsuda\'s punchline reacting to the immaturity of Shino and Aria regarding sex. Anddd, sometimes it\'s just Suzu\'s insult to others when she\'s being teased tiny.Oh, before I forgot, this is a gag anime which consist of serial short skits. This anime contains lots of jokes related to sex. I suggest you to be an adult to watch this, or at least have a sufficient knowledge of sex. Personally, I watched this when I was younger and found some ""things"" hard to understand, such as dildos, chasity belt, masturbation and other stuff which is a completely unsuitable for Justin Bieber.I don\'t really know if this could be considered funny or not. I mean, I laughed a bit, but so often it just keeps giving sex jokes which I couldn\'t really understand.If you\'re looking for a rom-com anime, then you\'re definitely looking at the wrong place.If you\'re looking for a comedy anime, I can\'t say that this anime is guaranteed to be funny, since some jokes are not for everybody.So, I could say that if you\'re a person with a reasonable knowledge of sex, and also a reasonable sense of humor, Seitokai Yakuindomo is \'maybe\' the right choice to watch. hundred percent wrong.Seitokai Yakuindomo is actually about a group of student council of an all-girls school that has just turned into a co-ed school.

Full of shocking and vulgar sex jokes, there is no filter on the mouths of these hilarious characters as they try to live the life of high school students while controlling their unmatched sex drives.Story (7/10):The story itself is pretty simple. Tsuda Takatoshi is a new student at Ousai Academy and he is accidentally forced to join the student council (all girls) by day one. What he doesn\'t know is just how perverted the president and vice president are of this council. Whether it\'s discussing how to...experiment S&M on teddy bears or pester Takotshi about how many times he ""finishes"" per day, there is no rest for Takotshi as he tries to keep up with the seemingly unlimited energy of the council.The weakness of this kind of comedy, however, is that there really is no central plot. Each episode is self-contained and does nothing more than set up the situation for the jokes, so anyone looking for a profound story, a slice-of-life, or even a school romance will be disappointed.Art (9/10):Good animation. Nothing worth noting.Sound (8/10):Thought the opening and ending themes were pretty good. Nothing super spectacular.Character (8/10):There\'s no doubt these characters were hilarious. Coupled with Takatoshi and Hagimura\'s stunned reactions, these characters will keep you entertained from start to finish. Do not worry that the jokes are only sexual; they honestly don\'t get old. But this is all assuming we look at these characters from a comedic perspective. Once again, there aren\'t any deep background stories or in-depth looks at their personal struggles; this is no slice-of-life. It is pure comedy.Enjoyment (10/10):I thought this show was hysterical. I never found the jokes repetitive since they were so shocking; unfiltered vulgarity  has its own charm. Even if you\'re not a fan of sexual jokes, I suggest you give this type of humor a try.Overall (8/10):Approach this show as if you would approach a stand-up comedy: don\'t expect any deep stories, expect comedy and you will receive. experiment S&M on teddy bears or pester Takotshi about how many times he ""finishes"" per day, there is no rest for Takotshi as he tries to keep up with the seemingly unlimited energy of the council.The weakness of this kind of comedy, however, is that there really is no central plot.

I will get straight to the point.  This all base on my opinion, so even if I like or hate it, you still might love this series.  :)  I just love writing reviews.  I gave it a 8 on Story mostly because there is only 2 episodes out and I do not know what the plot will be.  So far, this show is pure comical action through perverted jokes made my the Shino (Mio from K-on!) and Aria (Ritsu from K-on!).  Now however, if some of you guys are watching it for Yoko and Satomi, sadly...Aria has more of a higher voice than Ritsu and Shino, is well more perverted than Mio will ever be. lol Their characters are nothing similar.I like all the character personality, since it's comedy, I expect them to make me laugh, or at least make me smile lol.  Anyways, so far the jokes aren't bad, but I hope they don't rely solely on perverted jokes alone.  I didn't really like it the first time I watched it because after watching K-on... it threw me off that Mio's voice was a perverted personality lol.  So watch the first episode, and try to erase Mio's character.  You might enjoy the perverted comedy, or maybe you may pass :) Aria has more of a higher voice than Ritsu and Shino, is well more perverted than Mio will ever be. lol Their characters are nothing similar.I like all the character personality, since it's comedy, I expect them to make me laugh, or at least make me smile lol.

After that you see what happens in the student council, the adventures they go on and the time they spend togetherAlthough this anime has no plot (because of it's genre), it was really enjoyable (if you are into sex related jokes).  About 90-95% of the jokes in this anime were sex-related and...they had me laughing a lot even though I find them somewhat repetitive.  The concept of this anime seems really simple but it works.The characters aren't anything too special, we got Shino the student body president, who is perfect (except for that one flaw), Aria the rich girl, Suzu the loli and a whole bunch of minor characters.  Sure the characters might not be unique but they all fit into their roles and that's all I ask for.  In this kind of anime there really wouldn't be any character development but there are one or two love interests flying around, but the anime isn't really too heavy on it, I guess it's because of the genre. However it would be nice if they did have some romance but I guess that's asking for too much.The art and animation is clear and they do have some moments where the characters are in chibi version but nothing too special and nothing negative eitherAs for the sound there is nothing too special here either, the voice actors are alright and I would say fit the role, the OP and ED songs are at par.Overall I enjoyed this series quite a bit, I got to say this is one of the funniest anime series I've watched this year.  If you're not into sex-related jokes then I would bypass this anime but if you just want a laugh like me I recommend SYD.

To put it simply, it was just several hours of smutty jokes; and not even good ones.  It was puerile, weak and childish.When you\'re eight years old, someone saying ""boobies"" is hilarious.  Even as an adult, you still might snigger.  Sitting through 13 episodes of an anime with humour at that level, however... that takes a special kind of person.

That, and the fact society sure is changing fast these days. Maybe GoHands was better off restoring their mistake and making Princess Lover into a H series again.Summarizing this series, let's take B Gata H Kei as example. Remove the shyness about adult subjects and instead make it the most common subject to talk about in the world. Replace the cast, add in a very mediocre soundtrack, reduce the art a bit and you're done. Welcome to SYD.The plot....Pure and innocent guy Tsuda transfers to an all-girl school to find out sex jokes do not get a 'what are you talking about o0..' reaction but rather 'I think it feels better there while doing ***' with serious face-- you get the idea. During the 13 episodes this series spans you will get coverage of all possible adult jokes you're going to hear on the short term. If you hear them that is, between all censoring and *bleep* words. And no, there will be no pantsu on the DVD either according to the anime.The only thing I remembered about art and soundtrack is that some scenes were straight default H game rips, with the classroom at sunset with dramatic music to the school grounds and everything.Characters are there, but predictable. After two eps you can already tell in what state of mind corruption everyone is, not a bad thing since that's all what matters here.In a nutshell, watch SYD for the following reasons:1.) Test if your mindset is past the point of no return yet.You pass when you can guess how a joke is going to play out with a small hint.You fail when..well, you actually can't fail. 13 eps full of dirty jokes boast a pretty high success rate. If you are among the group that still has a pure mind after watching this, drop a line on my profile. I'll be waiting for you, my Savior.2.) You have spare time and need a good laugh. With BSDM Teddybears, no pantsu and vibrators from Santa pretty much everything passes by.P.S. I took a long break from writing reviews. Does it show?

Does it show?"", 'Seitokai Yakuindomo’s humor is definitely an acquired taste. What appears at first as another slice of life high school harem / comedy hybrid quickly and subtly begins delivering sexually charged jokes one after the other. The sex centered humor is either going to make or break your opinion of the show, that or if you thought this type of humor was childish to begin with. If you begin to start picking up on the sexual innuendo setups before the punch line hits then you my dirty-dirty friend will probably like the show.The entire cast is a sexual riot, well except for our male hero lead...Tsuda who is caught in the middle of it all, forced to join the student council the moment he stepped on school grounds. Suzu also joins Tsuda in the normal group; though she’s used to taking the brunt of all the short jokes. I always did love the random arrows that showed she’s actually in the scene because of her height, just a part of her pigtails barely visible at the corner of the screen. Shino and Aria round out the rest of the student council members and everything from masturbation, sex toys, and all that jazz do not escape these two. I also can’t forget their sex hungry teacher and student council supervisor Yokoshima who at any moment will jump on the opportunity to hit on any of her male students.By no means is the show explicit in its jokes, as it’s all supposed to be taken light-heartedly at the end of the day. The show does not even have any fanservice scenes to speak of, shocking right? I think it’s the fact girls are doing the jokes that help to lighten the mood, if it were the other way around with three guys, this would be viewed as creepy.Jokes aside, there’s generally a tangible story to keep the episodes moving and each character is adequately developed to make sure they aren’t just joke dispensing machines. If you’re not even smiling in the first episode, forget it, this is not for you as the general format of the show and topic of the jokes stay consistent all the way to the end.

I also can’t forget their sex hungry teacher and student council supervisor Yokoshima who at any moment will jump on the opportunity to hit on any of her male students.By no means is the show explicit in its jokes, as it’s all supposed to be taken light-heartedly at the end of the day. The show does not even have any fanservice scenes to speak of, shocking right? I think it’s the fact girls are doing the jokes that help to lighten the mood, if it were the other way around with three guys, this would be viewed as creepy.Jokes aside, there’s generally a tangible story to keep the episodes moving and each character is adequately developed to make sure they aren’t just joke dispensing machines. If you’re not even smiling in the first episode, forget it, this is not for you as the general format of the show and topic of the jokes stay consistent all the way to the end.', 'One of the very few cases where explaining things is a BAD idea.An anime focusing on comedy, Seitokai Yakuindomo is a highschool story where the straight man Tsuda, one of the first male students of the up-till-then female-only school, is forced to become a part of the student council, since the president (Shino) has decided that she needs a male\'s opinion in managing the now-both-sexes school. Along with her are the secretary, Aria, and the adorable blonde loli Suzu.That said, from the start Seitokai shows clearly that it isn\'t interested in promoting any sort of story and each episode after the first is a...standalone excuse for hilarity to ensue. The anime hits us with one sex joke and gag after another, with the occasional trolling by the animation team spicing things up (for example fake last episodes, game and movie announcements etc etc). Overall I am totally in for this sort of mindless fun. The gags focus mostly on Suzu\'s height and all sorts of pervertidness (hell, the only scene where they show the girls naked is just an excuse for another gag.)The problem is that I quite often caught myself FORCING myself to laugh at the jokes, and when you do this long enough to realise it on your own, something, dear animators, has gone wrong. See the dialogue below from ep 11 and you\'ll understand:President:I really hate wearing skirts on windy days.Sex-crazed secretary:You shouldn\'t say that indiscriminately...Sex-crazed secretary (cont): You can legitimately expose yourself!See the problem with the above dialogue? You read the first 2 lines and leave your imagination to do the work, which in turns leads you to laughter. But when they add an explanation of the joke on the third line it just ruins it. This is the one rule that Seitokai Yakuindomo always fails to realise: NEVER EXPLAIN THE JOKE. Implications are far more hilarious than going to someone and saying: ""HERE! THIS IS WHAT I MEANT WITH THAT JOKE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW AUDIENCE?"" Apart from ruining the mood it also feels like the show is insulting our IQs on purpose.In the end I can\'t really hate Seitokai though. With every episode I get the sweet wonderful feeling of my brain cells dying, and recreating its jokes is usefully very successful, provided you know WHEN NOT TO EXPLAIN THINGS. standalone excuse for hilarity to ensue.

Heads up, possible spoilersStory: 6The anime is about our main character, Tsuda, attending a former all girls school, and then being forced upon the student council with three very interes..., actually two very interesting characters and one with a height complex.  The story, much like other comedic animes such as Nichijou and Lucky Star, has a bunch of short events in each episode.  SYD didn\'t transition all these events as well as the other two animes I said and...this caused the anime to have weird pacing.Art: 9Saved a couple of screen shots of scenery as my wall paper, the art was great!  I believe this is one of the best shounens art-wise, as all the chibi parts were done very well.  If other shounens were drawn/animated like this anime, I may watch more shounen... or not complain about them as much.Sound: 7.99One of my favorite OPs ever, Yamato Nadeshiko Education is extremely catchy.  The ED, Aoi Haru, was a bit of a turn off for a few episodes, but, like what most music does to me, became extremely catchy and I just wanted to hear it all the time.  So in shorter terms, both OP and ED are on my iTunes with roughly 60 plays each.  Yes, I liked them.

The voice acting was on point, with two of my favorite seiyuus, Hikasa Yoko and Satou Satomi.+1 for those two-.01 for those two talking dirty like they aren\'t anything, mostly Satou Satomi, I MEAN SHE PLAYED SUCH INNOCENT CHARACTERS, WHAT HAPPENED.  But than again I liked it... I was gonna give it a -1 but then I was like, Seiyuus are not real life version of their anime character and it actually was funny to hear them talk and blah blah blah... -.01Character: 9Ok, no one cares about the main character, because he is simple and boring and is only there because he is a male.The other three... actually, every female in the anime are great characters,  as they all are much like middle school boys (Possibly girls? I don\'t know how middle school girls acted) with a sense of innocence, but a sense of trying to figure out the world, in dirty ways.  Little character development, just better relationships between the three girls and Tsuda.Enjoyment: 8Dirty slap stick humor?  How can I not laugh at that?!  I probably would have enjoyed this anime more if I weren\'t watching it before going to bed and being tired, as I actually didn\'t laugh as much as I was expecting.  It was great though, just not as funny as I thought it would be.  A lot more just ""what did she say"" and ""uhm... glad my parents don\'t speak Japanese"".Overall: 8Funny anime, with a different type of humor, this anime is a must watch in my opinion, but because of the different style of humor, not because it is the best.With the next season coming around the corner, I am excited to watch it.

You'd think this will quickly become a harem story, but the main character himself can't get over how all the girls are just casually tossing tampons to each other in the class, simply because they are so used to it (being on a girls-only school in the past years) and are not shy about it in any way.Now the characters may be rather stereotypical, but they are very well executed! You have the rich, perverted airhead bimbo, a perverted miss-perfect highschool student, a tsundere, a spoiled drunk teacher. All the signs of a harem right? But it still doesn't become one!

The plot itself isn't very exquisite and I'd even go so far to say is the weakest part of the series, but what makes it interesting is the personalities of the President, Shino Amakura and the Secretary, Aria Shichijou who have a habit of constantly making sexual references to just about anything that is brought up in conversation. Even the Treasurer Suzu...Hagimura had her own personality quirks since she fits a loli archetype with the maturity of an adult...unless someone mentions her height. Tsuda in the Student Council was the only main character and seemed to be the only voice of reason. In regards to the story, my biggest complaint about it is it really didn't go anywhere. It even got to the point where it felt like the story was getting repetitive. If you're looking for any sort of romance or dynamic character building, there really isn't a whole lot. It stays pretty consistent from beginning to end.However, despite my beefs with the story, I will admit one thing...the scriptwriting was fantastic. One of the funniest scripts I have ever seen in an anime and the seiyuu's did a very nice job of performing their roles. A minor complaint I do have about it is I wish they would've actually toned it down slightly with the sexual commentary and innuendo. There were times it seemed like they were repeating jokes and it just wasn't that effective the second and third times around. Still, this series didn't cease to amaze me with how bold it would get with its script.I found the characters to be pretty funny and interesting. While I already mentioned the main characters, the supporting staff in their own right had their moments. Hata, Mitsuba, and Kotomi were three funny supporting characters to go with an already hilarious main cast.There wasn't necessarily anything great about the animation or the music. None of it was that memorable but that is typically how goes with anime comedies. The one thing I can say was the OP was rather catchy and fit the mood of the series perfectly.Overall, this is a rather touchy series in regards to enjoyment. If you love sexual jokes and humor, you'll love this series. I found them to be hit-or-miss, but I can say they hit more than they missed. It is a pretty strong comedy series as far as the writing is concerned. Like I mentioned, I just wish it would've done a little more with its story or at the very least, have a little more character building between Tsuda and his Student Council classmates. I think that's what separates a series like Seitokai no Ichizon or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou from a series like this. Those animes are at least willing to try character building and story progression. Still, you can't go wrong with a series like this. It is refreshingly unique series for it's ambitious scriptwriting and if you're looking for a series that isn't too deep with lots of sexual humor, this is a must see.

I\'m only half way through, half way meaning five more episodes left. Up above was a quote I found extremely funny for some reason.Story: 7/10A new format for reviewing? What is this? I\'m now going to do reviews like this. I see other people do it like this, and I\'m gonna... erhmm... steal it. The story follows a teenage boy named Tsuda who transferred to an all-girls school. Only because it was close, though....No real reason. He is immediately confronted by the student council president, and forcibly made a male representative of the student council, and also a vice-president. Eh, don\'t know, but don\'t judge it. I think that\'s all there really is, other than that, a lot of humor is in it. Whilst walking home in the rain, the above quote was said by the student council leader, Shino. The group constantly makes jokes about sex, but only the girls. The three girls, Shino, Aria and Hagimura... well, not so much Hagimura, but the other two girls are constantly making jokes about sex. I think Shion is a curious virgin.Animation: 8/10The animation constantly changes between scenes. Like, it will go into chibi mode or something like that. I don\'t know if that\'s what you would necessarily call it, but, yeah, kinda like that. But, other than that it\'s completely normal animation. Changes from style to style from time to time, but most anime do that anyway.Sound: 8/10I actually quite enjoy the music and whatnot in Seitokai Yakuindomo. I have \'Seitokai Yakuindomo\' on my clipboard, so I can just paste it whenever I want with Ctrl+V. But, the music is pretty much how I rate every other anime, because I think the music is one of the most important things of an anime, including animation, including story, including character... So everything in anime is pretty much important, so... Forget all my words!Character: 9/10I pretty much love all the characters in the anime. They\'re all pretty epic, and they\'re all pretty funny. Tsuda is the main guy, literally, I think he\'s one of the only 5 guys in the anime. Tsuda is probably the most responsible out of all of them, Aria and Shino constantly making sex jokes, actually. No, Hagimura is the most responsible and the smartest. So, forget my words once again. Now, time to explain more in-depth. Lemme redo this.Takatoshi Tsuda is the main character of the story. He moves to a new town or whatnot, and goes to an all-girls school except for a couple of guys only because it is close to his house. Seriously, who wants to walk 80000000m just to go to school? Nobody would actually really walk that far in real life. Not to mention, the male representative and the vice-president of the student council.Shino Amakusa is the president of the student council, and I think she is a curious virgin. She constantly makes jokes about sex, and Aria goes along with them like nothing is wrong. She once got Tsuda a pornographic novel to read, considering she never got a gift for the opposite sex. That\'s just something funny I\'m pointing out.Aria Shichijo is the secretary of the student council and is good friends with Shino. She has an extremely perverted mind, and converts almost anything she says into something sexual. Pretty much Shino for ya, and it\'s also Aria. They\'re basically... twins from different families.Suzu Hagimura is the student council treasurer and in the same year as Tsuda. Probably the smartest out of all of them, considering she claims that her IQ is 180, can do 10-digit calculations in her head, is fluent in multiple languages including English... but she is no taller than an elementary school student. Once called a \'little kid\' or \'child\' she often gets mad and... gets mad? I don\'t know. I\'ve spent too much time on this section. Not really, because it\'s near the end of the review.Overall: 8/10I\'ve enjoyed this anime so far, considering I\'m really a fan of humorous anime, and other... stuff. It wouldn\'t be my favorite category though, because as you should know, I watch a lot of psychological/horror anime. I just like seeing people getting massacred (don\'t know if spelled right) and people getting a steak to their heart (Shiki). But, comedy is nice for a change.

I don\'t know why, but I just did. It may have been the fact that these days, most animes involve this Slice-of-Life thing involving high school students. I\'ve seen a lot of them, however, none were quite like this... how should I put it... Seitokai Yakuindomo, to my surprise, was actually one of the most entertaining animes I\'ve ever seen. It\'s full of comedy that literally makes me laugh out loud. The unique part about it is that all of the humor is related to sex in some way, and it still comes out professional,...mature, and hilarious above all. So let\'s get down to business, shall we?Seitokai Yakuindomo is about a guy who gets into what was formally an all-girls school. The school started allowing guys in, however, most of the students are still girls. It\'s every guy\'s dream to be in a school similar to this one, but once you get inside, it\'s a completely different story. This guy, Tsuda, is one of the guys who gets into this school. On the first day, he meets Shino, Suzu, and Aria, otherwise known as the Student Council. As most of us know, student council members are supposed to be mature and smart. They got the last part right, but these girls are what make the show for mature audiences only. Constant sexual references about intercourse, jerking off, feminine hygiene products... and every single reference makes me refuse to stop laughing. Tsuda gets put on the Student Council, and that\'s where the story begins... if you can actually call it a story. It\'s similar to Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star. There isn\'t really a story revolved around the show, it\'s just random fun every episode. It\'s good to take a break from the big storylines every once in a while, but I would have liked to see at least some plot take place at one point in the show.When I watched the anime, I was apparently watching the censored version. How could I tell, you may ask? Pixels over pictures, beeps over voices, pretty much what you\'d find in a normal sitcom these days. It was good for quite a few laughs, and saving me the expense of looking at what a vibrator looks like. Thank God for that. The artwork was good overall. I liked the character designs, especially Suzu\'s, her amazingly small figure makes it funny to watch her yell at everyone for calling her a kid when she is in fact 16.Really good voice acting. I liked the voice actors and actresses that took part in making this anime possible, and I thank them for that. They handled their roles really well, and the humor they put out for the show was awesome. Pure genius!Poor Tsuda. He\'s probably the most mature one in the entire ensemble, due to the fact he\'s able to keep a straight face and not freak out most of the time when a sex reference is brought up. It\'s those calm characters that can handle situations like that that make me love shows like this. It\'s also kind of interesting how instead of the guys making all those references, it\'s the women. You\'d expect guys to do that, and girls would be too innocent to say anything like that, but it\'s all switched in this. Shino seems to take everything the wrong way, but she also brings the humor to the anime. Suzu is what turns people into Loli-Lovers. 16 years old with an IQ of 180, and yet, she\'s only 4\'6"". That\'s amazingly short. But she was my personal favorite character in the entire show, and I liked how the ""Suzu\'s Head"" arrow would start flailing around when the camera would go over her head. Aria... beautiful, rich, erotic dreamer... 2 of the 3 seem normal for one of the protagonists. That\'s right, I was referring to beautiful and erotic dreamer (not really). Her imagination takes thing to a whole new level in the anime universe, and it makes you wonder what these people were like as kids. I\'d guess that they were pretty much the exact same, but I can\'t really picture a 6 year old reading a XXX magazine.Constant laughs and enjoyment. I haven\'t ever seen an anime quite like this, it was totally worth watching if you\'re looking for something in the Comedy dept., so I would recommend this to anyone that loves to laugh. Those who get uncomfortable with any mention of sex, steer clear. Just don\'t watch it. You\'ll be more uncomfortable then you\'ve ever been in your life. But those who don\'t mind for it, I challenge you to watch it. mature, and hilarious above all.

They got the last part right, but these girls are what make the show for mature audiences only. Constant sexual references about intercourse, jerking off, feminine hygiene products... and every single reference makes me refuse to stop laughing. Tsuda gets put on the Student Council, and that\'s where the story begins... if you can actually call it a story. It\'s similar to Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star. There isn\'t really a story revolved around the show, it\'s just random fun every episode. It\'s good to take a break from the big storylines every once in a while, but I would have liked to see at least some plot take place at one point in the show.When I watched the anime, I was apparently watching the censored version. How could I tell, you may ask? Pixels over pictures, beeps over voices, pretty much what you\'d find in a normal sitcom these days. It was good for quite a few laughs, and saving me the expense of looking at what a vibrator looks like. Thank God for that. The artwork was good overall. I liked the character designs, especially Suzu\'s, her amazingly small figure makes it funny to watch her yell at everyone for calling her a kid when she is in fact 16.Really good voice acting. I liked the voice actors and actresses that took part in making this anime possible, and I thank them for that. They handled their roles really well, and the humor they put out for the show was awesome. Pure genius!Poor Tsuda. He\'s probably the most mature one in the entire ensemble, due to the fact he\'s able to keep a straight face and not freak out most of the time when a sex reference is brought up. It\'s those calm characters that can handle situations like that that make me love shows like this. It\'s also kind of interesting how instead of the guys making all those references, it\'s the women. You\'d expect guys to do that, and girls would be too innocent to say anything like that, but it\'s all switched in this. Shino seems to take everything the wrong way, but she also brings the humor to the anime. Suzu is what turns people into Loli-Lovers. 16 years old with an IQ of 180, and yet, she\'s only 4\'6"". That\'s amazingly short. But she was my personal favorite character in the entire show, and I liked how the ""Suzu\'s Head"" arrow would start flailing around when the camera would go over her head. Aria... beautiful, rich, erotic dreamer... 2 of the 3 seem normal for one of the protagonists. That\'s right, I was referring to beautiful and erotic dreamer (not really). Her imagination takes thing to a whole new level in the anime universe, and it makes you wonder what these people were like as kids. I\'d guess that they were pretty much the exact same, but I can\'t really picture a 6 year old reading a XXX magazine.Constant laughs and enjoyment. I haven\'t ever seen an anime quite like this, it was totally worth watching if you\'re looking for something in the Comedy dept., so I would recommend this to anyone that loves to laugh. Those who get uncomfortable with any mention of sex, steer clear. Just don\'t watch it. You\'ll be more uncomfortable then you\'ve ever been in your life. But those who don\'t mind for it, I challenge you to watch it.', ""This is one of the most hilarious anime i have ever seen. If you want to really get a good laugh, please do not hesitate to watch this anime as it is really funny.Story:NILThis anime has absolute no plot at all. Maybe just a some events linking to the later episodes but I am absolute that even if you watch the episode half-way, it wouldn't affect anything. However, a anime without any plot to be this good is not something really common.Art:6/10I admit that I immediately left this anime the first time i watched it after about 5 minutes because the...art isn't really very desirable. It kind of gives me a feeling of lethargy. When i first started that anime, I was already quite tired. Additionally, since it was my first time watching this anime the art instantly made me even more tired and I left this anime after 5 minutes.Sound:7/10Probably one of the main aspect that makes the anime really hilarious. Think of those sounds that would probably tickle you a bit. That's the sound you get when you watch this anime which contributes to the light-hearted anime.Character:8/10The characters are seriously, insanely funny. No joke. I dare say everyone in this anime has a really funny role to play. I really mean every character. Be it the main or the subs, they all had a role to really tickle me when I watch this anime.Enjoyment:8/10I really enjoy this anime because it can seriously and instantly brighten up anyone's moody day. With just one episode, I was instantly back to my normal self despite feeling a little depressed earlier. The jokes are funny to a certain extent. Warning: Most of the jokes are practically all dirty. You get what I mean. Dirty. I even went to the point when I google some stuffs to get what the joke is about and learnt some new vocabulary. Watch at your own risk, especially if your parents are really strict about things like that.If you are feeling a little moody today, you can check out this anime because I think the jokes inside can cheer you up at least by a little.

Quantity should never supersede quality. Unfortunately, it appears this show's writers missed the memo. I'll grant that, as a non-Japanese speaker, it seems at the very least that some 'good' jokes that can't be translated went over my head, but at this point, it may not have made a difference.Story 4/10:The basic storyline is about as cut-and-dried as any other. Stop me if you've heard this one before. A slice of life high school anime about a male protagonist -...the only person with common sense of course - surrounded by a harem of girls (a tsundere, an obnoxiously nice girl, a nerd, an annoyingly high pitched little sister) who are forced together by some sudden and random event but quickly become close friends over the course of the school year. Basically, the vanilla ice cream of anime.Of course, however, there is the twist! That being that every five seconds, a character makes some unnecessary and unprovoked sex joke.At first, the jokes are cute. They aren't necessarily belly-achers, but they're relatively amusing. Mostly it's nose exhales, but every now and then you may even let out an under-the-breath chuckle. By episode 2, you're just asking for it all to end.Here's a little taste of what the jokes may sound like (btw I literally just clicked a random episode and went to a random timestamp because that's how often and pattern-like the jokes are):*Someone spills tea on other girl's phoneGirl: Oh no... it's okay. This phone is waterproof. That's why it stays fine even if you put it 'inside'.......So, like me, you may be wondering: where is the joke? Indeed, 'putting it inside' is certainly a sexual innuendo. Congratulations, the show mentioned something sexual. But... where is the punchline? Where is the clever writing? That's the thing. It doesn't exist. Almost every joke is simply a throwaway line about some sex-related thing.Art 6/10:The animators tried their best to build off of what little material they were given. There was nothing particularly outstanding, but the art certainly complimented the jokes as best they could.Sound 6/10:Again, nothing particularly good or bad. It felt fitting for the context of the show.Character 3/10:The two best characters of the show, Tsuda and Suzu, were the only two not constantly making sex jokes. Who would have guessed. Even then, every character could pretty much be boiled down to one or two personality/physical traits that defined their character throughout the entirety of the run time. Aria, that one girl who constantly talks about masturbation. Suzu, the girl that is very short and very smart. Hata, the girl who is a perv that sells questionable photos of others and inexplicably misrepresents others in the school newspaper. Mitsuba, that judo girl. The predatory female teacher. The list goes on.Ironically, the best parts of the show came when characters weren't attempting unfunny sex jokes but actually just earnestly and genuinely interacting with each other. Unfortunately, these interactions are far too sparse and infrequent to invoke any emotional impact.Enjoyment 3/10:I tallied the number of times I laughed during the show. Four times. That also ended after episode 4.Overall 4/10:If you don't understand Japanese, don't even bother. Even if you do, I still wouldn't get my hopes up. This is a show that thinks itself clever but ultimately boils down to the eastern equivalent of 'that's what she said' jokes. Funny.

At the time of writing this review, this is the only anime I've ever dropped, and I will try to explain why.Let's start off with the story, which is not there, there is no story. It's the most generic high-school scenery someone can come up with, and nothing happened in the 8 episodes I watched. It is the same, every episode could be the first one, and there is no development at all.Speaking about development, the characters are the most shallow ones I've seen so far. Now I see what the...point of this anime was, the 'plot' wasn't supposed to be interesting, it's more about 'comedy' if anything. Comedy which didn't work on me.Now I wouldn't call myself a snob, but this anime was below my level. I can enjoy comedy, and even ecchi, although I'm not a fan of it, can be bearable if there's some reason for it. This however was not really apparent at all in this anime. I was constantly wondering whether or not I was supposed to laugh at the same sexual innuendo's that get thrown around all the time. It's as if the writing happened by a twelve-year-old who just discovered what 'sex' is. Maybe it get's better in later seasons, I didn't have the patience to find out.The art and sound are alright, though not really good at all, maybe I couldn't enjoy it because I was already somewhat pissed off, who knows.Overall though, even though I wouldn't call this anime good in any way, I can see it having some sort of appeal to a very specific group of people. A group of people I'm not part of. I'm sure there are worse shows out there, this simply has been my first encounter with an anime I think is dreadful. Whether or not you should watch this is something you can decide for yourself. If you enjoy the same iteration of sexual jokes, you might find this somewhat entertaining, for anything else, you're in the wrong place. point of this anime was, the 'plot' wasn't supposed to be interesting, it's more about 'comedy' if anything.

Can't really write a long review about this anime.

REALLY messed up jokes about strange sex ideals and weird little things....like the suggestion box O_O...haha if you're in for a good laugh, take a look at this.

The unique thing about the show is how the girls are the ones making the perverted jokes, giving you a very different feel of the girls act compared to other series (or perhaps closer to RL). Every other males in the series is almost non-existent (I forgot if I ever seen one) so there\'s a hint of harem, but it\'s not like that mattered for the show anyway.There\'s a brief sequence in the beginning showing how Tsuda...got into the situation he landed himself in, but don\'t go thinking that the show actually have any real story; Any form of plot goes as far as the first episode and the rest of the show is a series of perverted tsukkomi-boke routine, with Tsuda delivering the witty comeback to every joke.The animation quality was mediocre.

Having no overarching plot, this show does not have to follow the conventional methods of character development. This show also has witty and clever play with words, which always end up with great perversion.Story - 5: Having no plot, SYD is very unpredictable; the audience won't know what would happen in the next episode (if you don't watch the preview that is). However, in my personal opinion, this adds to the excitement of watching it. Some shows I have watched (with an overarching plot) are so predictable and cliched, that...I just end up skipping to the last few episode and not bother with the episodes in between.Art - 7: SYD does not have the most detailed characters or the best drawings, however the simplicity adds to the humour, especially during the shows 'punch-line' scenes.Character - 10: The characters in this show is the absolute best. The main four characters are Takatoshi Tsuda, Shino Amakusa, Suzu Hagimura, and Aria Shichijou, Shino being my personal favourite. This show uses humour common to the anime scene. By contrasting the perverted characters (Shino Amakusa and Aria Shichijou) with the 'straight' characters (Takatoshi Tsuda and Suzu Hagimura) this show is able to convey humour that is unique in anime. The characters in this show always have witty (possibly dirty) comments up their sleeve. Sometimes I even expect one after every dialogue.Enjoyment - 10: Overall, SYD is a very enjoyable show. This show doesn't require a brain to watch, all you need is a strong diaphragm and a dirty mind.Overall - 9: When this show and its sequel was still airing, I was eagerly waiting for it every week; downloading it as soon as I see it online.If you like this show I also recommend:Mangaka-san to Assistant-san toHentai Ouji Warawanai Neko [HenNeko] I just end up skipping to the last few episode and not bother with the episodes in between.Art - 7: SYD does not have the most detailed characters or the best drawings, however the simplicity adds to the humour, especially during the shows 'punch-line' scenes.Character - 10: The characters in this show is the absolute best.

Don’t get me wrong – I was laughing like a damn maniac every episode because the things they say, or the puns they make, or the irony of the situation is just too hilarious. This anime really did make me laugh like no other one has. The only problem really is their way of doing so: sex jokes. That’s right, of every element known to man that has any comedic value sex jokes was the way they decided to go. And you know what? It was not even half bad. I'd recommend it...to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. But be warned: it may be a little uncomfortable if you can't handle it. Nonetheless, its a great show. Just fantastic.Story:The story is very simple: boy goes to school, gets stopped by student official, is forced into joining their club, and then becomes very good friends with all the new people of the club. So essentially, he goes to school, is tagged for wearing his uniform in a sloppy manner, and then is forced into the club (in this case, the student council). Except you get much more than you thought you would. Of the three girls, Shino Amakuza is the perverted but exceptionally smart president. Aria Shichijou is the beautiful, rich ditzy girl who spaces out almost all the time, but she IS second best at school behind the president. Suzu Hagimura is super smart, the genius of the school, but is barely standing at 4 feet tall. Maybe even less. You can’t help but love the blend of characters.Art:This was probably the biggest flaw, as it was a big factor in why this series didn’t get a higher score. The animation was good. But that’s all. It was good. There where some parts where if you freeze frame, you see a grotesque image of facial features (nose, mouth, eyes) too far to the left, or too close together, or too far down. But when they move, it all goes back. So all in all, the animation is not bad. But I definitely think that the producers could’ve put more thought into it.Sounds:Ahh. The entrance was just great. Even from the first episode, the intro was very fun and childish and it just wasn’t as serious as the intro’s of most of the anime that I’ve been watching. So it was a nostalgic feeling I got from hearing the intro. And at just over a minute long, its worth it. I recommend you watch it at least once. But I gotta tell you, I watched it every chance I could.Characters:This is probably the best part. The characters are wayyyyy wacky, and I just couldn’t get over it. The inner machination of their minds is a complete mystery. You can’t say you like the rain, because then one says that it nicely camouflages the sound of masturbating. You can’t say you like it either, because then the other would say that you can’t safely masturbate because the rain makes it hard to hear who is approaching you. Odd? Yes. And the poor guy just cant win. What’s good is that they’re in groups. You’ve got the President and Shichijou being the perverted weirdos, and you’ve got Tsuda and Hagimura who are always combating what they say and attempting to keep the norm.  They honestly all made even the perverted uncomfortable stuff watchful. I can’t tell you how hard these characters made me laugh. Schichijou is so damn adorable, because she’s rich, and thus, clueless. Not to say all people are clueless, but when you’re spacing out on the stairs for a few good minutes, then come to the realization that the school doesn’t have escalators like you’re accustomed to – yeah, that persons pretty much an idiot. The first time I saw her space out I was laughing hysterically and had to re-watch it about 5 times. I’m not a big fan of anything over ecchi unless I’m prepared for it or unless it is relevant to the story. In this case, it was relevant to the personality of the characters. They made it truly enjoyable.Enjoyment:I can’t tell you just how much I enjoyed this show. This show is seriously the first time I started laughing like a damn maniac. I felt like such an idiot, but I couldn’t stop. It was definitely one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. I honestly loved it. This is seriously recommended to someone who is MATURE. Not an age rank, but someone who can handle the amount of perverseness in here. If you’re uncomfortable with vibes or sexual innuendos, then turn away. It’s funny, but you need to be mature enough to get the jokes and know what’s meant to be funny and what isn’t.Flaws:The only flaw is the main plot for mostly everything: ecchi. Every episode has a perverted character in it. I’m not a huge fan of pervertedness, and so I didn’t really like the premise for the jokes, but it wasn’t all that bad. All in all, it’s a great show, recommended for anyone who wants to have a good laugh. to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. But be warned: it may be a little uncomfortable if you can't handle it. Nonetheless, its a great show. Just fantastic.Story:The story is very simple: boy goes to school, gets stopped by student official, is forced into joining their club, and then becomes very good friends with all the new people of the club. So essentially, he goes to school, is tagged for wearing his uniform in a sloppy manner, and then is forced into the club (in this case, the student council). Except you get much more than you thought you would. Of the three girls, Shino Amakuza is the perverted but exceptionally smart president. Aria Shichijou is the beautiful, rich ditzy girl who spaces out almost all the time, but she IS second best at school behind the president. Suzu Hagimura is super smart, the genius of the school, but is barely standing at 4 feet tall. Maybe even less. You can’t help but love the blend of characters.Art:This was probably the biggest flaw, as it was a big factor in why this series didn’t get a higher score. The animation was good. But that’s all. It was good. There where some parts where if you freeze frame, you see a grotesque image of facial features (nose, mouth, eyes) too far to the left, or too close together, or too far down. But when they move, it all goes back. So all in all, the animation is not bad. But I definitely think that the producers could’ve put more thought into it.Sounds:Ahh. The entrance was just great. Even from the first episode, the intro was very fun and childish and it just wasn’t as serious as the intro’s of most of the anime that I’ve been watching. So it was a nostalgic feeling I got from hearing the intro. And at just over a minute long, its worth it. I recommend you watch it at least once. But I gotta tell you, I watched it every chance I could.Characters:This is probably the best part. The characters are wayyyyy wacky, and I just couldn’t get over it. The inner machination of their minds is a complete mystery. You can’t say you like the rain, because then one says that it nicely camouflages the sound of masturbating. You can’t say you like it either, because then the other would say that you can’t safely masturbate because the rain makes it hard to hear who is approaching you. Odd? Yes. And the poor guy just cant win. What’s good is that they’re in groups. You’ve got the President and Shichijou being the perverted weirdos, and you’ve got Tsuda and Hagimura who are always combating what they say and attempting to keep the norm.  They honestly all made even the perverted uncomfortable stuff watchful. I can’t tell you how hard these characters made me laugh. Schichijou is so damn adorable, because she’s rich, and thus, clueless. Not to say all people are clueless, but when you’re spacing out on the stairs for a few good minutes, then come to the realization that the school doesn’t have escalators like you’re accustomed to – yeah, that persons pretty much an idiot. The first time I saw her space out I was laughing hysterically and had to re-watch it about 5 times. I’m not a big fan of anything over ecchi unless I’m prepared for it or unless it is relevant to the story. In this case, it was relevant to the personality of the characters. They made it truly enjoyable.Enjoyment:I can’t tell you just how much I enjoyed this show. This show is seriously the first time I started laughing like a damn maniac. I felt like such an idiot, but I couldn’t stop. It was definitely one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. I honestly loved it. This is seriously recommended to someone who is MATURE. Not an age rank, but someone who can handle the amount of perverseness in here. If you’re uncomfortable with vibes or sexual innuendos, then turn away. It’s funny, but you need to be mature enough to get the jokes and know what’s meant to be funny and what isn’t.Flaws:The only flaw is the main plot for mostly everything: ecchi. Every episode has a perverted character in it. I’m not a huge fan of pervertedness, and so I didn’t really like the premise for the jokes, but it wasn’t all that bad.

And that is it.There are huge number of sex related jokes. I wouldn't call them dirty just smutty. It is generally the kind of thing you find funny or you don't. Most of the dialogue is there to build up to a sex related joke where there is a deliberate misunderstanding or it is just shameless.Fortunately the jokes are delivered by some good characters with some decent voice acting many of which are standard anime fair, the almost tsundere school president, rich girl with large breasts, short but intelligent girl obsessed by her height, irresponsible teacher, emotionally stunted president of the newspaper club who is more paparazzi than journalist and hyperactive younger sister and of course Tsuda who is the straight man.

Seitokai Yakuindomo in a nutshell.If you\'re looking for a hysterical, perverted, pure for-laughs-only anime, you\'ve found it. If you\'re looking for a lot of fan-service, heavy romance, or ecchi, look somewhere else, as this show avoids visual adult humor. Your view of sexual humor will utterly influence your enjoyment of this show. If you appreciate it, it\'s fantastic. If not, it\'s terrible.Unusual in that most all of the jokes come directly and intentionally from the female cast, who represent a different fetish each, the show is surprisingly enjoyable. Despite the immature content, it doesn\'t really come off as low-brow; most of the...humor comes from wordplay and misunderstandings. Yet if you really just can\'t stand inappropriate innuendos or any no-filter dick jokes, then you might give this one a pass. Otherwise it\'s a great interlude between your more serious dramas and it\'s really easy to drop and pick up at your leisure.There isn\'t much of a story to push the characters along, being very much slice-of-life. It often changes scenes pretty quickly, to move onto the next joke or pun. This left me a little bored in the few scenes when there wasn\'t a joke, but that was between laughing my ass off from great writing, so it\'s not much of a downside. Unfortunately sometimes there is a bit lost in translation to English, but the sub does a decent job to explain anything that would be otherwise lost. Well enough that despite the lost timing of the joke, you still can chuckle a little.Overall this show is a great laugh and I recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of humor, but don\'t expect a compelling story or anything serious. humor comes from wordplay and misunderstandings.

Not for the hardcore anime viewers that write 10 page long essays on a single misplayed note of an OST which had a sound wave 1 Hz shorter than it should have been.Be wary; this is my first and probably only review ever (嘘).As you can see from my overall score of this anime, I have thoroughly enjoyed this show. The sex jokes, the innuendos, the characters, the \'ecchi\' scenes. Loved every second of it. Hell, I\'ve even watched the whole series multiple times and still laugh at the jokes (immaturity at its finest).Right, lets lay this out like a proper review.Story:...6I have given it a 6 for story, although it probably only deserves a 4 at best. There is little to no \'real\' story to this. Every episode is just crammed full of perverted scenes. To be honest, it\'s actually quite difficult to keep track of the chronological order of things (ending of Seitokai Yakuindomo*). Although there is no actual story, it was fun watching the day to day life of Tsuda as he goes through school trying to take as little notice as possible of the immature minds of his senpai in the School Council.Art: 8Honestly, I\'m not sure how I\'m supposed to rate artwork and animation. The art of this show does not displease me, however it isn\'t exactly Fate/Zero or Steins;Gate or even Monogatari level artwork. I guess my overall score for it would be 8.Sound: 8Again, first time review, not sure what to talk about here. Didn\'t really notice any blank spaces of sound during the show and the light happy-go-lucky background music was delightful to listen to.I guess I should also add in Character voice actors/actresses into this section.Seitokai Yakuindomo, in my personal opinion, has perfect seiyuu for each character.Yoko Hikasa (Rias Gremory, Mio Akiyama seiyu) voices the part of the school council president, Shino Amakusa, perfectly. The slightly controlling tone of a club president matches Shino\'s voice brilliantly.Satomi Sato (Ritsu Tainaka, Wendy Marvell seiyu) voices the part of the airhead ojousama, Aria Shichijou. The slight \'airiness\' (I guess) of her voice fits the personality of the beloved school council secretary.Sayuri Yahagi (many supporting characters seiyu...) voices the returning student with 180 IQ able to speak perfectly in English and do 10 digit sums in her head... but she doesn\'t have a body anywhere near that of a 16 year old. Suzu Hagimura. To be fair, her voice as Suzu is either love or hate. I for one, think that it is befitting of the character. Some may disagree and say that it is too high pitched.Character: 10I have covered some of the qualities of the 3 main female students in the \'Sound\' section.Shino Amakusa, the school council president is the perfect female. Good manners, good at sports, best grades of her year. However, her mind isn\'t fully out of puberty yet. Over the course of the anime, we get small hints of developing feelings that she might have for Tsuda. However, being a fully comedic anime, this hasn\'t really blossomed into a relationship.Aria Shichijou, the school council secretary. Good grades, good manners, good at sports and also good looking. She comes from a rich family. But she\'s a bit of an airhead, too used to the comforts of her own home, as can be seen when she stands in front of a set of stairs for a while before realizing that it isn\'t an escalator. Or standing in front of sliding doors before Tsuda reminds her that they aren\'t automatic. She seems to have the same immature mindset as the president.Suzu Hagimura, the school council accountant. ""I\'m a returning student with an IQ of 180! I speak fluent English, and can easily do 10 digit calculations in my head! The student council wanted to use my talents and recruited me as an accountant! Now, Will you stop treating me like a kid?"" This introduction of her in the anime perfectly describes her. Usually, only the top of her head is shown when the characters stand up beside each other. Or sometimes she isn\'t even in the shot but there\'s an arrow pointing down stating her position. I find this hilarious xDTakatoshi Tsuda, the school council vice-president. From the very beginning of the anime, it is actually unclear what his personality is like. He dressed improperly for his first day of school and was stopped by Shino before being recruited in to the school council. Eventually, we find out that he is quite a hard worker (as shown when he cleans the bathroom until it shone) but sometimes gets distracted easily (he was actually supposed to do school council work until his sister asked him to clean the bathroom). It may seem as though he has a harem due to the fact that 99% of the other characters seem to be female, however, relationships between him and any of the girls are not really discussed throughout the anime unless for comedic purposes.Side/minor characters. Some characters such as Hata Ranko from the newspaper club who seems to permanently hold on to her camera so that she can find a \'scoop\' to sell. Monotonous voice and bland eyes go extremely well with her character due to the contrast between her features and the things she talks about. Kotomi Tsuda, the little sister of Takatoshi who seems to be a bro-con or at least is veeeeery perverted. Affectionately calls Takatoshi \'Taka-nii\'. Uomi, the school council president of Eiryou high school. In SYD*, she becomes Takatoshi\'s cousin in-law. She seems to have some sort of feelings towards Tsuda and constantly discusses/compete for him with Shino. There are a few others, such as the androphobic Kaede Igarashi, a member of the disciplinary committee, the borderline sex offender (not that guys would say no to sex with a hot teacher) Yokoshima-sensei, Mutsumi Mitsuba, the president of the judo club (whom also seems to have some feelings towards Tsuda.... ok, I think all club presidents have a thing for him...) and then finally, the maid of the Shichijou household, Sayaka Dejima (as perveted, if not more, than Aria Shichijou. Dejima is constantly trying to get a hold of anything that Aria has bathed in, worn on or slept in.Enjoyment: 10This anime was a nice break from a few serious/feels shows (Steins;Gate, Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, Kokoro Connect to name a few) and I constantly go back to it for fast relief of stress.Overall: 10I hope that one more season of Seitokai Yakuindomo will be released. Overall, this anime is brilliant for those of us seeking a rest from the darker, psychological anime.Thank you for reading, check out my profile for a look at my other top anime and leave a comment there if you have any questions.

"", ""Seitokai Yakuindomo is a slice of life school comedy with little plot that focuses largely on making rapid-fire sexual innuendo jokes.

The basic premise in a nutshell is that normal high school student is forced to join the Student Council in a school which was previously an all-girls shcool is now co-ed. Seems straightforward enough. However, the real charm and main attraction of the show is its cast of characters and how incredibly the perverted the jokes are without being an ecchi series.The Good: Like previously mentioned, the show features an interesting cast of characters. Tsuda, who is our main character, acts like the straight-man of the series, usually replying with a quick retort or clever reaction. Shino, our...student council president, is one of the many sources of perverted-ness in the series. She will often make sexual references in attempt of humor. Aria, our other perverted character, will often say some outrageous sexual remarks, and the weird thing is that unlike Shino, Aria means it because of how dense and how much of an airhead she is. Finally, our beloved Suzu, the loli tsundere series, will also act like the straight-man of the show along with Tsuda, but the show always comments on her height because she is abnormally, yer adorably small for her age. The humor is hit or miss. The cast will either say something really clever or something really predictable. At most you will will get a few LOL moments, but most of the jokes will get a chuckle or even a smile from you.The art is rather simple and fits the the nature of the show. For perverted show, there was hardly ever any fanservice scenes, which is quite surprsing.The Meh: The music isn't to outstanding. I personally didn't like the opening song or ending song, and the background music isn't anything special. You will most likely just skip the OP and ED sequences because of how generic they are, but if you like this type of music, then by all means go ahead. The story is kind of non-existent. The story will sometimes try to have heart-felt moments, but it will hardly do anything to you unless you grew some attachment to some of the characters. The structure is kind of weird also. Based off a 4-koma manga, scenes usually last around 2-5 mintues, each ending in a joke, then quickly transitions to another scene, prepping up another joke. It isn't a fast paced series, each episode will revolve around a theme, whether it's a field trip episode or a festival episode, and just use that to set up jokes. And like said before, the humor is hit or miss. Some will episodes will be hilarious, while others will be slow and gather a few chuckles here and there.The series does enough to differentiate itself from other shows. I have to give credit that for a show about perverted teenagers (and some adults) it doesn't rely on fanservice, boob-shots, panty-shots, or anything of the sort. Instead it relies on it's interesting cast to deliver the jokes, followed by a clever comeback. This series isn't for everyone, but if you are looking for a simple series to pass the time, Seitokai Yakuindomo will fill in that space. However, this isn't the type of series you can't marathon becuase due to the nature of the series, one can only handle so much perverted-ness unlike our main man Tsuda student council president, is one of the many sources of perverted-ness in the series.

I had some problems understanding certain jokes too, but I certainly enjoyed it, cos of the execution of the script and certain background sounds during the scenes.Story:This is basically a gag series, specialising in sexual and sarcastic jokes. The sarcastic jokes are mainly targeted at Suzu though. Other than that are feelings of harmony between the Seitokai members and some undertones of love.I remembered that...the first ep was a little hard to take as the presentation style was rather unique, compared to other 4-koma adaptations I\'ve seen. But from ep 2, somehow the \'intervals\' didn\'t bother me much anymore. But till the end of the show I still dun get the purpose of many of the \'intervals\' inserted between scenes within an episode.And yeah, most of the content inside are sexual parodies or puns, so if you\'re not into that kind of thing this series might be offensive or alien to you. Whatever it is, it\'s best to take some scenes with a pinch of salt, and pls dun flame this show if you dun like it.Art:7Average. There weren\'t much scenes to flaunt animation skills since most of the scenes were rather dialogue-based.Sound:Voice acting was quite good, esp for Tsuda and Shino. Background music was quite good too, and OP and ED was good, but I prefer OP.Character:Characters were ok, not too unique. Suzu in particular reminds me of the small girl in Working!, and Tsuda the straight guy, similar to Takanashi in Working!.Shino reminds me of Medaka in Medaka Box, but to a less extreme extent.Character development was present, though in small doses each time. For example, we could see feelings being developed, and greater harmony between the SYD members. Also, some personalities were developed in certain scenes.Enjoyment:9Well it\'s good and reminds me a lot of B Gata H Kei. Ecchi-comedy at its best in sexual puns, for this series. Other stuff in this series is also not bad, like the stalker photographer etc.Overall:9IMO, the best anime in summer 2010 season.

"", 'IN SHORT, this is what Seitokai Yakuindomo + the sequels are:96% referencing sexual terms and non-veg jokes[The measure of this appearing is every 14.75 seconds]1% making fun of Suzu\'s height1% Idiocy of other characters2% Tsuda\'s reaction to all this nonsense.The best part is the last one :3It\'s episodic but jokes can continue in further episodes....I misunderstood it as a harem, fan-servicing to make up for it\'s bad jokes sorta anime, but it\'s none of those. Never did I find this anime to be vulgar. The male lead doesn\'t chance upon ""opportunities""; he infact has to remain calm and mature to balance with the rest of the characters ""energy"" and ""enthusiasm"" and it\'s quite an entertainment to see that!Even if you don\'t like ecchi talks, being open to them is plenty! If you do, you\'ve come to the right place.There is no story as such...it mainly revolves around the activities of the Student Council. They are, ofcourse, highschool students so they pass into the next year and will graduate eventually.Characters:1 male, 2-3 males in the background, everything else is a girl.

If you smell a hint of harem and sexual innuendos, you're half right! This anime is the epitome of sex jokes and references. It's a comedy anime, with the set up as aforementioned, but revolves almost entirely around sexual jokes and word play. It will actually take you by surprise how much sexual jokes...and references they can make. Many are clever or completely unexpected, and being that Tsuda is really the only male character (and he's the only NORMAL character), it's the GIRLS that are making these weird jokes. I don't even know how I would react if a female friend casually said some of the stuff to me that was said to Tsuda in this anime!In all honesty, I actually found it rather funny; although, I also found the barrage of constant sexual jokes also a bit tiring. If you're at an age where sex is a new/primary interest of yours, then you will find this anime especially funny and entertaining; that's probably why I didn't appreciate the comedy as much as other's did (I sound old, but I'm only 19). I still enjoyed the anime though, as it was something I had never seen before and the jokes were still moderately comedic and clever.There wasn't much in ways of story, the anime is mostly just meant to make you laugh. Each episode is sporadic and deals with completely different things than the previous one. All the anime needs is the set up from the first episode, and then things take off from there. Just Like clothes. (Just kidding. Whoops, now I'm making unnecessary sexual jokes too. Seitokai Yakuindomo got to me)The art was pretty average for an anime. It's of a standard that I like, but there wasn't anything that would set it apart as spectacular. It was good, but not great. But I kind of feel like that was the point; the characters weren't really meant to stand out visually, but their personalities were, and OH BOY DID THEIR PERSONALITIES STAND OUT.The characters are what really set the anime off. Tsuda is the most 'normal' character, and the one we can relate too. Basically everyone else is over-sexual, short of Suzu Hagimura (emphasis on SHORT). The way they act and react to each other is what really makes the anime funny. Shino Amakusa, the President of the Student Council, and Aria Schichijo, the Secretary, are the ones who make the most ridiculous and clever sexual jokes. There are also some less sexual secondary characters, like Mitsuba Mutsumi or Kaede Igarashi, and they are enjoyable in their own right. My personal favorite character was Ranko Hata; something about her monotone way of speaking, but extreme personality, was just absolutely hilarious and entertaining for me.Overall, you'd watch this anime for a good laugh, especially if you find sexual references funny. But this anime is the bane of your existence if you hate perverted references. Overall, it was an enjoyable short anime, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a purely comedic anime. and references they can make.

That aside;Story: 8/10Seitokai Yakuindomo a school comedy that revolves around a student council and the absurd and sometimes bizarre sex jokes. The story isn't anything spectacular, and there is no plot development. There are no story twists or unexpected turns. Like I said, the main focus in this anime is the outrageous and random perverted jokes thrown at you without a minute passing in between. I wasn't satisfied with the ending because of the lack of a relationship to form between any...of the main characters.Art: 9/10The art was very well done, especially the lighting. It was definitely enough to keep me interested in the show, not that the constant barrage of jokes wasn't enough.Sound: 9/10The sound was also very well done. The opening and ending, while not among my favorites, were very upbeat and fun. The voice acting wasn't half bad either, especially when they say the most obscene things in cute voices.Character: 8/10The cast is mostly you're typical group of characters, not really anything special. Except the main character, Tsuda, isn't the common, useless male lead with his mind in the gutter. While he has his moments, he is actually a pretty normal guy.Enjoyment: 8/10Even though mostly romance/comedies are my cup of tea, I actually really enjoyed this anime. I can't even begin to count how many times I laughed out loud at the bizarre comments made while the characters are drawn cutely while holding a thumbs-up. I don't think that the creators were trying to go anywhere past making you're jaw drop or stomach cramp from the absurd jokes.Overall: 8/10Being the first review for me to write, but most certainly not the first anime to watch, I'm not really sure what else to say. Overall, this is a good choice if you want to watch an anime with no plot and pure humor. I sure had some good laughs, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a funny anime. However, I don't recommend watching this late at night, because you're sure to wake the whole house with the sound of you falling out of your chair from laughter. of the main characters.Art: 9/10The art was very well done, especially the lighting.

Basically, a male (Tsuda), one of the very few, who attends a female-dominated school and is randomly chosen to be the male representative of the student council. From then on, everyday school life for him, which he once thought was to be normal, has now become strange. Since it\'s a school anime, there\'s really no story at all.Art & Sound- This is one of the first anime that I\'ve seen produced by GoHands and to be honest, they did quite a...good job. The character designs are particularly slim and stand out quite well. Nothing notably wrong with sound. The OPs and EDs are upbeat and I found nothing wrong with the VAs, so no problems there at all.Characters- What I find great about this anime is the characters. The female leads (Shino, Aria, Suzu) are pretty ""unique"". By ""unique"", I mean that although you can tell how their character is on the outside (especially Suzu), what makes them stand out is how they are on the inside. The supporting cast if notably great as well. I was a bit disappointed, though, that they don\'t appear as much as some supporting characters do in comedies. If you\'re looking for character development, expect to be disappointed because there\'s no drastic development with the characters whatsoever. Maybe just a little bit, but it\'s nothing that changes the show in a different way.Enjoyment- What I liked about Seitokai was the random humor thrown at me every episode. The main humor point in Seitokai was its perverted thoughts, but with a twist, it\'s the females doing that instead of the male lead. The opening, in particular, did that well and was something I\'ve honestly never seen before. Seitokai, however was not the first anime I\'ve seen where female characters are the ones who are perverted. While B Gata H Kei DID have female characters think perverted thoughts, most of it was pretty much forced and I couldn\'t find it funny at all. Seitokai, however, has it set up fairly random and unexpected, therefore, making it funny. Although, if you\'ve grown accustomed to the comedy, for example, you can expect a sex joke when it\'s coming, so you may either laugh or not. Overall, it\'s best to watch Seitokai at a steady pace.While Seitokai is not the best comedy out there, it is certainly one that stood out to me so far this year. It may not be the comedy for everyone due to its perversion, but give it an episode or two and find out if you\'ll like it. Most certainly, it\'ll surprise you like it did to me. good job.

Your a guy sitting at your computer, in your room alone? Suddenly you hear foot steps though, and your little sister barges in. You are caught off guard and slightly started, she didn\'t knock."" HA! Caught you masturbating huh?"", she asks. But no...you weren\'t...Aaaaaand that is what this show is pretty much like. Personally I think the anime is a little bit overrated so below I will give my personal thoughts.Hopefully you won\'t go into Seitokai Yakuindomo thinking it\'s a slice of life/comedy/ romance/school like me. And you might be disappointed.Story-6- Tsuda, is a male student who enrolls into a previously all-girls...school. (*GASP* OMG have we heard this before?). He joins the student council on the first day of school and we follow his adventures with his sempais from there.Aaaaaaaand, that\'s pretty much the whole plot of the story. Because yeah, this anime...no plot. The story is your old ""boy goes to previously all-girls school"" type. You might think that the anime has plunged straight toward a pitfall trap, but it doesn\'t. LUCKILY Tsuda is not the only guy at the all girls school, otherwise it\'d be a perfect harem. And the other guys (BARELY even mentioned in the anime) are the only reason keeping the story above a 5.Art-7- I watched in 1280, the art was OK. Like I like to say a lot. It wasn\'t OMG MIND BLOWING. At times it was slightly lacking though. Oh! I forget to mention, the one problem I had with the art. Tsuda (the main character)  has a little sister, THEY LOOK ****ING IDENTICAL *** IS THIS?Now now, calm down all of you. You might justify it with ""well they are related they will look alike"". HOWEVER, if you look closely.. Tsuda\'s little sister has the  EXACT same face and hair as Tsuda EXCEPT for 2 pigtails added on. This is not ""related, so they look alike this is: copy, past, add pigtails and hope viewers don\'t notice.Sound-6-The music for this anime was a big of a drag. The opening was annoying so I skipped it after the first time. The background sounds were simplistic but did their job. Voice acting at times was bland.Character-6- For Seitokai Yakuindomo, another one of its weak-spots is its characters. The characters, are not developed....like AT ALL past episode 1 school.

If you just want to relax and have fun without thinking too much, this is itStory:Seitokai Yakuindomo relies entirely on sex jokes. The whole damn thing is just sex jokes, and if there are some innocent times they're nothing but a setup for sex jokes. Despite this the anime doesn't even rely on fanservice to deliver them, using nothing but various features of Japanese language and culture to setup wordplays and possible...misunderstandingsFor those who don't really understand Japanese, quite a few of the jokes are more easily understood, but if you learn the language you'll catch on quite a few more, and more, and more. You can rewatch Seitokai Yakuindomo just for shits and giggles and figured out the jokes you didn't quite catch, it's hilariousSeitokai Yakuindomo also doesn't have any drama whatsoever. There's literally none of those. Nothing at all. The whole thing is just jokes, and more jokes, and more jokes.Finally, SYD isn't a derivative work. There are no references to get, there are no cross over characters, it's a work that can be fully appreciated simply by itself, unlike say Carnival PhantasmArt:The art is on the simpler side but works amazingly to capture that 4koma comedic style. It goes to show that more detail does not equal better, this anime would've been way worse if it got any more detailedSound:Each and every single voice fits their character perfectly, the OP is great, the BGM are also great. There are actually not that many BGM, you can hear them using the same BGM all the time but it works with the situation for some reason, probably because I'm laughing too hard to complainCharacter:The characters are simple and they simply don't change the entire time. Each and every single character is the same from start to finish, but that's why I like them. For a comedic slice of life it's perfect.Enjoyment:Watching SYD is pure joy, there's nothing else to describe it. The jokes are witty, plenty are understandable simply because they're visual misunderstandings, they also never drag on: responses are quick and characters move on almost immediately.

Not a single joke in this anime made me laugh. It feels as though a lot of it was lost in translation. there are many awkward silences left for people to laugh in but nothing actually funny has been said. Most of the humor must have been involving word play that didn't carry over because some characters would say one thing and then another would respond with something completely unrelated. Conversations finish and I'm left wondering what they were even talking about. One of the worst I've ever seen/finished. "", ""So I was looking for a good anime to watch and I came across this one.

It's quite funny and everything about it is amazing, except its decent story, but it is a slice of life anime, so i shouldn't judge its story too harshly.STORY- Simply put it's a slice of life anime so the story isn't that great. However, this doesn't mean the story is bad in any way.Story Score 7/10STORY ELEMENTS- This anime isn't classified as a romance but i wish it was. The anime does hint at romance a...lot, however not every episode. The comedy on the other hand is well though out. If you're not perverted yourself, you may have some trouble understanding its sexual innuendos.Romance Score 5/10Comedy Score 9/10CHARACTERS- The characters are amazing. I love them. They are well designed except for one problem, the females in the anime are WAY TOO Perverted. Almost all the female characters in the anime are overly perverted except for a few. However this is an anime based on sex jokes, so if the characters are not perverted it wouldn't really work. However they are mostly static throughout the anime.Character Score 9.25/10ART- The art is amazing. It may not be the most detailed but i like its art styles. The characters look amazing too.Art Score 10/10SOUND- The sound is also amazing. The voice actors are great and the music is truly amazing. For some reason the music in this anime sound very much like the music in Pokemon. Maybe because both of them use symphony music.Sound Score 10/10ENJOYMENT- I LOVE this anime. i really recommend this anime to almost anyone (unless they're not into sex jokes). This anime does so many things right, except for its mediocre story.I RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for:PervertsNormal peopleAlmost everyoneI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for:Non-pervertsPeople that get offended easilyAnime Rating 9.75/10Enjoyment rating 9/10Thanks For Reading and don't forget to click helpful if you thought my review was good!

They are well designed except for one problem, the females in the anime are WAY TOO Perverted. Almost all the female characters in the anime are overly perverted except for a few. However this is an anime based on sex jokes, so if the characters are not perverted it wouldn't really work. However they are mostly static throughout the anime.Character Score 9.25/10ART- The art is amazing. It may not be the most detailed but i like its art styles. The characters look amazing too.Art Score 10/10SOUND- The sound is also amazing. The voice actors are great and the music is truly amazing. For some reason the music in this anime sound very much like the music in Pokemon. Maybe because both of them use symphony music.Sound Score 10/10ENJOYMENT- I LOVE this anime. i really recommend this anime to almost anyone (unless they're not into sex jokes). This anime does so many things right, except for its mediocre story.I RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for:PervertsNormal peopleAlmost everyoneI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ANIME for:Non-pervertsPeople that get offended easilyAnime Rating 9.75/10Enjoyment rating 9/10Thanks For Reading and don't forget to click helpful if you thought my review was good! Have a nice day!"", ""This show won't be for everyone. It has no actual story plot, so its essentially a pure slice of life comedy. And that comedy is pretty much entirely sexual. So if you aren't into that, don't bother watching this, since that's pretty much all you'll be getting. But if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then you should absolutely check this out!Honestly, this was incredibly enjoyable and funny throughout. The sexual jokes take center stage, but the characters themselves also have certain quirks that distinguish them, and character interactions throughout this entire series adds more to the show. True, the characters wont necessarily...develop overtime, however, they aren't meant to. It becomes clear early on that that, along with the fact that there isn't a story, are intentional. The show is successful at being what it's trying to be: a slice of life (sexual) comedy. And just to be clear, the sexual jokes are mostly dialogue based, essentially like jokes we all made when we were younger. Unless you're currently younger, in which case it would be the jokes you're making now.One possible draw back can be that the jokes may begin to feel repetitive, which would be a fair thing to critique the show with, but I personally enjoyed this entire series (both seasons, OVAs, and the movie).:) develop overtime, however, they aren't meant to.

Slice-of-life just isn't my genre- I find it too boring. SYD, however, is not boring. It's a thoroughly entertaining, extremely funny (subjective) masterpiece.The writing is amazing, the animation is deceptively well-done, the visual comedy is superb, and the characters are extremely likable. I have almost no problems with this show at all, and I'm a nit-picking bastard.Seriously, pick this anime up. Even if you don't like slice-of-life, you have to try SYD. It's a 10 from me. "", 'What do feel toward Seitokai Yakuindomo with its ""sex jokes"" is already stated in one quote from Cromartie High School character, Yamaquchi Noboru. As i recall, in the 4th eps, when Ishikawa told a sex joke, Yamaguchi hit him while saying ""Why did i hit Ishiwaka? It\'s because he choose to tell sex jokes without thinking. This is typical pattern that someone with no sense of humor quickly falls into.""Seitokai Yakuindomo is what Yamaguchi has told before. Sex joke without thinking and quite repetitive. I\'m not saying that those who loves Seitokai Yakuindomo jokes are those who don\'t have sense of humor, but personally i...do think the same way as the previous quote. I don\'t like this kind of humor. I know that adult jokes have sex joke in it and it can be really funny. However, if it is repetitive and said/done in wrong moment, the mood would be ruined. That\'s what Seitokai Yakuindomo did.I would say that the art and sound is good, considering this anime is aired in 2010. The plot which is a story about some highschool students daily life, is a good component for comedy type anime. Some notable titles like GTO, Saiki, SKET Dance, Gin no Saji, and maybe currently airing Kaguya-sama show us that comedy and school are good combination. However, what Seitokai Yakuindomo did is a mistake. Completely ruin what could be a proper comedy school anime.I know that i\'ve only watched 2 eps of it, so i\'m quite sure the reader might think that my opinion isn\'t valid at all. However, it really takes so much to watch those two episode in which i barely laugh at all, then why would you continue to watch thing that doesn\'t entertain you at all? The only option is dropping it.Last, everyone has different sense of humor. So, if you like those kind of humor which i have stated before, go ahead watch this anime since that Seitokai Yakuindomo is. This could be warning sign for you who don\'t have that kind of taste.5/10 do think the same way as the previous quote. I don\'t like this kind of humor.

Seitokai Yakuindomo is set in a recently developed co-ed school wich can only lead to trouble. The MAIN charactor the brownhairduduewahtshisface is awesome the girls add an agressive lewd content to the show that mixes well with the comedy theme. Only points I disag fuck this it was a cool show to watch hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I did time to start season two Seitokai Yakuindomo* ', 'If you are like me, and likes to laugh hysterically at sexual jokes and references. Then this is the anime for you. It is overloaded with misinterpreted situations where anything you say can be turned either into a joke or a sexual reference. For me the funniest part of it is that the entire school used too be an all girl school, so every girl there talks VERY openly about their ""monthly cycle"" and other typical women issues, and the poor guys has to listen too all of it.overall an extremely enjoyable anime that makes you laugh within minutes. ', '""Seitokai Yakuindomo"" is about an all girls school recently made Co-Ed, 3 women on the student council, two with a very sexually active mind, and one who has an IQ of 180, can easily do 10 digit math problems in her head, and can speak fluent English as well as other languages.And 1 guy gets in the middle of it all after transferring to the school because it\'s close.After Shino Amakusa spots Tsuda with his tie loose ""Because you don\'t want to be seen as a loose man. I look tight, so I am not seen as a loose woman!"", after a comedic scene, she...basically forces him to join the student council for a male view on things.The rest are a bunch of jokes.Now, is that a bad thing?To me, no it is not.Story:What is story?We all know that there can be romance, military war, political battles, epic space warfare, battle of the wits, adventure, shojou, ect.But can story also be well written and well timed jokes as well?In this context, I would assume so, yes.The story of this anime is basically about the antics of these 4 people and all of the sexual humor you can throw a stick at.If you do not like jokes about sex, women, men, naughty situations, D*ck$, V@g*n@$, @$$, C*m (seriously), and B**bs.You may have a heart attack watching this show.I must mention, the story progression is directed in the same way as LuckyStar, where the scenes progress as joke by joke by joke, the scenes change by scene. It does not progress like a normal series.Here, it works very well, just like LuckyStar.Art:I actually liked the artwork in this production quite a lot.The backgrounds are generic, but detailed.The characters are drawn in an elongated fashion (Could be a new Seitokai Yakuindomo joke, if you catch my drift), but it fits the show very well.The choice of changing from basic anime look to chibi look when telling a really over the top joke, was hard to get use to at first, but you definitely get used to it after a couple epsiodes.Sound:The music is relaxing and fits whatever scene when it is needed very well, for comedic effect of course.The seiyuu are top notch in their talent here, especially in comedic timing and effect.The sound effects add to special comedic moments when needed, especially the jokes about man and woman juices.Character:Again, there can be a lot of character and no character at all.It all depends on your perspective.In my opinion there is a lot of character in this series, albeit perverted and more towards male fantasy, there\'s still character.""Shino Amakusa"" is the counsel President, and her mind is always fixated on finding the perverted in everyday activities. Especially when it comes to Tsuda, even though she actually likes him in the strange scenes that you will see them together in.""Aria Shichijou"" is basically Shino\'s rich and classy protege of sexual conversation, yet her sexual jokes are ""Quite heavy"" even for Shino.""Suzu Hagimura"" is the most mature of the bunch, she has an IQ of 180, can 10 digit math- ect. ect.But she has one problem that you may notice at the start of the show, she\'s about the size of a toddler.She is very sensitive about her height, and becomes quite angry when joked about being a child.""Takatoshi Tsuda"" is the UNfortunate target of sexual conversation, sounds like a good thing right? Well, not when they think you\'re a pervert who masturbates every time he goes to the bathroom, and if is late to a meeting, is probably having an affair with the teacher (Which would not be very hard to do with the counsel advisor, as I will explain in a second) in the next classroom.He\'s never annoyed enough by this to see the principal, or the police for that matter, but I digress.He\'s a very normal guy who is not interested in the Harem school life that the other guys in the school fantasize about.Naruko Yokoshima is the Student Counsel advisor, and a teacher at the school, she is (no surprise) a perverted woman with nothing on her mind but sex.It is quite ridiculous how much she thinks about it. She\'s even more perverted than a guy shooting himself up with testosterone on a treadmill getting drunk while getting a BJ. I\'m serious.And the things that she says are hilarious!She has a thing for younger guys though, so watch out, she may attack you, and trust me, you\'ll be running.Or at least that is how the show portrays her.All the extra characters you will see along the way are just as perverted (except for Naruko), so get ready for an avalanche of sexual humor.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this series.I enjoyed it a lot in fact.I was always excited to see a new episode.There are no points that will depress you, they just stay far enough from being offensive (For me at least), and the overall unique way the show is presented was very fun to watch.Overall:This is a show full, and I mean the glass is overflowing with sexual humor.If you ever wanted a show about woman who talk about sex in an over the top, comical way, this isn\'t just recommended, it is a must watch.Anyone who do not like sexual humor, and/or are easily offended by it, stay far away.Amazingly enough, Seitokai Yakuindomo it is not an Ecchi, even though there are probably 1,000 jokes about it in this show.I\'m perfectly fine with that, in fact, I welcome it.I for one, would love to see more if there ever will be.This show actually makes me want to read the manga too. basically forces him to join the student council for a male view on things.The rest are a bunch of jokes.Now, is that a bad thing?To me, no it is not.Story:What is story?We all know that there can be romance, military war, political battles, epic space warfare, battle of the wits, adventure, shojou, ect.But can story also be well written and well timed jokes as well?In this context, I would assume so, yes.The story of this anime is basically about the antics of these 4 people and all of the sexual humor you can throw a stick at.If you do not like jokes about sex, women, men, naughty situations, D*ck$, V@g*n@$, @$$, C*m (seriously), and B**bs.You may have a heart attack watching this show.I must mention, the story progression is directed in the same way as LuckyStar, where the scenes progress as joke by joke by joke, the scenes change by scene.

The comedy is fast-paced with almost 100% of it being sexual puns, word plays with double meanings. The series runs without an underlying plot, but does a fair job going into some of the characters backgrounds and personalities.~Story 6/10~There is no grand-underlying plot, it\'s just a show full of random events and jokes within a 9 month period. I am not disappointed in the randomness, but I am disappointed that there weren\'t any romantic strings being pulled throughout the series. There were a few spots here and there where romantic flags pop up but they...only last for a few seconds then it\'s back to sexual puns.~Art 8/10~The art is pretty good actually. It is a near perfect fit for this kind of random comedy show. The backgrounds are well detailed and the art style did not change  constantly, which is a big plus for me.The scene sequences are often the same ones you\'d see in almost every single anime show. A beach, a school/academy, giant mansion, an inn, you\'ll also go through an athletic festival  a cultural festival, entrance exams and an entrance ceremony. All in synch with other anime shows.You just know there will always have to be a beach scene, it just never fails to show up.~Sound 6/10~Although Dialogue was the main focus of this show, the dialogue was fast-paced all the time. As someone who isn\'t up-to-date on all the cultural references, I tend to have to read the notes that help explain the word play being used and by the time I get a few words of it read, the dialogue has already changed to something else.The word play and disjunct conversations between two or more people gets frustrating after a while. For example in an episode someone said, ""stand"", but instead someone interpreted it as ""penis."" That is the kind of word play you\'ll see and hear throughout the ENTIRE show. So, if that is your kind of humor, then enjoy.~Character 6/10~There was nothing very deep about the characters. Most were just shells of a complex personality. The characters are also not very unique in nature. There is a dense guy with common sense, a flawless female as student council president, a klutz with big breasts and a short genius girl.~Enjoyment 7/10~I often found myself frustrated and sighing because the pace was just took quick. I can read the subs pretty fast, but even the dialogue speed was took quick.The constant use of word play and sexual puns were just too much. At first it was appealing and acceptable, but by episode  8, I just had enough.But overall, I did enjoy the series for the most part and I would recommend this to others, especially those who love dirty jokes and dirty word play.[Subs Used :: Ayako] only last for a few seconds then it\'s back to sexual puns.~Art 8/10~The art is pretty good actually.

There is really no strong plot that drives us to keep on watching. Each episode may have one individual plot, and elements of other episodes do carry through, but in general, each episode is comprised of like 3-6 short ""specials"" that have the similarity of the main girls in the anime making sex jokes. It was funny at the beginning but became tedious to finish.The art was pretty good, the sound was meh, the characters were pretty good with their own personalities, the enjoyment was fair, and the...story was pretty mediocre.

But at the same time, I can not complain. This show makes me laugh, despite all the sexual innuendos in this program. I keep forgetting that these characters are kids in high school, so it does make it hard to take this show seriously.Still, if your a fan of this type of show, then I think you will like it. It\'s probably the goofiest show that I have seen so far.Favorite characters would have to be Hagimura and Shino. For some...reason, they remind me of most girls that I would always go to school with. Only difference is Shino is more diligent when it comes to studying actual work than just man\'s work, if you catch my meaning. Hagimura was just a delight because it goes back and forth with how much you can fun of the short girls sterotype, and i really enjoyed her presence. I know my review is probably late considering that this show was just on air seven years ago.Oh but I also can\'t forget about Ranko Hata.

It's about being young, dumb, and curious.The tricky thing about Blue Comedy: a little bit off-balance and you end up feeling embarrassed just watching one episode. Fortunately, such is never the case for SYD. Admittedly, the unique pace as introduced right away on the pilot would most likely catch the audience by surprise-- as the whole series is basically a mosaic of multiple short episodes. Moreover, technically speaking SYD also lacks many things that conventional anime typically offer: plot, character development, and not to mention: an insane bucket filled with sexual innuendos that may come off as...overwhelming for the unsuspecting ears. Nonetheless, once the audience get used to the rhythm of the narrative, the entertainment quality can finally be appreciated as both original and unmatched.SYD is a perfect example of how to deliver dirty jokes without making the audience feel dirty whatsoever.

Sex jokes is to SYD as large breasts are to HSOTD.  Basically, there\'s a lot of it, and I would suggest to stay away if you do not like that sort of content.Oh dear god.  Where the hell do I begin?  Let\'s see...umm...yeah, I got nothing.  Shino: ""You mean, you\'re still a virgin?""  Me:  ""How did this conversation get to this point?  And frankly, how are you...here?""  Yeah, that about sums up the anime.Story (7/10): First of all, there\'s a story?  I kid, kind of.  Seitokai Yakuidomo is a very odd anime.  The story itself has little to no merit, as I can literally sum it up in 4 words.  ""Student Council piss about"".  To be frank, it\'s basically a slice of life anime that\'s about the student council of Ousai Academy doing whatever they can to be entertaining.  Whether it\'d be working as the student council, messing about somewhere in the school, taking a beach vacation, or making the hundreds (yes, hundreds) amount of sex jokes and innuendo.  (The amount is insane).Characters (9/10): Compared to the actual story, the characters exceed it by a milestone.  (Or, a 2 point rating).  The characters in this anime are a vibrant mix, from the pure minded and innocent Mitsuba, to the tainted mind of the student council president.  Where the story lacks, the characters make up for in full.  There\'s no character development that is too noticeable, and the grand scheme of the anime altogether is based around their individual personalities and odd quirks that make up the show\'s quality.  All in all, the characters are the highest point of the whole series due to how zany and funny they truly are.Art and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art is pretty damn good.  The art itself is split into 2 categories.  Chibi, and normal.  From a chibi standpoint, the art style is quite simple and less detailed.  Their eye detail is replaced by black slits, and that\'s the art style that is used whenever something is funny/joke related.  The other is a ""normal"" anime style with quite crisp colors and overall good and nice art that is very pleasing to look at.  (especially in HD)  The anime constantly switches between these 2 art styles, to the point that it makes it cohesive and required for its storytelling and punchline delivery.  The sound though is sort of generic.  It\'s happy and bright, cheerful and nice to listen to, but to me, it\'s not too memorable.  It\'s still nice though.Personal Enjoyment (9/10): The abbreviation for this anime is SYD; more like STD, am I right?  (Yeah, bad joke.  Sorry).  Basically, this show is infectious.  Once you start, it\'s unlikely that you\'ll want to stop.  The series itself has an odd quirk to it, that just makes it so fun to watch.  I enjoyed every second of it, and the comedy just came and came and came and came.  *looks at previous sentence* (I disappoint myself sometimes.)  With its wonderful characters, good art, and hilarious comedy just bursting with sex jokes, I felt really awkward, but entertained at the same time.  I will watch the OVA\'s and the second season.

The characters in this anime are a vibrant mix, from the pure minded and innocent Mitsuba, to the tainted mind of the student council president.  Where the story lacks, the characters make up for in full.  There\'s no character development that is too noticeable, and the grand scheme of the anime altogether is based around their individual personalities and odd quirks that make up the show\'s quality.  All in all, the characters are the highest point of the whole series due to how zany and funny they truly are.Art and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art is pretty damn good.  The art itself is split into 2 categories.  Chibi, and normal.  From a chibi standpoint, the art style is quite simple and less detailed.  Their eye detail is replaced by black slits, and that\'s the art style that is used whenever something is funny/joke related.  The other is a ""normal"" anime style with quite crisp colors and overall good and nice art that is very pleasing to look at.  (especially in HD)  The anime constantly switches between these 2 art styles, to the point that it makes it cohesive and required for its storytelling and punchline delivery.  The sound though is sort of generic.  It\'s happy and bright, cheerful and nice to listen to, but to me, it\'s not too memorable.  It\'s still nice though.Personal Enjoyment (9/10): The abbreviation for this anime is SYD; more like STD, am I right?  (Yeah, bad joke.  Sorry).  Basically, this show is infectious.  Once you start, it\'s unlikely that you\'ll want to stop.  The series itself has an odd quirk to it, that just makes it so fun to watch.  I enjoyed every second of it, and the comedy just came and came and came and came.  *looks at previous sentence* (I disappoint myself sometimes.)  With its wonderful characters, good art, and hilarious comedy just bursting with sex jokes, I felt really awkward, but entertained at the same time.  I will watch the OVA\'s and the second season.  Just for the simple reason that I enjoyed this a lot.  Don\'t judge me.', 'Seitokai Yakuindomo is one of those animes that start out with a bang and ends quietly. The first few episodes were very enjoyable, but it started to get repetitive after the 8th episode. It is roughly based on the manga, which takes the form of a comic strip. This anime is pure comedy so if you were hoping for an adventure, sorry to disappoint you. Nevertheless, it does fulfill its role as a comedy with its many sexual jokes.Art (6/10)Simply put: the art in this anime isn\'t that great. After watching a few episodes you\'ll get the feelings that... well ...everyone looks the same. Most...guys are drawn like Tsuda and most girls are drawn similar to Shino. At one point I was quizzical on why the Student Council president was asking the Student Council VP to help her start a club. Then I realized that it wasn\'t the Student Council president... just someone who looks almost the exact same. If they start making the second season, art would be one thing that I hope they will improve on.Story (5/10)Because this anime is a comedy, I didn\'t really expect much of a story. It\'s loosely based on the life of Tsuda, freshman at a recently integrated, previously all female, Osai Academy. On the first day of class, he is pulled away by the student council consisting of the President, Shino; the secretary Aria, and the loli treasurer Hagimura. As apology for making him late to his first day of class, they gave (forced onto ) him the position as Student Council VP. This 13 episode series roughly outlines their year together in the student council and ends with the end of the school year. Although there does seem to be some love tension between Shino and Tsuda, it is never developed on because the main purpose of this anime is to crack sex jokes.Characters (9/10)The characters are humorous and likable. Tsuda seems to be the only normal person in the council and, hence, the only person who stops Shino\'s and Aria\'s sexual jokes. Shino, the president, has perverted fantasies and is simply fascinated by male penis (don\'t worry there\'s no nudity in this anime). Aria, the secretary, is beautiful and nice but even more perverted than Shino, often cracking random sex jokes in the most awkward situations. Hagimura, the loli treasurer, hates being referred to as short and has a quite temper when she is called a ""kid"". None of the characters seems to be particularly serious throughout this anime. Almost everything they say or do is simply for LOL and maybe even a ROFLCOPTER.Enjoyment (9/10)Seitokai Yakuindomo provides a nice relief from other intense and action packed anime. Even though the art was mediocre, the content was there. One issue that lessen the effect of the anime is that most jokes are revealed through puns. Instead of actually understanding what they say (since japanese romaji has multiple meanings), you get a subtitle that says ""Blahblahblah is playing on words. She said blahblah which is a play on words of blahblah"". But I guess that\'s the price to pay for not being able to understand Japanese in a comedy anime.Overall (7/10)This is probably one of the best (and few) comedy animes I\'ve watched. Most of the jokes are understandable and the producers really seem to give the anime the ""common man"" appeal. They put notices and jokes on there that gives viewers the impression that they are also kids who love anime. So if you\'re tired from watching action animes with never-ending suspense and need a break, Seitokai Yakuindomo is a good anime to just watch and relax, maybe even lol a bit. If you\'re not quite the comedy anime fan, then don\'t bother with this. guys are drawn like Tsuda and most girls are drawn similar to Shino.

It exists! I swear to god I dreamed this shit up one day in middle school, but now that I've re watched the first season I can definitely confirm it is real and it's...alright.At the risk of seeming like a basic boy in while writing this review I'm gonna go ahead and chop this baby up into sections. Starting with art and animation: It's, alright. The show was clearly doing one of two things when it came to it's art direction. They were either a small team with a low budget or they paid a lot...of money to make it look kinda below average. The show generally stays at a very generic mid 2000s art style. It's serviceable but bland. However, that's not to say they don't spend more than half the show in either a chibi art style or some other variant that I don't know the name of. There are glimpses of really interesting animation with the viewer following the camera as it goes around different locations. That was however, the exception not the rule.In terms of the story, there kinda isn't one. It's a mostly episodic comedy with light story progression. You won't need to watch one episode to understand another, but I do recommend watching it in order.The sound is easier to sum up. Ninety percent of the sound: songs, sound effects, etc. all sounds well below average. The other ten percent sounds law suit levels of similar to Pokemon. Next!Here's where we get into why this show is ultimately a recommendation. The characters and the comedy. I'm not going to spoil any jokes, but this is basically the kind of show that middle school boys have wet dreams about. It's a parody of harem ecchi anime that for the most part accomplishes the goal of satirizing the genre, but unfortunately does a habit in reveling in the same tropes it's trying to mock. The jokes, the jokes are good and although they are very low brow, they still have proper structure and can be hilarious. The characters themselves are a joy to follow. My favorite actually being a side character, that now that I think about it is usually around when a lot of the cool animation tricks and set pieces come into play. The show is worth watching for her alone if I'm being honest. The main cast is incredibly strong with a lot of chemistry between the four members. Unfortunately the comedy is mostly confined to a couple of jokes. All of them just being talking in a group in front of the camera. Realizing that can make the show a bit more dull.My personal enjoyment? Honestly this is the only thing that really matters. You see I watched this show blazed out of my mind and it was fucking hilarious. If it wasn't for the sub par art and animation, and some of the sound honestly sounding like Pokemon and the rest being kinda meh, I would have loved this show and put it in my favorites. I really do like this show.

This is where Seitokai Yakuindomo enters the picture.Pros:-Animation is very good for this type of slice of life/high school type of show, especially when they are parodying other genres of anime.  In one episode they opened up by parodying a type of horror anime, and I legitimately thought I had gotten mixed up and was watching a completely different show altogether.-While you can definitely see the sex jokes from a mile away, sometimes it...does catch you off-guard and usually it ends up being really clever.  Even when the humor isn't sexual, there's definitely some very clever 4th wall breakings and genre parodies that seems more akin to the humor of American cartoons than those in Japan.-Aside from the token Tsundere character, most of these characters break from typical anime tropes (at least the major ones I've heard about) and uses their personality traits to enhance the show's comedy elements.  This isn't a very character driven show, but it doesn't need to be.  The characters are all simple and likable enough that any additional conflict or drama would have weighed down the shows strengths.Cons:- While this doesn't really affect the overall enjoyment factor too much, every episode seems to have a similar premise to it.  I certainly didn't go into this expecting anything plot heavy, but a little less redundancy would've been nice.Overall:Very funny, definitely a must see if you like school/comedy anime.  If sexual humor makes you cringe (or turns you off) then avoid this show like the plague.  As for me, I really enjoyed this series as immature and simple as it was.  Check it out if you want some light, entertaining, fluff that will get a chuckle out of you now and then. does catch you off-guard and usually it ends up being really clever.

This anime is just full of jokes and gags and laugh out loud moments. The anime holds no punches and is very lewd. If you dislike sex jokes then this is not the anime for you! If you're immature like I am then this anime should suit you well. This anime has an almost unimportant story due to the fact that each episode is really just finding ways of making more and more jokes, some of which are quite intelligent but more often that not it's just silly fun...jokes. There is a bit of romance like feeling through the anime but its mainly used for gags so don't be expecting too much in the romance department.This anime is one of my favourites because its funny, feel good, really lifts the spirit kind of anime with little drama. If you're feeling down this is the kind of anime which will help you get laughing again, well it did for me anyhow. Although the anime is built on sex jokes it isn't at all ecchi, so don't be expecting fan service.

I'm watching the season 2 OVA's now and god-damn I love this show.The story is basically the setup and I won't bother wasting your time rewording it here. It works really well, and I really believe the writers get maximum mileage out of the premise. This isn't going to be a show you watch for interesting plot developments, you'll watch this when you want to laugh and spend time with fun characters.The characters are where it makes its mark for me. Early on I...was concerned this was going to be a simple gag, call and response style show, nothing more than an anime sketch show. To be honest though after a while the characters really start to shine, each one is unique and while there's limited character growth everyone does change slightly and new characters and developments are introduced to keep it fresh.A critical part of this show is that there's no cruel humour, no one character so obviously designed to be the butt of every joke. Nor does it rely on half naked girls or exploitation. This might sound odd but the amount of jokes around a female sexual mentality (and periods) makes this show kinda refreshing. The humour doesn't feel to me to be focused on a male viewpoint, as most are.

Still, I've got to give credit to Seitokai Yakuindomo, or SYD, for being just that in a nutshell while being mildly entertaining.I've actually been reading the 4-koma for a while now, so I knew what I was expecting. For those who aren't familiar with this anime being thrown around for what it's known for, SYD is fundamentally what you would imagine if adult humor had its own consciousness and manifested into a TV series. Double entendres and deadpan humor come from all sides of this show, and...you will barely get a break. Of course, this means that this is definitely not suitable for kids. Don't let them watch this show.So how does SYD fare in comparison to the sea of lewd that is ecchi and hentai lurking from Japan's questionable fetishes? Well, it's a surprise because this anime is not ecchi AT ALL. What SYD pulls off uniquely is its ability to be a innuendo-filled show without relying too much on visual, gratuitous display of female body parts. Heck, even the fanservice scenes are barely anything of service.The main cast of characters contains the Student Council that serve as archetypes of typical Japanese comedy, which shouldn't be a surprise as 4-komas generally have that setup. The role of straight-man or tsukkomi is often given to Takatoshi Tsuda, the main character and vice president, and Suzu Hagimura, the council's resident genius and shorty. Meanwhile, the role of the funny man or the boke is presented through Shino Amakusa, the president and Aria Shichijou, Shino's best friend, co-pervert and secretary. While nothing can be much said about their characters as they're only often devices to set up the jokes, their differences with each other and with the supporting cast help make the comedy of the show consistent all throughout. Also, there's a little bit of characterization for Shino, who is my favorite of the cast (because black haired girl bias).Despite the comedy being consistent at most, it never reaches a level of being genuinely funny—a few jokes here and there will make you grin, but nothing more. This becomes a problem as the show goes on, as its starting ground was barely above average to begin with. Don't get me wrong, I find sex jokes hilarious, but SYD suffers from being commonly executed in the same manner but with a different punchline. The jokes being animated from the manga were a plus, but it seems to fare in an underwhelming way on both mediums. However, since comedy is subjective, some may find it funnier than I did.One difference I did like from the anime was its inclusion of a subplot, and the show seems to hint more on Shino and Tsuda's relationship undertones farther than its source material. They also included several original content that made me remember the earlier chapters in a refreshing way. Though the studio could have stopped there, they felt the NEED to add in more scenes to fit the runtime, and that's where I was sorely disappointed. These segments that have nothing to do with the plot or the characters suddenly appear for an unnecessarily extended amount of time, and it waters down the excitement to keep watching.The biggest let-down was the final episode, which works as a parody of the series itself and the fourth wall monster let hell loose and everyone became so self-aware that this was an anime. As a matter of fact, I love fourth wall humor, but not when it's overused to the point that it's just a copout to extend past the 20-minute mark.There's so much more SYD's first season could have done, like build on the existing character relationships past the comedy vibe (if they were going to add in subplots, why not do it all the way?) or add in more content from the manga so as not to rely on half-assed segments that should belong in another anime. SYD's forte is sex jokes, and it still pulls it off much better than any anime similar to it. Even if it wasn't as good as a comedy, it was still enjoyable to some extent. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, though, and that's not just for its NSFW content.But hey, maybe the OVAs and the second season is better. Just not for this one. you will barely get a break.

SYD's forte is sex jokes, and it still pulls it off much better than any anime similar to it. Even if it wasn't as good as a comedy, it was still enjoyable to some extent. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, though, and that's not just for its NSFW content.But hey, maybe the OVAs and the second season is better. Just not for this one."", 'Unexpected, hilarious and enjoyable would be the way to describe this if you are mainly into sexual jokes and innuendo. And even if you aren\'t you could still use the 1st three words to describe this anime because its very good.Look there might not be much in the sense of character development, the stories are a bit independent of each other and there is this sense they go to sex joke well  1 too many times but.... You will still watch it and laugh your ass off.The reverse concept of perverted female characters is what makes the jokes work. If it was...the guy it would just be the same-old same-old but the female mains and the straight man male lead is just enjoyable.Special shout out goes to my favorite side character Hata, the head of the Newspaper club. Monotone and single minded in getting ""scoops"" and sell-able photos of the main characters she to me is one of the funniest characters in the show cause of some of the havok she creates.

Rather than having characters trip into girls panties, it provides witty dialouge with perverted female characters, which there seems to be no end to. The characters arent stupid which seems to be a trait you have to have in order to be perverted in a harem, which makes the characters not annoying. One of the funniest animes i have watched in a while, kept me laughing almost the entire time. ', ""There honestly isn't much to explain about Seitokai Yakuindomo, especially story wise.  It kind of hard to explain without actually spoiling things, but I'll make a brief attempt anyway.There pretty much isn't a story.  What your read in the description is all you get.  This is just an episodic slice of life that focuses heavily on comedy, with much of it being sexual jokes.  I was brief just like I said I would be.The sound, animation, and art were all really well done.  I read somewhere that this is adapted from a manga with a bunch of one line jokes,...which kind of shows, but it flows very nicely considering that fact.  I like the opening theme, which is very cheerful and it includes sexual references, which should be expected from a show with the type of description this has.Now, if you're someone who hates it when there really isn't any character development, don't even consider watching this anime.  The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo do not grow at all.  Every character just has fun personalities that you'll either love or hate from the start.  I personally loved them and think each character added something special to the show even if only for a short time.After seeing that I really don't have much information written about the show, you're probably wondering why I gave the anime a 9.  That's an easy question to ask.  I found it be really enjoyable and I was laughing about every few seconds.  It's just such a simple, yet very entertaining and enjoyable at the same time.  For like 90% of the show being pretty much just sexual jokes mixed with a tiny bit of other comedy, it's surprisingly a great show.  Of course if you hate sexual jokes, you won't think this same way.  I'm really surprised that a slice of life anime can include the content of Seitokai Yakuindomo, since I expect this genre to be more about just cheerful things and everyday life and not lewd in anyway.  Now that you've read this, decide your fate: watch it and laugh and or feel ashamed for doing so; or skip this one and potential regret not giving it a chance. which kind of shows, but it flows very nicely considering that fact.

If you do end up watching it; it\'s fairly enjoyable. ', 'This review will be broken into 2 sections; a brief run-through of all MAL\'s criteria for rating an anime, and then a longer, in-depth take on what holds this series back. Note: the title, Seitokai Yakuindomo, will simply be referred to as SYD during this review.Story - 3, Most shows that receive a rating this low in any category are lucky to get a 5 overall from myself, however unlike many shows out there, SYD doesn\'t attempt to convince you it has a story worth paying attention to, and simply relies on pure comedy in its attempt to entertain its viewers. Although, it should be...noted that the comedy rotates heavily around sexual jokes, so if that\'s not your cup of tea, you might want to give up on this show already.Art - 7, While the quality isn\'t outstanding or breath-taking it is consistent, which is always a plus. There is some variation in the art style, but its used for comedic affect, and done quite well.Sound - 8, Wasn\'t huge on the OP/ED, but all the OSTs seemed solid. The voice actors were casted pretty well, and played their parts well.Character - 8, A must for any good comedy is a cast of characters that you enjoy watching. Most characters have their own unique running gag, but the over-abundance of characters that ran completely off sexual jokes drags this down a bit.Enjoyment - 7, It was solid, and I got more laughs than I expected. I didn\'t go into this with high-expectations, but found myself pleasantly surprised in quite a few episodes.Overall - 7, It was decent, but certainly not anything amazing. Ill save my recommendation for the end of the second part of this review.Part 2 -What\'s wrong with pure comedy? - Nothing, many shows make it work, but, since the only redeeming factor a pure comedy show has is its ability to make you laugh, it will always limit its audience based on whether or not you think it\'s funny. Comedy is something almost everyone enjoys at least a little bit, making it one of the most universally used genres regardless of what a series\'s primary genre is. While comedy is great as a side dish to another genre, many times a full-on comedy leaves you craving something more, and that\'s one of the many places SYD will leave you disappointed. While it doesn\'t try to be more than a straight comedy, the route in which it does its comedy makes most of the scenes feel choppy and leaving you saying things like, ""uh, I don\'t really know what\'s going on"". This is largely due to the nature of the manga which it\'s adapted from, however, just because you can state the reason for something, doesn\'t make the facts excusable. Its basically designed as a bunch of rapid fire skits, 90% of which pay-off in sex jokes.Sex Jokes - Here\'s the things, if you\'ve gotten this far in the review, I\'m going to assume you don\'t have a problem with sex jokes, but if you do, you\'re certainly not going to enjoy SYD. While I expected the sex jokes based on what I read about SYD before watching, there was still much to my surprise. First, while SYD has really no boundaries about what kind of fucked up shit they say, its quite impressive how vigilant they are with avoiding ecchi, and even remotely fan-servicey scenes, to the point that some of the transition scenes between scenes actually joke about ""no bath scene"" and the like. Regardless, when it comes to the jokes, this show has no boundaries; there were ""punch lines"" that didn\'t have me laughing, but certainly had my eyes widening while my brain went, ""whaaaaat da fuq?"" While some of the sexual humor is genuinely funny, a lot of the time it ends up feeling like, a girl\'s talking about something gross so now it\'s funny, when in actuality it just makes you go, ""ewwww"".Characters + Their Comedy - A lot of the characters in SYD have their own unique feel and comedy to them. While most of the cast has their comedy orbiting a planet filled with sexual deviancy, quite a few actual have their own, unrelated schticks. Suzu is stupid short and thus has to flip shit every time someone jokes about her childish physique, because ya know, that\'s what anime thinks about short people. There\'s judo girl who ends up having some sexual jokes, but atleast she\'s not mentally aware of it, which genuinely improves the comedy, also she definitely has a thing for the MC, which gets used quite a bit. That one guy, who makes like a whole 3 appearances and is the only male character excluding the MC, has his comedy mainly orbiting the fact that he is thirsty af, and lastly the hall monitor chick who is terrified of men, and yes, that\'s all of the jokes that occur while she\'s on screen. Everyone else (excluding the MC, who serves as the voice of reason) makes constant sex jokes, some of which are genuinely funny and the rest fall somewhere between ""meh, whatever"" and mildly disturbing. Some of the characters have their own brand of sex jokes, like the teacher who is probably going to end up in jail for raping small boys, the maid who is obsessed with her master\'s dirty laundry, and journalist who is mad levels of peeping tom, and probably also belongs in jail. The problem is the sheer number of characters that make sexual jokes in this is absurd, and thus, makes some of the characters feel less unique. The Prez and Aria both seemed unique at the beginning, but by the end, their sex jokes were more general and less focused than a lot of the other characters. The MC\'s sister seemed normal at first, but then we get an episode were she gets some actual lines and she turns out to be just as freaky as 90% of the cast.Recommendation - Do I recommend SYD? That\'s honestly a hard question to answer. It got some genuine laughs out of me, but I\'m not sure if I\'m going to watch the next season. It isn\'t terrible by any means, even if I gave that impression with this review, but it\'s really nothing more than sex jokes. The worst part is that its not even dubbed, I know some people prefer subbed, but personally I don\'t like having to keep my eyes glued to screen, and occasionally having to hit the pause button because a line of text was only on the screen half a second, and in my opinion the subbing in SYD was pretty bad, sometimes lines of text would appear on top of other lines, making it very difficult to read. Anyways Im rambling, the point is if you really like sexual humor give it a shot, if not, then don\'t because that\'s all SYD has going for it. noted that the comedy rotates heavily around sexual jokes, so if that\'s not your cup of tea, you might want to give up on this show already.Art - 7, While the quality isn\'t outstanding or breath-taking it is consistent, which is always a plus.

Where the creators of this show basically put every international dirty joke they could find and put it all onto this show was very interesting and quite thrilling for a moment. SPOILER like whenever the female characters make a rhetorical yet dirty comment or joke, the respondent always has his/her back turned and makes a quiet almost whisper kind of tune response and it does intend to irritate since it does happen ALL THE TIME! Especially of the idea that only females in this show are always aroused by sexual fantasies and...constant sex inundated experiences occur from the female characters towards the male(s) and, even though it is a show and it is fiction, still sounds ludacris and inane.Story 7/10:Personally felt that there were plots in the show where it tends to go somewhere that leads to a story where it follows how the characters will go in adventures or perform ""action"" like scenes but then it leads to wasteful plots where it is like fillers and that also was a peeve to me for this show.In some episodes it concentrates to what the show has set the plot for but then later goes to more fillers and more and more of them. The reason why there are so many fillers is because in the actual manga it reads many ""jokes"" and small plots and so the creators must have thought it would have been great if they just quickly smoosh up all the manga work together in less than 13 episodes.Art 8/10:I liked the artwork and especially in some episodes where it tends to get so realistic like and the details of every scene is always constructed will thought out its like a dream! Not a miss anywhere.Sound 7/10:The sound of this show was simple and great fit and comfort for it as well where not like other shows where it carries a certain type of music always playing whenever a character is speaking (Ex: in DBZ when Vegeta talks his Hells Bells performs in the background) so basically in this show is a free-for-all music type.Character 6/10:The characters well... were not that well thought out, they all remind me of shows similar to Rosario + Vampire where there are females who always have sexual references being mentioned, act immature, and always go for the innocent one male character and constant pointless plots happen all the time (fillers). This really should have been improvised upon but what can you do.Enjoyment/Overall 7/10:I enjoyed this show because it did have some funny plots, the switched off stories were very attention grabbing and was an interesting show to watch. This show however is sincerely meant for how it is rated, 17+, since this how is just plain dirty and no young child should go near this. It is a cute show though and very enjoyable to watch.Thank for reading! constant sex inundated experiences occur from the female characters towards the male(s) and, even though it is a show and it is fiction, still sounds ludacris and inane.Story 7/10:Personally felt that there were plots in the show where it tends to go somewhere that leads to a story where it follows how the characters will go in adventures or perform ""action"" like scenes but then it leads to wasteful plots where it is like fillers and that also was a peeve to me for this show.In some episodes it concentrates to what the show has set the plot for but then later goes to more fillers and more and more of them.

The jokes are great, not for those who don\'t understand the nature of sexual jokes, however, not all the jokes are sexual, as in seen in episode 3 when Hagimura Suzu goes mad and starts swearing in English.As for the story, well, to put it bluntly, what story? Haha, all it revolves...around is a group of High Schoolers running their Student Council while getting up to shenanigans and having a huge laugh with each other. What I thought made it all so much funnier is Tsuda\'s comments after every punchline of the jokes, where he either agrees, or is appalled by the joke, this is the same with the Student Council rules they would state at the beginning of every episode, sure they started out reasonable, but then they became absolutely ridiculous.The art and sound of this anime was great, the characters in themselves were just amazing to watch and so funny to be able to just laugh as much as I wanted at, as for enjoyment, 10 out of 10, easily, I loved this anime due to how much it made me laugh and clutch my sides from the burning pain I felt from laughing too much.This is my first anime review, hope it was of use to some people :D around is a group of High Schoolers running their Student Council while getting up to shenanigans and having a huge laugh with each other.

Not at all.Does Seitokai Yakuindomo have a story? Yes, but it is very simple.Is Seitokai Yakuindomo a good show? I would say it's enjoyable.More than that it is its own thing, it doesn't do anything new, but it doesn't fail to be dumb entertainment for each episode.It's actually really decent at showing an episodic story where you can really start watching anywhere in the series, not to say that there may...not be plots that are shown throughout the whole series that can explained more if you watch each episode, but for most of the episodes you can probably hop in and get a dumb comedy.This show is really subjective based on your comedy, I thought it was stupid, but also humorous. The main issue that the series has is that it repeats some of the sex related jokes for the entire series, and this does wear down on the humor and enjoy-ability of the show the more you watch it.- Whole series review here -With all this in mind though, the first season is the best season in my opinion, the jokes feel better written, and the show changes the setting enough to make it interesting.The 1st season OVA is alright too, definitely not poor plot wise, but lacks a little compared to the main series, but it is an OVA, so I let it pass a little.2nd season is more of the same, but feels a little more drawn out for the sake of dragging it on.The 2nd season OVA though, I actually enjoyed more then the actual 2nd season, mainly because the jokes seems better written, and have better sequences between them.Both of the movies were a little bit of a letdown to me, still good, but the story would've been better as episodes.Overall I really liked the series, and I recommend watching it! not be plots that are shown throughout the whole series that can explained more if you watch each episode, but for most of the episodes you can probably hop in and get a dumb comedy.This show is really subjective based on your comedy, I thought it was stupid, but also humorous.

Certainly, these two animes do share a common theme of sex related comedy however, I personally found the latter executes it's comedy far better be it through it's visual gags or dialogue between characters. Seitokai Yakuindomo has some of the best sex jokes i've heard in any anime, although that isn't the full extent of it's comedy thankfully. Despite it's clearly adult comedy, this isn't a typical ecchi comedy anime. Episodes don't rely on over the top, lewd shots or bizzare scenes to achieve the desired joke, which is refreshing...to see on a stage chocked full of panty shots and beach episodes. Instead the show points the spotlight on genuinely amusing interactions between it's brilliant cast of characters. While they may not be original in their idiosyncrasies and personalities(there's the usual ara ara oneesan, horny teacher and loli), i found them to be incredibly enjoyable to watch. There isn't much plot, if any to speak of in this anime, but it still executes it's job very well, that is, this anime will actually make you laugh, and frequently too. Thanks to the lack of structure in this series, it is easy to pick up and watch whenever the usual soul crushing drama brings you down a little too low, and it'd say it's perfect for that. to see on a stage chocked full of panty shots and beach episodes.

Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36754/Kakuriyo_no_Yadomeshi,"[""I had got the impression that Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi (Hidden realm: Bed & Breakfast for Spirits) was more or less a copy of Kamisama Hajimemashita (which I highly enjoyed). Both seemed to have the same premise; a Japanese folk lore setting, a mundane girl in her late teens who are involved with spirits (ayakashi) from the hidden realm, with the potential for a reverse harem and lots of shoujo romance stuff. Which sure can be a very good thing if done as in Kamisama Hajimemashita.I was both right and wrong. The premise was indeed similar, with our girl Aoi Tsubaki having her life changed drastically...and are forced to a new life in the Hidden realm, the Japanese folk lore setting, and lots of cute ayakashi guys for a potential reverse harem. Aoi like Nanami looks like your average lead for this kind of show with mouse brown hair and plain features.But the similarities only go so far. Because, the main theme of the KnY isn´t a reverse harem, or even romance. It´s mainly about food and the importance of food in our lives really. As this can be utterly disappointing for some, I actually grow to highly appreciate KnY for just this reason.The narrative is mostly episodic with each episode address some kind of problem for Aoi to solve (mostly by cooking delicious food). There is a more overarching plot though, it´s just not the main focus the first half of the show. And those 1-episode stories actually contribute to the overarching plot in the end as well, so the feeling that I wasted my time on filler bs never occurred.I mentioned that the show focused a lot on food and how it influences our lives. Well, cooking isn´t just a hobby for Aoi, it’s a way of survival. You see, Aoi has a strong spiritual energy and have always been able to see ayakashi. Said strong spiritual energy has attracted hungry ayakashi all her life, and to give her a tool to protect herself her grandfather taught her to cook delicious food that ayakashi like, so she could give them the food instead of getting eaten herself (this isn´t a spoiler, it is established very early in the show). When she gets spirited away by a handsome Ogre spirit and declared as his bride as payment for her grandfather’s debt, she refuses and want to work of the debt instead. And here is where her cooking skills really come to use.I grow highly interested in the Japanese kitchen during this watch. It´s so different from where I come from, and I really do want to try some of the food she made. But the allure of the food and cooking extended further than just that it looked tasty, it also brought up the spiritual and mental emotions that food can create. Just imagine that you been gone from your home for a long time and then someone cooks a dish that you love from your home town. The nostalgia, the happiness and even safety one can feel at such a moment is really astonishing. Or that you are so bored with food that you pretty much lost your appetite, and then someone places a delightful home cooked meal that surprises all your senses (smell, texture, taste, vision etc.). Or that you just are hangry and get a lovely meal, and what it does for your state of mind. Or how it can connect us, shearing food together and rejoice in the flavours and how satisfied it can make us feel.KnY brings up all these scenarios and then some. Of course, the show isn´t exclusively about food and cooking, but it is the topic in the spotlight and I aren´t complaining. There is definitely some romance going on but it´s heavily taking the backseat, so don´t expect a full-blown romance to develop fast, because then you only will get disappointed.The reverse harem theme is also almost absent, even if there are a lot of cute ayakashi guys around. But they have more independent roles than being a harem member, which worked absolutely fine in this case. And there are almost as many female characters present, which many have funny personalities and important roles as well.Aoi as the female lead does differ a bit from your copy and past persona for this kind of role. She is very ordinary yes, but in the most relatable way, because she has indeed a personality and background as well. She knows her limits and works with what she has – a bone hard determination, a genuine will to understand others and brilliant skills in cooking. She is kind, stubborn, positive and caring, a real goodie good girl but not the least mentally weak. Aoi gets a lot of mean shit thrown at her in the Hidden realm, and copes with it like a boss.Oodanna (the handsome Ogre spirit) could´ve been portrayed as a real creep, but wasn´t. I have had problems with this type of set up before, the older mystical creature declares young female to be his bride (yes, looking at you The Ancient Magus' Bride). But besides calling Aoi his wife, he does no creepy things like bathing her as a first thing when she arrives to the Hidden realm. He looks after her from a non-intruding angle, gives her the tools and protection she needs, and lets her find her own way in this new strange situation.Studio Gonzo has done a good job on the art and animation. Not perfect per say, but over my expectations. Vivid colours, detailed backgrounds and environments, and varied and distinct character designs. The food looks yummy, the ayakashi´s magic looks dramatic, and the atmosphere is spot on.Honestly, I haven´t paid much attention to the soundtrack, but it´s for sure not bad. The 2 openings however are awesome, especially the second one. Certainly, the best in a long while. Recommend you look them up, even if you´re not going to watch the show itself. Voice acting is also top notch, with veterans such as Noa Touyama and Katsuyuki Konishi as the main leads.This has been my “feel-good” show during it´s airing time, and I enjoyed it a lot, even if the reasons for said enjoyment originate from completely different sources then I first believed. Which is a bit odd since that I´m not even that into the SoL-genre. The setting is a familiar one in anime, but it´s has its own main themes and feeling. I can warmly recommend KnY to anyone that is looking for a Japanese folk lore setting, cosy atmosphere, and a wee bit of romance. And especially if you enjoy food in any way, eating it, cooking it, exploring new kitchens etc. It was a surprisingly stimulating main theme. and are forced to a new life in the Hidden realm, the Japanese folk lore setting, and lots of cute ayakashi guys for a potential reverse harem.

You have been warned.A world where determination, great food, kindness and understanding of others can help promote friendship and understanding that transcends race and worlds.Based off the popular Light Novel of the same name Kakuriyo No Yadomeshi which is often shortened to just Kakuriyo is a supernatural and romance-themed anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a teenage girl from the realm of...man was to be whisked away and into a parallel world where both spirits and various types of mythical creatures such as Ogre’s, nine-tailed foxes and Yuki-Onna’s exist and most surprisingly be introduced to her future marriage partner that no one has told her about. The idea of being drawn from the human realm to another world is not something that is rare within the anime industry as we can see from the large amounts of anime that make use of the trapped in the game and traveling to another world ideas in the form of renowned series such as Sword Art Online and Log Horizon. However, I felt that Kakuriyo’s premise of being drawn into a parallel world where mythical creatures such as Ogre’s exist and being presented as a bride in order to pay off the debt of a relative was an interesting one as it allowed us as the viewer to see not just how the social standings of the various races work within the world but also allow us to see how a normal human girl like the main character Aoi would react as she enters this world and encounters the various rules and stigma that others view her with. The first episode of the series I felt was an excellent episode that did a great job of not just introducing us to the parallel world within the series but also introduce the two main characters of the series which was Aoi Tsubaki and Oodanna and their strong-willed and conflicting natures that clashed with each other. From this, I was impressed enough in that I decided to watch this series until the very end and I was glad that I did.Taking place within the parallel world that is called the hidden realm by its inhabitants the hidden realm is a land that resembles a fusion of ancient Japan and a fantasy world. While having many concepts that are recognizable from ancient Japan such as ancient inns, ninja’s and clothing suitable for that era the realm also features many elements of fantasy such as magic, flying ships and of course the various races that inhabit the different realms that make up the hidden realm. It is in this world that is hidden from the realm of human kind that the inhabitants of the realm who call themselves the ayakashi live their lives in a manner that is almost identical to that of normal human beings while co-existing with their fellow ayakashi in an age where conflict is all but unknown and where encounters with beings other than them are rare indeed. The overall story of the series follows the life of Aoi Tsubaki a human college student who while on her way to college one day is kidnapped and brought to a new world called the hidden realm and told that due to her recently deceased grandfathers’ debt Aoi must marry the head of a well-known inn as per an ancient agreement that was agreed between the two of them. Despite the situation facing her the ever so defiant Aoi refuses to obey the contract and instead counters with a proposal of her own in which she would work off her grandfather’s debt by opening up and operating an eatery within the inn.As Aoi opens up and begins operating her eatery the Moonflower she while overcoming the many hardships and stigma that she faces from the many races that make up the ayakashi would gradually start to realize that preparing delicious and beautiful food would not just allow her to pay off her debt but at the same time allow her to learn about not just the various races that inhabit the realm but also allow her to solve their various problems by listening to them, understanding them and try and devise solutions that will help them overcome such burdens and in the process not just forming strong friendships and bonds with each other but also allow her to come up with solutions to solve the many hidden problems that exist within the realm. Joining Aoi in her quest to use food to forge friendships and understanding between races are a host of characters that while mostly hostile to her at first soon become some of her best friends and most loyal allies. These include the intimidating but surprisingly kind Ogre inn master Oodanna, the kind, and loyal nine-tailed fox Ginji, the arrogant but surprisingly fair young hostess Oryo and the calm but surprisingly perceptive accounting chief Byakuya. Together with her allies Aoi would begin a fantastic adventure that will allow her to not just explore the many different regions that form the hidden realm but also allow her to create many beautiful and delicious food that will be used to not just form friendships but also solve the many problems that exist within the realm.AoiAoi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of The World God Only Knows and Kancolle fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A college student from the human realm that was brought to the hidden realm through somewhat forceful means Aoi in the beginning of the series while understandably upset at the turn of events was also shown to be a kind and caring person that while getting scared easily was also steadfast in her beliefs even when faced by the most intimidating of ayakashi. While easily scared Aoi was also an intelligent, curious and fast thinking person that thanks to her perceptive skills was not just able to identify sudden shifts to people’s behaviors but also act upon them by using this to further her understanding of both people and events within this new world. While a quiet person by nature Aoi was also someone that was friendly, good-natured and humble and while facing a lot of hostility in the beginning was able to convert these feelings of antagonism and use these to forge bonds and friendship with the staff of the inn something that was helped greatly by her fair and honest nature and her desire to do her best for all of her friends and customers. As a result of her friendly and honest nature Aoi was someone that always believed that one must act based on what their heart tells them and while this choice may not always be the best choice in some situations it can be seen that Aoi is someone that believes firmly in this belief even when the alternative might have been better. This is seen in her attempts to help those in need and her attempts to solve the problems that they are burdened with despite not getting anything back in return showing just how caring she is as a person. While a quiet and calm person by nature Aoi while often hard pressed in the beginning of the series also showed that rather than causing her undue pressure that would cause most normal people to mess up the extra pressure instead had the opposite effect in that it actually helped in allowing her to come up with not just solutions but also new dishes that can be used to handle situations no matter how sudden a trait that I felt took great advantage of Aoi’s ability to not just think outside of the box but also take advantage of her knowledge of dishes from the human realm as well. This trait of being able to use pressure from others as a source of motivation for Aoi to create new dishes I felt was one that suited her personality really well.A key part of Aoi’s personality that stems from her friendly and caring nature was her skills as a listener that takes advantage of her perception skills which allows her to not just understand the surface problem that someone is burdened with but also the underlying issues that may not be immediately visible due to a need to hide that fact something that I felt matched her image as both a cook and an eatery owner perfectly. While a very capable cook Aoi while loving the opportunity to both discover new recipes and ingredients is someone that can be surprisingly open-minded and honest in that she is willing to take feedback from others regarding her dishes and work hard to improve them showing not just how hardworking she is but also how determined she is to make sure that her dishes are able to fulfill the many promises that she has been bestowed with.As the series goes on and as Aoi, not just realizes just how vast the hidden realm was but also encounter many different people and situations Aoi’s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset, it can be seen that Aoi while having a great deal of respect for her grandfather didn’t particularly hold him in high regard due to his rather eccentric personality and actions and indeed seem to view him with some amount of dislike. After his passing and seeing the kind of bonds and effects that he had within the hidden realm however this instead is replaced by a sense of regret in that she did not seek to renew their strained bonds even as he neared his end. As a result of this sense of regret Aoi also developed a belief that regrets were something that was very sad and that no one should have any regrets which soon served to become one of Aoi’s most potent sources of motivation as she set about the task of running her eatery. This is shown in Aoi’s development as not just a capable cook but also a person as well as she will by improving her cooking skills also seek to understand her customers and the regrets and needs that they have and create the perfect dish for them that ensures that after having her dish both their physical hunger and their psychological burden has been dealt with. While having few friends at the beginning of the series this gradually changes as the series goes on as Aoi’s friendly and honest nature soon begins to change the views of the people around her. As a result of this Aoi becomes very protective of the bonds of friendship that’s been formed between them and becomes very loyal to her friends and will do her utmost to protect them from harm even if it meant that she must take some daring actions to do so. A trait that I felt was an interesting development since Aoi initially was someone that was used to being alone.A prominent belief that arose within Aoi as the series progressed was the belief that with her cooking ability she will be able to bridge not just the gap that exists between the human realm and the hidden realm but also between fellow ayakashi whose contrasting ideas often causes disagreements to form between them. A belief that only grows much more important during the second arc of the series as a result of Aoi bonding with the many ayakashi that inhabit the southern lands and the dire situation that the land is in due to past failures of an important ceremony. This belief I felt was an important development for Aoi as it showed the fact that Aoi has not just realized the importance of having loyal and important friends but also that her cooking ability can also be used for a much larger and more important purpose of mending the rifts that result from strained bonds and in the process saving a land from its cruel fate.The character of Aoi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. Aoi’s development from someone that was lonely, scared and had a deep sense of regret to someone that was not just brave but also determined to help those with their own burdens by understanding the underlying issues that plague them and creating a dish that solves it and in the process forming bonds of friendship with them being especially well thought out. I felt that her seiyuu Nao Touyama really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Aoi.GinjiGinji voiced by new voice actor Shunichi Toki is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi that takes the form of a nine-tailed fox that’s silver in color Ginji is also a shapeshifter whose human form is the form that Aoi and the members of the inn encounter the most. The young master of the Tenjin ya inn and effectively part of that inn’s upper management Ginji from initial appearances was a kind, caring and positive being that despite his position was also an honest and modest being that had little ego and helped all those that he met in his duties. A responsible person by nature Ginji was someone that approached each situation in a calm and composed manner and will do his best in everything that he does which is shown in his attempts to help Aoi as her assistant despite the added duties that this entails. This however also means Ginji can be somewhat reluctant in letting others do his job as he feels that it's his responsibility given his role. Due to his personality its perhaps unsurprising that Ginji was one of Aoi’s first friends as unlike the rest of the inn he did not see Aoi as an enemy and indeed was somewhat intrigued that Aoi’s skills as a cook was that impressive and as a result as their bonds deepened Ginji grows very protective of Aoi and dislikes seeing her being used by others.As the series goes on and more of Ginji’s character is revealed and expanded upon Ginji’s personality gradually starts to change. Despite his easy-going and friendly nature Ginji is someone that has a surprising lack of confidence in himself and while he has no shortage of acquaintances and fellow staffers that he can call upon it can be seen that Ginji tries to keep distance from them due to his low confidence and the fact that he feels that they do not trust him due his past. In fact, until Aoi’s appearance, Ginji’s best-known friendship was with the inn master Oodanna due to their long association in the past. Perhaps as a result of this Ginji was able to forge an immediate bond with Aoi due to her friendly and honest nature and in the process discover what its really like to have friends that he can count on. As a result of this, it can be seen that Ginji while valuing the fact that he can eat and have fun with his new friends is also very loyal to them and serious about their welfare and can become very distraught when he feels that he has failed them in some way.The character of Ginji I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. In a way I felt that Ginji’s inner darkness which served as his development was very similar to how Aoi was in the past before her coming into the hidden realm in that both were lonely and had few people that they could trust and indeed it can be said that Aoi’s development as a character was what opened his heart to the many joys that friendship and trust can bring to someone and in the process liberate him from the darkness that held him back. This shared sense of development between the two of them I thought was pretty well done and illustrated the fact that friendships and bonds can also be used to liberate someone from the darkness that constrained their lives.OodannaOodanna voiced by veteran voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi of Bleach and Fairy Tail fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi in the form of an ogre in human form and the master of the Tenjin Ya inn within the hidden realm Oodanna at the start of the series was a calm, composed and self-confident person that while quiet was also very professional and was highly regarded by both customers and his staff who viewed him with a high degree of respect. While appearing seemingly cold at first glance this was far from the truth as he was not just kind and caring but also intelligent and perceptive and treated everything and everyone fairly and is willing to place his trust in his staff something that his staff will do their utmost as to not betray. While a quiet person Oodanna was someone that was very loyal to his friends and while his usual self was normally polite and diplomatic this attitude can change dramatically if his friends are being treated harshly by others and will try to help them when needed. At the beginning of the series, Oodanna’s relationship with his bride Aoi was a tense one given the unique situation and though he is put off by her initial refusal to the proposal his impression of her gradually starts to change after seeing her determination to pay back her debt by working. In the beginning, while taking care to remain neutral to her work at the inn it can be seen that he also shows a great deal of concern for her and tries hard to dissuade her from any dangerous plans that she has thought off.As the series goes on and Oodanna’s relationship with Aoi improves and as they are confronted with one crisis after another Oodanna’s personality gradually starts to change. While initially not supportive of Aoi’s efforts to open up an eatery as the series goes on and as Oodanna saw with his own eyes just how much effort Aoi was putting in to prove herself this attitude of his eventually changes and Oodanna begins to slowly support her and be willing to come running when she calls. Despite his aloof nature, Oodanna is not someone that will let his station hold him back and indeed when things get busy Oodanna can also willingly let go of his role and work alongside his staff by taking care of guests and cooking for them a side of his character that I felt was surprising. A prominent part of Oodanna’s personality is, without doubt, his motivations both as a person and as an inn master. While having great faith in not just his friends but also in his staff as well Oodanna is someone that encourages them to not just do their best at their duties but also have ambition and dreams as Oodanna believes that without it the ayakashi would not be able to advance themselves. As a result of this Oodanna is someone that hates those that have neither which is one of the reasons why he pushed Aoi to work harder and why he let his staff do actions on their own free will. As a result of this the bonds that he shares with his staff and forges with Aoi can be seen to be a strong one and its easy to see just why Oodanna has so much faith in Aoi not just as a person but also as a cook since he knows that both are trying hard to achieve their dreams. The character of Oodanna I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with his contrasting personality and his way of motivating both Aoi and the members of his staff being one of the best things about his character. I felt that his voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi did an excellent job of portraying the character of Oodanna.ByakuyaByakuya voiced by veteran voice actor Atsushi Tamaru of Asterisk Wars and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s many allies within the series. The head of Tenjin Ya’s accounting department and thus one of Aoi’s bosses within the series Byakuya on initial appearances is a calm, composed and efficient person by nature that comes off as someone that’s strict and unsociable. A fact that is reinforced by the manner in which he treats Aoi at first as he only saw her as being the owner of a business that was not making a profit. While calm and composed Byakuya is also an intelligent, rational and logical person that while very serious about his job is also someone that’s willing to give people chances if they display the determination to do so. As a result of these qualities, it's perhaps unsurprising that Byakuya acts as the second in command to Oodanna where both his intellect and rational nature can also be used to locate and deal with threats to both the inn and to his friends and allies including to Aoi herself.As the series goes on however and Byakuya’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that while certainly strict and stern at times beneath this Byakuya is actually someone that has a surprisingly caring side to him which is best shown in the fact that he takes care of stray ayakashi in his spare time rather than say hole up in a dark room somewhere crunching numbers as most accountants would. In this state, it can be seen that Byakuya’s alternate personality is one that’s positive, cheerful and caring traits that I felt contrasted greatly with his normal strict self. As a result of this interesting side to his personality, I felt that it was quite funny at seeing him panic when he realizes that his secret has been exposed. At the beginning of the series, Byakuya as a result of his role as the head accountant of the inn had a somewhat antagonist relationship with Aoi due to the fact that despite Moonflower not making any profits at first Aoi was determined to keep it open as she tries to come up with the perfect recipes. However, as the series goes on and Byakuya came to both understand Aoi as a person as well as see the effects that her food has had on her many customers this sense of antagonism gradually disappears and is replaced by a healthy amount of respect for Aoi as both a person and a cook and as a result Byakuya gradually began to see her as a member of the inn. An interesting trait of Byakuya is that despite his calm and composed nature he can still get angry and when that happens his demeanor can be quite menacing which when used in dealing with upstarts like Raiju can be quite entertaining to watch.OryouOryou voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of The Asterisk War and Brave Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi in the form of a Yuki-onna that had taken on human form Oryou is the Tenjin Ya’s young hostess and as a result is the head of the hostesses that serve the many customers that come to Tenjin Ya. From the onset, it can be seen that Oryou is someone that while confident was also someone that was arrogant and rude to people and as a result while she was respected by the staff for her rank she had very few people that she can call her friends. This isn’t helped by the fact that in addition to being arrogant Oryou is also very rule-bound and would punish any infraction no matter how minor it is. As a result of this from the beginning of the series, Oryou actively viewed Aoi as a rival to her due to a combination of being the inn master’s fiancée and the fact that her hard work is earning her the respect of the staff while Oryou despite being here longer than her was getting nothing.As the series goes on however and as Oryou gets to interact with Aoi more her personality gradually starts to change. While rule bound to a degree it can be seen that Oryou beneath her arrogant surface personality is actually someone that’s fair and honest with her feelings. Indeed, looking at her past it can be seen that Oryou when she first become a hostess was someone that was not just determined but also worked hard at everything that she did which is similar to how Aoi is within the anime. From this, it can be seen where her pride actually comes from as its obvious that she’s very proud of her status as the young hostess. Despite her confident nature, it can be seen that beneath this Oryou can be surprisingly fragile due in part to her lack of friends and to the fact that she distrusts outsiders to the inn which served to limit the interactions that she could have with Aoi. However, after being taken care off by Aoi after she had collapsed due to overwork Oryou’s attitude towards Aoi began to change after seeing how much effort Aoi put in to help her recover which caused her to realize just how foolish her own actions had been in trying to belittle her. As a result of this, the relationship between the two gradually thawed as Oryou becomes friendlier not just bonding with Aoi but also becoming not just fast friends but also one of Aoi’s most trusted allies. At the same time as a result of this change Oryou while still arrogant and distrustful of others become much friendlier and willing to help others with their problems a notable example being her attempts to help Nene her opposite number at the Orio Ya inn overcome her insecurity by covertly helping her with some tricky customers. While showing her skills as a hostess this I felt also did a great job of showing the kind of contacts that she has across the realm something that is pretty important to a hostess. The character of Oryou I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual evolution from an arrogant and condescending hostess to one that was both friendly, caring and willing to help her juniors improve their skills so that they can both help the inn and themselves being especially well done. The manner of how Oryou and Aoi bonded by having them share memories of how they were in the past I felt was pretty interesting. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kakuma really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Oryou.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series many characters were pretty well designed with the many species of ayakashi especially being so. This was helped greatly by the large variety of species that form the ayakashi that Aoi encounters within the series. I felt that the incorporation of species like Ogre’s, nine-tailed foxes, Yuki-Onna’s and the other races that feature prominently within Japanese mythology matched well with the fact that the world of the hidden realm is one that fuses ancient Japan with a fantasy world. The various settings and locations that Aoi and the cast visit I felt was pretty well designed and featured quite an impressive variety of terrain that made great use of the world’s lore. In particular, I felt that the areas around Tenjin Ya and the southern lands that housed Orio ya contrasted well with each other as the former while lacking in beauty and resources was stable and at peace while the southern lands while beautiful were also one plagued by misfortune. While Kakuriyo is a supernatural and romance-themed anime the few combat scenes within the series I felt while short was also well designed as while they showed the ayakashi’s desire to keep peace and avoid conflict with each other the scenes also showed how powerful the ayakashi can be if they were fighting to protect those dear to them.The music within the series I felt was pretty well done with the OST, in particular, doing a great job of providing a great variety of music to the many kinds of situations that Aoi encounters while exploring the hidden realm. The series in total made use of two opening themes which was Tomoshibi No Manimani by Aoi’s seiyuu Nao Touyama and Utsushiyo no Yume that was sung by Nano. In total the series made use of 10 ending themes which was quite a lot even for a full season anime. I felt that the two opening themes both did a great job at conveying a sense of anticipation for the series with the first one doing a better job at this than the second one. The many ending themes for the series I felt did a great job at conveying the unique emotions and feelings that were attached to the events of each of the episodes in which they were featured in.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Nao Touyama, Shunichi Toki, Katsuyuki Konishi, Atsushi Tamaru and Ai Kakuma who portrayed the characters of Aoi, Ginji, Oodanna, Byakuya and Oryou respectively all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, while I didn’t cover them I felt that Yuma Uchida, Maaya Uchida, Reina Ueda, Mitsuki Nakae, Aoi Yuki, Kaito Ishikawa and Sayaka Kaneko who portrayed the characters of Akatsuki, Suzuran, Shizuna, Kasuga, Ougon Douji, Ranmaru and Nene respectively all did an excellent job at voicing their assigned roles.Overall conclusionIn overall Kakuriyo was an anime that I really enjoyed and was one of the few animes that I felt really deserves a full season. I felt that Kakuriyo’s greatest strengths were its interesting premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, creative emotional problems that require Aoi to solve, excellent voice acting and a lot of interesting life lessons.The overall premise of the series which was the kidnapping of Aoi and being told that you have been promised to marry the ogre that you have been brought before and Aoi’s subsequent determination to not just refuse it but also display a desire to pay back the debt by working within the world I felt was an interesting one and certainly one that’s rare within the world of anime. However, while strong this premise won’t be enough if it doesn’t have a good enough story that it marries itself too and in this is another of Kakuriyo’s strengths. As a result of both the fact that Aoi is the fiancée to the inn’s popular master and also of the fact that Aoi is also a human it won’t be an understatement to say that Aoi’s journey to start to work off her debt by first opening her eatery was an easy one as the inn’s staff definitely tried their hardest to stop her. However while these actions were often petty these actions also allowed us to see how Aoi not just withstands these abuse but also start to gradually overcome the innate hatred and distrust that her detractors have for her via her actions that not only help the inn’s but also serve to prove to them that while human Aoi isn’t just a pretty face and has both a kind and caring personality and plenty of skills that easily make her an equal to her detractors. Watching Aoi gradually win over her detractors by not just showing her creativeness but also her excellent ability as both a cook and a listener I felt was something that was really well done and resonated well with the series main theme of forging bonds and friendships with the ayakashi and changing their opinion of humans.While the story did a great job of showing how Aoi’s attempts to help others and solve their problems managed to win over plenty of ayakashi who formerly disliked her I felt that the reverse is also true as by interacting with the ayakashi and seeing their world Aoi not only realized how similar this world was to her own but gradually came to like it as well something that was the complete opposite of what she thought at first upon her arrival and a good indication that not just the ayakashi but Aoi herself is changing as they both interact with each other.While the main plot was interesting I felt that the series also made great use of a number of subplots that not just took great advantage of the different lands and species that made up the realm by not just introducing the large variety of support characters that existed within the series but also expand upon them by allowing Aoi to interact with them and understand the issues that they are burdened with. While allowing Aoi to convert them from enemies to allies and friends these subplots also allowed us to see the many unique problems that bother each of the support characters which serve to expand upon their personalities something that I felt was well thought out. Overall Kakuriyo was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its unique premise, story, characters, creative problems and excellent voice acting. As a final score I felt that Kakuriyo easily deserves a final score of 10/10. man was to be whisked away and into a parallel world where both spirits and various types of mythical creatures such as Ogre’s, nine-tailed foxes and Yuki-Onna’s exist and most surprisingly be introduced to her future marriage partner that no one has told her about. The idea of being drawn from the human realm to another world is not something that is rare within the anime industry as we can see from the large amounts of anime that make use of the trapped in the game and traveling to another world ideas in the form of renowned series such as Sword Art Online and Log Horizon. However, I felt that Kakuriyo’s premise of being drawn into a parallel world where mythical creatures such as Ogre’s exist and being presented as a bride in order to pay off the debt of a relative was an interesting one as it allowed us as the viewer to see not just how the social standings of the various races work within the world but also allow us to see how a normal human girl like the main character Aoi would react as she enters this world and encounters the various rules and stigma that others view her with. The first episode of the series I felt was an excellent episode that did a great job of not just introducing us to the parallel world within the series but also introduce the two main characters of the series which was Aoi Tsubaki and Oodanna and their strong-willed and conflicting natures that clashed with each other. From this, I was impressed enough in that I decided to watch this series until the very end and I was glad that I did.Taking place within the parallel world that is called the hidden realm by its inhabitants the hidden realm is a land that resembles a fusion of ancient Japan and a fantasy world. While having many concepts that are recognizable from ancient Japan such as ancient inns, ninja’s and clothing suitable for that era the realm also features many elements of fantasy such as magic, flying ships and of course the various races that inhabit the different realms that make up the hidden realm. It is in this world that is hidden from the realm of human kind that the inhabitants of the realm who call themselves the ayakashi live their lives in a manner that is almost identical to that of normal human beings while co-existing with their fellow ayakashi in an age where conflict is all but unknown and where encounters with beings other than them are rare indeed. The overall story of the series follows the life of Aoi Tsubaki a human college student who while on her way to college one day is kidnapped and brought to a new world called the hidden realm and told that due to her recently deceased grandfathers’ debt Aoi must marry the head of a well-known inn as per an ancient agreement that was agreed between the two of them. Despite the situation facing her the ever so defiant Aoi refuses to obey the contract and instead counters with a proposal of her own in which she would work off her grandfather’s debt by opening up and operating an eatery within the inn.As Aoi opens up and begins operating her eatery the Moonflower she while overcoming the many hardships and stigma that she faces from the many races that make up the ayakashi would gradually start to realize that preparing delicious and beautiful food would not just allow her to pay off her debt but at the same time allow her to learn about not just the various races that inhabit the realm but also allow her to solve their various problems by listening to them, understanding them and try and devise solutions that will help them overcome such burdens and in the process not just forming strong friendships and bonds with each other but also allow her to come up with solutions to solve the many hidden problems that exist within the realm. Joining Aoi in her quest to use food to forge friendships and understanding between races are a host of characters that while mostly hostile to her at first soon become some of her best friends and most loyal allies. These include the intimidating but surprisingly kind Ogre inn master Oodanna, the kind, and loyal nine-tailed fox Ginji, the arrogant but surprisingly fair young hostess Oryo and the calm but surprisingly perceptive accounting chief Byakuya. Together with her allies Aoi would begin a fantastic adventure that will allow her to not just explore the many different regions that form the hidden realm but also allow her to create many beautiful and delicious food that will be used to not just form friendships but also solve the many problems that exist within the realm.AoiAoi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of The World God Only Knows and Kancolle fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A college student from the human realm that was brought to the hidden realm through somewhat forceful means Aoi in the beginning of the series while understandably upset at the turn of events was also shown to be a kind and caring person that while getting scared easily was also steadfast in her beliefs even when faced by the most intimidating of ayakashi. While easily scared Aoi was also an intelligent, curious and fast thinking person that thanks to her perceptive skills was not just able to identify sudden shifts to people’s behaviors but also act upon them by using this to further her understanding of both people and events within this new world. While a quiet person by nature Aoi was also someone that was friendly, good-natured and humble and while facing a lot of hostility in the beginning was able to convert these feelings of antagonism and use these to forge bonds and friendship with the staff of the inn something that was helped greatly by her fair and honest nature and her desire to do her best for all of her friends and customers. As a result of her friendly and honest nature Aoi was someone that always believed that one must act based on what their heart tells them and while this choice may not always be the best choice in some situations it can be seen that Aoi is someone that believes firmly in this belief even when the alternative might have been better. This is seen in her attempts to help those in need and her attempts to solve the problems that they are burdened with despite not getting anything back in return showing just how caring she is as a person. While a quiet and calm person by nature Aoi while often hard pressed in the beginning of the series also showed that rather than causing her undue pressure that would cause most normal people to mess up the extra pressure instead had the opposite effect in that it actually helped in allowing her to come up with not just solutions but also new dishes that can be used to handle situations no matter how sudden a trait that I felt took great advantage of Aoi’s ability to not just think outside of the box but also take advantage of her knowledge of dishes from the human realm as well. This trait of being able to use pressure from others as a source of motivation for Aoi to create new dishes I felt was one that suited her personality really well.A key part of Aoi’s personality that stems from her friendly and caring nature was her skills as a listener that takes advantage of her perception skills which allows her to not just understand the surface problem that someone is burdened with but also the underlying issues that may not be immediately visible due to a need to hide that fact something that I felt matched her image as both a cook and an eatery owner perfectly. While a very capable cook Aoi while loving the opportunity to both discover new recipes and ingredients is someone that can be surprisingly open-minded and honest in that she is willing to take feedback from others regarding her dishes and work hard to improve them showing not just how hardworking she is but also how determined she is to make sure that her dishes are able to fulfill the many promises that she has been bestowed with.As the series goes on and as Aoi, not just realizes just how vast the hidden realm was but also encounter many different people and situations Aoi’s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset, it can be seen that Aoi while having a great deal of respect for her grandfather didn’t particularly hold him in high regard due to his rather eccentric personality and actions and indeed seem to view him with some amount of dislike. After his passing and seeing the kind of bonds and effects that he had within the hidden realm however this instead is replaced by a sense of regret in that she did not seek to renew their strained bonds even as he neared his end. As a result of this sense of regret Aoi also developed a belief that regrets were something that was very sad and that no one should have any regrets which soon served to become one of Aoi’s most potent sources of motivation as she set about the task of running her eatery. This is shown in Aoi’s development as not just a capable cook but also a person as well as she will by improving her cooking skills also seek to understand her customers and the regrets and needs that they have and create the perfect dish for them that ensures that after having her dish both their physical hunger and their psychological burden has been dealt with. While having few friends at the beginning of the series this gradually changes as the series goes on as Aoi’s friendly and honest nature soon begins to change the views of the people around her. As a result of this Aoi becomes very protective of the bonds of friendship that’s been formed between them and becomes very loyal to her friends and will do her utmost to protect them from harm even if it meant that she must take some daring actions to do so. A trait that I felt was an interesting development since Aoi initially was someone that was used to being alone.A prominent belief that arose within Aoi as the series progressed was the belief that with her cooking ability she will be able to bridge not just the gap that exists between the human realm and the hidden realm but also between fellow ayakashi whose contrasting ideas often causes disagreements to form between them. A belief that only grows much more important during the second arc of the series as a result of Aoi bonding with the many ayakashi that inhabit the southern lands and the dire situation that the land is in due to past failures of an important ceremony. This belief I felt was an important development for Aoi as it showed the fact that Aoi has not just realized the importance of having loyal and important friends but also that her cooking ability can also be used for a much larger and more important purpose of mending the rifts that result from strained bonds and in the process saving a land from its cruel fate.The character of Aoi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. Aoi’s development from someone that was lonely, scared and had a deep sense of regret to someone that was not just brave but also determined to help those with their own burdens by understanding the underlying issues that plague them and creating a dish that solves it and in the process forming bonds of friendship with them being especially well thought out. I felt that her seiyuu Nao Touyama really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Aoi.GinjiGinji voiced by new voice actor Shunichi Toki is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi that takes the form of a nine-tailed fox that’s silver in color Ginji is also a shapeshifter whose human form is the form that Aoi and the members of the inn encounter the most. The young master of the Tenjin ya inn and effectively part of that inn’s upper management Ginji from initial appearances was a kind, caring and positive being that despite his position was also an honest and modest being that had little ego and helped all those that he met in his duties. A responsible person by nature Ginji was someone that approached each situation in a calm and composed manner and will do his best in everything that he does which is shown in his attempts to help Aoi as her assistant despite the added duties that this entails. This however also means Ginji can be somewhat reluctant in letting others do his job as he feels that it's his responsibility given his role. Due to his personality its perhaps unsurprising that Ginji was one of Aoi’s first friends as unlike the rest of the inn he did not see Aoi as an enemy and indeed was somewhat intrigued that Aoi’s skills as a cook was that impressive and as a result as their bonds deepened Ginji grows very protective of Aoi and dislikes seeing her being used by others.As the series goes on and more of Ginji’s character is revealed and expanded upon Ginji’s personality gradually starts to change. Despite his easy-going and friendly nature Ginji is someone that has a surprising lack of confidence in himself and while he has no shortage of acquaintances and fellow staffers that he can call upon it can be seen that Ginji tries to keep distance from them due to his low confidence and the fact that he feels that they do not trust him due his past. In fact, until Aoi’s appearance, Ginji’s best-known friendship was with the inn master Oodanna due to their long association in the past. Perhaps as a result of this Ginji was able to forge an immediate bond with Aoi due to her friendly and honest nature and in the process discover what its really like to have friends that he can count on. As a result of this, it can be seen that Ginji while valuing the fact that he can eat and have fun with his new friends is also very loyal to them and serious about their welfare and can become very distraught when he feels that he has failed them in some way.The character of Ginji I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. In a way I felt that Ginji’s inner darkness which served as his development was very similar to how Aoi was in the past before her coming into the hidden realm in that both were lonely and had few people that they could trust and indeed it can be said that Aoi’s development as a character was what opened his heart to the many joys that friendship and trust can bring to someone and in the process liberate him from the darkness that held him back. This shared sense of development between the two of them I thought was pretty well done and illustrated the fact that friendships and bonds can also be used to liberate someone from the darkness that constrained their lives.OodannaOodanna voiced by veteran voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi of Bleach and Fairy Tail fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi in the form of an ogre in human form and the master of the Tenjin Ya inn within the hidden realm Oodanna at the start of the series was a calm, composed and self-confident person that while quiet was also very professional and was highly regarded by both customers and his staff who viewed him with a high degree of respect. While appearing seemingly cold at first glance this was far from the truth as he was not just kind and caring but also intelligent and perceptive and treated everything and everyone fairly and is willing to place his trust in his staff something that his staff will do their utmost as to not betray. While a quiet person Oodanna was someone that was very loyal to his friends and while his usual self was normally polite and diplomatic this attitude can change dramatically if his friends are being treated harshly by others and will try to help them when needed. At the beginning of the series, Oodanna’s relationship with his bride Aoi was a tense one given the unique situation and though he is put off by her initial refusal to the proposal his impression of her gradually starts to change after seeing her determination to pay back her debt by working. In the beginning, while taking care to remain neutral to her work at the inn it can be seen that he also shows a great deal of concern for her and tries hard to dissuade her from any dangerous plans that she has thought off.As the series goes on and Oodanna’s relationship with Aoi improves and as they are confronted with one crisis after another Oodanna’s personality gradually starts to change. While initially not supportive of Aoi’s efforts to open up an eatery as the series goes on and as Oodanna saw with his own eyes just how much effort Aoi was putting in to prove herself this attitude of his eventually changes and Oodanna begins to slowly support her and be willing to come running when she calls. Despite his aloof nature, Oodanna is not someone that will let his station hold him back and indeed when things get busy Oodanna can also willingly let go of his role and work alongside his staff by taking care of guests and cooking for them a side of his character that I felt was surprising. A prominent part of Oodanna’s personality is, without doubt, his motivations both as a person and as an inn master. While having great faith in not just his friends but also in his staff as well Oodanna is someone that encourages them to not just do their best at their duties but also have ambition and dreams as Oodanna believes that without it the ayakashi would not be able to advance themselves. As a result of this Oodanna is someone that hates those that have neither which is one of the reasons why he pushed Aoi to work harder and why he let his staff do actions on their own free will. As a result of this the bonds that he shares with his staff and forges with Aoi can be seen to be a strong one and its easy to see just why Oodanna has so much faith in Aoi not just as a person but also as a cook since he knows that both are trying hard to achieve their dreams. The character of Oodanna I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with his contrasting personality and his way of motivating both Aoi and the members of his staff being one of the best things about his character. I felt that his voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi did an excellent job of portraying the character of Oodanna.ByakuyaByakuya voiced by veteran voice actor Atsushi Tamaru of Asterisk Wars and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s many allies within the series. The head of Tenjin Ya’s accounting department and thus one of Aoi’s bosses within the series Byakuya on initial appearances is a calm, composed and efficient person by nature that comes off as someone that’s strict and unsociable. A fact that is reinforced by the manner in which he treats Aoi at first as he only saw her as being the owner of a business that was not making a profit. While calm and composed Byakuya is also an intelligent, rational and logical person that while very serious about his job is also someone that’s willing to give people chances if they display the determination to do so. As a result of these qualities, it's perhaps unsurprising that Byakuya acts as the second in command to Oodanna where both his intellect and rational nature can also be used to locate and deal with threats to both the inn and to his friends and allies including to Aoi herself.As the series goes on however and Byakuya’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that while certainly strict and stern at times beneath this Byakuya is actually someone that has a surprisingly caring side to him which is best shown in the fact that he takes care of stray ayakashi in his spare time rather than say hole up in a dark room somewhere crunching numbers as most accountants would. In this state, it can be seen that Byakuya’s alternate personality is one that’s positive, cheerful and caring traits that I felt contrasted greatly with his normal strict self. As a result of this interesting side to his personality, I felt that it was quite funny at seeing him panic when he realizes that his secret has been exposed. At the beginning of the series, Byakuya as a result of his role as the head accountant of the inn had a somewhat antagonist relationship with Aoi due to the fact that despite Moonflower not making any profits at first Aoi was determined to keep it open as she tries to come up with the perfect recipes. However, as the series goes on and Byakuya came to both understand Aoi as a person as well as see the effects that her food has had on her many customers this sense of antagonism gradually disappears and is replaced by a healthy amount of respect for Aoi as both a person and a cook and as a result Byakuya gradually began to see her as a member of the inn. An interesting trait of Byakuya is that despite his calm and composed nature he can still get angry and when that happens his demeanor can be quite menacing which when used in dealing with upstarts like Raiju can be quite entertaining to watch.OryouOryou voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of The Asterisk War and Brave Witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Aoi’s allies within the series. An ayakashi in the form of a Yuki-onna that had taken on human form Oryou is the Tenjin Ya’s young hostess and as a result is the head of the hostesses that serve the many customers that come to Tenjin Ya. From the onset, it can be seen that Oryou is someone that while confident was also someone that was arrogant and rude to people and as a result while she was respected by the staff for her rank she had very few people that she can call her friends. This isn’t helped by the fact that in addition to being arrogant Oryou is also very rule-bound and would punish any infraction no matter how minor it is. As a result of this from the beginning of the series, Oryou actively viewed Aoi as a rival to her due to a combination of being the inn master’s fiancée and the fact that her hard work is earning her the respect of the staff while Oryou despite being here longer than her was getting nothing.As the series goes on however and as Oryou gets to interact with Aoi more her personality gradually starts to change. While rule bound to a degree it can be seen that Oryou beneath her arrogant surface personality is actually someone that’s fair and honest with her feelings. Indeed, looking at her past it can be seen that Oryou when she first become a hostess was someone that was not just determined but also worked hard at everything that she did which is similar to how Aoi is within the anime. From this, it can be seen where her pride actually comes from as its obvious that she’s very proud of her status as the young hostess. Despite her confident nature, it can be seen that beneath this Oryou can be surprisingly fragile due in part to her lack of friends and to the fact that she distrusts outsiders to the inn which served to limit the interactions that she could have with Aoi. However, after being taken care off by Aoi after she had collapsed due to overwork Oryou’s attitude towards Aoi began to change after seeing how much effort Aoi put in to help her recover which caused her to realize just how foolish her own actions had been in trying to belittle her. As a result of this, the relationship between the two gradually thawed as Oryou becomes friendlier not just bonding with Aoi but also becoming not just fast friends but also one of Aoi’s most trusted allies. At the same time as a result of this change Oryou while still arrogant and distrustful of others become much friendlier and willing to help others with their problems a notable example being her attempts to help Nene her opposite number at the Orio Ya inn overcome her insecurity by covertly helping her with some tricky customers. While showing her skills as a hostess this I felt also did a great job of showing the kind of contacts that she has across the realm something that is pretty important to a hostess. The character of Oryou I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual evolution from an arrogant and condescending hostess to one that was both friendly, caring and willing to help her juniors improve their skills so that they can both help the inn and themselves being especially well done. The manner of how Oryou and Aoi bonded by having them share memories of how they were in the past I felt was pretty interesting. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kakuma really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Oryou.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series many characters were pretty well designed with the many species of ayakashi especially being so. This was helped greatly by the large variety of species that form the ayakashi that Aoi encounters within the series. I felt that the incorporation of species like Ogre’s, nine-tailed foxes, Yuki-Onna’s and the other races that feature prominently within Japanese mythology matched well with the fact that the world of the hidden realm is one that fuses ancient Japan with a fantasy world. The various settings and locations that Aoi and the cast visit I felt was pretty well designed and featured quite an impressive variety of terrain that made great use of the world’s lore. In particular, I felt that the areas around Tenjin Ya and the southern lands that housed Orio ya contrasted well with each other as the former while lacking in beauty and resources was stable and at peace while the southern lands while beautiful were also one plagued by misfortune. While Kakuriyo is a supernatural and romance-themed anime the few combat scenes within the series I felt while short was also well designed as while they showed the ayakashi’s desire to keep peace and avoid conflict with each other the scenes also showed how powerful the ayakashi can be if they were fighting to protect those dear to them.The music within the series I felt was pretty well done with the OST, in particular, doing a great job of providing a great variety of music to the many kinds of situations that Aoi encounters while exploring the hidden realm. The series in total made use of two opening themes which was Tomoshibi No Manimani by Aoi’s seiyuu Nao Touyama and Utsushiyo no Yume that was sung by Nano. In total the series made use of 10 ending themes which was quite a lot even for a full season anime. I felt that the two opening themes both did a great job at conveying a sense of anticipation for the series with the first one doing a better job at this than the second one. The many ending themes for the series I felt did a great job at conveying the unique emotions and feelings that were attached to the events of each of the episodes in which they were featured in.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Nao Touyama, Shunichi Toki, Katsuyuki Konishi, Atsushi Tamaru and Ai Kakuma who portrayed the characters of Aoi, Ginji, Oodanna, Byakuya and Oryou respectively all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. In addition, while I didn’t cover them I felt that Yuma Uchida, Maaya Uchida, Reina Ueda, Mitsuki Nakae, Aoi Yuki, Kaito Ishikawa and Sayaka Kaneko who portrayed the characters of Akatsuki, Suzuran, Shizuna, Kasuga, Ougon Douji, Ranmaru and Nene respectively all did an excellent job at voicing their assigned roles.Overall conclusionIn overall Kakuriyo was an anime that I really enjoyed and was one of the few animes that I felt really deserves a full season. I felt that Kakuriyo’s greatest strengths were its interesting premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, creative emotional problems that require Aoi to solve, excellent voice acting and a lot of interesting life lessons.The overall premise of the series which was the kidnapping of Aoi and being told that you have been promised to marry the ogre that you have been brought before and Aoi’s subsequent determination to not just refuse it but also display a desire to pay back the debt by working within the world I felt was an interesting one and certainly one that’s rare within the world of anime. However, while strong this premise won’t be enough if it doesn’t have a good enough story that it marries itself too and in this is another of Kakuriyo’s strengths. As a result of both the fact that Aoi is the fiancée to the inn’s popular master and also of the fact that Aoi is also a human it won’t be an understatement to say that Aoi’s journey to start to work off her debt by first opening her eatery was an easy one as the inn’s staff definitely tried their hardest to stop her. However while these actions were often petty these actions also allowed us to see how Aoi not just withstands these abuse but also start to gradually overcome the innate hatred and distrust that her detractors have for her via her actions that not only help the inn’s but also serve to prove to them that while human Aoi isn’t just a pretty face and has both a kind and caring personality and plenty of skills that easily make her an equal to her detractors. Watching Aoi gradually win over her detractors by not just showing her creativeness but also her excellent ability as both a cook and a listener I felt was something that was really well done and resonated well with the series main theme of forging bonds and friendships with the ayakashi and changing their opinion of humans.While the story did a great job of showing how Aoi’s attempts to help others and solve their problems managed to win over plenty of ayakashi who formerly disliked her I felt that the reverse is also true as by interacting with the ayakashi and seeing their world Aoi not only realized how similar this world was to her own but gradually came to like it as well something that was the complete opposite of what she thought at first upon her arrival and a good indication that not just the ayakashi but Aoi herself is changing as they both interact with each other.While the main plot was interesting I felt that the series also made great use of a number of subplots that not just took great advantage of the different lands and species that made up the realm by not just introducing the large variety of support characters that existed within the series but also expand upon them by allowing Aoi to interact with them and understand the issues that they are burdened with. While allowing Aoi to convert them from enemies to allies and friends these subplots also allowed us to see the many unique problems that bother each of the support characters which serve to expand upon their personalities something that I felt was well thought out. Overall Kakuriyo was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its unique premise, story, characters, creative problems and excellent voice acting. As a final score I felt that Kakuriyo easily deserves a final score of 10/10."", ""After watching the first episode I had low expectations of this show. The whole Mary Sue in wonderland thing has been done to death at this point.Having the angle be a Japanese fantasy and it being a romance that attempts a reverse harem was not a bad idea so I kept watching. My tastes are simple, I see a cute guy in black or a fox dude and I'm in.Then the show's problems start to pile up. At first the story/plot line is really thin as they're not sure what to focus on. Should it be the character cast? The spirit world? Or the...food since it's a restaurant?Out of confusion they threw their hands in the air and said NONE, we will focus on none and just create random situations to fill up each episode. Just make sure The leading lady comes out of it smelling like a rose and the lead Man as super awesome making them the perfect match.I have to believe that there were budget restrains on this anime as it pads the running time with lingering shots (supposedly to showcase the artwork but really it's a normal shot nothing spectacular) a ton of looping animation and flashbacks.This last point is why I'm rating this so low, The show has so little respect for it's viewers that it would flashback to something that happened minutes, literally minutes ago in the same episode. If a character looks angsty they'll tell you exactly why in the very next frame. If you saw something like say a yokai transforming for the first time then you get the jest . In the next scene you don't need them to tell you that they are the spirit of so or so... you just saw it!This show is just sad. The artwork suffers and has an unfinished quality to it, The animation is really cheap, the storyline is paper thin, the Characters have no distinct personality and are only there to tell you how amazing the leads are... the leads who are Mary Sues so they have no personality either.There are way better shows out there for this genre, This one stole elements from almost every show in the recommendation list under it yet did nothing with it. Things just happen then the people disappear, like a kid playing with his action toys where suddenly out of nowhere this happens and this happens and some unrelated person appears so hero will save the day. Lame... food since it's a restaurant?Out of confusion they threw their hands in the air and said NONE, we will focus on none and just create random situations to fill up each episode.

Lame..."", 'Cast in a spirit world of mythology and supernatural entities, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi (Bed & Breakfast for Spirits) came together as a 2-cour show of enchanting brilliance. It’s actually based on a light novel but the ideas behind it reminds me of reading fantasy literature where the author knows what the readers wants. As a show that people probably overlooked this year, this anime definitely sets the bar.Written by Midori Yuuma, some of the authors’ work all contain several genres mixed together. When I began watching this show, it gave me the impression of a mythical slice of life while blending in cooking elements. Then,...you add some demonic entities in this show and volia, we have Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. Make no mistake, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is relatively simple to understand but may be hard to truly embrace. From my first viewing, it felt like the series was aiming to please a certain demographic. Folks who enjoy slice of life with an easy pacing may find this more watchable than others. However, this anime does accomplish a variety of goals that I think needs to be recognized.The plot focuses on a college student named Aoi Tsubaki who has the ability to see Ayakashi. These entities are spirits that we’ll see often throughout the show and she inherited this ability from her grandmother. It doesn’t take long for an Ayakashi to take her to a place known as the “Hidden Realm”. It’s a place where Ayakashi spends their lives. Aoi finds out the hard way as she realized her grandfather owed a debt. The collateral? It’s herself. It sets up for an arranged marriage as Aoi is forced to marry Oodanna to pay off the debt. However, she proposes to pay the debt by working at a restaurant there. What we get now is a human girl in this spirit world as her life changes forever. What does this all sound to you? If it reminds you of series like Kamisama Kiss or The Ancient Magus Bride, then you would be right. Both series involves a human girl getting involved with a not-so-normal entity while they adapt with a new lifestyle. From there on, they take on their role while surprising everyone at what they can really do. However, I would also say that this anime made a distinction of its own.To put it into perspective, the sensation I got from this series blends slice of life with fantasy with also a bit of shoujo vibe. Aoi is a standard female protagonist and despite her unique talent, she still falls under traps of being a damsel in distress. She often gets herself caught in danger by being at the wrong place at the wrong time. This is especially shown early in the series when she gets lost around the Hidden Realm. However, Aoi is also a very kind and gentle person. She accepts others for who they are and sincerely cares about the well-being of others, especially those who she trusts. Throughout the series, others sees her as a reliable and honorable person rather than just a marriage candidate. I think this is particular true for Oodanna as the two begins to understand each other more. Of course, there’s some subtle romance elements between the two. However, the show doesn’t fully explore that territory as this isn’t a love story. Joining them also includes other bishounens like Ginj, Akatsuki, and Byakuya. Ginji is noticeable from this list as he’s the first Ayakashi to show kindness to Aoi. As a nine-tailed fox, he also has the unique ability to shapeshift. It didn’t take long for him to notice Aoi’s culinary talent either. On the other hand, Akatsuki comes off as one of the more unfriendly characters. It’s hard to get along with him and the show makes it clear through effective storytelling in the form of flashbacks. Indeed, be prepared for a lot of flashbacks in the show especially on Aoi. She is the most important character in the story and this show attempts its best at getting us to understand her more.As Aoi meets and more characters, some will definitely find her as a nuisance and even sees the girl as a rival. Oryou is the most prominent example of this as she becomes jealous of her presence. It’s not exactly a love rivalry despite her obvious feelings towards Oodona. It’s more about Oryou trying to prove herself as being better. After a certain incident, she sees Aoi less as a rival and more as a friend. This sort of Aoi’s innate ability to change certain characters in the series is definitely something valuable. Initially, many characters in the series distrust her simply because she is human. However, Aoi can virtually make friends with just about anyone after proving herself. Other female characters in the series such as Kasuga and Shizuna also respects her as a person they can trust in.With 26 episodes, you may be asking yourself how to really enjoy this series. To be honest, there isn’t an easy answer but treating this show as a fantasy slice of life feels like the best route to go. The plot isn’t complex and it’s easy to understand the story. It doesn’t try to mislead viewers or try be something it’s not. There’s also cooking elements in the show that enhances the experience for those who seek some decorative slice of life. I’ve seen plenty of slice of life series and this anime crafts its cooking content with creativity.To be honest, Gonzo is an unusual choice for this show. From day one, I asked myself is they can make this show look like what it is and thankfully, there’s no worries. My first impression of the artwork is the shoujo-like character designs. Let’s face it, the bishounens in this series are pretty boys with handsome features. Even as Ayakashi, most of them look human. Then, there’s Aoi with her feminine and delicate character design. The show is also known for creating charming little critters like Chibi. In their mythical forms, most of the characters gives the impression of Japanese mythology. This is because the show is set in a spirit world and everything looks dream-like with a feeling of enchanting mystique. Similarly, this extends to the decorative theme songs of the show and character voices. Last but not least, I can also say with confidence that the food in the show look realistic enough to please. There’s a variety with carefully crafted texture and details for every dish no matter how simple or complicated.Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is a hidden gem from this year that most people may have overlooked. I have to admit that prior to watching this show, I had little interest in it either until realizing what it was really about. A fantasy slice of life anime like this doesn’t come by too often and can feel like a trick pony.

However, there\'s a reason of why I put this anime on-hold for such a long time. For months in fact.Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is an anime about a girl who had the isekai effect ( aka transported to another world ) and then instead of fighting monsters. She instead open a ""human"" food shop where she makes and sells ""human"" food. The story\'s quite simple and it\'s mostly about her helping other yokais as they come and go. And that\'s about it.The reason why I held this anime for so long is because of the fact...that I see no progress at all in the romance factor. Okay, I actually already expected this because the anime isn\'t categorize as romance. However, I solely started this anime for three things. Food, Kamisama ( God ) and Romance. I got two, but not the last one in which disappointed me incredibly.Although I am incredibly disappointed. Aside from the trash-ass-slow-paced-romance. The show itself does a pretty good job overall.

Ah, there\'s literally nothing better that could describe this anime. Seriously, if this anime had more romance then I\'d probably give it a 9 or so. Very disappointed.I recommend this anime to anyone who\'s looking for something chill + some food. Oh yeah, if you\'ve started watching this with the expectations of getting romance. Don\'t!

It\'s fine, it\'s meh, nothing good nor bad, both traits cancelled and equaled each other. And it\'s been a while since Gonzo has done a 2-cour series (since 2009), but the studio\'s quality of making anime has deteriorated overtime, and Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is no different.Story:It\'s very easy to summarize the entirety of the show, not just because of the source material, but of how shallow the series the staff working on this show decided to place the various scenes around with coherent but inconsistent...flow:1st Cour:- Girl gets summoned into the supernatural world (tempted to call it an Isekai, similarity sake) because of her predecssor\'s problems, then gets coerced into a ""legal""-binding marriage with an ayakashi (or Spirit).- To avoid this controversy of a major problem (pay off all debts of her deceased uncle), she sets up ""shop"" at the inn so that they can monitor her every action while she cooks up food from the apparent realm (the world humans live in) to appease and satisate all of the ayakashi\'s taste buds. Together with her companion Chibi (which is the small tortoise-looking kappa), the weird ""love-romance"" interest between Aoi and the Master (Oodanna) exists...? More likely as a source of protection.Result: The first few episodes really got me intrigued...but somehow along the way it becomes repetitive. And also, you can throw the Isekai Shokudou reference out already, because this line is played consistently in EVERY episode, so much to the fact that it has gotten boring overtime.2nd Cour:- To make matters worse, she is caught in the fire of another inn, this time serving in the land of no return and acting as the rival inn to the one that she resides in.- Adding the fuel to the fire, the rival inn ALSO knows of the travesty of the girl\'s deceased uncle, and aims to shoot everything at her feet while not giving her leeway to do as she pleases.- The nail in the coffin: Some traditional festival to please the ayakashi god of that festival to maintain peace and prosperity, and the ayakashi in charge acts like some mean and demeanor villain to derail the rival inn and the girl\'s efforts...just to invoke some senseless and forced emotional ""drama"".Result: A story that while handled by series composer, veteran Tomoko Konparu (Nodame Cantabile, NANA, Kimi no Todoke), is handled by someone whom has done a lot of Side-B directorials (key animation, character designs etc.) and this is her very first overall directorial work. But somehow, as good as how we perceived this series to be, the problems start showing up one after another, so much so when we needed the understanding link, it is nowhere to be found.Characters:Aoi Tsubaki is a firm and steady girl, and does not give in to peer pressure, and I applaud Nao Touyama for voicing as her because for all intensive purposes, she is the perfect character for Aoi.

Throughout the course of the series, they appear at the key moments where the Master and Aoi were having problems of their own, and they were the catalyst to ""keep things moving"" and substantiate the relationship of Aoi and the other ayakashi.I never thought I would say this, but the number of characters here were perhaps a bit overbearing, like ""What\'s the point of them showing up only when (specific) things occur""? The initial focus on both the romance of Aoi and Oodanna (this ain\'t a reverse harem), along with the friendships of the closest aide Ginji and Chibi the annoying kappa (which only eats cucumber), that switch is always on and off, to the point that I was wondering what is the resolution of the characters if they were meant to serve that one-and-only purpose.Art and animation:No surprise here, it\'s Gonzo. Their works of recent are less than impressive with nothing noteworthy of mention, and it doesn\'t help that the artwork is seriously washed out, animation is cut-thin while being of decent quality, and the entirely has an incomplete sense of quality. And despite all that, I think this is the perfect series that compromises everything about the studio: decent to downright mediocre. Nothing more to say about this aspect.Music:This particular OST is rife with the usual 2-cour OPs but MANY EDs due to the fact that certain episodes encompass the main male ayakashi as the centrifugal position (majority of screentime) where the series storytelling lands into. I\'d say this was a somewhat interesting mix, so let\'s break it down:OP: Great with Nao Touyama\'s voice talents and absolutely brillant with nano.ED: Main EDs are great, with the various male ayakashi\'s VAs being OK at best.Easily the best part about the series. And then again, nothing more.In the end, this series, while being a poor man\'s effort of every other series done right, be it subtle references of such, is sadly a chore to watch once you get to know what is happening, and that as is remains for the core foundation of everything. So much so that the boredom and tireness tells the story of one irrefutable destiny that is laid dormant and never focused again. What a shame this is, playing the lame game all the time. flow:1st Cour:- Girl gets summoned into the supernatural world (tempted to call it an Isekai, similarity sake) because of her predecssor\'s problems, then gets coerced into a ""legal""-binding marriage with an ayakashi (or Spirit).- To avoid this controversy of a major problem (pay off all debts of her deceased uncle), she sets up ""shop"" at the inn so that they can monitor her every action while she cooks up food from the apparent realm (the world humans live in) to appease and satisate all of the ayakashi\'s taste buds. Together with her companion Chibi (which is the small tortoise-looking kappa), the weird ""love-romance"" interest between Aoi and the Master (Oodanna) exists...? More likely as a source of protection.Result: The first few episodes really got me intrigued...but somehow along the way it becomes repetitive.

I, personally, like Odanna a lot and wouldn\'t mind seeing Aoi and him together. I was SO disappointed to see in the later episodes, NOTHING happened. The premise was dropped like a stone and the show just introduced more and more characters I don\'t care about.None of the characters even breathed without saying ""Oh Aoi, your grandpappy was a real (insert cliche line about him saving their life or messing with them)"" It\'s so ANNOYING! And they keep eating food and talking about it all the time? Like, is it relevant or is this a cooking anime? BORING.Also, I cannot seem to pinpoint if this is a romance or some kind of adventure? The stint about the business in the restaurant was so boring.My biggest issue is the lack of plot. Okay so basically, Aoi wants to know more about her mysterious grandad and wants nothing to do with Ogre-boy. Right? There\'s a red herring about her grandad being alive and the demon who helped her.Is the show going to talk about finding peace with demons and humans?Will Aoi and Odanna fall in love and maintain the inn together? Will Aoi fail in her restaurant mission?No.Instead I\'m sitting through filler and pointless nonsense about characters grunting happily while they eat some mediocre cooking and fawn over her grandad. Pointless. Stupid.Still, I\'m watching because of Odanna. Then again, the writing is so TERRIBLE he doesn\'t get much screentime :(. I hope to see more of him and Aoi and hopefully some world building too...Overall, the show is meh but promising. I don\'t suggest watching it if you cannot stand filler and stupid boring characters with LOADS of cliche.Out of ten, I give it a 5 1/2. Up to episode 3, I was satisfied.

Embarrassing that this show has such a high rating when better anime like Kamisama Kiss exist with a similar feel. The animation for this show is straight up lazy. At first the premise sounded cool and I enjoyed the first episode, but the whole anime feels like filler--pointless episodes going absolutely nowhere. The characters weren\'t even good enough to make it worth while; MC is a mary-sue, and everyone else is so flaccid. Where\'s the flavour? Theyre all just caricatures of certain personality types. At least their character designs were cuteI wanted to see more of a relationship form between the ogre and...MC but they get random odd scenes together (mainly when he\'s rescuing her because she\'s constantly a ""damsel"").  In fact, it seemed sometimes that Ginji and the MC had a possible thing going on more than the ogre.I would never watch this again lol MC but they get random odd scenes together (mainly when he\'s rescuing her because she\'s constantly a ""damsel"").  In fact, it seemed sometimes that Ginji and the MC had a possible thing going on more than the ogre.I would never watch this again lol', 'Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is boring, confused, poorly made, and all around one of the worst anime I have ever seen.This is my first review so sorry if it\'s not really good.When I read the summary for Kakuriyo Bed and Breakfast for spirits, I thought it was the average, lighthearted shoujo with a slight supernatural twist. What I got was radically different and extremely disappointing.This anime, in short, can\'t decide what is wants to be. There are basically four main story lines, each more unnecessary than the last. On one hand, the protagonist is learning to love a man that she was forced into an...arranged marriage with while also managing a restaurant since the food she cooks apparently has strange rejuvenating powers in this other world. On the other hand, she is trying to find the ayakashi that helped her as a child in the midst of assassination attempts of unknown origin.Is it a romance, a cooking anime, a mystery, or a thriller? I sincerely feel like this anime could have been half decent if they had focused on one or two things. Instead, it turned out to be a horrible, awkward story made of stitched-together story lines that hardly made sense. The lore is hastily explained, often through long, boring scenes of characters explaining how the world works to a clueless protagonist over an unanimated, unengaging slideshow of mediocre images.  The entire story danced around this mystery of the ""masked ayakashi"" who gave her food as child when it really could have just been found out by asking a couple simple questions. The climax was the opposite of thrilling. And the worst part is that even with everything going on, the story managed to be incredibly boring.Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t need jaw-dropping scenes and seamless animation painstakingly drawn frame-by-frame. However, I have some standards, and Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi definitely did not mean those. The anime ran in 2018, which is fairly recent. In all honestly, the style of the anime was fine. The animation and the quality overall is horrible. There were scenes where I thought my TV was frozen because there was almost no movement except for maybe one character\'s mouth. It seemed like every character moved as little a possible in order to limit the amount of animation that needed to be done. I wouldn\'t be surprised if someone told me it was made in Microsoft Paint.I\'ve never seen a show with less character development. Every character\'s defining trait was either ""nice"" or ""mean"" and no one ever deviated from the character type established in episode one. Despite being deceived multiple times and receiving ill-treatment from multiple characters, the protagonist exhibits a nonsensical amount of naivete and believes every single word anyone says. Despite the situation, (ie. and attempt made on her life MULTIPLE TIMES, being imprisoned, fooled, discriminated against, etc.) she seems to automatically forgive and care for anyone in a way that is so unrealistic it\'s laughable. Moreover, it seems like no one can resist Aoi\'s nonexistent charms and every character who begins disliking her somehow comes to begrudgingly love her in an episode or two.The relationship between the female protagonist, Aoi, and the main love interest, Odanna (who is almost exclusively referred to as ""Ogre God"" throughout the anime, so much so that I had to look up his name because I realized I never really learned it) never develops. Their relationship morphs from general distaste to friendly acquaintances at best. Apart from a small arc at the end of the anime, she hardly has an interaction with him as he makes an appearance for roughly 6 minutes an episode if any.It was boring. I never once had a feel for where the anime was going and I never felt compelled to watch another episode when one ended. It never felt like the story was progressing and instead was just a documentary of a clueless girl wandering around in a world she knows nothing about. The moments that were supposed to tug on the heartstrings were devoid of emotion with no strong story to back it up. The moments that were supposed to be heartwarming felt cold because it never felt like you really knew any of the characters beyond surface level.I cannot think of a less memorable anime. I finished it without being able to recall a single significant plot point. It seemed to be poorly made and honestly might have been better if it just remained a manga. The story was bad and confusing, the characters were boring and predictable, and every episode felt like filler because there was no substantial story. I have no idea why this was so well-received by viewers or why it has even a single rating above a 6 (and that\'s pushing it).TLDR;Please, don\'t waste your time. Don\'t watch Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. arranged marriage with while also managing a restaurant since the food she cooks apparently has strange rejuvenating powers in this other world.

I also think that the lesson you\'ll get in this anime is, cooking for someone or...to others (especially if the food is delicious) gives you and them happiness, and will also bring you energy and move forward in your day to day life (ayakashi or not :D)Overall, I like the anime but it just didn\'t give me too much excitement. To others, this might be a boring anime, but I suggest you guys to give this anime a try. to others (especially if the food is delicious) gives you and them happiness, and will also bring you energy and move forward in your day to day life (ayakashi or not :D)Overall, I like the anime but it just didn\'t give me too much excitement.

Kakyriyo no Yadomeshi appeared to be a good mix of what I wanted with a bit of action, a focus on supernatural, and a light-hearted romance on the side. As I continued to watch on it quickly dawned on me that the plot, story, and characters were getting nowhere fast. After the 12th episode aired I decided I had given this show enough of my attention and it was time to drop it in favor...of another seasonal show.The premise of Kakyriyo no Yadomeshi is rather a cut-and-dry love story that takes place in a parallel world filled with Japanese spirits. The art style is very generic for the romance genre with many episodes have mediocre or even laughable quality control on the character’s ratios or movements. Every 2-3 episodes consist of a still image, with generic traditional Japanese music being played, that is meant to highlight the beauty of the art style where it really just shows the mediocrities.As far as characters go, they are all rather stereotypical and can be extremely predictable at times. The main character, Tsubaki Aoi, comes off as very Mary Sue since she has no family left living, can see spirits, and can cook up just about anything from tofu ice cream to homemade mayonnaise. The show explains that her grandfather took her under his wing and, seemly, transformed her into a character out of Shokugeki no Souma. Aoi is then warned to never truly trust a ‘Ayakashi’ as they have fowl intentions for those with supernatural abilities.Naturally, one of the first true impressions we receive is Aoi taking a present with no regards to her own safety and gets spirited away. The main love interest, Odanna, is a typical rich boy attitude that somehow is able to charm our main girl even when she is simply there to act as collateral for her grandfather’s debt. The cast of characters are seen every episode or so with most only getting 1-2 episodes of growth before resorting to their old personalities.The music in the show is nothing that is really majestic or something I would go back and listen too, however, it does fit the theme of traditional Japan since most of the characters are seen wearing traditional dress and traditional food options. Since this show was originally a light novel series adapted to a manga serialization then created into a 26-part anime, I believe the show must have lost a good portion of its natural charm.For those that want a show that’s not serious about itself, uninspired on its themes, and full of predictable side characters this would be the best. As horrible as it is, it might not be a bad start for people just getting into anime or for a rather easy to follow plot for new comers. Is it a ground-breaking master piece or might it ever be considered a classic?

Ok. So, you don\'t care \'bout spoilers. I\'m assuming that.If you watched like, four romances and one supernatural show, you know exactly what is going to happen in Kakuriyo. It is predictable as that. They took the laziness in a whole new level while writing the script for this show. Basically, Kakuriyo is about Tsubaki Aoi, a girl that can see spirits named Ayakashi,...and one beautiful day, a handsome ogre (it would be better if it was good ol\' Shrek) stepped onto her and asked ""do you wanna come with me to my world?"" and Aoi, as a woman full of obligations, full of bills to pay, of work to do, said: ""sure, why not?"" and then discovered that his grandpa lost to the ogre in a bet, and that she was the prize. But she refuses to marry the ogre! As the independent woman that she is (at this point, there someone who still believe in this?), she starts a restaurant to pay her debt with the handsome ogre, and so the story begins.Story: 3/10This anime treats the audience like complete idiots. They do flashbacks of things that happened 1 episode before, or even in the SAME EPISODE! Another thing, is that they don\'t know how to foreshadowing a thing. In episode 3 or 4 they introduced a blond children in the story, but in episode 15, they revealed that in fact, the blonde children was the Ougon-douji, the master of the Hachiko Council and superior to the Odanna and all the other Hachiko, but why is her so powerful? Why is her so important? How did she became the woman that she is now, respected and feared by all the eight kingdons? The anime simply don\'t tell any of that to you. And I\'m just started.There\'s a character named Ginji and another named Ranmaru in this series. I\'ll talk more about them in the Characters section, but for now, just know that they can transform into, respectively, a dog and a fox. In episode 24, they went to this place that were inside a painting on a parchment that represented a river in a sunny day, with a forest on one side and a mountain on the other, and by that, you presume that this world will be in stasis, right? To represent the image that was painted on, the world will be in stasis, always day, always sun, no rain and all of that, right? But the anime just says ""fuck you and your logic"" and creates and entire and a functional ecosystem... INSIDE A PAINTING! There\'s night and day cycle, there\'s rain and fog! AND THAT MADE NO FUCKING SENSE AT ALL!!! And to top it off, in the end, Ranmaru and Ginji arrive on the place they were trying to arrive (with Aoi, because fuck logic, she\'s the protagonist), and for no reason, they turn into puppies and rub their heads. By the direction of the scene, it was supposed to be an emotional scene, the two brothers reconciling and all, but I was just laughing. There were NO REASON fort them to turn into puppies. I think they did this just to please the furry fandom (and they did it, search for ""Ranmaru"" on Rule34).But, let\'s move on, you already know why the story is crap and cliché, let\'s move on to the Art. Oh boy...Art: 3/10This is by far, one of the most poorly executed animations of Gonzo Studio. There were so many proportion errors, so many bad animation, so many repeated frames that I could pass the entire month writing about each one of them, but let\'s just focus on the thing that made me most upset about this: The use of CGI.I would not care if they started the anime with some elements already in CGI and carry that for the rest of the anime, really, the CGI isn\'t bad at all. My issue is that around episode 16, they stopped doing the flying boats in 2D like in the beginning of the anime and started doing in CGI. Why not use CGI from the beginning? Why change it midway? This is laziness at it\'s best. All the other art errors falls to this point: laziness. This entire anime were lazily made.Sound: 8/10Let\'s talk about the only thing that this anime did right: the soundtrack. Man, it is awesome. They did with traditional instruments from Japan, and it fits really well with the scenes, with the setting of the show, is really good. And the openings are very good too, the first is more traditional japan, had this emotional feeling, and the second is more heavy, representing the flow of the plot, that started to get more politically complex (although in episode 19 they forget all that they built) and the song is more fast and catchy than the first one, it suits more my musical taste. But both openings are good in their way.Characters: 2/10I hate all the characters of this show except of Ginji. Aoi is more dumb than a door, she always do the same mistakes and always have to be rescued; Odanna is really boring and the way that he always insists in marry Aoi, even though she clearly don\'t want to, really pisses me off; Ranmaru is... someone please kill him, he\'s A DICK; Byakuya is omnipresent apparently, he always appears when Aoi needs help and is really boring to see the covenience that the plot made him be, because he had potential when he first appeared, and the rest of the cast just isn\'t worth to mention because NOBODY CARES. Besides Ginji, all of the characters of this anime are boring as hell. And the thing that made me hate this anime even more: the mysterious ayakashi.The anime presents in the beginning this mysterious ayakashi that helped Aoi when her mother abandoned her, and this was the only bit of mystery that the show was working on. Later, in episode 14 I guess, the show revealed to us that this mysterious ayakashi that helped Aoi was in fact, Ginji, and Aoi started to feel something about Ginji, and so on, the anime worked to develop that feeling by taking Odanna out of place and putting Aoi with Ginji all of the time. And 10 eps later, Ginji reveals that he only helped the mysterious ayakashi. HE WASN\'T THE MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI! AND THE OPENING JUST SHOWS YOU THAT HE IS THE MYSTERIOUS AYAKASHI! WHY?! WHY THROW ON THE TRASH CAN THE ONLY MYSTERY THAT THIS PLOT WAS DEVELOPING?!Enjoyment: 1/10I barely had any enjoyment while watching this show. The episodes were really really boring, it was like I watched 100 episodes after finishing just one episode. In a moment, I just asked why I picked this anime to watch, and I was almost dropping when episode 24 came. THIS EPISODE IS ONE OF THE WORST EPISODES THAT I\'\'VE WATCHED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! After this episode I swore to myself that I was going to finish the anime and I was going to write this review. I had the same feeling with Darling In The FranXX, I just have to explain my thoughts of why this anime sucks.Overall: 2/10Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is a bad anime. But it isn\'t like the bad animes out there: it offends you. It so bad that you get offended by watching it. It\'s so bad that you pause the episode and yell to the PC ""WHAT THE FUCK? DID THIS REALLY HAPPENED? WHY? IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE!"". Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is one of the worst anime that I watched in my entire life. I suffered watching 26 episodes of this shit so you there won\'t have to suffer. Stay away of this anime.  STAY AWAY! and one beautiful day, a handsome ogre (it would be better if it was good ol\' Shrek) stepped onto her and asked ""do you wanna come with me to my world?"" and Aoi, as a woman full of obligations, full of bills to pay, of work to do, said: ""sure, why not?"" and then discovered that his grandpa lost to the ogre in a bet, and that she was the prize. But she refuses to marry the ogre! As the independent woman that she is (at this point, there someone who still believe in this?), she starts a restaurant to pay her debt with the handsome ogre, and so the story begins.Story: 3/10This anime treats the audience like complete idiots. They do flashbacks of things that happened 1 episode before, or even in the SAME EPISODE! Another thing, is that they don\'t know how to foreshadowing a thing. In episode 3 or 4 they introduced a blond children in the story, but in episode 15, they revealed that in fact, the blonde children was the Ougon-douji, the master of the Hachiko Council and superior to the Odanna and all the other Hachiko, but why is her so powerful? Why is her so important? How did she became the woman that she is now, respected and feared by all the eight kingdons? The anime simply don\'t tell any of that to you. And I\'m just started.There\'s a character named Ginji and another named Ranmaru in this series. I\'ll talk more about them in the Characters section, but for now, just know that they can transform into, respectively, a dog and a fox. In episode 24, they went to this place that were inside a painting on a parchment that represented a river in a sunny day, with a forest on one side and a mountain on the other, and by that, you presume that this world will be in stasis, right? To represent the image that was painted on, the world will be in stasis, always day, always sun, no rain and all of that, right? But the anime just says ""fuck you and your logic"" and creates and entire and a functional ecosystem... INSIDE A PAINTING! There\'s night and day cycle, there\'s rain and fog! AND THAT MADE NO FUCKING SENSE AT ALL!!! And to top it off, in the end, Ranmaru and Ginji arrive on the place they were trying to arrive (with Aoi, because fuck logic, she\'s the protagonist), and for no reason, they turn into puppies and rub their heads. By the direction of the scene, it was supposed to be an emotional scene, the two brothers reconciling and all, but I was just laughing. There were NO REASON fort them to turn into puppies. I think they did this just to please the furry fandom (and they did it, search for ""Ranmaru"" on Rule34).But, let\'s move on, you already know why the story is crap and cliché, let\'s move on to the Art. Oh boy...Art: 3/10This is by far, one of the most poorly executed animations of Gonzo Studio. There were so many proportion errors, so many bad animation, so many repeated frames that I could pass the entire month writing about each one of them, but let\'s just focus on the thing that made me most upset about this: The use of CGI.I would not care if they started the anime with some elements already in CGI and carry that for the rest of the anime, really, the CGI isn\'t bad at all. My issue is that around episode 16, they stopped doing the flying boats in 2D like in the beginning of the anime and started doing in CGI. Why not use CGI from the beginning? Why change it midway? This is laziness at it\'s best. All the other art errors falls to this point: laziness. This entire anime were lazily made.Sound: 8/10Let\'s talk about the only thing that this anime did right: the soundtrack. Man, it is awesome. They did with traditional instruments from Japan, and it fits really well with the scenes, with the setting of the show, is really good. And the openings are very good too, the first is more traditional japan, had this emotional feeling, and the second is more heavy, representing the flow of the plot, that started to get more politically complex (although in episode 19 they forget all that they built) and the song is more fast and catchy than the first one, it suits more my musical taste. But both openings are good in their way.Characters: 2/10I hate all the characters of this show except of Ginji. Aoi is more dumb than a door, she always do the same mistakes and always have to be rescued; Odanna is really boring and the way that he always insists in marry Aoi, even though she clearly don\'t want to, really pisses me off; Ranmaru is... someone please kill him, he\'s A DICK; Byakuya is omnipresent apparently, he always appears when Aoi needs help and is really boring to see the covenience that the plot made him be, because he had potential when he first appeared, and the rest of the cast just isn\'t worth to mention because NOBODY CARES. Besides Ginji, all of the characters of this anime are boring as hell. And the thing that made me hate this anime even more: the mysterious ayakashi.The anime presents in the beginning this mysterious ayakashi that helped Aoi when her mother abandoned her, and this was the only bit of mystery that the show was working on.

STAY AWAY!', ""I honestly love this show, I don't really like a cliche romance or cliches in general. I think this did fall into some cliches considering there were tengu and a nine-tailed fox, but I did learn more about the folktale compared to an anime like Kamisama Kiss. This show isn't focused on romance too much, it is the main premise and I feel like Odanna doesn't get enough show time and the chemistry between them feels rushed. He's still a great and kind character and I think the manga goes into their romance more.I was also a bit hesitant at first to watch this...because of the food, and I still don't really care too much about it, but I love the dialogue and plot.The main character is not weak and docile, she will speak up when she feels so and she can be kind, but teasing and playful as well. She constantly helps people with her food even though people talk ill of her, but she will not back down. She is forced into the marriage but doesn't plan to accept it. Even though she doesn't hate Odanna, she still continues to work her hardest.Byakuya and Ranmaru are also very entertaining characters, in my opinion.

The characters are cliché with hardly any likeability, and the stories tend to throw all logic out the door to ensure the two main love interests become a couple by the end. Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi (Bed and Breakfast for Spirits), sadly, falls into this category. But the end result for this one is much worse than you\'d expect.There\'s a lot to this review, so please bear with me.Story | 2/10Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi sets itself up as a story about an orphan girl named Aoi Tsubaki who...is unexpectedly swiped into the ""Hidden Realm"" - a realm where ayakashi live - by an ogre god named Oodanna. When she arrives, she is told that she will become Oodanna\'s bride as collateral from a debt her grandfather owed but was never able to pay off before his untimely death. Aoi immediately refuses this proposal and decides that instead of marrying someone she hardly knows, yet alone loves, she will alternatively pay off her grandfather\'s debt by working at Tenjin-ya, the inn that Oodanna is the headmaster of. Oodanna hesitantly agrees to this new plan, though with his approval, he gives Aoi the condition that she only has a certain amount of time to pay off the debt. If she fails to complete the task, she will become his bride, and if she still refuses, she will be devoured by him.The first episode proved to be very promising, and I had high hopes for the rest of the anime. Right away, I really liked how Aoi gave off the impression of being assertive and clever. She didn\'t appear to be the kind of girl who would cave in and submit to the demands of a man, so having a strong female lead was refreshing to see considering in most other romance shoujo I\'ve seen, the female main characters are usually the ones who will do anything and everything to make their crush like them back (Itazura na Kiss and Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji are some examples). I also loved how Oodanna\'s character was introduced. His demeanor was threatening, impatient, and unforgiving, which was a perfect arrangement for character development.For a few episodes following the first, the story continues exactly as planned: Aoi begins her work at Tenjin-ya in a small restaurant she called Moonflower in order to earn money to pay off her grandfather\'s debt that he obtained while he spent his own time at Tenjin-ya. With how well the plot was going so far, I was eager to see what was to become of Moonflower, and how a romantic relationship would eventually bloom between Aoi and Oodanna - since this anime IS tagged as a romance, after all. However, as the story further progresses and more characters are thrown into the mix, the initial intentions for the plot completely falls apart and are nearly forgotten all together.I first noticed hints that the story was going to creep away from what was settled in the first episode when Aoi would frequently serve food to people at her restaurant without charge. This was quite odd to me because it was clearly stated that Aoi had a time limit she needed to meet if she wanted to return back to her home in the human world. Sure, most of these ayakashi she fed were either out of pity or for a special event, but if she was fine with giving out her service for free more than with a charge, then what\'s the point of setting up a plan to pay back the debt in the first place? She\'s not earning any money this way. Perhaps it was meant to show the audience that Aoi is a kind person, but this was already determined after the first ayakashi she fed for free. The fact that Aoi continued to serve without asking for payment only pushed her further into a direction that was completely out of character from the beginning where she was wholly adamant on not wanting to marry Oodanna. If she really felt this way, it would have made much more sense for her to be constantly reminding herself about her deadline and picky-choosy about who gets food for free. Maybe even have her offer discounts to those she deems as friends rather than just handing out meals because they showed up to talk to her. That way, her character could still be showcased as kind to others while also keeping a bit of healthy selfishness in favor of her goal. Regardless, only a few episodes in, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi quickly started down a path that was losing focus on the whole setup of the anime, and from here on out things only seemed to get worse.As more characters are introduced into the plot, Aoi\'s goal to get home is put so far on the back burner that the importance of this objective evaporates entirely. For real, I mean it when I say that the debt and her time limit are NEVER mentioned again. Instead, the story of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi turns into a Kamisama Hajimemashita and Shokugeki no Souma hybrid where the sole emphasis is on Aoi\'s ability to cook food for the ayakashi. Alongside that, we are also given half-episode long useless backstories for characters that have miniscule importance to the plot other than what was happening in that current episode. This results in almost every single episode to follow this layout:⇒ A problem arises in Tenjin-ya (first arc) or Orio-ya (second arc) caused by either an employee or a customer⇒ This problem causes an over-dramatic fight between characters⇒ Aoi decides to meddle and try to solve this problem herself⇒ One of the characters tells their backstory/how they started fighting the other character⇒ She cooks food for said characters in disagreement⇒ Eating her food magically makes everyone happy; the arguing characters make up and become best friends⇒ Roll creditsIf this layout was only used on characters who ended up being vital to the plot, I would have been okay with seeing it once or twice by means of story development. However, this is the generalized structure that is seen episode after episode with characters that are introduced as soon as the episode begins, and are never seen again once it\'s over. Thus, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi spirals down a never ending mess of repetitiveness and predictability. Aoi in particular also loses her determination to work hard so she can get out of an unwanted betrothal, and instead she works more toward solving the problems of other people over her own. The most annoying part about all of this is that every single problem is resolved immediately once the characters eat Aoi\'s food. She makes no effort to try and get these characters to overcome their differences on their own by giving them advice and whatnot. Literally, her FIRST idea to help with every problem is to head toward the kitchen. I get it, food brings people together, but this is taking it a bit to the extreme. I know if I was fighting with my friend or sibling over something like the characters in the anime were, food would NOT help with the process of making up with each other. The solution as a whole is just lazy and unrealistic.Now, where\'s Oodanna during all this? As one of the three main characters in the anime, we surprisingly don\'t see much of him once the anime turns into a cooking show. The only episodes where he receives the most screen time are the ones where Aoi ends up kidnapped by an ayakashi for absolutely no reason at all, meaning it\'s up to Oodanna to save her. These episodes attempt to disguise themselves as ploys to develop the romance side of things, but to me it felt more like an unnatural and cliché way to force the two love interests alone together. Not to mention, with the addition of Aoi\'s continuous stubbornness and disinterest toward the dude, there isn\'t much advancement in romance at all. Hell, the two don\'t even end up together by the end of the anime, so that was a disappointment. Sorry for the spoiler.I should mention that there\'s also a small subplot that runs throughout the anime where Aoi is trying to find this masked ayakashi in the Hidden Realm who saved her from starvation and loneliness when she was a child. This was definitely something that piqued my interest in the midst of the main plot falling apart, because it could\'ve definitely worked well as a motive regarding why Aoi doesn\'t entirely look eager to rush back home anymore. However, the subplot is only mentioned from time to time, and after it\'s randomly brought up that Aoi starts to think she\'s getting closer to the ayakashi she\'s looking for, the subplot drops off the face of the earth for another few episodes. For example, in the transition between the two arcs of the anime, Aoi begins to suspect that a certain character is that ayakashi. Yet, even after throwing a whole-ass tantrum making it a big deal that she ""HAS to know if it\'s true"", she never even bothers to mention it to them the next time she talks to them. She even seems to completely forget that this character could be who she\'s looking for until the LAST EPISODE of the anime. It doesn\'t make sense. If finding that ayakashi was something that was so important to her, why would she wait to see if what she suspected was true? Yeah, problems arose and things got in the way as soon as she thought that ayakashi from her childhood could be this character, but it really doesn\'t take that much effort to ask someone, ""Hey, by any chance was that you?"" Like come on. Stop dragging the subplot out and reveal who it is already. There is absolutely no need for suspense.Character | 2/10As I stated before, new characters are added to the story from left and right. Consequently, valuable screen time is used to explain the history of these minor characters rather than expanding on characters that already exist. In other words, the anime both massively lacks character development for some, and forces others to change way too quickly. I was so frustrated with this, because the actions of Aoi and Oodanna portrayed in the first episode were PERFECTLY set up for strong character development, yet this wasn\'t taken advantage of at all!First, we have Aoi, the main character whose point of view we follow. She is introduced as a kind-hearted, strong-willed, independent woman. As a female watcher, these are all wonderful traits to see given to a female main character! I love it when these girls are given the abilities to solve problems on their own and act without male influence. Unfortunately, the way Aoi uses these traits ends up turning the initial attractiveness of her personality into one that is extremely unlikable. Let me elaborate. Aoi\'s ""kindness"" makes her a serial meddler. She will one hundred percent put herself in the middle of any disagreement between other ayakashi she comes across to solve the problem for them. On most occasions, Aoi isn\'t even doing this because she wants to see everyone happy. She has ulterior motives, ones where solving this problem means that she\'ll get something in return, like an object or simply the characters\' approval. If anything, that seems less benevolent and more manipulative to me. Moreover, Aoi\'s independent mindset makes her extremely stubborn and rude. She will not stop until she gets what she wants, and she won\'t hesitate to lecture or even downright insult a character if they set her off. The victim of her stubbornness in many of these cases is Oodanna. I can understand why there would be tension between the two during the first half of the anime, but because of Aoi\'s disinterest, the tension continues to be present up until the very end of the last episode. For an anime tagged as a ROMANCE, I expected Aoi to undergo some type of development around the halfway mark where she realizes that Oodanna isn\'t as evil and threatening as she thought he was, and instead notices that he\'s actually very sweet and gentle. But this didn\'t happen, so the absence of development with Aoi\'s character proved very irritating to watch.Oodanna, on the other hand, went through development that was so rapid, I almost thought I had missed a couple episodes. In episode one, he is depicted as intimidating and cruel, and he does not hesitate to tell Aoi that if she decides to go through with her plan to work instead of marry him, he will treat her as nothing but an employee. This means she also won\'t receive protection from him should she find herself in a dangerous situation. Like I said earlier, I loved this! It set the story up nicely for Aoi to be on her own and do what she needed to do. However, flash forward to only a mere TWO episodes later and Oodanna is taking her out shopping, buying gifts for her, and giving her nicknames like, ""my lovely wife""; behavior that continues throughout the rest of the anime. Not only that, but he also invites Aoi to his room for dinner, says he wants to cuddle and fall asleep with her, rescues her when she\'s in trouble, and takes special requests in buying materials for Moonflower for her, all of which is the complete OPPOSITE of treating her as just an employee. Of course, by giving her attention more than he said he would, it only means that he truly was starting to fall for her and wanted her to feel the same way, but the fact that he went from threatening to eat her if she doesn\'t want to be his wife in one episode to happily heeding her every request in the next makes absolutely no sense. There\'s no logic or realism in this development. He hardly knew Aoi before bringing her into the Hidden Realm, so why is he so quick to fall in love? I would have ADORED seeing his development if it was at a more natural pace, but it was delivered so quickly and poorly that I seldom had time to even understand that this transition was happening by the time it already happened.Lastly, for being the final main character of the trio, Ginji hardly contributes much to the anime other than being Aoi\'s moral support. There isn\'t really much explored with his character beyond him being the person she talks to most when Oodanna isn\'t around, and him being a friend who helps her run her restaurant. He only seems to be on screen when Aoi is too, but not vice versa, with only a few exceptions. I feel like so much more could have been done with his character instead of just him being there for ""friendship"" purposes, because his character felt more like a heavy supporting role rather than a main role. He also doesn\'t get much development either due to his limited performance, which again, was aggravating.Art | 1/10With the animation technology and talent that\'s out there nowadays, my expectations for the art showcased in an anime released during modern day are much higher than anime from the 90s/early 2000s. I won\'t necessarily say art styles and animation that aren\'t executed at an exceptional level are a real bother to me so long as the story itself is good, but when you pair an unsatisfactory story with lousy art, that\'s when I really start to judge. In Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi\'s case as an anime released in 2018, oh my god, the art was horrendous.Let\'s start with the style. It\'s boring. Though I like how the outfit choices and architecture of the Hidden Realm are geared toward the more traditional side of Japanese culture, the character designs themselves are super bland and generic. What I mean by this is that there\'s not really anything about these designs that pops out and sets the style apart from other anime. On top of that, the color saturation for the characters in Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is extremely inconsistent. In some episodes, the color of the characters matches well with the vibrant scenery surrounding them, and in others the characters are so pastel that they look like ghosts. I could also easily tell when the pen was handed off to a different artist, because the characters looked different in nearly every episode. Sometimes, their facial appearances would even change in the middle of an episode, which doesn\'t look good at all.The movement of the characters is where the art fails the most. While talking, besides the obvious opening and closing of the mouth and occasional tilt of the head, there is hardly any animation for the characters beyond a still image. They don\'t move their arms around, mess with their hair or clothing, and sometimes they don\'t even blink! By heavily restricting the movement of these characters, they are also stripped of any kind of body language and emotion that isn\'t already shown through words, resulting in a cast of living beings that look like soulless dolls. Then, when the characters ARE moving around, the animation is agonizingly choppy and lacks any type of smoothness that even an anime as old as Cowboy Bebop was able to create. Should I even mention the horrendous CGI animation used for the background townsfolk? The animation as a whole was an atrocious mess that just screamed laziness and low budget.Sound | 5/10The music given to us through Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is the only redeeming quality this anime has. Even so, there is still a mix of substandard within the favorable. Starting with the former is the instrumental soundtrack that played while the episodes were running. The energy given off by what\'s happening in any TV production really depends on the instrumental soundtrack. This is where Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi failed. This soundtrack was so weak that I didn\'t even notice there was music at all while I was watching. Dramatic scenes or even comedic scenes in the anime felt so dry and boring to me because the right type of music wasn\'t there to match my energy with that of the anime. On the bright side, I really enjoyed the many opening and ending themes. They did a great job capturing traditional Japanese music while also keeping up with modern music. My favorite song in particular was the ending theme ""Toki no Suna,"" and it ended up being one that I would listen to quite often when I wasn\'t torturing myself with shitty anime.Enjoyment | 1/10I wouldn\'t necessarily say that I enjoyed this anime at all. In fact, I dreaded pushing through to the end so much so that it took me nearly a year to complete all 26 episodes. Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi had SO MUCH wasted potential. The story could have been great, it could have done so many things differently, and I could have had so much fun watching this show. Instead, what could have been, and what it was literally set up to be, was thrown off a bridge into deep waters never to be seen again. From the forgotten original plot and repetitive storyline to the unnecessarily large number of useless characters that crowded over any chance of character development, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is one of those anime that I regret watching and hope to never return to. is unexpectedly swiped into the ""Hidden Realm"" - a realm where ayakashi live - by an ogre god named Oodanna. When she arrives, she is told that she will become Oodanna\'s bride as collateral from a debt her grandfather owed but was never able to pay off before his untimely death.

Literally, her FIRST idea to help with every problem is to head toward the kitchen. I get it, food brings people together, but this is taking it a bit to the extreme. I know if I was fighting with my friend or sibling over something like the characters in the anime were, food would NOT help with the process of making up with each other. The solution as a whole is just lazy and unrealistic.Now, where\'s Oodanna during all this? As one of the three main characters in the anime, we surprisingly don\'t see much of him once the anime turns into a cooking show. The only episodes where he receives the most screen time are the ones where Aoi ends up kidnapped by an ayakashi for absolutely no reason at all, meaning it\'s up to Oodanna to save her. These episodes attempt to disguise themselves as ploys to develop the romance side of things, but to me it felt more like an unnatural and cliché way to force the two love interests alone together. Not to mention, with the addition of Aoi\'s continuous stubbornness and disinterest toward the dude, there isn\'t much advancement in romance at all. Hell, the two don\'t even end up together by the end of the anime, so that was a disappointment. Sorry for the spoiler.I should mention that there\'s also a small subplot that runs throughout the anime where Aoi is trying to find this masked ayakashi in the Hidden Realm who saved her from starvation and loneliness when she was a child. This was definitely something that piqued my interest in the midst of the main plot falling apart, because it could\'ve definitely worked well as a motive regarding why Aoi doesn\'t entirely look eager to rush back home anymore. However, the subplot is only mentioned from time to time, and after it\'s randomly brought up that Aoi starts to think she\'s getting closer to the ayakashi she\'s looking for, the subplot drops off the face of the earth for another few episodes. For example, in the transition between the two arcs of the anime, Aoi begins to suspect that a certain character is that ayakashi. Yet, even after throwing a whole-ass tantrum making it a big deal that she ""HAS to know if it\'s true"", she never even bothers to mention it to them the next time she talks to them. She even seems to completely forget that this character could be who she\'s looking for until the LAST EPISODE of the anime. It doesn\'t make sense. If finding that ayakashi was something that was so important to her, why would she wait to see if what she suspected was true? Yeah, problems arose and things got in the way as soon as she thought that ayakashi from her childhood could be this character, but it really doesn\'t take that much effort to ask someone, ""Hey, by any chance was that you?"" Like come on. Stop dragging the subplot out and reveal who it is already. There is absolutely no need for suspense.Character | 2/10As I stated before, new characters are added to the story from left and right. Consequently, valuable screen time is used to explain the history of these minor characters rather than expanding on characters that already exist. In other words, the anime both massively lacks character development for some, and forces others to change way too quickly. I was so frustrated with this, because the actions of Aoi and Oodanna portrayed in the first episode were PERFECTLY set up for strong character development, yet this wasn\'t taken advantage of at all!First, we have Aoi, the main character whose point of view we follow. She is introduced as a kind-hearted, strong-willed, independent woman. As a female watcher, these are all wonderful traits to see given to a female main character! I love it when these girls are given the abilities to solve problems on their own and act without male influence. Unfortunately, the way Aoi uses these traits ends up turning the initial attractiveness of her personality into one that is extremely unlikable. Let me elaborate. Aoi\'s ""kindness"" makes her a serial meddler. She will one hundred percent put herself in the middle of any disagreement between other ayakashi she comes across to solve the problem for them. On most occasions, Aoi isn\'t even doing this because she wants to see everyone happy. She has ulterior motives, ones where solving this problem means that she\'ll get something in return, like an object or simply the characters\' approval. If anything, that seems less benevolent and more manipulative to me. Moreover, Aoi\'s independent mindset makes her extremely stubborn and rude. She will not stop until she gets what she wants, and she won\'t hesitate to lecture or even downright insult a character if they set her off. The victim of her stubbornness in many of these cases is Oodanna. I can understand why there would be tension between the two during the first half of the anime, but because of Aoi\'s disinterest, the tension continues to be present up until the very end of the last episode. For an anime tagged as a ROMANCE, I expected Aoi to undergo some type of development around the halfway mark where she realizes that Oodanna isn\'t as evil and threatening as she thought he was, and instead notices that he\'s actually very sweet and gentle. But this didn\'t happen, so the absence of development with Aoi\'s character proved very irritating to watch.Oodanna, on the other hand, went through development that was so rapid, I almost thought I had missed a couple episodes. In episode one, he is depicted as intimidating and cruel, and he does not hesitate to tell Aoi that if she decides to go through with her plan to work instead of marry him, he will treat her as nothing but an employee. This means she also won\'t receive protection from him should she find herself in a dangerous situation. Like I said earlier, I loved this! It set the story up nicely for Aoi to be on her own and do what she needed to do. However, flash forward to only a mere TWO episodes later and Oodanna is taking her out shopping, buying gifts for her, and giving her nicknames like, ""my lovely wife""; behavior that continues throughout the rest of the anime. Not only that, but he also invites Aoi to his room for dinner, says he wants to cuddle and fall asleep with her, rescues her when she\'s in trouble, and takes special requests in buying materials for Moonflower for her, all of which is the complete OPPOSITE of treating her as just an employee. Of course, by giving her attention more than he said he would, it only means that he truly was starting to fall for her and wanted her to feel the same way, but the fact that he went from threatening to eat her if she doesn\'t want to be his wife in one episode to happily heeding her every request in the next makes absolutely no sense. There\'s no logic or realism in this development. He hardly knew Aoi before bringing her into the Hidden Realm, so why is he so quick to fall in love? I would have ADORED seeing his development if it was at a more natural pace, but it was delivered so quickly and poorly that I seldom had time to even understand that this transition was happening by the time it already happened.Lastly, for being the final main character of the trio, Ginji hardly contributes much to the anime other than being Aoi\'s moral support. There isn\'t really much explored with his character beyond him being the person she talks to most when Oodanna isn\'t around, and him being a friend who helps her run her restaurant. He only seems to be on screen when Aoi is too, but not vice versa, with only a few exceptions. I feel like so much more could have been done with his character instead of just him being there for ""friendship"" purposes, because his character felt more like a heavy supporting role rather than a main role. He also doesn\'t get much development either due to his limited performance, which again, was aggravating.Art | 1/10With the animation technology and talent that\'s out there nowadays, my expectations for the art showcased in an anime released during modern day are much higher than anime from the 90s/early 2000s. I won\'t necessarily say art styles and animation that aren\'t executed at an exceptional level are a real bother to me so long as the story itself is good, but when you pair an unsatisfactory story with lousy art, that\'s when I really start to judge. In Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi\'s case as an anime released in 2018, oh my god, the art was horrendous.Let\'s start with the style. It\'s boring. Though I like how the outfit choices and architecture of the Hidden Realm are geared toward the more traditional side of Japanese culture, the character designs themselves are super bland and generic. What I mean by this is that there\'s not really anything about these designs that pops out and sets the style apart from other anime. On top of that, the color saturation for the characters in Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is extremely inconsistent. In some episodes, the color of the characters matches well with the vibrant scenery surrounding them, and in others the characters are so pastel that they look like ghosts. I could also easily tell when the pen was handed off to a different artist, because the characters looked different in nearly every episode. Sometimes, their facial appearances would even change in the middle of an episode, which doesn\'t look good at all.The movement of the characters is where the art fails the most. While talking, besides the obvious opening and closing of the mouth and occasional tilt of the head, there is hardly any animation for the characters beyond a still image. They don\'t move their arms around, mess with their hair or clothing, and sometimes they don\'t even blink! By heavily restricting the movement of these characters, they are also stripped of any kind of body language and emotion that isn\'t already shown through words, resulting in a cast of living beings that look like soulless dolls. Then, when the characters ARE moving around, the animation is agonizingly choppy and lacks any type of smoothness that even an anime as old as Cowboy Bebop was able to create. Should I even mention the horrendous CGI animation used for the background townsfolk? The animation as a whole was an atrocious mess that just screamed laziness and low budget.Sound | 5/10The music given to us through Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is the only redeeming quality this anime has. Even so, there is still a mix of substandard within the favorable. Starting with the former is the instrumental soundtrack that played while the episodes were running. The energy given off by what\'s happening in any TV production really depends on the instrumental soundtrack. This is where Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi failed. This soundtrack was so weak that I didn\'t even notice there was music at all while I was watching. Dramatic scenes or even comedic scenes in the anime felt so dry and boring to me because the right type of music wasn\'t there to match my energy with that of the anime. On the bright side, I really enjoyed the many opening and ending themes. They did a great job capturing traditional Japanese music while also keeping up with modern music. My favorite song in particular was the ending theme ""Toki no Suna,"" and it ended up being one that I would listen to quite often when I wasn\'t torturing myself with shitty anime.Enjoyment | 1/10I wouldn\'t necessarily say that I enjoyed this anime at all. In fact, I dreaded pushing through to the end so much so that it took me nearly a year to complete all 26 episodes. Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi had SO MUCH wasted potential. The story could have been great, it could have done so many things differently, and I could have had so much fun watching this show. Instead, what could have been, and what it was literally set up to be, was thrown off a bridge into deep waters never to be seen again. From the forgotten original plot and repetitive storyline to the unnecessarily large number of useless characters that crowded over any chance of character development, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi is one of those anime that I regret watching and hope to never return to.', ""I personally don't mind the recycled youkai-ayakashi realm premise, and rather like these types of stories, so the bad rating is not a complaint of a recycled premise.

I haven\'t seen everything. However, I have seen and read a LOT of stuff related to mythology from many different cultures, historical literature and historical fiction, and lots of stuff containing folklore, fantasy, or superstition. If you like that kind of stuff, this will be a gem for you!I like this anime a lot. I usually am a pretty hard critique when it comes to films, since I study film in school. However, when I\'m watching something I really aim to watch and to enjoy...it instead of study it like I normally am doing (I watch for fun especially with anime, since it\'s easier for me to let go of my film studies knowledge and stop nitpicking).This anime has does have some issues with pacing in the story, which a lot of reviews have mentioned. It starts, and you\'re generally wondering where tf it\'s going to go from here with so many things possible. Just know, it gets better. The plot is less meandering than it seems.I understand the beef that other reviewers had with lingering shots, flashbacks, and looped material but I really do chalk that up to budget constraints. Despite those things, there are many shots/sequences that are beautifully done! The distribution of the budget isn\'t equal for every second of the show which I\'m understanding of, since nothing ever looks really... bad, at all. The setting is always gorgeous, and if you like traditional Japanese inns or even just seeing the traditional created landscape of Japan, you\'ll appreciate it enough to make it worth it. I know I enjoyed the atmosphere, especially the baths and hot springs for me.This show does have multiple focuses on different aspects of the story- I know someone mentioned that they didn\'t think that the creators knew what kind of anime it would be, so said ""eh let\'s choose no kind""; which I actually liked. It seems like they focus equally on all the best parts of it. The show has variety. For a casual viewer looking to unwind after class or work, I LOVE having the different aspects of my favorites in one show. There\'s food shots (who doesn\'t want to see some tasty food?!), character and world building (without that, a fantasy genre show really doesn\'t seem fleshed out or immersive), and the extensive references to Japanese mythology. The mythology-drive plot is very enjoyable, and I like the relationship building between characters. Humanizing the Yokai is interesting to watch and can be a heartwarming moment. As for the romance, it\'s enjoyable and doesn\'t feel forced. I think the most complaints of ""cliche"" comes from the inclusion of a romance in the spirited-away genre, which I feel is pretty typical across the board.

Everything that makes me drool about an anime, and they managed to get every bit wrong.This will be more of a rant that a review so here we go:Let's start with the setting of the spirit world. The world could've easily had a rich lore and history & I can think of a billion legends/myths of...which to base this off of. It could've had a rich tapestry of places and wacky spirits/creatures filling the place with colour and mystique (think Spirited Away). NOPE - The inn felt empty and cold. We didn't see a single guest stay at the inn (apart from one or two sides characters who appeared, finished their arc, then left). We didn't get introduced to any location in the spirit world other than the stupid fake-inn that noone seemed to stay at. The plain and sparse art only added to this 'empty' feeling, where the studio either: didn't have the budget to draw any furniture in the rooms, or were just cutting corners.NEXT - The romance : It was so emotionless and vanilla. They spent so much time setting up the male lead to be this scary, dark, tsundere demon but he was SO VANILLA, servile and there was no explanation for why he liked the female lead.THE CHARACTERS had no dimension to them at all. They were flat and boring because there was no area of interest, flaw or conflict in their personalities. Side characters had little screentime and low quality arcs relying on story-telling via cheap flashbacks. The dialogue was detached, formal and polite.I can't believe I wasted my time on this but atleast I watched it so now you don't have to. which to base this off of.

Watch a couple of episodes or so, but never base your likeliness of watching an anime because of someone who rated it so slow, remember all reviews are subjective. Same goes for me, but I will tell you what I like about this series.Story - The synopsis says it all but it doesn\'t stop there. This anime is not all about cooking, it\'s more about building trust and relationships with the Ayakashi. Sure, it may sound...like that with the synopsis, but I don\'t judge an anime from it only, I go and watch and see if I will get into it, and I did. I actually get into and was surprised that there are something else involved than just cooking for the Ayakashi and paying off the debt. I try to be spoiler-free here, so if you want to spoil yourself feel free to look for other reviews. I am sorry if this has wasted your time.Art - Since the main setting of this series is in the Hidden Realm and not the Apparent Realm (Humans). The art remains the same as we are used to. It\'s not like your typical anime, it actually tries to blend the atmospheric as the Human Realm (Apparent). Although there are times that the characters looked weird at some point, but most of us know the reason.Sound - I am enthralled by its opening and ending songs, besides there\'s nothing to say to this section because the anime is not action-oriented.Character - The characters aren\'t really realistic but given this is not a slice-of-life genre, I don\'t see any reason why they should try to aim for realistic personality. The characters are here to entertain and satisfy its viewers. Either be happy or be mad. The point is you are driven to somewhat ""act"" whatever the characters do.Aoi is a character that I actually want to be, but not entirely. There are some points that I don\'t like about her but sometimes her judgement is correct. Although there are some scenarios I don\'t understand why she chose to act kind. But then again, she doesn\'t exactly hate those person.Just like the kid from a youtube video where he was asked what his last message was to end the video, he said ""If people hate you, don\'t hate them"". You have no exact reason why to hate those people, we just let this grew into our hearts. This is what Aoi is trying to show when she has endure those hatred from Ayakashi or the avoidance.I won\'t talk the others because I don\'t think they will fit my ""review to convince you"" and also Aoi always appears on every episode.Enjoyment - Supposedly you already know how I feel about this anime, given the score of 8 and how I enjoyed the story. When I waited for episodes to come out, I decidedly to watch them all until I realize that I was at the end of the episode. I felt sad and frustrated because I wanted to know more only to find out they don\'t show previews, only give hints what it will be for the next episode, at the end of the episode they will show an episode end card where it has the hint what the next episode it will be. Gives you something to think about.Overall - This anime has one of those cases where the suspense drama starts acting up during halfway of its run, this is somewhat sad given how many people are prejudicing anime nowadays. Or comparing, but need to remind you that the anime is unique on its own, never compare an anime to another anime, this is like comparing DC and Marvel. like that with the synopsis, but I don\'t judge an anime from it only, I go and watch and see if I will get into it, and I did.

heart is through their stomach, a mantra followed by those who utilize their cooking to get woo or have good relations with another.\xa0 It\'s here where we have a series built around that idea and virtually nothing else.Story:Our story of a bed and breakfast for spirits begins with the man Tsubaki Shiro, a man who would often traverse into the hidden realm, the world of ayakashi and spirits, in order to gamble and party.\xa0 As a result of his reckless habits, he accrued a massive debt that eventually led him to give away his only granddaughter, Aoi,...as collateral by giving away her hand in marriage without her consent to the Ogre god known in the show only as the \'Master\'.\xa0 Now taken to the hidden realm to be wed, Aoi uses the cooking talents she was taught to by her grandfather in order to open up an eatery in order to pay off what she owes.Ignoring specifics, the story of Kakuriyo is the watching of Tsubaki Aoi make food for whatever Ayakashi is making trouble for her at that moment in time, pacifying them with her spiritually enhanced cooking so that she either gets what she wants out of them, or pleases them well enough to leave her alone.\xa0 While the series provides enough variance in its individual stories to give us mini devoted arcs for the various workers of the Tenjin-ya inn, the way to get to that is always the same: Aoi\'s cooking.\xa0 It\'s because of this that I find the show to be almost hilariously predictable, being so formulaic and expected that I really wish they could do something else in order mix things up a bit.\xa0 Hell they even went to the extent of dragging her over to a different place just to do the whole song and dance again with conquering the staff of a different inn using her cooking prowess.That being said, the show does do a good job at doing worldbuilding, expanding upon the lore and build of the hidden realm that gives more credence to various characters\' motives and actions.\xa0 This becomes even more apparent due to the wide variety of side cast members, giving us examples of a large plethora of different Ayakashi from all walks of life and powers in order to populate and color the world of Kakuriyo a bit more.\xa0 Annoyingly though is the fact that Aoi doesn\'t get an amazing amount of attention herself, a detail that\'s so sparsely sprinkled throughout the series that the backstory might as well have been ""Random girl gets kidnapped"" without the whole grandfather bit, and the story would\'ve ended up the same.While I give credit for the show at giving us an interesting venture of spirits and take on Japanese lore, much of what Kakuriyo ends up being is \'cooking, cooking, cooking, this is the solution to everything\'.\xa0 Yes it\'s what the show\'s about, but doing so stales the experience due to the lack of variety and makes the supposed scary ayakashi who have threatened to kill/eat Aoi on more than several occasions, seem like giant pushovers rather than residents of a supernatural realm.\xa0 Furthermore, the series just...ends without really any further details on what might happen next.\xa0 No \'read the manga teaser\', no real closure, just kinda ends.\xa0 Which while expected for a show that barely dramatizes any tragedy, is still weirdly disappointing in its own right.Overview:+ Good worldbuilding-\xa0 Plot\'s pretty bland and very predictable-\xa0 Not really a satisfying conclusionCharacters:Born with the same latent ability to connect with the spirits as her grandfather, much of what Aoi was taught at a young age was to cook for Ayakashi to pacify them, a skill she executes at least once per episode.\xa0 This is why Aoi has no personality.\xa0 As much as I love Touyama Nao as a voice actor, I can\'t really say many positives about the role because there aren\'t any to speak of.\xa0 If anything, I\'d go as far as to say that Tsubaki Aoi, as much as the Ayakashi praise her to be, is nothing more than a plot device for almost everyone else who by their own merits, has more of a story than Aoi does.\xa0 Her first instinct is always to cook, and when you make a character who only does one thing, you\'re gonna end up with a flat character.\xa0 What makes it worse comes from how vague the series wants to be with Aoi\'s importance.\xa0 They hint so much at the supposed Ayakashi that saved her life, as well as her importance to the hidden realm without any execution, that it might as well be a joke because there\'s so much teasing.\xa0 Combined with her offset ratio of character importance to character change, and you end up with a bland Mary Sue-esque character whose overall impact is present, but not meaningful.On the flipside, the show\'s cast of Ayakashi spans an interesting range from recurring characters like the Master without devoted mini arcs who have the same kind of importance Aoi has, those WITH mini arcs who suffer from being a one and done deal, leaving their footprint on in the worldbuilding, those that\'re only there for the purpose of worldbuilding and diversifying the cast, and Chibi, the kappa who\'s there to occasionally be helpful and act as the series\'s sidekick.\xa0 Wonderful.Overview:+ Side cast aids in worldbuilding-\xa0 Aoi is an extremely lacking protagonistArt:Produced by Gonzo, the art is about the best positive that I could give to this series.\xa0 Though average by today\'s standards, the art of Kakuriyo is very picturesque, bearing many lighter colors and leaning towards the white side in order to give an eerie beauty to the hidden realm.\xa0 It\'s a pleasing style with very few art errors, and that\'s a nice thing to see.Unfortunately however, the show very much lacks in the \'animation\' department, the characters at most walking around or standing in place for the majority of the series.\xa0 There\'re a few actions scenes here and there, as well as those with a much different setting aesthetic, but they\'re so uncommon and not much different from the regular style that I wouldn\'t really bat an eye at them.\xa0 I blame this mostly on the show\'s exceedingly lax nature that takes away any and all tension that could\'ve occurred.Sound:Sound is a bit of an interesting beast, as both ""Tomoshibi no Manimani"" by Touyama Nao herself, and ""Utsushiyo no Yume"" by nano are both VERY japanese songs, being both modern songs played with a traditional twist to them.\xa0 Personally I find Touyama Nao\'s song to be the better of the two, but both are memorable in their own right simply due to how they song.\xa0 Endings by comparison don\'t feel as memorable to me, and typically I find more than two endings for a single series to rarely be worth putting under a looking glass.Personal Enjoyment:Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi looked like a supernatural shoujo romance to me.\xa0 The cover art of a young, attractive girl being surrounded by some hot ayakashi men with any other woman in the series strewn off to the side made me suspicious when I first read about it.\xa0 But as I learned, that\'s not the case, but I\'m still disappointed regardless.The fact that the show only had one way of progressing its storyline was a big red flag of concern.\xa0 Typically, if a show has one thing it\'s really good at, it would find multiple ways to do that in order to vary up the content, or maybe throw in a twist to make the show more engaging.\xa0 Never once did I find the show to be engaging, and I\'m disappointed in that regard.\xa0 The fact that Aoi was capable of literally cooking up a storm to solve everyone\'s problems hurt the show so much that practically nothing surprised me when we got to the second half.\xa0 Hell I even made a joke prediction for the cliffhanger ending of the second to last episode that came true during the finale.\xa0 THAT is how easy this series is to read.Of course if you\'re not looking for something with a gripping storyline and instead something more character-based, this might be what you\'re looking for.\xa0 Again, I still think the worldbuilding is good, and the show is certainly pretty to look at, but I find the show\'s tastelessness in how it\'s presented to be the biggest fault and ultimately the reason why it was brought down.\xa0 Aoi not having a personality is a result of this, and lemme tell you, putting a supposedly empowered young woman to clear away a massive debt on her own merits into a kitchen does NOT send a good message.\xa0 Just saying. as collateral by giving away her hand in marriage without her consent to the Ogre god known in the show only as the

What a wonderful and an amazing trip this show has taken me into! From the start of the anime I realized that it was my type slow paced,sweet,gentle,warm and romantic of course.I have always enjoyed animes about Ayakashi and spirit souls which showcase traditional Japanese tails and legends. The animation is amazing too so is the music and the songs. I also liked how the events became more intense when Aoi went to OriaYa like it just made the show even better.I really loved the story and I hope to see another season of this wonderful show where we can see how Aoi and...her Oodana become closer.In conclusion, this anime is criminally underrated like come on MAL users! Its rating should be at least 8 like what the heck?! Okay anyway You gotta give it a watch and you will surely like it. her Oodana become closer.In conclusion, this anime is criminally underrated like come on MAL users!

This immediately drew me in. I loved Aoi's attitude and how she was so headstrong. The anime started out really strong, with the art being beautiful, the plot flowing well, the characters being relatable, everything was wonderful.However after around episode 13, it began to go downhill. I had noticed before that the quality of the art wasn't as nice but the plot itself and the characters were also not portrayed as well. The anime does...have some romance but the focus is on self development. However we really don't see much in terms of Aoi developing. She becomes a Mary Sue character, solving everyone's problems, never holding grudges, and becoming saintly, a shift from her character in the beginning who was kind but not perfect.I felt that the plot could have been further developed, there were so many great opportunities to make the characters shine that weren't used sadly.The ending was also unsatisfying. There is big build-up of a romance that is hinted at being resolved that doesn't ever get to be dealt with. There are some questions left unanswered and I think that that may be done on purpose so viewers will have some incentive to watch the second (if there is one) season.This anime is wonderful for a feel good anime but be ready for repetitive plot devices and not much conflict.

This seems to be the way things are going, so I don’t want to be too critical of shows for this reason, but time and time again I found myself uncomfortable with how this looked. Faces are void of the emotion their voice actors attempt to put on....There are sometimes long and awkward pauses on unimportant images. Heck, the flashbacks people complain so much about probably aren't a shortcoming of the story, but of the animation budget, scrambling to fill up as much of the 20-minute block as they can. It’s a shame, too; the story isn’t absolutely terrible, but when it’s this hard to look at, it’s not worth continuing.The story isn’t bad, but it’s certainly not great. The main issue with it is that there are so many mini-plots going on at a time, and I can't bring myself to care about any of them. I’ve waited six episodes for one solid anchor to pop up, but instead I get a ton of different trains of thought (mild spoilers):- Aoi almost starved to death once, and her grandfather taught her how to cook, so she appreciates food. When she gets whisked away to the spirit realm, maybe she can work off this surprise debt by running the restaurant, and I oop-- But no one wants her to cook? They say “women don’t belong in the kitchen,” but they never explain that one to me, at least from a western perspective.- Oh, and she’s that smelly grandpa’s daughter.

It’s a shame because the world seems lush with creative ideas milling about in the background, but I can't get through its main presentation. There are sometimes long and awkward pauses on unimportant images. Heck, the flashbacks people complain so much about probably aren't a shortcoming of the story, but of the animation budget, scrambling to fill up as much of the 20-minute block as they can. It’s a shame, too; the story isn’t absolutely terrible, but when it’s this hard to look at, it’s not worth continuing.The story isn’t bad, but it’s certainly not great. The main issue with it is that there are so many mini-plots going on at a time, and I can't bring myself to care about any of them. I’ve waited six episodes for one solid anchor to pop up, but instead I get a ton of different trains of thought (mild spoilers):- Aoi almost starved to death once, and her grandfather taught her how to cook, so she appreciates food. When she gets whisked away to the spirit realm, maybe she can work off this surprise debt by running the restaurant, and I oop-- But no one wants her to cook? They say “women don’t belong in the kitchen,” but they never explain that one to me, at least from a western perspective.- Oh, and she’s that smelly grandpa’s daughter.

I\'ve seen almost every romance/shoujo out here, and more than most of them; forgettable to say the least. This is not an anime I will forget.If you like Japanese mythology, this will blow you away.If you need a new waifu/ husbando, Kakuriyo will deliver.Besides the beautiful animation, the pretty good English dubbing, and the attention the creators paid to really bringing these ancient mythological creatures to life, the story is what really drives this home for me.Our main character is a strong girl who...I could admire, she\'s not the typical ""shallow background MC"" that shoujo\'s often use. She handles her past gracefully, doesn\'t swoon over the men around her, and protects herself and her friends.The romance aspect is subtle. It\'s smooth and I almost felt as if my feelings were growing Aoi\'s own, the pace of the plot feels great.At first I disliked her love interest, then as she started warming up to him, I did as well.Every episode makes me smile and I hate to say it but, this anime makes me feel a bit magical.The only con is waiting for new episodes, as the show is currently airing, I find myself re-watching this over and over, I can\'t get enough of it!AND the first opening song is a bop.

I watched this anime last night and I've already forgotten what happened.

It\'s more like a fair likable thing, but it\'s not going to suck me in like few others. Even though there is some potential in it.Story: I really liked the story despite being predictable and not the most original. However, it was entertaining and fairly written. This is a light, enjoyable watch, but if you after excitement or real emotions then this is not for you. The romance part of the story very low and not very deep. The series is not episodic, but because it\'s repetitive sometimes feels like it is....Anyway, I gave a 7/10 because I liked it and I love animes that includes spirits. That\'s just my personal preference, otherwise, I would give a strong 6.Art: I was very unhappy with the art. More precisely with the animation. The characters, the buildings, and really everything looks just fine, but it\'s very poorly animated. Lots of times when the Ogre and the fox guy move they look like they have some kind of physical disability. It happens a lot when they are talking, but their mouths are not moving or the opposite. Not good, not good at all. (Yeah I\'m shaking my head when I say this) It gets a 5/10 as it was still much better than some other stuff that I had the misfortune to watch and because the second session was done a bit better.Sound: Well, I\'m not happy with this either. I nearly never had any problem with Japanese voice actors, but this time I was not satisfied. Especially the ogre god guy\'s voice was really not right.The music wasn\'t good or bad, it was like background noise, not annoying but if you not pay attention you not even notice it. Except for one time in the first session. Oh, I noticed that...It was like someone suddenly changed their mind about the genre of this anime. For a few vast moments, I asked myself ""Is this an epic story about a hero from some kind of crappy fantasy?"" No, it wasn\'t, thank god, but honestly, I have no idea what that music had anything to do with this anime. Sorry, I can\'t remember which episode was it.  So sound gets a 4/10Character: Okay...I liked most of them and my expectations were not too high anyway so I\'m not going to analyze them. They are okay for an also okay anime. The whole cooking and eating are not really that interesting, but I can deal with it. However, I would get rid of that shameless, idiotic, and annoying little bold turtle. It\'s NOT cute to have characters like this. munch munch much...It\'s cringe!So the characters are getting a 6/10.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it. It was okay. It was good as a 7/10 can be.Overall: I wasn\'t looking for something unique or meaningful so it was a perfect choice. If you wanna go into sofa/laptop/fluffy blanket mode and chill, Congratulation!

Some basic isekai, an anime with a female protagonist like any other anime with a female protagonist. Well... You got it all wrong (at least to me you do).Why should you give this anime a chance ? Here are few reasons without spoiler :1) Great values and simplicity : This anime is very simple and straightforward. One of its best qualities to me is that every values portrayed are so complicated irl and yet so easily depicted in the anime. It's not always about the good, not everybody is kind and...stuff. There's a lot of comparisons between the good and the bad, which feels more real, more enjoyable. To go back on the simplicity of this anime, the art is simple as well. It's familiar, and comforting, it somehow feels like home..? I can't put it better than that so just watch it !!!2) Characters : Every character has a point and each of them have a story or a role in the plot. I like anime with values, that moves you y'know? The characters of this anime do it so elegantly, all of them have a reason to exist in the plot and of course they're great. . We relate a lot to them and they are very endearing. So yeah :D (s/o chibi)3) The protagonists : Now the female protagonist is not like any other. She is simple yes, but at least she has a story that feels true (finally!!!). She also has a strong personality and strong beliefs as well. Throughout the whole anime I could not tell much her next moves so this was great. The others are good too again I think you read 2) lol.I may have appreciated this anime that much because I do share some of the female character's experience but you should definitely watch it. It's just that comforting and wholesome. It feels like a needed tight hug, every episode. And it's not even that long come on! Anyways hope you'll enjoy as much as I did ! stuff.

Like all anime that get transferred onto youtube, the sound quality sucked. but even so, I remembered really liking the music. also, I did watch it again after a year or so, so this review isn't from the perspective of a ?? I don't really know, from someone unfamiliar with the subject matter.-STORY-the story was nice, to me it was quite consistent, the goals were clear, though I didn't quite get the whole thing with the two inns and their founder + Aoi's grandfather, one of the main reasons for that was probably because I didn't know Odanna's name was Odanna until the second time I watched it bc the sub kept saying it meant 'master' so every time the name Odanna was mentioned, I just thought it was the collective noun for the masters of inns across Kakuriyo, and it didn't help that Odanna was addressed as Odanna-sama (ｰ ｰ;) I'm going a bit off-topic but, the story was great overall, I thought the story would just stop before Aoi was kidnapped by Orio, but unlike some other stories when the plot stops progressing, this doesn't feel like an unnatural push to get the plot going again which was nice.-ART-not much I can add, same as the flash review.it was ok, well pretty good in fact, but the characters make the art seem unworthy (?) of them. ( I'm sorry, I worded that wrong.)-SOUND-this was one of my favourites, I liked every bit of music in this anime, it was all so nice and charming and mystical, I just really loved it, as for things like VA and sound effects, I don't remember much but I didn't like the VA very much.-CHARACTER-they were all so good looking (☆_☆) I loved them, and all their different personalities too, I also found it quite fun that Orio and Tenjin had corresponding characters for each personality type that was introduced. That said, I didn't really understand how all the ayakashi came to trust Aoi so easily, it was like those 'an episode each for every character' Otome adaptations >_< i know her food restored ayakashi powers but still, even those at Orio who were so hostile before.I enjoyed it, even in the second time I watched it.

This is way different than what I expected it to be.For one, I don\'t know if im alone in feeling this, but I don\'t see how the title fits the story haha. It was a purely CHILL and LAIDBACK anime in simple terms. It was at times unrealistic due to the ""laidback-ness"" of it, such as how easily Aoi adapts to wherever her kidnappers take her! Also the fact that she was 100% okay with leaving behind her world. I know she didn\'t have family and...she was used to ayakashi, but it\'s still unrealistic.I found it very pleasant to watch and see her build relationships with ALL of the characters, although I would have liked to see a bit more romance between her and the Master:(The ""second season"" was really good and I really liked the whole ceremony idea, especially discovering that bit about the umi-bouzu!

It\'s just fine for me.yeah, only fine but not the best.Story 5/10 - Storyline is very very simple.It not about cooking only. It focused on Aoi make trust and good relationship to Ayakashi. But...it should be more episode, It has so much uncleared plot and so much plot hole such asHow OodannaSama met with Aoi when she still child ?Why he sent Ginji to gave food to her instead himself?And why he don\'t tell anything about that to Aoi?How he met her grandpa?Will Aoi fail in her restaurant mission?She marry with Oodanna-Sama in the end or not?how Oodanna-Sama fall in love with Aoi?He protect her EVERYTHING her do in every EP but they didn\'t told anything about that. It seem he suddenly just fall-in-love and protect her. It just not make sense. I really want to know more detail of Oodanna-Sama and Aoi relationship.Well, maybe they want us buy a novel if you want to know that.But Overall is good feeling anime and happy end.Art 7/10 - Well, As a japanese folklore theme anime lover I\'m ok with the Art. But maybe some episode is bad... (yeah, it happen on every TV-Series and I hope they will fix it in Blu-Ray)Character 8/10 - Mostly you can imagine the design of his/her only know his/her name but Character design overall is great.Many Character so cute (Ex.Twin-Crane / Umibotsu / Kappa)Oodanna-Sama is really handsome.... If you need new Husbando. You will ok with him.Song 9/10 - Most of traditional Japanese music theme. So, if you like traditional Japanese theme you\'ll be love it. Every theme song and character song is very good especially OP2 from NANO and Oodanna-Sama Character Song.Enjoyment 6/10 - Well... is quite boring. So I said in storyline is so simple and plain.Mostly about Aoi cooking for Ayakashi and made his/her to feel good with her. But other this is nothing any especially.Overall 7/10I suggest this anime if want to see good feeling anime to healing you. and make sure you can stand boring storyline EP in the first half.

The first half feels like something I could watch while laid up sick on the couch, while the second half ups the stakes just a little while still being very relaxing to watch. The basic plot is the main character Aoi, a human girl transported to a world of ayakashi, makes food for ayakashi and usually produces some other good as a result. I would say it fits the slice-of-life genre above any other. It has hints of romance, but this...definitely isn't the primary purpose, even if it is full of attractive male characters. (Some other review said it failed as a romantic comedy -- but I don't think it's even trying to be one.) You can feel its light novel origins in the romantic angle, since the romantic development is quite slow. Somehow I'm not bothered at all, though, as I watch this anime to destress, not to get my heart pounding. Anyway, it feels more natural here than in some shows (Aoi has reasons to take it very slow since her partner is an ogre who practically kidnapped her).I will say that the animation is unfortunately subpar. Going from the gorgeous manga to the low budget anime was a shock to the system, but either I got used to it, or it improved somewhat later in the show. The opening songs are fine (I really like the second one), while the ending songs are mostly character songs, ranging from decent to forgettable.The only downside to me is the animation, so if you can get past that, Kakuriyo is a really enjoyable, relaxing slice-of-life anime. If you can't get past it, I do highly recommend the manga. definitely isn't the primary purpose, even if it is full of attractive male characters.

Not bad for a slow and calm series. I’d give that a solid 8/10.The voices of the characters was likeable . I liked odanna’s voice . Others weren’t annoying either.

Plot-wise it's engaging but there isn't a lot of development from the start of the series to the end, mostly relying on the introduction of new characters/scenarios for the protagonist to win over. There isn't a lot of depth to the story, it's at times nonsensical (I found it contradicts itself i.e. ayakashi implied to be dangerous...and superior beings yet they are easily won over and have immature motives) and the characters are very one dimensional/unconvincing and don't go through much of any growth throughout (this is probably the most frustrating thing about the series). I gave it a 7 overall because although it's quite childish plus all the faults aforementioned, I guess I have a weak-spot for its type, it had a feel-good effect and there were plenty of characters to keep it entertaining (Chibi is the MVP). and superior beings yet they are easily won over and have immature motives) and the characters are very one dimensional/unconvincing and don't go through much of any growth throughout (this is probably the most frustrating thing about the series).

Its kind of like comfort food, it doesn't do anything too surprising but still is enough to keep me entertained. My wife and I can watch it together. The only thing I have a problem trying not to look at too closely...is the entire world that has been constructed. The ayakashi seem to be living human lives. They are supposed to be spirit beings but eat normal food off of plates with chopsticks, look mostly human, etc. Bottom line; If you like slice of life type anime (and this is not really that), and you can ignore the similarities to other anime and you are not entirely burnt out on Alice in wonderland, I think you will enjoy this well enough, we have. is the entire world that has been constructed.

I was about to put an 8, but I expected another ending and to my disappointment there were not so many love scenes in the whole anime. Maybe there is a second season, who knows.On the other hand, this story is somewhat moving because of the stories that the different characters carry behind. Although these stories are always repeated without leaving an end, however, this makes you reflect and think about things that might have happened in the past. They lead you to imagine situations that...could have happened.In relation to the characters, there was a character breathtaking with his super cute actions. ALso he was lovely and peaceful. He was always magnificent and reassuring in his manner of speaking. In addition, another character who was intriguing for his past and helped the protagonist in everything, as if they were best friends. I loved this character. Also, there was other character from the Eternal World that I loved because she was super kawaii and cute. She was secondary and always accompanies the protagonist, by the way she is always eating cucumbers. This was fun.Speaking of where the action takes place, the story is located in a fantastic world called Eternal World. This is something that I liked because it was different from other anime, since it was the real world where humans live and then this one. This world had fantastic things and characters that I could not imagine because of their great looks and their wonderful changes. Some of them super kawaiis.It should be noted, already said in the first paragraph, that I expected more love scenes. Literally, I thought this anime was going to be love because I found it in the romance category, but I was a bit disappointed because there was almost nothing!In summary, the story is fine and everything else too, also if you like fantasy anime  you can not miss it.And finally, I hope there is a second season because there are things to solve (like romance please!). could have happened.In relation to the characters, there was a character breathtaking with his super cute actions.

I just love how it is simple enough but still interesting with all its elements to keep you motivated to watch and want to know more and to see what will happen next.I...enjoyed that one of the parts in this story is about Aoi being alone and through the story of her and her journey that the ayakashi are or have been alone at one point or another in their life but when you have friends and people who care about you and are willing to help you you don't feel so lonely and sad anymore. The sense of belonging and the fact that you are not alone and can relate to others like yourself. I really liked oodanna when he would talk about a husband helping and aiding his finance in her time of need and supporting her in her endeavors. not gonna lie, I think more guys should think or have that type of mindset. lolEverything worked out in the end and all's well that ends well. I am glad she figured out that it was oodanna and genji that were watching over her when she was young and believed in her and was confident in her abilities.

It's a wonderful story/anime with interesting plots, and above all, great characters, especially the female lead Aoi.Aoi is strong and independent, showing strength when needed during times of peril, and at the same, she has her flaw and weakness, too, which is only human. The two male leads are great as well, and I find the demon somewhat charming.Overall, I totally recommended this anime if you're looking for a shoujo story with a dash of supernatural, romance, and of course, food. I mean an anime is always interesting and...fun to watch when there's food and cooking involved. I only wish there's a second season, but alas, for now, there's only this one season to feast our eyes on. fun to watch when there's food and cooking involved.

That was done so well! I loved the romantic interests!The story itself was also really well laid out! I was so eager to see what was going to unfold and be revealed...next!

It lacks salt, it lacks spice, it lacks everything because the anime sells itself as a romantic comedy but does not have a serious romance. I don't know if there was an episode for that but it could have been much better than it was, after all it had potential.This anime is good for you to watch to relax, spend time and watch something cute without commitment because when you analyze...the story you can see that it is clearly incomplete.

It may seem simple, but it’s not boring.There’s some thriller and comedy into it too.The last time I felt connected to characters this way was when I watched Katekyo Hitman Reborn.Ginji best boy.The characters speak nonstop, the amount of situations each episode feels like you’ve watched two.

So she has to choose between marrying the ogre ayakashi or working off her debt.

I made an account here just so i can leave a review on how bad this is. I was wondering why it wasn't as popular or hyped up as other fantasy  cafe type anime, and now i know why. The female lead is so horrendously annoying. The storyline and the concept itself isn't half bad but the execution is off. At first it was interesting to see how her eatery isn't overly successful , i thought it would showcase her growth as a business owner as well as introduce human food to the ayakashis'. Even though the ayakashis' don't know it...all or already tasted it, they seem to be already familiarised with most of human food. It feels like this took away the fascination non-humans usually have with human food (as typically showcased in this type of genre).

But goddamn, the awe and admiration that non-humans have with human food is what makes this genre of anime entertaining, and they took that away.

Sakamoto desu ga?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32542/Sakamoto_desu_ga,"[""“Who.. are you?”“Haven’t you heard? I’m Sakamoto.”You’d almost wish it started out like this, there’s that perpetual gnawing going on in the obscured depths of your conscience that bugs you for some normality, some profound simplicity in going about an anime you might never have even heard of. This auxiliary introduction to this mysterious, clean-looking man, unfortunately, doesn’t exist.Why, of course, would there be such a need?One does not introduce Sakamoto.One does not simply require the induction of any mainstream preface to unveil such a magnificent being.It is without question, almost as splendidly visceral as how the gleam in his eyes decimates the wobbly...heart of every female and non-asshole male in his vicinity, for everyone to instantly fathom that this man right here, Sakamoto, superabounds over what it takes to be the chef d'oeuvre of all characters, a resounding existence amongst those who don’t exist, in an even more resounding, deafness-impelling, heaven-shattering pièce de résistance that goes by the splendid title: Sakamoto desu-ga?It’s quite simple, especially for a thoughtful Solomon who would scrutinize and deeply consider the 2nd last, 6th and 6th last letter of every title of every anime before concluding on a score, to assign Sakamoto desu-ga an objective semblance of pure perfection. While the masses do revere icons and symbols of divinity, others of heuristic agnosticism, few can appreciate the enrapturing coalescence of the two. Such is the misappropriation of the essence and cachet withheld by some for Sakamoto desu-ga. Allow me to hereby inscribe the holy scripture of seraphic diagnosis with respect to Sakamoto, and why any of this information should be not be reprised.i) Story - Simple, yet revolutionaryConsign GTO’s Onizuka Eikichi and his biker-educational-reformation to oblivion. It’s a simple explanation in real life, really: Panty and Male equals to, well, Jail. Forget One Punch Man’s Saitama just like how everyone he’s saved belittles his bald existence. You’d be fighting incredulous monsters every second and be damned to well, a bald existence.This story’s premise doesn’t stink with excessive quixotical nihilism, or a spectrally-antithetical cosmic flamboyance, nor is it ostentatious in budget-cramped explosions or drenched in senseless sexual innuendo.Instead, this story presents that of one we have all experienced, through sweat and tears, through journeying a school life so mundane and arduous, through all those lonely and embarrassing moments, and to this day we still ponder what had ruined it all. That’s right, the omission of a Sakamoto in our lives. Someone, who epitomizes vigor, strength and intellect, that inspires and unbounds the coolness deep within our own individuality. With the absence of such a character, our stories were tasteless, and this story, just like ours had been, would be so too, with a convolution of archetypical dense leads as dense as lead, busty brainless “supports”, conventional franchise-driven, product-advertising, cash-grabbing studios dragging sideways an unrealistic rendition of what COULD have happened in our youths, hence pandering to the lowest, albeit commonly sought-after pubescent demographic. Lay everything bare with your eyes, and you’ll see how all this dirt and grime have long since insidiously buried the savior to all this banality, the deity and student of class 1-2, Sakamoto, and how HE truly deserves to lead us back to a path of greatness that anime has long since been led astray.This story, is how it all begins.ii) Characters - Sheer, harmonic opulenceWhy have characters when there are no characters at all? With the respectable, sensible judgment upheld by numerous veteran critics, the characters of animes in vogue are plethorically referred to as “cardboard cutouts”, “lifeless”, “fictitious”, “not-Sakamoto”. There are no supporting characters in Sakamoto desu-ga, simply because Sakamoto himself supports everyone else. He never imposes; he does not instruct; he only exemplifies the genuity of coolness, and he blows both the animated plebeians and you away with way more than whatever renewed apocalyptic jutsus in Naruto Shippuden are ever canonically capable of achieving. Sakamoto need not amateurish fillers, what for? He is filled to the brim with untainted swag, and instead of receiving fillers he fills everything around him with nothing but the truth. Critics lament and exhort producers and animators to fix their messed-up characters. Well then, Sakamoto’s very much heard enough, so he fixes his own goddamn characters, he gives the very meaning to life as it should be, it’s the raison d'être of his existence. What else, then, are the characters in Sakamoto desu-ga but an ethereal assemblage of life itself, with all its beauty and flaws intact?iii) Production - A team of legendsAnimation: Studio DeenThe beginning of Sakamoto heralds what will be known as the timely Olympian peroration of Deen-animation jokes. “Deenimation” budget might have once been a joke. However, this very production itself, is factually no joke. Sakamoto visualized in motion picture spells an unequivocal merchandisable disaster for financially acclaimed studios such as Madhouse and ufotable; Sakamoto’s rendition is simply too gorgeous, invoking too paradisiac an animation quality requirement for even the likes of so-called Unlimited Budget Works to sustain. Before Unlimited Sakamoto Works, everything else’s reduced to a marginal and pathetic joke.Director: Shinji TakamasuSuperseding School Rumble, Gintama and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, comes a man of wit almost as cool as Sakamoto himself. One can only admire his wisecracking craft as much as Sakamoto desu-ga is to be admired for its gag-propitiated comicality. Accordingly, I place utmost value on discerning the first, third last, seventh, fifth last and fourth letter of the names of every director before contrasting it to the former analysis of the very title of that anime. Naturally, you can barely even perceive how powerful this matchup is; what else, would Sakamoto be deserving of if not the best?Voice Acting: Hikaru Midorikawa as SakamotoHeck, you might have watched Gintama, some Great Teacher Onizuka, maybe Code Geass, perhaps Angel Beats, or Fate/Zero, with an off-chance of Mononoke, and this guy’s been in all of them and more. You’ve probably never even heard of him, he’s never been in the spotlight, but now that “supporting role” entirety is gonna change. As Sakamoto himself, he holds nothing less than the God’s Tongue and the voice of heaven, auralizing an indescribably lustrous overtone that defines perfection. What more can you ask for? Beethoven? That's on appallingly divergent levels. Sakamoto’s voice entails the ascension of every composed and uncomposed orchestral symphonic masterpiece to date. Right here, it’s Sakamoto Flows In You. Beethoven, on the other hand, has long since been decomposing.Opening/Ending Songs by Customi Z and Suneohair:22 times. That’s the total number of different stances that Sakamoto has stylishly taken in the opening sequence, COOLEST. It’s almost as if the song was made just for Sakamoto. Can you believe that? Simply amazing.Unabridged and sporting a melancholic transience, Suneohair’s exemplar of an ending song is contemporary to that of an angel’s hymn. With luster and class, Sakamoto is splashed with an aural paint of sublimity in an everlasting interlude between his work days of delivering more COOL to the mortal realm and heightening levels of SPECIAL in the progression of civilization. In the lateness of day, even the sun begins to shy away from overexposure to Sakamoto’s dignified existence. It is thanks to this hymn in great taste, that we can observe Sakamoto in his natural habitat, partaking in elegant recreation alongside a beauteous sunset.iv) UltimatumShould you watch Sakamoto desu-ga?I am afraid I would have to say no.It is beyond tangible excruciation for me at this point of writing to even delineate the consequences of watching the first episode of Sakamoto desu-ga, which include:1)\tSentience2)\tAdmiration3)\tKiller moves4)\tAnother reason to watch Sakamoto5)\tMacrocosmic indulgence6)\tObstruction of negativity7)\tTitular charisma8)\tOver-the-top greatnessVery much 8 tragic mortal weaknesses, withal the 8 tenacious symptoms of perfection.Should you be slightly confused or bewildered at this point, I greatly sympathize with the below philosophical postulation:“Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he has created here on Earth?”-Robert RodriguezSakamoto however, parades the mortal realm with no fear of himself.Undoubtedly, you should fear and stray away from such an absurdly brilliant creation.

Perfect characters are often frown upon but now and then, someone would find someway to challenge such sentiments. Sakamoto, the complete opposite of a certain popular cringe character named Bean (even with...a slightly elevated mole position), revolves around the story. I mean the story revolves around Sakamoto and his interaction with daily life and the people whom just so happened to be sharing the world with him.Due to his character already being flawless in nature, the show\'s premise relies on the development of other character that directly interacts with him. Almost every episodic segment promotes an obvious ""moral of the story"", Sakamoto ""kakoi-ness"" inspires his fellow students to strive to be better, in somewhat roundabout comedic way.The opening song of the anime serves as a fitting ""bard\'s song"" singing heroic praises, commemorating Sakamoto\'s existence. The jazzy tune played at every instance of ""Sugoi-ness"" amplifies Sakamoto\'s position as a cult of personality in his own show. I sincerely wished there were more varieties for this composition (musical instrument wise) otherwise I would have given it a ""Sakamoto"" rating (That\'s a perfect score).A major risk with the show\'s premise is that it constantly needs to redefine it\'s ""Kuru-ness"" as it needs to persistently impress viewers so that the humor does not run dry. Being constantly bombarded by his ""sugoi"" antics, viewers may sense a feeling of repetition and familiarness. Thus, an unimpressive side character was eventually introduced as Sakamoto\'s comrade in order the contrast the blatant difference between them. The show is capable of inducing a few chuckles here and there but it\'s short of being anything revolutionary. Whether you are impressed or just find his roundabout ways amusing, Sakamoto does capture our imagination of an almost perfect human being (Clearly because he has to wear glasses, his eyesight isn\'t that perfect).PS: Apologies for all the wapanese terms, just an afterthought of how cringey it is when non-Japanese speakers use Japanese word but it is somewhat ""cool"" for Japanese people to use English terms.

If you watched the first 3 episodes, whether you liked it or not, you've seen everything the show can offer.There is no story, no characters, just Sakamoto swagging around, overcomes his opponents effortlessly. It becomes repetitive and boring real quick. There are some minor plot twists in every one or two episodes, when you along the rest of the cast thinks Sakamoto doing something extraordinary, but it turns out, it's just a regular thing, like making noise or hail a taxi. It's creative and funny, at least the first 2 or 3 times, but...not enough. The sound and music are decent, fits to the series, but that's all. There is literally nothing to talk about this series because it's completely blank.At the end the biggest flaw of the series is that how flawless the main character is.

As per custom, this responsibility is passed on to the next of kin, and in order to uphold this age-old tradition, my long rigorous undertaking of Swag began.Through the deepest depths of the Amazon rainforest and the scorching heat of the Sahara desert, I traversed the lands in search of answers. Learning the forbidden tapestry of the Maasai tribe, as well...as dedicating 5 years of discipleship to the Caribs and Arawaks natives of Trinidad, I\'ve gathered up enough information through extensive research and careful analysis to finally end this ancestral task. And so, after much deliberation, I\'ve come to the conclusion that Sakamoto is, without dispute, the swaggiest character in all the land.SWAGMOTO (often misspelled as ""Sakamoto desu ga?"") or ""Haven\'t You Heard? I\'m Sakamoto"" in English, is the story of a Gary Stu maneuvering his way through high school, as he deals with the everyday pressures of growing up, as well as the burden that comes with having an excessive amount of swag and being absolutely fabulous.With no one else to turn to, Swagmoto is forced to carry this heavy burden of ""COOL"" all by his lonesome, constantly being pestered into appeasing lesser beings by humoring or aiding them in their daily dilemmas. He\'s a God among men, our Lord and savior sent from the heavens to guide the uncultured plebeians. And when he isn\'t indirectly seducing men, women and grown-ups alike, Swagmoto is teaching his fellow man life lessons in absurd ways that only a true SwagLord of his caliber is capable of doing.Sakamoto is what happens when you take an observational approach to an overused trope, while also deciding to view it through a comedic lens. And in this case, the overused trope being examined is Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters. With portrayals that often border on the implausible due to the nature of these type of characters being flawless, Sakamoto purposely pushes pass the already thin threshold of practicality associated with them, to enter a realm beyond logic or reason. It exaggerates an archetype that\'s already exaggerated, to begin with, resulting in what would usually be seen as idealistic features and feats in any other show, into laughter inducing comedic mishaps.Any given episode sees the titular SwagLord modestly demonstrating his unparalleled COOLNESS in daily tasks at school and around his town, while also occasionally introducing other opposing characters that try to dethrone his position as the swaggiest character on campus. These naysayers often try desperately to outdo SwagJesus in some kind of task, only to have their plans backfire in their faces when his swag is proven to be 2COOL4them. And like everyone else that comes face to face with Swagdaddy, they too are assimilated into the fold as one of his disciples, admiring his fabulousness from afar, while desperately seeking out his attention and approval.The story structure of Sakamoto is similar to that of comedies like Cromartie High School, but where that over-exaggerates the actions of high school delinquents, Sakamoto switches its focus to idealized characters. And while it should go without saying that comedy is highly subjective, it\'s still safe to say that if you like comedic stories with this kind of structure, then there\'s a good chance that you would find Sakamoto\'s offerings to be up to snuff. The protagonist\'s deadpan delivery, coupled with the range of reactions given by his peers, is the selling point of the show. But with no other offerings besides this joke, it doesn\'t take long for the misadventures of Swagmoto to border on lackluster. Like any other gag comedy with a central gimmick carrying it, there will come a point where the punchline doesn\'t hit as hard as it did before, and Sakamoto wasn\'t immune to this occurrence.A joke that\'s become par for the course runs the risk of growing dull. You could always spice it up with different scenarios, but when the core reasoning behind the joke remains the same, it ceases to deliver the same results after some time. This is usually why most comedy shows have something other than its signature style of humor to keep the viewer\'s attentiveness. With a limited repertoire of comedic quips and material to worth with, Sakamoto often found its level of impact fluctuating on regular intervals. And while the scenarios are different, the jokes all center around the same comedic gag, which of course is Sakamoto\'s unnervingly perfect execution of everything he does.But even when the show doesn\'t bring the laughs, you could still depend on Swagmoto to swoop in and save the day. If it doesn\'t hit its target on the first try, there\'s usually a follow-up attempt that does. This doesn\'t mean that our messiah was always successful at salvaging a dying joke, but his efforts did keep the show from becoming a chore to watch. With Jesus on your side, anything is possible. Even a measly comedic attempt is still capable of making you smile when Swagmoto is behind it. The Lord is truly great and worthy to be praised.Another key feature of Sakamoto\'s sense of humor is just how upfront it is. It never feels mean-spirited about how it goes about masquerading any of these characters. Even when accounting for the fact that these type of characters presented are usually taken in a negative light. Mary Sue/Gary Stu characters are often detested by viewers, and rightfully so. Their presence usually indicates a sign of cheap writing on the creator\'s behalf. So when Sakamoto views this detracting feature as a glass half full, it opens up an avenue for a new look on the subject.Even when Swagmoto appears to be giving someone the cold shoulder, in reality, he still has their best interest in mind. As stated by fellow reviewer RogerSmith2004, ""Even when the other person loses, they never actually lose. Their encounter with Sakamoto is always a beneficial one. By the end of the segment, no matter how crazy it may seem... Sakamoto, through some means, helps them out."" The lighthearted nature of Sakamoto gave the show a feel-good quality about it.

Sakamoto. Despite how much I enjoyed Sakamoto desu ga? I can fully understand this anime is not for everyone. However, I love comedy shows that don\'t take themselves seriously. Sakamoto took a similar approach to Nichijou in the fact that it didn\'t give a shit. It wasn\'t trying to cater towards a specific category of viewer and stuck to its repetitive yet effective style of humor, with its over exaggeration of daily, normal events. In doing so, it became the unsung hero of the season for me, and...made me appreciate the whimsical side of normalcy. For now, despite whether or not you agree with me, depress your mute button and let me explain Sakamoto\'s greatness to you.Sometimes less is more, and I couldn\'t think of a better phrase to sum up this show. Sakamoto desu ga? flew onto the scene this season headed by the well known director, Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, School Rumble). The setting is simple, a standard Japanese high school with your pranksters, babes and nerds. But what makes this high school different is that it\'s enrolled the embodiment of perfection that is Sakamoto. He\'s tall dark and handsome, and can do no wrong. He performs every task quickly and concisely, emulating a smirk that would drop panties from a mile away. Whether he\'s an alien or robot doesn\'t really matter, since it would only add confirmation to the ridiculousness that this anime contains. Countless people wish to disrupt Sakamoto\'s greatness for one reason or another but constantly fail in doing so. The methods in which their feeble attempts are vanquished always seem to have me rolling. One minute Sakamoto is fighting a bee with a protractor and the next he\'s attacking people with soft drinks. The ""Secret Techniques"" employed in some episodes were a riot, most specifically the ones in the adult video episode. Some of those scenes were pure comedic gold. The important thing to remember here is that Sakamoto desu ga? was produced on a rather low budget, and although it doesn\'t do many things, what it does it nails. It truly embodies greatness through simplicity.Another thing Sakamoto does well is the accurate transposition of its source material. If you\'re anything like me (being a primary anime viewer), you get tired of the phrase ""oh, that\'s not how it is in the manga!"" So when an adaptation executes well and I don\'t have to hear that talk, everyone is happy. Well done Studio Deen! They\'ve been responsible for some rather big budget titles over the years (Fate series etc.), so to see them succeed with something on the contrary is impressive. With some anime the season, I went into each episode unaware of what I was going to get. Since I watched the series as it aired, I\'m looking for something consistent that will bring me back excited each week. By the end of the first four or five episodes of Sakamoto, I sort of knew what to expect from it every Saturday. If I don\'t have the luxury of binge watching it, give me something to look forward to in each episode!Similarly to the comedy, the negatives in Sakamoto are mostly preferential. For cultural reasons there were some jokes that went over my head but didn\'t necessarily deter me from finding them amusing. Also, episode six was an absolute bore. Watching a bunch of kids follow Sakamoto down a white line for 10+ minutes is not my idea of a good time. The elicit one-sided love affair with Sakamoto\'s friend\'s mom kind of made me nauseous at times. Fortunately enough, Sakamoto\'s tireless acts of evading countered my disgusted emotions quite well. As much as I hate to say it, this series could fall flat at times which probably hindered it from being an 8/10 for me. As previously stated, I can understand why people don\'t like the show. I can usually find most comedy styles humorous in anime, but slapstick and stupid humor are some of my favorite sub-genres. And although most of the jokes were way out of left field, instead of getting the forced vibe I did accept it as commonplace given Sakamoto\'s flawless behavior. Non-comedy fans may not ""get"" Sakamoto, and that\'s fine.  This show was not geared towards everyone\'s perspective of what qualifies as funny. I do admit, even as someone who is a fan of this comedy style, I could feel myself losing interest in the last two episodes.As far as characters go, Sakamoto is really the only thing that matters in this show.  Sure, there are supportive cast mates strewn about, but none of them really make or break the show.  Our lord and savior, Sakamoto sweats perfection, and makes even the manliest of men blush with a mere smile.  Sometimes I\'m not sure if I should laugh or be entirely creeped out by some of the character\'s reactions to Sakamoto\'s escapades.... But I\'m not sure that it makes any difference.  There has been a debate among the forums of whether he\'s an alien or not. Again, the over-analytic approach some anime fans have grown accustomed to will not translate well into this show.  Coming from a reasonable critic, shut your brain off while watching this series and just enjoy the senseless comedy. Sakamoto is sort of a one trick pony, so there really isn\'t much development in him, and there weren\'t any instances of internal monologue or breaking the fourth wall.  I think adding too much or maybe any development to his character would\'ve been detrimental to the show\'s atmosphere.The art isn\'t anything special in Sakamoto desu ga? Any slightly seasoned anime fan could notice the show\'s lower budget in its art.  Aside from the OP, there aren\'t many instances of bright or vivid color schemes, and the character models are dull and slightly cloned (although you could argue that this was intentional). I did find the students who were drawn to look like they were in their 20\'s or 30\'s rather amusing, even more evidence that the writers didn\'t take the show seriously.  The backgrounds are often recycled and bland, but in an anime mostly shown in a school, you can\'t expect much else.The OP as mentioned above was my favorite of the season.  The small animations were all to accentuate Sakamoto\'s greatness, and the music was powerful and triumphant.  I loved watching the various props he\'d use to sing with or use as musical instruments.  The ED was a calming way to end the comedy from each episode, and it grew on me the longer I watched the series.  The rest of the soundtrack consisted of a couple of recycled songs, most notably the ditty that played prior to each time Sakamoto swooped in doing something mesmerizing. I enjoyed it every time. Sakamoto\'s voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was quite brilliant in his classy portrayal.  Kubota, played by Akira Ishida, was phenomenal.  He was a large reason the character gave off such a creepy vibe.So, to be fair, Sakamoto desu ga was the anime of the season for me.  Its inflated representation of the ""perfect"" guy at school made me laugh constantly, and there was no way I could guess what he would do next.  This anime is certainly not for everyone, and my score is entirely dependent on my preference.  I\'d recommend Sakamoto to fans of shows like Nichijou, Gintama or Chromartie High School, but if you\'re not a fan of mindless comedy I\'d stay away.  Unlike its main protagonist, it\'s not perfect by any means, and sometimes ventures too far to get a laugh, but overall I found it to be highly enjoyable.  As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Spring 2016 reviews! made me appreciate the whimsical side of normalcy. For now, despite whether or not you agree with me, depress your mute button and let me explain Sakamoto\'s greatness to you.Sometimes less is more, and I couldn\'t think of a better phrase to sum up this show. Sakamoto desu ga? flew onto the scene this season headed by the well known director, Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, School Rumble). The setting is simple, a standard Japanese high school with your pranksters, babes and nerds. But what makes this high school different is that it\'s enrolled the embodiment of perfection that is Sakamoto. He\'s tall dark and handsome, and can do no wrong. He performs every task quickly and concisely, emulating a smirk that would drop panties from a mile away. Whether he\'s an alien or robot doesn\'t really matter, since it would only add confirmation to the ridiculousness that this anime contains. Countless people wish to disrupt Sakamoto\'s greatness for one reason or another but constantly fail in doing so. The methods in which their feeble attempts are vanquished always seem to have me rolling. One minute Sakamoto is fighting a bee with a protractor and the next he\'s attacking people with soft drinks. The ""Secret Techniques"" employed in some episodes were a riot, most specifically the ones in the adult video episode. Some of those scenes were pure comedic gold. The important thing to remember here is that Sakamoto desu ga? was produced on a rather low budget, and although it doesn\'t do many things, what it does it nails. It truly embodies greatness through simplicity.Another thing Sakamoto does well is the accurate transposition of its source material. If you\'re anything like me (being a primary anime viewer), you get tired of the phrase ""oh, that\'s not how it is in the manga!"" So when an adaptation executes well and I don\'t have to hear that talk, everyone is happy. Well done Studio Deen! They\'ve been responsible for some rather big budget titles over the years (Fate series etc.), so to see them succeed with something on the contrary is impressive. With some anime the season, I went into each episode unaware of what I was going to get. Since I watched the series as it aired, I\'m looking for something consistent that will bring me back excited each week. By the end of the first four or five episodes of Sakamoto, I sort of knew what to expect from it every Saturday. If I don\'t have the luxury of binge watching it, give me something to look forward to in each episode!Similarly to the comedy, the negatives in Sakamoto are mostly preferential. For cultural reasons there were some jokes that went over my head but didn\'t necessarily deter me from finding them amusing. Also, episode six was an absolute bore. Watching a bunch of kids follow Sakamoto down a white line for 10+ minutes is not my idea of a good time. The elicit one-sided love affair with Sakamoto\'s friend\'s mom kind of made me nauseous at times. Fortunately enough, Sakamoto\'s tireless acts of evading countered my disgusted emotions quite well. As much as I hate to say it, this series could fall flat at times which probably hindered it from being an 8/10 for me. As previously stated, I can understand why people don\'t like the show. I can usually find most comedy styles humorous in anime, but slapstick and stupid humor are some of my favorite sub-genres. And although most of the jokes were way out of left field, instead of getting the forced vibe I did accept it as commonplace given Sakamoto\'s flawless behavior. Non-comedy fans may not ""get"" Sakamoto, and that\'s fine.  This show was not geared towards everyone\'s perspective of what qualifies as funny. I do admit, even as someone who is a fan of this comedy style, I could feel myself losing interest in the last two episodes.As far as characters go, Sakamoto is really the only thing that matters in this show.  Sure, there are supportive cast mates strewn about, but none of them really make or break the show.  Our lord and savior, Sakamoto sweats perfection, and makes even the manliest of men blush with a mere smile.  Sometimes I\'m not sure if I should laugh or be entirely creeped out by some of the character\'s reactions to Sakamoto\'s escapades.... But I\'m not sure that it makes any difference.  There has been a debate among the forums of whether he\'s an alien or not. Again, the over-analytic approach some anime fans have grown accustomed to will not translate well into this show.  Coming from a reasonable critic, shut your brain off while watching this series and just enjoy the senseless comedy. Sakamoto is sort of a one trick pony, so there really isn\'t much development in him, and there weren\'t any instances of internal monologue or breaking the fourth wall.  I think adding too much or maybe any development to his character would\'ve been detrimental to the show\'s atmosphere.The art isn\'t anything special in Sakamoto desu ga? Any slightly seasoned anime fan could notice the show\'s lower budget in its art.  Aside from the OP, there aren\'t many instances of bright or vivid color schemes, and the character models are dull and slightly cloned (although you could argue that this was intentional). I did find the students who were drawn to look like they were in their 20\'s or 30\'s rather amusing, even more evidence that the writers didn\'t take the show seriously.  The backgrounds are often recycled and bland, but in an anime mostly shown in a school, you can\'t expect much else.The OP as mentioned above was my favorite of the season.  The small animations were all to accentuate Sakamoto\'s greatness, and the music was powerful and triumphant.  I loved watching the various props he\'d use to sing with or use as musical instruments.  The ED was a calming way to end the comedy from each episode, and it grew on me the longer I watched the series.  The rest of the soundtrack consisted of a couple of recycled songs, most notably the ditty that played prior to each time Sakamoto swooped in doing something mesmerizing. I enjoyed it every time. Sakamoto\'s voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was quite brilliant in his classy portrayal.  Kubota, played by Akira Ishida, was phenomenal.  He was a large reason the character gave off such a creepy vibe.So, to be fair, Sakamoto desu ga was the anime of the season for me.  Its inflated representation of the ""perfect"" guy at school made me laugh constantly, and there was no way I could guess what he would do next.  This anime is certainly not for everyone, and my score is entirely dependent on my preference.  I\'d recommend Sakamoto to fans of shows like Nichijou, Gintama or Chromartie High School, but if you\'re not a fan of mindless comedy I\'d stay away.

It has a cool guy named Sakamoto who swags his way through every situation he’s ever faced with.Characters are made interesting through their complexity, with them coming to deal with their flaws, accept them and improve upon them where they can. That’s what makes an interesting and complex storyline.In a lot of ways, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is the One Punch Man of school-life anime. One Punch Man is about a hero named Saitama who destroys every enemy he faces with one punch and zero effort.Sakamoto Desu Ga? is about a kid...named Sakamoto who has similar results against his foes. But instead of fighting giant monsters, he’s going up against school bullies and manipulative girls.And instead of defeating them with a punch, he defeats them with sheer charm and charisma.And by “defeat,” I mean “make them like him and also make them better people overall in the processThe really impressive thing about Sakamoto Desu Ga? so far is the ability it has to take a simple concept and keep it fresh in a number of situations.The negative thing about the anime is that there is no character development, no plot development. Each episode basically just sums up the same way: “Someone is going to try to make Sakamoto look bad, let’s see how it ultimately backfires and makes him look way cooler.”Despite all this, it’s so weird and quirky that it’s ultimately still quite enjoyable. Despite it just featuring the same gag, playing out in different ways, it’s still a ton of fun. That’s incredibly impressive to me, and speaks to the quality of the gag. But I have to wonder just how long it can keep up.The secondary characters in the series are practically non-existent. The few that are recurring aren’t especially interesting, even down to their names. such as :There’s “popular girl who tries to seduce Sakamoto for the sake of status, but keeps getting hilariously foiled.”I didn’t list all of the  names, because honestly, they’re not important to the series. Sakamoto Desu Ga? is a one-man show, and the other characters are little more than props to further the legend of Sakamoto.Even the opening credits feature all of exactly one character.It’s easy to see Sakamoto Desu Ga? is made on a budget. The very first episode opens with a wide shot of three guys tossing a volleyball around in the school yard in the most minimal, circular animation imaginable.The action sequences rely heavily on dressed-up still shots, simple circular animation patterns, and motion blur. They do a good job of hiding the lack of funding where they can, but suffice to say there aren’t any sequences that are going to leave you slack-jawed in awe and appreciation.Spoiler--------Episode 6 was really terrible due to the fact that Sakamoto and three kids was walking in a white line which took most of the time consumption on the episode which was rough about 10minutes ""WASTED"" footage. This episode really lacked being entertaining aswell being enjoyable.All in all:Animation: 5/6Character development : 3Sound: 5Enjoyment: 4/5Overall : 4Thank you for reading my review if you got this far and i hope you found it useful and take in ideas on what is to come when you watch this series. named Sakamoto who has similar results against his foes.

My friends seemed to like it, but I honestly struggled to get through the whole series. It starts off well enough, we meet Sakamoto, the impossibly perfect high school boy, able to do any task with efficiency and grace, no matter how outrageous said task is. But then that's it. That's the anime. Here is some cool, infallible guy WHO DOESN'T CHANGE EVER.If Sakamoto had maybe developed in some way - i.e. become more human, hell had turned out not to be a human - I might have liked this anime. But I can't. I can't sit through so many episodes...of effectively the same thing over and over. I watched the Endless Eight, well this is the Endless Twelve. Good luck. of effectively the same thing over and over. I watched the Endless Eight, well this is the Endless Twelve. Good luck."", 'This is truly a horrible anime. This thing barely worked in manga format because you could read it quickly(and even THEN you tired after 5 chapters when the novelty wore off because it was just a repeat thing with no jokes or anything every damn chapter, while the latter half was barely worth reading despite only having a few chapters over 20), but when it\'s endlessly dragged out in anime format and no new parts or innovations which adds to the experience? Yeah, you have a dreadful or even pathetic piece of crap that you just shouldn\'t waste your time watching.This anime has pathetic characters,...pathetic story and offers ridiculously low amounts of enjoyment. You might even go minus on the enjoyment part and just wish to kill yourself while watching this. It might be slightly better if you haven\'t read the manga, but I don\'t see this thing being worthy of anything above 3 stars even then.None of the side characters have any soul or special part about them, at most they\'re all kind of obnoxious. The whole thing is just about sakamoto showing that he\'s got a bigger d*ck than anyone else and amaze everyone with his rather impossible actions as he flawlessly avoids every possibly negative thing for himself, dumbfounding people over and over again. This is all this anime is. Sakamoto isn\'t even interesting as a character, just like in the manga, he\'s a soulless shell with no clear emotions, no goals and no parts that stand out other than the fact that he can\'t be screwed over because he\'s so ""amazing"". We don\'t know who he is, we don\'t know what he is, we don\'t know his real goals, we don\'t know what he feels about anything. How could such a character be likable, especially when he needs to prop up the show by himself since none of the side-characters have anything to offer other than being retarded and way too eager to kiss his arse?Just spare yourself from the frustration and never, ever watch this.

For the students at Gakubun Prefectural High School the answer would most definitely be ""Sakamoto.""""Sakamoto desu ga?"" is an anime which focuses around our main character Sakamoto. The niche of this anime is that Sakamoto is the coolest guy around; always figuring out the best answer to any given situation. Now, the plot of this show may not seem extraordinary, nor do I proclaim it to be; but the show manages to grasp your attention with it\'s own unique style. This show...couples easy to follow scenes with a nice jazz-styled OST to create a calming vibe. The anime does a perfect job of creating an atmosphere where the viewer has time to sit back and unwind.To follow, there\'s another element of the show that I felt made it worth watching. The show inspires you. Sakamoto throughout the duration of the series always manages to find the best answers to even the trickiest situations; a trait which is inspiring and admirable. Watching Sakamoto pull off the feats that he does leaves the viewer with a sense of wanting to do the same in their own lives. It gives you the initiative to live like Sakamoto, without fear or regret, finding the best answer to all questions; which I feel alone is enough to make the anime enjoyable.To add to the inspiring atmosphere that the show creates there\'s also the comedy, which of course is meant to be the focal point of the show. The comedy wasn\'t phenomenal, but there were very few points in the show where I was not laughing or at least cracking a smile. The anime does not pull off too many hysterical jokes (that\'s not to say there aren\'t any), but it does pull off consistent quality ones; a feat which will leave you happy and laughing throughout each episode.The OST, I have to mention, is also very well done. The aesthetic of the music develops a calming and fanciful environment in which we can watch each character live their life. The OST is truly fitting of the anime\'s genre and purpose; and for that I must give it high regards.The art is very-well done, surprisingly so for a show that doesn\'t involve any extensive fight scenes or breath-taking scenery. There was even a ""fight scene"" at one point during the show that was animated better than some of the big fights I\'ve seen in animes with extensive budgets - that, to me, says a lot about the quality of the work that went into the show.The only downfall I\'d have to mention about the anime is there\'s no evident story-line to follow. If you\'re a sucker for a good story, then this anime may not intrigue you. The purpose of the show is to follow the comical school life of the coolest guy you may ever know, Sakamoto; but at the same time that\'s all it is. There is not meant to be a story to follow simply because that\'s how the show was constructed. There is, however, a small underlying plot device that defines the show and is the reason I am giving it such a high mark. This underlying plot device is hinted at in the anime itself, and I will make a point not to spoil it here.To conclude this review; I hold ""Sakamoto desu ga?"" in high regards and I loved sitting down to watch the show each week. It\'s relaxing, fun, consistently funny, and a great show for anyone who wants to unwind and laugh.

Go watch it.', 'If there wasn’t enough fabulousness this season, don’t worry, Sakamoto is here. Sakamoto desu ga is exactly how it looks and sounds. An entire series focused on a character that is perfect is a pretty risky job. The series can easily become repetitive and boring if it heavily relies on one joke. Sakamoto manages to consistently entertain with its variety of different jokes, that all use the same backbone. It’s just the sheer amount of creativity and wackiness that can make Sakamoto look not only perfect to the people around him, but also the viewers. But it’s not just the comedy Sakamoto succeeds at, but...also its parody on common tropes in anime, which makes the series seem much more intelligent than it out to be.~{Story}~Well, Sakamoto desu ga is exactly as the premise says it is. The series revolves around Sakamoto doing wacky, yet fabulous stuff in very weird comedic situations. He’ll avoid bullying, smoke bubble, run like the Darwin Evolution diagrams, create subliminal messages in split-seconds… you get the point. People say that there is no such thing as perfection. They clearly haven’t heard about Sakamoto. He has the girls being deredere for him, the guys being tsundere for him, and birds being dandere for him… yeah, that’s the power of Sakamoto’s charm. Sakamoto is primarily episodic, as each episode (or more like half of an episode) revolves around a comedic situations involving Sakamoto. The series doesn’t have a major plot in the series until the very end, but that’s not the highlight of the series. The highlights are the comedic situations throughout the series. The writing of these comedic situations is somewhat genius and the tiny stories themselves are very unique and creative. And the ending is satisfying enough to be a fitting conclusion to the series, that doesn’t need any more continuations. It leaves a lot of questions open, but that’s what maintains the charm of the series – who is Sakamoto really?Story: 5/10~{Presentation}~If there’s one thing that’s fabulous in Sakamoto desu ga besides Sakamoto himself, it’s the style. The way the series presents its comedy is fantastic. Characters will talk about the most absurd things in the most common fashion, OST will be an intentional mismatch for the situation to create more comedy, and Sakamoto will make the most bizarre things look like a typical day for an average teenager. For an anime that heavily relies on one joke for laughs, it manages to do so properly. The amount of creativity the series has makes it very impressive. Sakamoto’s jokes may come from a randomly generated joke machine, but it manages to blend these absurd elements together that it makes is feel consistent. The series also has moments when the series takes a serious tone in situations, and this is when the series starts to break apart. The serious moments don’t seem tense enough to be serious enough and they only make the moments boring. Though it is necessary to have these moments to create a main story, it’s just that it feels so out-of-place that it feels like I’m watching a different series. Luckily these moments end quick and the comedy kicks in again. But there are moments when the series can be heartwarming, such as its conclusion and its final moments with Sakamoto.Presentation: 6.5/10~{Character}~Sakamoto desu ga is all about Sakamoto and Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. And for a series that primarily focuses on one character, it is important for him to be likable and good as a character. Well, Sakamoto is more than that, as he’s fabulous! Sakamoto is a character without any flaws and perfect to the core. But he’s not a Gary Stu, because he’s too extreme to be so. He’s more like a parody of it. Sakamoto’s character is here to pull fun at other characters from other series that are considered perfect. And a formula like this can get boring quite easily, but Sakamoto manages to keep us entertained by going through even wackier situations. He doesn’t have a backstory, and there’s no real depth to him, but that would ruin the purpose of the series. Sakamoto has always been a mystery with his inhuman abilities, and it’s up for the viewers to decide who his really is. No matter what he is though, he’s still Sakamoto. Even though the series primarily focuses on its protagonist, the supporting characters are also fun and likable. You got the tsundere bully Acchan (who plays a bigger role near the end), bully victim Kubota, delinquent Hayabusa, and much more. The series does feature an antagonist, but he never ends up being an interesting character.Character: 5/10~{Art}~,Considering Studio Deen’s track record of having subpar art, Sakamoto desu ga’s art quality is a lot better than most of their work. For the most part, it’s very clean and consistent, and the series manages to have good detaining even for background objects. The backgrounds are really good looking and have a good amount of details. Deen was always good at having detailed architectures, and Sakamoto is no exception. Characters also look clean and neat, though they do lack some detailing. Character design is quite interesting, as the perfect Sakamoto is shown to have glasses, which was an interesting choice. Acchan’s toque also makes him stand out a lot. And overall the character designs are good and somewhat unique.Art: 6/10~{Animation}~This is where Sakamoto desu ga starts to stumble. Studio Deen doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to production values and animation fluidity. However, they managed to nail Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu’s quality from last season, so one could hope they would do the same in Sakamoto. Sadly it’s only okay, nothing more. Character fluidity is quite lacking and disappointing and backgrounds, though they look good, feel very static and flat. And the series heavily relies on still shots so less will need to be animated. Though these still shots might have good art, the lack of animation in them shows that they were used to cut corners. Hey, at least the animations in the OP are great…Animation: 5/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting in Sakamoto desu ga is fabulous to say the least, as every character Is done with near perfect. Although, that is expected with such a good cast. Midorikawa Hikaru nails it as Sakamoto. His tone in his voice is always kept in an even level, just like how a perfect character like Sakamoto would talk. He makes sure to make his character lack emotion, yet not feel dead. He might have been the best choice for Sakamoto. Sugita Tomokazu does an outstanding job as Acchan, which it to be expected since Sugita is a wonderful seiyuu, especially for comedic situations. His over-the top tone in certain situations is hilarious. And Sugita nails his love for Sakamoto, by adding a girly tone to Acchan whenever he goes deredere for Sakamoto. Ishida Akira does a role I’ve never seen him do before. It astonishes me how he’s able to do Kubota so effortlessly. It just shows how talented he is. Other well-known seiyuu are also part of the series, such as Horie Yui, Nakahara Mai, Suzuki Tatsuhisa, and they all do an excellent job in what they have to do.Voice Acting: 8/10~{Music}~I guess you can say that the music is Sakamoto desu ga is the “coolest”. The OP, “COOLEST”, is absolutely perfect for a series like this. The vocals are nice and the lyrics are ridiculous (and it should be like that), and the music is great too. The OP matches the context of the anime so well because Sakamoto is indeed the coolest. The ED, “Nakushita Hibi ni Sayonara”, is also quite good. It’s not as memorable as the OP, but it’s nice enough. The vocals are nice and the music is soothing. The background music in the series is great and it works well with the series. Sakamoto’s theme, which you’ll be hearing a lot, matches every over-the-top situation Sakamoto’s in. Overall, the background music may not be the most inventive, but it works well with the anime.Music: 7/10~{Enjoyment}~Sakamoto desu ga is always a blast to watch. Very few comedy anime can make me laugh in every episode, and Sakamoto succeeds in doing so. The series is just so over-the-top, absurd, and ridiculous, that it’s hard not to find enjoyment out of it. Sakamoto’s perfection is to die for, and it’s always fun seeing him in weird, comedic situations. Whether it be running like the Darwin Evolution diagram, or Sakamoto using curtains to make breasts, or uses a balloon gun to threaten bullies, Sakamoto does all of this in ease and it’s fun seeing him do so. He remains a mystery throughout the series, and it’s up for the audience to decide who he really might be. Is he actually human or is he an alien? It’s up to you to decide.Enjoyment: 7/10In the end, Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy you don’t want to miss out on. Parody comedy anime are pretty rare to see these days, so finding one that actually works is a blessing. The series is all about Sakamoto, nothing more, nothing less. It may be repetitive for some, but it’s impossible to deny the sheer creativeness and uniqueness the series has to offer. You won’t see comedic situations like the one you’ll see in Sakamoto. The production values are a little off, and the serious moments aren’t too great, but the comedy makes up for it. Do yourself a favor and fall in love with Sakamoto’s fabulousness. You won’t regret it!+ Sakamoto’s a cool protagonist who manages to entertain throughout the series+ Comedic situations are absurd and ridiculous, yet creative and inventive+ Fitting and somewhat heartwarming conclusion+ Fantastic voice acting for Sakamoto and the major supporting characters.- Production values are lacking- The serious tone, when it appears, don’t work well for the seriesOverall: 6.2/10 also its parody on common tropes in anime, which makes the series seem much more intelligent than it out to be.~{Story}~Well, Sakamoto desu ga is exactly as the premise says it is.

Every girl wants him, even those that have gone way past their teenage years.The reason for this quite mediocre 4 is pretty simple: it\'s because I just described ALL of Sakamoto\'s storyboard.There is no plot per se, it\'s half-episodes shorts where Sakamoto is always fabulous and the others are not.There is nothing special about any of the characters, they...bring out a really boring villain halfway through the season but apart from that, there is nobody even noticeable.And far worse, not only are the characters unmemorable, but they are not developped AT ALL. Not one of them. Why are the punks punks? Why is the loser a loser? Is there any buildup in their personalities for any of that? I never even began to care about anyone because nobody was even remotely developped.While the gimmick is a lot of fun, it\'s used on something completely nonexistant, like watering a piece of wooden fence hoping a tree will grow out.

When referring to this anime, I will not be using the question mark at the end because it messes with punctuation and makes it complicated. This is my first anime review because I\'m sure that I can give an accurate and objective perspective of what this anime is and isn\'t. As such, I want people to decide for themselves whether or not they enjoy Sakamoto desu ga. The purpose of this review is just to spell out what Sakamoto desu ga entails so that people who are watching and people who are interested in watching will know what...to make of this anime. Now, let\'s begin.For those who dislike reading long blurbs, I\'ll summarize what I want to say right here. Sakamoto desu ga is a comedy anime that uses the main character, Sakamoto, in little skits. These skits will always involve another person trying to make Sakamoto look bad, but apparently Sakamoto is so omnipotently perfect that he can\'t possibly look bad and any attempt to do so will only highlight how cool he is. As such, this anime has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. This is not my opinion, this is fact. To contradict this statement would be a blatant lie. Now, before those who enjoy this anime gather their pitchforks, I am not saying that this anime is unenjoyable or dumb. My opinion is that this anime is a pathetic excuse for a comedy that is not worth my time, hence why this is on my dropped list, but that\'s just my opinion. For other people, maybe the skits are wonderfully funny and Sakamoto\'s character archetype is so perfect for them that this overrides the fact that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme.As such, this anime is hit or miss based on people\'s personal tastes. If you like the characters and how they revolve around Sakamoto, then great, you\'ve found something that you love. If you\'re two episodes in and you don\'t see anything worthwhile in Sakamoto desu ga, then quit while you\'re ahead. The series doesn\'t get better. In fact, for those who don\'t immediately enjoy the anime, I can guarantee that Sakamoto desu ga gets much, much, worse. Spare yourself the trauma.Wow, that was the summary? Well then, okay. From here on out there may be spoilers for Sakamoto desu ga, but it\'s not like it matters. If you\'re watching Sakamoto desu ga for the plot, then I pity what your life has come to.Story: 1/10There is no story. Period. I could take episode 1 and 12, set them aside, and jumble up episodes 2-11. The end result would make just as much sense as how the anime is actually structured. Each episode has absolutely nothing to do with the previous and next episode. The only thing that changes is the people that admire Sakamoto. After each skit, the people who originally tried to make Sakamoto look bad later come to realize his godliness. That\'s really the only thing that changes from episode to episode. The only sign that you\'re actually getting deeper into the anime. Really. No, I\'m not kidding.Art: 7/10I didn\'t notice anything extremely good about the art, but I also have no complaints with how the anime looks. Then again, I\'m no art expert.Sound: 5/10Nothing from the soundtrack stood out to me. I actually barely remember it. At least that means I also didn\'t remember anything bad about it either.Character: 1/10Again, there is absolutely no character development. Anyone who says that there is is lying to themselves. Additionally, the change from ""hating Sakamoto"" to ""worshiping Sakamoto"" can hardly count as character development. That\'s literally the only thing that changes in this anime. As such, all the characters come as they appear. They don\'t change at all, so it\'s all up to personal preference whether you like them or not. I personally could not tolerate the presence of any of the characters.Enjoyment: 1/10This is entirely personal opinion. If you found enjoyment in this, then congratulations. If you didn\'t find enjoyment within the first two episodes, please quit while you are ahead.Overall: 2/10Objectively, anyone can say that Sakamoto desu ga has zero plot, zero character development, and zero meaningful theme. Because this show is fatally lacking in these departments, it can only possibly make up for itself through its art, sound, and static characters. Art and sound in anime are largely up to personal taste. I found nothing to actively complain about, yet nothing to actively praise about these two features. Because Sakamoto desu ga employs zero character development, all the characters that are introduced never change at all. That means the viewers will just get the characters as they are. If someone loves all the characters, they will find enjoyment in the show. If you can\'t bear any of the characters like me, you\'ll find every aspect of this show irritating and annoying.Sakamoto desu ga is really just hit or miss, but at least it\'s not a complicated anime. That\'s why this is my first review. If you enjoy Sakamoto desu ga, please keep enjoying it for your own sake. It stays the same through and through, so you\'ll definitely find even more enjoyment in it. If you hate Sakamoto desu ga, please quit watching for your own sake. The anime stays the same through and through, so you\'ll definitely continue to be annoyed by it. Sakamoto is able to enchant all of his acquaintances and make them see the good in him. Unfortunately Sakamoto does not have the power to make all viewers find the good in his anime, so if you haven\'t liked Sakamoto desu ga so far, turn back now. to make of this anime.

Because Sakamoto desu ga employs zero character development, all the characters that are introduced never change at all. That means the viewers will just get the characters as they are. If someone loves all the characters, they will find enjoyment in the show. If you can\'t bear any of the characters like me, you\'ll find every aspect of this show irritating and annoying.Sakamoto desu ga is really just hit or miss, but at least it\'s not a complicated anime. That\'s why this is my first review. If you enjoy Sakamoto desu ga, please keep enjoying it for your own sake. It stays the same through and through, so you\'ll definitely find even more enjoyment in it. If you hate Sakamoto desu ga, please quit watching for your own sake. The anime stays the same through and through, so you\'ll definitely continue to be annoyed by it. Sakamoto is able to enchant all of his acquaintances and make them see the good in him. Unfortunately Sakamoto does not have the power to make all viewers find the good in his anime, so if you haven\'t liked Sakamoto desu ga so far, turn back now.', ""Sakamoto Desu Ga is a gem that shines brilliantly in the Spring 2016 season. Its an amazing comedy that is definetly worth investing your time in. While I wasnt expecting much from this show Its become my favorite series of all time and one I highly reccomendSTORY: Sakamoto is the coolest kid at school who can do everything in the most stylish way possible. While the series follows Sakamoto but its really the story of how he helps everyone grow around him. Sakamoto Desu Ga is episodic and follows the narrative of hilarious short stories of everyone's interactions with Sakamoto. Wether his classmates are trying...to foil him or help him Sakamoto solves any problem often with the other chracter in that short story becoming a better person because of meeting Sakamoto. The story is amazingly creative in the everyday tasks Sakamoto and  co. face wether they're excorsizing a ghost, walking all over the town, or having a sumo match the show presents any task they face in the most hilarious way possible. 10/10ART: The way you know if a series is well animated is if you dont notice the animation at all and it feels like a living breathing series. SDG does just that it's very well animated with its fluid motions and nice character design. The series isnt meant to be the most amazingly animated work of art like a Psycho Pass or Fate/Zero but it is very nice to look at, and the art especially shines whenever Sakamoto is on screen as the lighting is shown to portray Sakamoto as the Flashiest and most amazing person as possible and they easily succeed. The Sakamoto scenes can easily make you buy into the idea that Sakamoto is the coolest person alive because of how amazingly hes presented.CHARACTERS: The cast of Sakamoto is very large but offers a very memorable selection of them. I could be here all day talking about how amazing Sakamoto is and thats because I truly believe he is. Studio Deen goes out of their way to make Sakamoto the coolest whether it be their amazing visuals when hes on screen, the Suave music that always plays when hes around, or his amazing feats he is the best character of the series and is absolutely hilarious. Kubota sakamoto's sidekick is absolutey hilarious and serves as the kind of ugly sister to sakamoto. The Three delinquents always get into some mischief, Hayabousa is an absolute badass, Aina is a dual faced flirtatious psycho who is one of the many girls fawning over Sakamoto, Sera is just completely hilarous (ill come back to him in a second). These are all characters ive grown fond of in my 12 ep. run of SDG because they have human emotions and feel like people I could actually meet and be friends with and those are a limited number to not make this review too long. Sakamoto helps all these characters grow inderiectly and it is rewarding too see them do so.SOUND: The soundtrack is amazing and very Suave reflecting the feel of the series. From the high powered OP to the Cool soundtrack around Sakamoto the soundtrack. Yasuhiko Fukuda  gives a great OST  and im excited to see what he brings us in the future.COMEDY: The series is hialrous and is always bringing a great sense of humor. If I had to compare how funny it is to other anime id say its up there with Gintama and Barakamon two of my favorite anime series. The show has great execution and always brings us the most simple situations in a hilarous manor.OVERALL: Sakamoto Desu Ga was a pleasure to watch and is easily one of my favorite series of all time. From the comedic execution to the great characters there is little not too love. SDG earns a 10/10 for me and a strong reccomendation to foil him or help him Sakamoto solves any problem often with the other chracter in that short story becoming a better person because of meeting Sakamoto.

It lacks variety. Like, REALLY lacks variety.A better alternative which I feel like has a similar sort of humour and overall style is Saiki Kusuo No Psi-Nan/The Disastruous Life of Saiki K, it's a show with absurd humour too but...doesn't rely in one sort of joke through most of it's run like Sakamoto does.I may sound harsh, but don't think the show is really horrible or anything, just a bit of a drag. My biggest issue really is that it just overstays its welcome, I do believe there could be a bunch of people out there who'd like it. doesn't rely in one sort of joke through most of it's run like Sakamoto does.I may sound harsh, but don't think the show is really horrible or anything, just a bit of a drag.

Haven’t you heard? Sakamoto happens.This short but sweet comedy anime focuses on one gimmick only. Sakamoto being absolutely perfect in every situation, and his interactions with his classmates. It may seem like after some time, the anime loses its charm as the plot keeps on repeating, but fear not. The 12 episode limit keeps the pace steady. The story never gets boring or stale. Good soundtrack which incorporates jazz (obviously) keeps the anime smooth. The comedy is going to have you question “how does Sakamoto get out...of this one” in second half of the anime. And it’ll keep surprising you and make you laugh. A lot. My only complaint is that the show for me lacks rewatching value once you’ll see how Sakamoto overcomes his situations in the most perfect manner possible. But for one time only it’s a great ride.Production remains good. Animation looks great. Only flaws I saw were some CGI shots later in the series but they are so brief that you have to search for them in order to find them.Voice acting is on point on the male side. The female side lacks a little but considering context of the show (females being mainly fangirls of Sakamoto and not having any MAJOR role in the story outside of trying to get his heart I can understand that producers weren’t trying to have vast and diverse cast)Before you’ll know it, it’s going to be over.

Saw the first episode, I was like eh it's alright, it's just the first episode it should get better. Second episode, in terms of comedy just like the first, one scene that I thought was funny. So then I forced to watch episodes 3 to 5 in hopes that it would get better. It just didn't happen, sure there were a few funny scenes but then as each episode went by the anime just started to get more...and more ridiculous and that's when I realized. Sakamoto is like a character that I would have created in fifth grade which I sort of have when in class we were required to write. The humor is the same too, Sakamoto would have been the funniest thing in the world to me if I was back in fifth grade because I have written scenes where stupid and impossible things happen to make a main character look cool. What I'm trying to say is, characters who are perfect in every way are just really lame and not funny or cool. and more ridiculous and that's when I realized.

I’m Sakamoto (9/10): Woh! A 9 out of 10?! If you want to know more about my rating system check the video description. Now it is time to fumble over my words as I begin a potentially spoiler filled review.Words can very easily describe “Haven’t You Heard? I’m Sakamoto,” but the experience is something else entirely. The show has a fairly basic premise, attractive high schooler acts cool and people are jealous of him, and from watching Handa-kun this season I have learned that, that premise, while funny,...can’t lift a show to Sakamoto’s heights. What makes Sakamoto so great is that most everything Sakamoto does is not cool, in fact, it is downright crazy most of the time, but the best part about it all is that he does it with such conviction that those around him find it cool. It is a show that shows confidence can mean everything, but it takes it one step further and addresses more serious issues. Characters end up disliking Sakamoto because he represents something they are lacking, whether that is principal, hard work, or escapism Sakamoto not only points out their flaws but helps to correct them. What truly made this show a 9 rather than an 8 was the last four episodes. The issues characters were struggling with resurfaced and Sakamoto assisted them in finally putting them to rest. The final few minutes of the last episode had me in tears, as the class was saying goodbye to Sakamoto I knew I was as well, and their heartfelt farewell along with the uncertainty of the future was a truly touching sentiment. Also, Sakamoto is totally an alien. I called it in episode two after he said his “investigation was a success.” This idea was further strengthened by his interest in NASA and how he assists others in odd ways and displays inhuman physical abilities. Then at the end Sakamoto is called out for not actually leaving school to go work for NASA by the blond school thug and Sakamoto replies “I have no idea what you mean,” dodging the question.

The delinquents at first are oddly weird and stereotypical delinquents, but come Sakamoto, they get some odd quirks that give them some personality. As for Sakamoto\'s fangirls, their fawning/fighting over Sakamoto are again typical fangirling, but once Sakamoto gives them screentime, they get some character development, fangirl wise, Megumi Fujita gets the most development and screentime, as for the delinquents, Atsushi Maeda and his posse gets the most. Yoshinobu gets his own episodes with Sakamoto too and Yoshinobu gains a backbone. More LA talks about the the minor characters, the more LA thinks the minor characters gets MORE character development than Sakamoto himself.Which makes a good point, Sakamoto, being his perfect self in terms of personality or backstory, we actually hardly know much about him yet LA still liked Sakamoto even without that, (though LA suspects Sakamoto is an alien or one of those Parasites from Rick and Morty in Total Rickall) or something you wanna know why?, Sakamoto is a catalyst or a great punchline with the minor characters being the reactants to the utterly bizarre situations Sakamoto does, him being perfect or otherwise. It\'s some actually great comedy routine.Now LA keeps saying that Sakamoto is ""perfect"" and that actually comes out as a small detriment to this series as what LA was soo worried about this anime, since he\'s perfect, we\'ll know he\'ll always win in some bizarre way or another and LA will honestly say that not ALL of the skits in this anime will hit, mainly with ""Sakamoto vs. the delinquents"" skits comes off as bizarrely typical, where\'s it\'s comedy goldmine is when Sakamoto teams up with the delinquents (huh, double edged sword much?).Voice acting wise, well LA is gonna be honest here, Sakamoto\'s voice actor Hikaru Midorikawa is the utter ace in the voice cast (duhhh because he\'s the main character),but LA is such a sucker for almost all of Sakamoto\'s fangirls voice actors (Yukari Tamura, Kana Ueda, Yui Horie and LA\'s favorite from the fangirls Mai Nakahara).Animation wise, well Studio DEEN, if KonoSuba gave us ironically made animation but still made a great comedy, then Sakamoto desu ga, did a solid animation for a great comedy, everything from the aesthetics to character designs, animation...is something LA would praise it much like it\'s comedy.The ending gave something rather dramatic in for a slice of life comedy and....errrrrr...LA hate to admit it but *ahem* mood-whiplashing, however the ending stuck to it\'s typical flavour and bombastically weird execution that the ending was well a perfect end to the mysterious eponymous Sakamoto...........................he\'s an alien right?...RIGHT!??!?!?!Sakamoto desu ga? is another bright spot to Studio DEEN\'s catalog of great comedies of 2016 and with that it\'s utterly cool~ wouldn\'t you say Sakamoto?. only do wee see Sakamoto\'s perfect nature, but also from his female and male classmates as well, most notably Yoshinou Kubota voiced by Akira Ishida an incredibly shy classmate, Atsushi Maeda voiced by Tomokazu Sugita a former delinquent along with his posse, Yuuya Sera voiced by Showtaro Morikubo an odd delinquent, Megumi Fujita voiced by Mai Nakahara, Aina Kuronuma voiced by Yui Horie Yagi voiced by Hitome Nabatame and Mii-chan voiced by Kana Ueda are all Sakamoto\'s fangirls.

Is an anime I didn\'t really enjoy watching, but it also wasn\'t something that I needed to avert my eyes to.First off, there isn\'t any real plot to begin with, it\'s just Sakamoto\'s every day habits with the thoughts of the people involved in it, and it only gets interesting after an episode introducing a ""villain"" whereas, ploys to ""annihilate"" our Stylish MC.This is an anime that will really make you laugh at some point, the comedy is worth a watch, some conflicts are easily predictable and how the whole thing delivers is a bit generic, bad person realizes mistake, and Sakamoto...knew all along.One thing that I clearly love about this anime is most definitely, Sakamoto\'s way of dealing with problems, not only does he resolve them well, but he resolves them ""Stylish""-ly. As to what I hate, is how the supporting characters wrap stuff up, consider it as a ""Sakamoto Syndrome"" but I most definitely expected something better.Overall, this is an anime you can watch if you really RAN OUT of good animes to watch, but put in mind that is is also something you can\'t watch half-heartedly, some moments are actually good and worth your 25 minutes of viewing.

It could have easily been overlooked by me but after I saw Konosuba from Studio Deen I was really into watching their comedies. Sakamoto desu ga? did not dissapoint. It is a string of vignettes about the coolest guy in school. It's such a simple concept but the absurdist humor is what drew me in. The senarios where Sakamoto can be embarassed and how he saves himself by making it look cool is absolutely hilarious. Some vignettes are better than others that's for sure but there is so much charm that I really enjoyed it thuroughly. It's...goofy and silly but I enjoyed that. A great example of the absurdity is that a ghost pushes a mop bucket with a mop in it to Sakomoto to hit him. He jumps in the air and lands in it and begins riding it down the hallway looking cool as ever. While everyone is amazed at him and calling it a Segway scooter, even though it's a mop and bucket he's riding. It's shit like that, that's simple yet well executed and works well as a stupid joke but when watching it, it's very funny. MY friends and I saw the first episode together and were laughing so hard we had to pause the show. It was really something fun to watch and laugh with other people. Overall if you overlooked this show I wouldn't be surprised.

The story is depicting a not-so-average high school student by the name of Sakamoto.Sakamoto excels at everything he does and his surroundings are either absolutely taken away by it or hating his guts for it - both ways lead to interesting and funny plot twists throughout the story!Frankly speaking, I have never ever laughed so much watching anime. The story development is all about simple process consisting of just as simple but yet interesting and very humorous events that slowly lead up to the end of the...series.

This is the first anime I've completed in a few years now, though to be fair, that doesn't say much because I haven't watched anime since 2012 and even some of what I consider to be my favorite animes of all time I never actually bothered to finish to the end.I wouldn't recommend it for people looking for a real story line or any real character development, since the show runs with the idea of Sakamoto being perfect and sticks with it throughout, but if you're looking for a pretty light hearted comedic anime...for the purpose of being just that, you'll get quite some laughs out of it. The show is truly unique though, nonetheless, though I feel like it weighs in just a bit on certain anime stereotypes that work for it.I personally consider it a favorite of mine in the comedy genre. No, it's not the most memorable anime and not amongst some of the best, but it is highly enjoyable and different and for someone such as myself who is only just now kinda-sorta-maybe getting back into anime, it's good enough.There's also a very interesting and popular theory surrounding the ending and why Sakamoto is the way he is that I won't go into depth about as it may potentially spoil something. for the purpose of being just that, you'll get quite some laughs out of it.

But, it had a...few issues, more on that later.1.) Story.Sakamoto is nothing mind-blowing or intricate, it won’t alter your perception of humanity or give you some astounding revelation that will change you forever. Rather, Sakamoto works as an episodic comedy with continuity.Most of the comedy boils down to Swagamoto (I saw this name in another review, credit to whomever wrote it) being impossibly perfect, and due to this perfection some dunce(s) decides to outdo Swagamoto but ultimately gets defeated. That is Sakamoto in its entirety.Without visual accompaniment I can’t thoroughly describe Sakamoto’s brand of comedy without saying, “Crazy shit happens, and it’s obvious that the animators had loads of fun breaking the laws of physics, via Swagamoto’s undeniable swagger.”While this act remains funny throughout, some of Swagamoto’s antics can get tiring-seriously, what was up with Swagomoto constantly manipulating air?-especially when the punchline never changes. It can get boring admittedly, chiefly in the intermittent episodes (7 and 8 I think?).Nonetheless, it still remained interesting. I smiled at the secondary characters, and still enjoyed the majority of these ‘boring’ episodes.So, I award Sakamoto a solid 8/10 for story, only deducting two points for some repetitive humor, and the same punchline being recycled.2.) Characters.By far the most incredible thing about Sakamoto is humanizing its secondary characters. Unfortunately, this depth cannot be extended to Swagamoto himself, which, honestly is ok, that’s the joke anyway! He’s unbelievably perfect, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.With Swagamoto himself constantly giving life lessons, or bolstering a classmate’s confidence I thought for sure, “Ok, they’re going to pull in new retards each episode to look dumb for laughs. Got it.” But, no, that’s not the case. Sakamoto utilizes the same characters, giving them arcs and the needed depth to keep an anime afloat.There was a certain amount of intimacy I felt with these secondary characters due to their humanity.For Sakamoto’s characters I award a 9/10, deducting one point for Swagamoto’s character, or rather, lack thereof. Not saying Swagamoto himself isn’t a good character! Just that he lacks humanity.3.) Art.Impressive, very impressive, minimal frame stutters, and appropriate usage of still-frames. It’s a pet-peeve of mine for an anime to constantly use still-frames, so I was happy with the animator’s restraint on using still-frames.Never once in this anime was anything an eyesore, colors blended and fused nicely, characters looked proportionate, and the animation had fluidity to it.However, there was the occasional animation stutter, and in episode 9 I think (?) certain character’s had jarring micro arms, very unsettling.Character designs were also fantastic, props to whoever designed Swagamoto. He is an unbelievable caricature of every anime Gary Stu ever conceived. From his physicality to his demeanor, Swagamoto is an amalgam of every awful anime protagonist. Amplified by 10,000,000, then allowed to simmer in his swag.For art, I award Sakamoto an 8/10, deducting two points for those disturbing micro arms, and stutters.4.) Sound.Probably the most underwhelming aspect of Sakamoto is its music, specifically its reliance on Sakamoto’s theme, and a (funny) melancholic theme. Both are rather good pieces, setting the tone for scenes, but were used with such frequency that I grew tired of hearing the same notes.Couldn’t they have, I don’t know, at least altered segments of the music for the sake of variety?With that being said, I award Sakamoto a 7/10 for music, deducting three points for the repetition of these themes. You’ll find yourself laughing at these themes for the first four episodes, but soon after you will be annoyed.5.) Enjoyment.Personally, this is the funniest anime I’ve ever seen. This isn’t hyperbole, I’m not fanboying. This is the comedy to watch for the summer season.As someone who has watched loads of disappointing comedic anime that began promising but sizzled into nothing, Sakamoto is refreshing in its consistency of comedy.I, subjectively, award Sakamoto a 9/10. Deducting only 1 point for the intermittent episode’s being slower than their predecessors and successors.6.) Overall.Watch this anime if you enjoy comedy, specifically surreal comedy that works in the realm of nonsense.

And the always perfectly timed theme puts the right amount of energy into every scene.The simplicity of the story and the humor really gives works in the favor of the show. You never go in expecting to much and are pleasantly surprised when the show throws you a curveball.

Sounds like someone\'s full name or something that just doesn\'t click to us non-Japanese speaking viewers and yet this anime is very slice of life -like. To be honest it looks far too fashionable for what it seems on the google images. Dare I even say, it looks like an anime purely based for individuals who like slim, slender, elegant, glasses-wearing boys and yet this anime is what I dreamt to be when I was in school.Lets get down to the basics oh this anime: The story revolves around the main character (who happens to be presented in the...title) Sakamoto. We follow Sakamoto on this story of his daily life in high school and how he ""tackles"" the typical issues that occurs in said school. Now this is not much of a spoiler but Sakamoto is the coolest guy in the entire school. How do we know this, well in most episodes there is a ten second introduction where a very aged and experienced narrator takes his time to sit you down and just softly mention to you that Sakamoto is not only cool, but also cooler and coolest. This by itself is enough to take an interest in what this narrator has to show and that is only the first ten seconds of the actual anime.So what got me interested in this anime? Am I one of those individuals that I mentioned previously? Nope. What caught my attention was a single .Gif image where we see Sakamoto sitting on the open window sill after seeing his school desk and chair missing. The hooking part was when Sakamoto took his place at the window sill and the wind elegantly brushes his hair to revel the sophistication of this mysterious character who is Sakamoto. And if this is not enough to capture your attention, the stunning awe is reflected back onto the entire classes reaction as you can see the girls fall in love and the boys also falling in love and, or being jealous of the situation. To think this short five-ten second .Gif was enough for me to try out the first episode and I am so glad that I did.From this point, the story tells us about Sakamoto and his interactions with each character to show us how suave, resourceful and gentleman-like Sakamoto really is and how we can either fall in love with him too or aspire to be like him.So would I recommend this anime? Yes, if everything you have read previous to this has appealed to you. Or if you\'re interested in watching an anime which has comedic value, relatable scenes or able to take an anime which could be possible in the real world but is highly unlikely. At the very least I would recommend that you try at least one episode as the anime is a change of pace from most other animes, including the ones in its own genre.Happy watching. title) Sakamoto.

Coolest!""It\'s no secret that everyone, even those who think they\'re perfect, has at least one flaw, but to every rule (although it\'s not really a rule), there\'s always an exception. Who is that exception? Could it be a certain high school boy with glasses and a mole under his left eye? I\'ve known of the manga that contains such a person for a while now, and when an anime adaptation was announced, I decided to check it out. All I\'ve got to say is, ""It was fun while it lasted.""Haven\'t you heard, ladies and gentlement, of Sakamoto? Good,...because I\'m reviewing ""Haven\'t You Heard? I\'m Sakamoto"", known in Japanese as ""Sakamoto desu ga?""Haven\'t You Heard?

Needless to say, he instantly wins the hearts of girls and the jealousy of boys. Even in a tight situation, he emerges from said situation with elegance, grace, and, dare I say it, swag. Basically, this anime follows the (mis)adventures of Swagamoto - dang it, WHY CAN\'T I SAY SAKAMOTO PROPERLY - and his classmates throughout his first year of high school.The first thing about this anime I\'d like to take note of is its animation. I\'ve seen a decent amount of anime from Studio Deen, but this has to be some of the best animation I\'ve seen from them, with some decent character designs to go with it. The voice acting is pretty solid, too, especially Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto; his voice adds to Sakamoto\'s coolness. The ending theme, ""Nakushita Hibi no Sayonara"" by Suneohair, is a pretty beautiful song, but I personally loved the opening theme, ""COOLEST"" by Customi Z, even more. Pardon the incoming pun, but it\'s a really COOL song! ....Moving on.The story of this anime is pretty episodic, and they always seem to end with Sakamoto staying on top of things. It can get a bit repetitive at times, but luckily, this anime does shake things up a bit and keep it fresh. There are more funny and amusing moments than there are not, and I would either find myself grinning or laughing at times. As for the characters, some are likable, while some are characters I didn\'t care much for. If there was a character I had to pick as my favorite, it\'s Acchan; the fact that he\'s voiced by one of my favorite seiyuus aside, he was given a good amount of development.To tell you the truth, though, a major deciding factor of whether or not you can enjoy this anime is the likability of the main character, Sakamoto. The main point of this anime is that he has no flaws; a character with no flaws is considered a ""Gary-Stu"". If you can overlook that, Sakamoto actually turns out to be a very interesting character. He always kept others\' best interests in mind, and he turned some cliches on its head; those two factors kept me interested in his character. Sakamoto is also quite an enigma; I couldn\'t help but ask questions about who he actually is, especially toward the end.Haven\'t you heard? ""Haven\'t You Heard?

Sakamoto is also quite an enigma; I couldn\'t help but ask questions about who he actually is, especially toward the end.Haven\'t you heard? ""Haven\'t You Heard? I\'m Sakamoto"" is an enjoyable anime that I would recommend to anyone in the mood for a ""cool"" comedy. Anyone who watches this will know of the antics of Swagamoto!', '""Everything he does is COOL! COOLER! COOLEST!""Sakamoto is the perfect student. He is popular, handsome, intelligent, and everything else. He is the one everyone wanna be. Keep in mind that this is a comedy, it doesn\'t take the story seriously, after all it\'s just a story about a perfect guy.STORY - 4/10Even if this anime focuses on comedy, it still needs a story. Well, the story is NOT the point in this show. It\'s just as it is, nothing more, nothing less. If you\'re looking for an anime with a great story and turnabouts, watch Steins;Gate, because Sakamoto Desu Ga? is NOT for you.ART -...8/10One of the best points in this show! The style here is awesome! Well, if it will make you laugh, at least it will not be for being poorly done.SOUND - 8/10The sound and the soundtrack is pretty good here.

From washing plates to molding flour to everything you could ever imagine, he does all of it in the coolest way possible. Ladies-no, even males get enamored by this man\'s coolness it\'s so unfair! How could such a human being exist? No, wait, is he even human? Whatever his identity is, one thing\'s for sure. He\'s the one and only coolest guy that you will ever see in your entire life. What?! Who the heck am I talking about?! Haven\'t you heard about him?! I\'m talkin\' about SAKAMOTO!Sakamoto desu ga is an anime adapted from...a manga by Sano. I read a few chapters of it back then when it was still on its early stage and I found myself interested but a little disappointed due to the fact that the manga releases were quite few some years ago. And now it has become an anime and having seen that title, I immediately remembered and thought ""Wohooo...It\'s SAKAMOTO!"" except not! I wasn\'t really surprised given that I have read some of the manga chapters already and I found myself enjoying it at that time so adaptation was kind of imminent and hey, let\'s give this show a try and see if it\'ll manage to live up to my expectations(which were slightly above normal) and I needed some fun in my life anyway after so much depression Undertale caused me(ye ye I\'m a pansy and take games seriously). So with that, I started watching Sakamoto desu ga. Each episode contained two to three story sections and Sakamoto\'s the star,like always, which wasn\'t bad because I have to admit, he was truly a cool and a likeable guy but perhaps that\'s just what my girl hormones is trying to make me feel, anyway, he was so cool and so funny in everything he does that I always find myself laughing already even just upon hearing that goofy cool Sakamoto theme song that\'s played whenever he was now about to show an absurdly, ridiculous yet cool ""technique"" to end a problem in a very neat and again, a very cool way. Surely, you have noticed that I used the word ""cool"" excessively but I have to put so much emphasis to that because that\'s the point! You should watch this show just to see how COOL Sakamato is. Anyway, it\'s still early for you to get convinced so I will now further enhance my skills to GENUINELY convince you to watch it. Ehermm...You must be thinking that Sakamoto\'s only quality is his coolness...well, you\'re right, that could be his only quality but I have to say now, Sakamoto has become the star of the show only because of the strong supporting cast and add to that his coolness and Sakamoto desu ga truly became such an entertaining show that combined everything from comedy to little drama to some bittersweet romance - it was really a fun ride overall. Music department, hoho, proved to be quite commendable as well which I realized maybe too late? Anyway, about EXACTLY halfway of the show, I took notice of the variety of instruments used on the BGMs and they were handled greatly, not that I\'m a music hardcore fan, but I really found myself getting carried away by the arrangement and the scene made an even more impact to me than that in the manga. And since I\'m a piano fan, I also fell in love with the piano theme BGMs which thankfully, were quite a handful. And to ignore the supporting casts would be an act of heresy so I\'ll now tell you how amazing these people were and how they managed to be so likeable like the protagonist of the show. To make it clear and to avoid excessive spoilers, I\'ll just mention some few characters which I won\'t say if they\'re the best supporting casts or not. That\'s for you to figure out once you watch the show. So first we have Aina Kuronuma, a cute,conniving, seductive girl that likes Sakamoto, actually, almost everybody likes Sakamoto but that\'s not what I\'m trying to say. Given her characteristics, it was pretty much obvious that this girl is the type that acts all cutesy but beneath that veil lies an evil intent and you are correct. She really is a little bit of a sweet yet evil girl trope. Still, what\'s wrong with adding some ugliness? That\'s what humans are and the show never did shy away about the dark realities of life which made for an even enganging situation. Course\', Sakamoto Desu ga is not a dark, depressing show. So the characters will change from being a very despising person to a slightly less atrocious human being in the blink of an eye but the way it was done - it all felt natural. And with each last few minutes of each episodes, I found myself smiling telling to myself how Sakamoto ended everything so neatly and so heartwarmingly again. And again, with each few last minutes of each episode, the supporting casts were given some great character developments that I can\'t help but feel satisfied every week back when it was still ongoing. Yeah, also noone could ever forget Acchan(actually forgot his real name) - an ""uke"" ,hrm, clearly he\'s a freakin\' fujoshi bait! I have to admit he was a very funny guy and I can\'t help but pair him up with Sakamoto and Hayabusa or whatever and I must add, he\'s voiced by Gintoki\'s VA. Ahg, an eargasmic voice he has....OK.. Sorry, this is digressing too much. Anyway, Acchan was a delinquent and Sakamoto straightened him up. That will happen in the first episode so spoiled you there, but really, how Sakamoto changed him was what really mattered as it\'s golden. It\'s really funny remembering that scene what with the ridiculousness of Sakamoto\'s antics, they just never grow old even if you had anticipated it. The animation also did its job well. Cool, just like Sakamoto.Sakamoto Desu ga was truly an entertaining show. It was ridiculously hilarious, well deserved of its genre, and offers a variety of gags to keep it fresh even until the last episode. Impressively done cute dramas that never felt forced and heartwarming conclusions to every problems that arise in every episodes coupled with loveable casts truly make for a nice heartfelt experience that I haven\'t felt since a long time in my life. So surely you\'ve heard it clearly now, how COOL Sakamoto really is. a manga by Sano.

So surely you\'ve heard it clearly now, how COOL Sakamoto really is.', ""He's what every women wants and what every man wants to be... This is the very description of Sakamoto: the most swag anime character in all existence. And there's a reason why he's cool, cooler and coolest.Usually, perfect characters don't often get much attention. It's mostly written off as lazy writing. Characters like this are often called Gary Stu. These kind of characters are those who are good at everything without any explanation whatsoever. Usually, it's a bad idea to use these kinds of characters because they lose connection with the audience. But can we say that Sakamoto is a Gary Stu?Heck no!In truth, Sakamoto...is completely different from this stereotype. For one, he is not based on lazy writing. Since the series is a comedy, you'd expect a klutzy idiot to be the MC. But Sakamoto changed that idea. This show proved that you don't need a funny character to be a comedy. What's important is the impact it has on the audience. And this is what Sakamoto has shown us.And another thing: what makes him so cool is not his appearance or his style. It's his personality, his compassion and willingness to help his neighbors. This itself shows a strong message to the viewers: you don't need to look cool to be loved, you just need a big heart. And that 's what makes Sakamoto cool, cooler, coolest!I definitely recommend this to casuals and elitists alike. Even if you're not a fan of anime, I swear, you'll love this show. Because once you see it, you'll know who Sakamoto is. is completely different from this stereotype. For one, he is not based on lazy writing. Since the series is a comedy, you'd expect a klutzy idiot to be the MC. But Sakamoto changed that idea. This show proved that you don't need a funny character to be a comedy.

Because once you see it, you'll know who Sakamoto is."", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I would not consider myself a cool person. Nerdy, sure. Handsome, why not. (At least, that’s what my grandmother tells me whenever I see her.) But not cool.I’m not even kidding. Snowboarding is probably my coolest trait, and, even then, I cannot perform any tricks off ramps or rails for fear of hurting myself unnecessarily. (Falling on my bum is enough pain for me).Although, after watching Sakamoto desu ga?, I may not be as uncool as I once thought.STORYSakamoto has only one star: Sakamoto. In short, he is beyond stylish. And that’s what the anime...almost exclusively focuses on. For twelve straight episodes, Sakamoto (the show) proves why Sakamoto (the man) is the coolest dude to ever live.He doesn’t just play an arcade whack-a-mole game; he plays Bach as he hits the different heads.He gets himself sent out into the hall while in class – to feed and protect a dying baby sparrow.He picks up a girl’s eraser, uses it furiously, then gives it back, allowing the girl to calm down her nerves and warm her hands from the heat created by the intense friction.Obviously, there are way too many instances to list because, to reiterate, the anime is literally all about Sakamoto being insanely cool ad infinitum. Which leads into the show’s most arguable aspect: the main joke itself.On the one hand, the audience always “knows” what’s going to happen. It doesn’t matter if the situation looks completely grim, if Sakamoto is doing something weird, or if nothing is happening at all. The show will make sure that the coolest guy ever is the coolest guy ever. In this way, the anime loses out on suspense and intrigue since the outcome is already “known” beforehand.On the other hand, this joke is the whole point of the show. It’s obvious that the anime will not be doing more than making Sakamoto out to be a cool cat, so it is almost unfair to expect anything else to happen. Plus, the anime does a nice job of spinning the mundane scenarios that Sakamoto finds himself in with crazy yet plausible coolness.Disregarding the contention of repetition, Sakamoto does choose to follow some questionable routes.For instance, the entire subplot with Fukase is odd. Having this antagonist appear way too late into the season is one issue, but it is his conclusion and relation that creates the biggest head-scratcher.As has been mentioned many a time already, Sakamoto is an anime about a super-cool dude. By extension, it’s also about how everyone else views him as cool, too. But not Fukase. He never actually concedes to Sakamoto’s coolness, “losing” by trickery and betrayal. In other words, the anime fails to fulfill its promise that Sakamoto is, in fact, the coolest dude around (to everybody else).The show also has the problem of regressing on its already-finished outcomes. Characters that were helped, such as Atsushi and Yuuya, are affected by Sakamoto’s cool aura, but the anime will later choose to have these same people go against Sakamoto again, removing the purpose or impact of their earlier interactions with the king of cool.Ambiguity in the ending also does not help the anime’s execution. His leave comes out of nowhere, and his sentimental appeal is lost on the audience since he never really seemed to connect with any of the other students emotionallyBut when all is said and done, Sakamoto has an underlying message that may not be clear since it is hidden behind the comedy and these problems.Once again, Sakamoto is no doubt a cool guy. But what makes him cool? Is it those quirky moves that he employs from time to time? Is it those girls that constantly flock around him? Is it his general demeanor?No. It is none of those qualities.It’s true that Sakamoto kicking a rock along a slanted ramp while defying gravity is cool. Him defeating one of the bigger punks of the school at a game of pushing sumo makes him cooler than most. But what makes him the coolest is his friendship with Kubota, his way of inspiring others to be better people, and his general sense of selflessness.That is, what’s coolest is being a genuinely good person. And that, if nothing else, makes the narrative a meaningful one.ANIMATIONMuch of Sakamoto finds itself with mixed art and animation.Art-wise, the show succumbs to its boring setting. The school and nearby town do not lend themselves to immense creativity and, as a result, the anime fails to be captivating visually.Granted, it does what it can. Sakamoto’s different “secret techniques,” such as “Sleepover PE” or “Wind with No Destination (Straw Cigarette)”, add some much-needed flair with sparkles, colors, and a display of words. Furthermore, a lot of Sakamoto’s different actions are given better lighting, accentuating the “holiness” that Sakamoto seems to exude.The character designs likewise meet a mixed fate. To be fair, they are what they should be: realistic, plain people. But they don’t do much to appeal to the audience. The exception, of course, is Sakamoto. The mole near his eye, his toned physique, his proper outfit, his tallness, and his sharp features turn him into the attractive, cool man he is supposed to be.To be fair again, the other characters are not without their own physical traits. Indeed, Kubota’s squat face or Yuuya’s big belly highlight Sakamoto’s design that much more. But it is hard to see their designs as anything more than passable.Actual-animation-wise, Sakamoto performs similarly. Perhaps obviously, the anime reserves most of its movement and resources for Sakamoto’s various exploits. Jumping onto debris in a swift river, competing in a snowball fight, and parachuting out of a window using a makeshift device are just some the many events involving Sakamoto that get animated throughout the season.Meaning, everyone who isn’t Sakamoto has seen better days. Lots of streaky backgrounds, non-moving bodies, and general nuance (such as eye and hair shifts) are hardly seen from the side characters.Although even Sakamoto cannot evade the low-quality animation hammer. Cleaning the ceiling while avoiding the dust that falls is given multiple still shots to mirror movement, and creating centrifugal wind through a video-rental store sees a similar effect. These examples, however, can be forgiven since they are used for cool, comedic effect.CHARACTERSThere’s not a whole lot to say about Sakamoto’s characters. And this void leads to both intentional and unintentional outcomes.Looking at the side characters first, they are more or less a single trait, missing out on characterization let alone development. Kubota is the loner. Kakuta is the mean teacher. Kuronuma is the popular girl. And so on and so forth.Their singular purpose is to demonstrate that Sakamoto cannot be phased, cannot be thrown for a loop, and cannot be anything but cool.Which works. It’s fun seeing Sakamoto one-up the college students, and it’s hilarious to watch the mean ring-leader unable to cope with Sakamoto’s insane attention to servitude.Unfortunately, the anime pays a price for only having its side cast exist under the same category: severely unengaging personalities. They simply lack the necessary intrigue to make them worthwhile characters – both for the audience and for the show itself.As for Sakamoto, surprisingly, next to nothing is given about him. Kubota even makes a comment about this – that he barely inquired about the coolest dude in the world. Because he didn’t, the audience likewise knows very little about Sakamoto. His family. His interests. His overall feelings as a person. Nothing is given.This lack of information creates mystery surrounding his origins and self in general, fueling his cool flame further. Plus, the adage “actions speak louder than words” work wonders here to visually demonstrate who and what makes up Sakamoto.The only other tidbit about the characters that could be said is through the reversal in their juxtaposition.To reiterate, almost all the side characters exist to make Sakamoto look cool. Simultaneously, Sakamoto exists to make the side characters also look cool.For example, Sakamoto using his “gun” to diffuse the balloon situation allows the two male students who framed him to reveal their true feelings. Another example is Sakamoto taking the time to not only serve as Hayabusa’s arms and legs but also to act as the face-forward decoy. Yet another example is Yuuya undressing himself to take embarrassment away from Yagi after his shoelace-tying plan against Sakamoto worked a little too well.In this way, the anime is essentially expressing the notion that everyone can be cool. Obviously, nobody can be as cool as Sakamoto, but, after what they see of him, how they are affected by him, it becomes clear that being cool is not just reserved for the NASA-aspiring man.SOUNDArguably speaking, the opening track of Sakamoto is its strongest facet. The triumphant tone of the piece, created by the resounding drums and loud guitar, fits easily amidst the triumph that Sakamoto so regularly champions. The chanting of “cooler, coolest”, the rising lyrics in the middle, and the overall catchiness of the piece make it a (appropriate enough) cool OP.The ending track should not be overlooked, however, for it is just as strong of a song. The slow, calm pacing contrasts with the OP but coincides with many parts of the anime. Because coolness, both in action and in name, entails a sense of chill. The vocalist does well, and, once again, the track is quite catchy (and fun to whistle to), so the ED ends up as another solid addition to the musical lineup.The rest of the original soundtrack is unlike the OP and the ED in that the tracks themselves are not all that interesting. But they do follow the main motif of the show: coolness. Lots of jazzy tracks and rich tunes, filled with saxophones, trumpets, wind instruments galore, inject even more coolness into the anime.Finally, voice acting sees no notable performances except for perhaps Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto and Akira Ishida as Kubota. While neither of them have any stand-out moments, the former’s composed delivery and the latter’s nasally voice fit their respective characters well.ENJOYMENTWhile the repetition in the joke was evident, I never felt as though it were an issue.Instead, I was laughing at the silliness of it all. Sakamoto riding a mop-and-bin like a Segway. All the girls during art class rushing to get near his side to draw and be drawn by him. The insane ability for him to create subliminal effects in fractions of a fraction of a second. Yes, it was “all the same,” but I still smiled regardless.Although it wasn’t all smiles. I do wish there was more to Sakamoto than what was given. Maybe exploring that romance angle or maybe showing more of his thoughts in general. To be fair, having him end up with anyone would, in some sense, take away part of his coolness, and monologuing would defeat the surprise in the solutions he comes up with. But I still would have liked to have seen more.My biggest gripe, however, was Kubota’s mom. Simply put, I was not a fan. At all. She was a creepy character who got too much screen time (time that could have been used to introduce another new person instead) for my liking.Even so, she wasn’t enough on her own to completely take away how entertaining it was to see these slice-of-life moments taken to the “extreme.”Sakamoto desu ga? gives an answer to its question. The story’s theme on coolness, the strong OP and ED, and the comedy itself are positives worth noting. But the lack of an interesting side cast, the low animation, and a certain mom are negatives also worth noting. Still, it’s a cool time nonetheless (even without any snowboard tricks).SUMMARYStory: Fine, while problems exist in terms of the content and its delivery, the overall message on what is actually the coolest makes the show into more than just a comedic outingAnimation: Fine, mixed artistic direction, character designs, and actual animationCharacters: Fine, the side cast are severely unengaging, but Sakamoto’s lack of details strangely helps, and the theme on everyone having the potential to be cool is not lostSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Kubota’s mom was creepy, but the “extreme” slice-of-life events were still a lot of funFinal Score: 5/10 almost exclusively focuses on.

Perhaps obviously, the anime reserves most of its movement and resources for Sakamoto’s various exploits. Jumping onto debris in a swift river, competing in a snowball fight, and parachuting out of a window using a makeshift device are just some the many events involving Sakamoto that get animated throughout the season.Meaning, everyone who isn’t Sakamoto has seen better days. Lots of streaky backgrounds, non-moving bodies, and general nuance (such as eye and hair shifts) are hardly seen from the side characters.Although even Sakamoto cannot evade the low-quality animation hammer. Cleaning the ceiling while avoiding the dust that falls is given multiple still shots to mirror movement, and creating centrifugal wind through a video-rental store sees a similar effect. These examples, however, can be forgiven since they are used for cool, comedic effect.CHARACTERSThere’s not a whole lot to say about Sakamoto’s characters. And this void leads to both intentional and unintentional outcomes.Looking at the side characters first, they are more or less a single trait, missing out on characterization let alone development. Kubota is the loner. Kakuta is the mean teacher. Kuronuma is the popular girl. And so on and so forth.Their singular purpose is to demonstrate that Sakamoto cannot be phased, cannot be thrown for a loop, and cannot be anything but cool.Which works. It’s fun seeing Sakamoto one-up the college students, and it’s hilarious to watch the mean ring-leader unable to cope with Sakamoto’s insane attention to servitude.Unfortunately, the anime pays a price for only having its side cast exist under the same category: severely unengaging personalities. They simply lack the necessary intrigue to make them worthwhile characters – both for the audience and for the show itself.As for Sakamoto, surprisingly, next to nothing is given about him. Kubota even makes a comment about this – that he barely inquired about the coolest dude in the world. Because he didn’t, the audience likewise knows very little about Sakamoto. His family. His interests. His overall feelings as a person. Nothing is given.This lack of information creates mystery surrounding his origins and self in general, fueling his cool flame further. Plus, the adage “actions speak louder than words” work wonders here to visually demonstrate who and what makes up Sakamoto.The only other tidbit about the characters that could be said is through the reversal in their juxtaposition.To reiterate, almost all the side characters exist to make Sakamoto look cool. Simultaneously, Sakamoto exists to make the side characters also look cool.For example, Sakamoto using his “gun” to diffuse the balloon situation allows the two male students who framed him to reveal their true feelings. Another example is Sakamoto taking the time to not only serve as Hayabusa’s arms and legs but also to act as the face-forward decoy. Yet another example is Yuuya undressing himself to take embarrassment away from Yagi after his shoelace-tying plan against Sakamoto worked a little too well.In this way, the anime is essentially expressing the notion that everyone can be cool. Obviously, nobody can be as cool as Sakamoto, but, after what they see of him, how they are affected by him, it becomes clear that being cool is not just reserved for the NASA-aspiring man.SOUNDArguably speaking, the opening track of Sakamoto is its strongest facet. The triumphant tone of the piece, created by the resounding drums and loud guitar, fits easily amidst the triumph that Sakamoto so regularly champions. The chanting of “cooler, coolest”, the rising lyrics in the middle, and the overall catchiness of the piece make it a (appropriate enough) cool OP.The ending track should not be overlooked, however, for it is just as strong of a song. The slow, calm pacing contrasts with the OP but coincides with many parts of the anime. Because coolness, both in action and in name, entails a sense of chill. The vocalist does well, and, once again, the track is quite catchy (and fun to whistle to), so the ED ends up as another solid addition to the musical lineup.The rest of the original soundtrack is unlike the OP and the ED in that the tracks themselves are not all that interesting. But they do follow the main motif of the show: coolness. Lots of jazzy tracks and rich tunes, filled with saxophones, trumpets, wind instruments galore, inject even more coolness into the anime.Finally, voice acting sees no notable performances except for perhaps Hikaru Midorikawa as Sakamoto and Akira Ishida as Kubota. While neither of them have any stand-out moments, the former’s composed delivery and the latter’s nasally voice fit their respective characters well.ENJOYMENTWhile the repetition in the joke was evident, I never felt as though it were an issue.Instead, I was laughing at the silliness of it all. Sakamoto riding a mop-and-bin like a Segway. All the girls during art class rushing to get near his side to draw and be drawn by him. The insane ability for him to create subliminal effects in fractions of a fraction of a second. Yes, it was “all the same,” but I still smiled regardless.Although it wasn’t all smiles. I do wish there was more to Sakamoto than what was given. Maybe exploring that romance angle or maybe showing more of his thoughts in general. To be fair, having him end up with anyone would, in some sense, take away part of his coolness, and monologuing would defeat the surprise in the solutions he comes up with. But I still would have liked to have seen more.My biggest gripe, however, was Kubota’s mom. Simply put, I was not a fan. At all. She was a creepy character who got too much screen time (time that could have been used to introduce another new person instead) for my liking.Even so, she wasn’t enough on her own to completely take away how entertaining it was to see these slice-of-life moments taken to the “extreme.”Sakamoto desu ga? gives an answer to its question. The story’s theme on coolness, the strong OP and ED, and the comedy itself are positives worth noting. But the lack of an interesting side cast, the low animation, and a certain mom are negatives also worth noting. Still, it’s a cool time nonetheless (even without any snowboard tricks).SUMMARYStory: Fine, while problems exist in terms of the content and its delivery, the overall message on what is actually the coolest makes the show into more than just a comedic outingAnimation: Fine, mixed artistic direction, character designs, and actual animationCharacters: Fine, the side cast are severely unengaging, but Sakamoto’s lack of details strangely helps, and the theme on everyone having the potential to be cool is not lostSound: Fine, good OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Kubota’s mom was creepy, but the “extreme” slice-of-life events were still a lot of funFinal Score: 5/10', ""I am Sakamoto is a humour-based anime.This was an interesting one for sure. For one, when I started the show, I was very very intrigued to say the least due to the fact that usually you would get an MC who is not perfect but would have character development.Here, it is the opposite, you get an MC that is perfect from the get-go and you get almost no character development. This is one of the reasons It led to its downfall but I will get into detail on that later on.The good:The Humour. The humour is very subjective, but for the most part I...liked it. It had a very natural feeling even though everything about the MC was unnatural at best. But other than him, you would feel like there is that sort of guy in every class and many of us would witness that when went to school. The actual humour is nice with some jokes hitting hard. It was not consistent humour like Nichijou or Saiki K, but it was nice nevertheless.The Music: OP and ED was nice. The background music as well. All evidence of a higher-quality anime.The Animation: Also nice. With Sakamoto's insane movements, the scenes are all animated nicely. Similar animation to Saiki K I would say.The Supporting Characters. The supporting characters, mostly the guys I'll be honest, were good. Almost ALL the supporting characters had real character development and went on to have nice stories of their own. It is very refreshing as most animes do anything but notice supporting-characters actual plots and stories. Here, the supporting characters had more screen-time and character development than Sakamoto himself which is interesting, but good for the side characters! Especially last episode, it was good.The Bad:Sakamoto was so annoying at times it was insane! Half the time I liked him, half the time he was so annoying. I know we might have perfect people, but even perfect people here would have imperfections, or something that they would like. Saiki K for example, went crazy for pudding and even he had 'friends' of his own which sometimes he enjoyed hanging out with.Here? He seems like he is unreal. He almost never thinks he is enjoying himself interacting with people and he has an ego thinking that he is benefitting other people with his own interactions it is beyond deranged mental psychopathic behaviour and is frankly quite appalling.He also has ZERO character development. Nothing. Nothing changed with him. From the moment he set foot in that classroom to the end, NOTHING about him changed it is insane.Finally, the last episode you were supposed to 'dislike' Acchan, yet I sympathize him once he stopped being a delinquent. I mean he was trying to hang out with Sakamoto and teach him a few things. Like man Sakamoto can be humble at least once right? For the benefit of people around him?Instead he was just being a pretentious douche and being himself like always. He is akin to a living AI and is actually not a real person. I would not be surprised if he was just programming himself everyday.Consensus:All in all, it was an okay series. Forgetting the Sakamoto mishaps, half the episodes were incredibly boring and the other half was surprisingly entertaining. You NEVER know what you will get.Pick your poison here, and enjoy the show if you can endure the other half that is frankly awful.Final Score: 5/10Thanks!-CyanCheetah liked it.

In each story segment, Sakamoto solves some sort of problem, which becomes a lesson his antagonists have to learn.

That was what we were learned when we were small children. However, this statement is proved false, with Sakamoto proving otherwise. In the world of Sakamoto desu ga? we explore the life of Sakamoto, showing us the very definition of cool.In my opinion, comedy anime never need an amazing story. They just need to have good reasons to make us laugh. Although the story isn\'t the most original, it is certainly good. To have the perfect person encounter the different problems people bring onto him was a good story that brought hilarious over-exaggerated events. To keep it simple, the...story is good, not amazing, but is enough to make anyone (relatively) laugh hard.On the technical side, the overall quality was good. The sound wasn\'t amazing, but it definitely wasn\'t bad. Overall, the sound was good. On the art and animation sides, it was really good. In most cases, it was okay, with the usual animation we see in other anime. However, when it is time to show the coolness of Sakamoto, the animation skyrockets. Everything suddenly becomes more intense, and the animation helps showcase that. Overall, the art and animation is decent for most of the time, but have some ""sakuga"" moments that help to show how cool Sakamoto is.When talking about characters in Sakamoto desu ga?, the first character we would think of is Sakamoto. However, if you didn\'t know, there are other characters in this anime (Wow, who would have known! My mind is blown!). Despite having the whole series revolving around Sakamoto, the characters are just as interesting, and do have a bit of development to them. Many side characters are fun to see react to the crazy things Sakamoto pulled off. As for Sakamoto, he does not get any development, as there is nothing to develop. He is just too perfect to be changed. While some may think that is a problem, thinking that he will eventually become a boring character, which is not entirely false, but can be forgiven because of his coolness. Overall, the characters good, with some of the supporting getting a bit of development.Are you familiar with a decrescendo? If not, it is a decrease in loudness, mostly used in music. That is a reflection of my laughter. I started this anime with a laughter at ff, or fortissimo. After a few episodes, the decrescendo was dropped on, reducing my laughter to small giggles. If you didn\'t understand that, it basically means that the jokes started becoming repetitive, making them somewhat predictable, and not making them have the full effect they would have initially have on me. However, that does not mean that the anime will be boring by the end. There will always be a few surprises awaiting inside an anime. Once those are revealed, be ready to laugh.

Apparently he\'s such a perfect guy that even a ghost confessed to him. No I\'m serious! They even showed me the pictures. Who\'s the perfect guy you say? Haven\'t you heard? He\'s Sakamoto.Sakamoto desu ga? Well I bet a huge portion of you know him. A highschool slice of life comedy that tells the daily life of a young, aspiring, passionate student Sakamoto. There is almost no story being told here, well it\'s about highschool and there\'s the slice of life genre, of course there isn\'t much story to be expected, it\'s actually...really simple, it\'s about Sakamoto, do I have to say more?The art style doesn\'t really hit me that much, sure it is more unique than the typical anime I\'ve seen, it is just not appealing enough to me, nevertheless it attracted people into watching it for its quirky art and seperates it from the normie looking anime, so I would say it\'s done its job. The animation budget is way over the top, I can see it now, two drunk coworkers at night deciding what is the best way to make a highschool boy more interesting than he is, the other guy was like, ""Bruh, have you even watched Nichijou?"" and then the other guy was like, ""Say no more fam!"" very smooth animation with comic style slides delivered a very strong punchline everytime a joke happened.I frickin love the music and the audio overall, especially the opening. Nothing gets you pumped for a hilarious show than the opening for Sakamoto desu ga? The song, man it is catchy, even a year past and I still can hear the rhythm in my head, it\'s even more so memorable with the opening scene, I could place it side by side with the ending of Danshi koukousei no nichijou, and that means a lot coming from me.The characters vary from one to the other, and get this, it actually has character development! Can you believe it, a highschool anime with actual character development!? Everyone slowly changes from the influence of Sakamoto, even the bad guys, I would say Sakamoto\'s best friend changes a LOT throughout the anime, the special episode could really confuse you if you\'re not familiar with him enough.Overall the anime was lighthearted, cheerful and a fun show to watch to pass the time, or a day.... I doubt there will be a season 2 but we all hope it would happen, however with the ending of the show, it would ruin the punchline, so I\'m kind of 50/50 with that thought.You all might think I\'m crazy and full of it, but one day, when you call Sakamoto, you will get a call from me instead.

SAKAMOTO, LET ME WORK FOR YOU! I HAVE FOLDABLE THUMBS!', 'Sakamoto desu ga? brings something new, to the veritable buffet table of comedy anime.  In a world filled with awkward protagonists, bumbling sidekicks, and simplistic humor, Sakamoto desu ga? manages to stir things off by doing the exact opposite, and manages to stick out from One Punch Man, despite the two having a relatively similar bases.  Sakamoto desu ga? stars Sakamoto (obviously), a man who has no flaws, and makes no mistakes.  You drop your books near him, he\'ll catch them all before they hit the ground.  You tie his legs together before a race, he\'ll gallop on all fours with...more poise then you ever could.Such an anime seems like it would get boring quite quick.  A perfect protagonist, after all, cant really grow.  And here\'s where the similarity with OPM is most significant.  Both tell the story of their protagonist through the side characters.  In OPM most of it\'s about the public not recognizing Saitama, and how other heroes cope with his superiority.  In Sakamoto desu ga? it\'s about the other students, and how they deal with this ""freak"".  However the similarities end shortly after, with OPM delving into juxtapositional comedy, and Sakamoto desu ga? focusing on more altruistic, almost philosophical comedy.The art and sound are relatively standard for the most part.  When it wants to, Sakamoto desu ga? can hit you with some beautiful visuals, or masterful songs and dialogue.  However those moments are reserved, and given as ""rewards"" for reaching the climax of a story.My main issue with Sakamoto desu ga? is the story structure.  Each episode is broken into 2-3 ""parts"", with each part being ~10 minute ""adventures"".  While this is great for comedy, it\'s very hard for the show to develop many characters, as they simply don\'t get enough screentime.  This leads to Sakamoto desu ga? at times feeling void of personality, but that almost never detracts from the comedy within.All in all I loved Sakamoto desu ga?, and it\'s a show I sincerely enjoyed.  The humour was spot on, it was just light enough while remaining serious on some issues, and Sakamoto was amazing, without feeling robotic or devoid of humility.

A premise is different from something with a continually progressing story, which is a plot. It must've been difficult to make a decent/good anime with a premise as shows like that can't make it that far for someone with my attention span. I have a very short one. So your premise needs to set your series up for success. At first I thought it was going to be a harem about a perfect man,...but I was wrong.He is a stylish and perfect character and is almost always alienating people around him as his perfection seems a little inhuman for the standard high school boy.This premise set the show up for success because it knows that he is perfect. It isn't like Kirito from SAO that is like, ya know, god. Wanna know why that was bad? Cause they expected you to take it seriously!Because of this, Sakamoto Desu Ga? is entertaining as it nails into your head that nothing should be taken seriously and doesn't mock your intelligence when it does nail the fact in your head.Visuals: 8This art is...really pretty. It sets a little bit more for a standard for normal TV anime especially one that takes place in high school and during freeze frames I like pausing my screen to stare at it's prettiness and the animation flows and moves just a tad bit more than the standard as well.Sound: 6I like the main theme often playing when Sakamoto shows off his style and other songs. I like the OP and ED though I wouldn't listen to it on my own. The voice acting is decent at best and the voices fit their character and I just enjoy it.Character: 8I love these characters. Not really Sakamoto. I feel like Sakamoto is there as a way of developing and helping us to get to know these characters.I can sympathize with a lot of the characters as a lot of them seem really depressed until Sakamoto comes into their life which is kinda heart warming. It reminds me of the first few seasons of Spongebob Squarepants.Sakamoto himself makes me happy because despite being perfect, he is so inhuman and alienating to so many people. I like that concept.Enjoyment: 9What you all came for is the comedy and you can enjoy it no matter what element you're seeking from Sakamoto Desu Ga(?). It is random. It is whacky. It is weird.We have an element of surprise which makes comedy, well, comedy. Fart jokes are never enjoyable when you predict them and they've been on the screen the whole time, but when you surprise a viewer with one it can make them laugh, especially in a relatively normal scene.In every joke and tangent we get surprise making the sometimes immature jokes funny despite how childish they can be.Overall: 7Once again pretend there is a synopsis.

Had a great start to it and it was both funny and weird, but, the overall plot was boring, if there was a plot. I know they couldn't put much into 12 episodes, but they could have excluded some of the episodes since those episodes were either about characters that we never see again, or, had the same exact character development compared to earlier episodes.This anime would have done so much better if it had introduced Fukase earlier in the story, since he seemed to be the main antagonist. They only gave him so few episodes that I barely understood why...he hated or why he was still in school, since he could have graduated year(s) ago.The Characters were good and they stayed consistent too. The reason for their character development was Sakamoto, which is what made them and the story worse. After the sixth episode, I found this repetition to be annoying.The only reason I watched in to the end was because it was extremely unpredictable and the results were usually funny and made me feel better about myself. he hated or why he was still in school, since he could have graduated year(s) ago.The Characters were good and they stayed consistent too.

I\'m Sakamoto redefines the term ""eccentricity"".There is nothing too grand in scale when it comes to the story. Each episode contains at least two parts that entail different stories. Most of them are set in the school, while the others are outside of that setting. If it weren\'t for the fact that the series is a full adaptation of the manga (which only lasted a little over 20 chapters), I kind of wished there was more. everything that happens comes into play later in the finale, which I still liked. However,...I feel like a series such as this doesn\'t really need to have a definite ending and be more like several one-shot stories regarding the antics of Sakamoto. Other than that, it was still enjoyable.This show would not be what it is had it not been for the characters. In this, we have the main character, who is either the prime focus or a driving point for other characters. While I do love Sakamoto as a character, I also find myself loving the others that interact with him. We only focus on one class, which has most of our cast, and we get to see how well everyone acts as a class. It would have been boring if Sakamoto was the only person that had any real personality, so with the others in the mix makes it a good blend.I can\'t really say anything much about the animation. While, for the most part, being pretty well done, there\'s not a whole lot you can do with a school setting. There aren\'t any dazzling spectacles or any fantasy-like elements that sticks out. It\'s simple animation that fits with its type of setting.When this was announced, I decided to read the manga beforehand to see what it was like (I managed to finish with a couple episodes left), which got me excited for its premiere.

It's somehow an anime for grown ups, even if it's no sex involved.The characters are well done, even if their screen time is just too little to develop them. The only character with loads of screen time that doesn't evolve is Sakamoto, but that is because of the nature of the character in itself.This is one of those...animes that needs to be tasted by yourself before deciding to watch it or not.

For those who play RPGs you know that character creation is a balance, you can\'t have it all- well Sakamoto has it all; he has perfect strength, perception, awareness, intelligence, stamina, and even luck. This show is about him acting cool in all situations. If you take Onizuka\'s indomitable spirit from GTO and translate that into unshakeable coolness, that\'s this show.In my opinion, the show is definitely overrated. Though there are some neat moments, it was canceled out by the impractical nature...of the stunts and antics. If you\'re looking for someone to be envious about, this might be your show.

The show has an average amount of overall detail and shading. The background consists of urban landscapes and the school, with a surprisingly high amount of greenery. What makes the animation unique is a combination of the characters and special comic-like styling that occasionally appears. The character focus here is strongly on Sakamoto, and so it\'s probably on purpose that the other characters don\'t particularly stand out. Used to seeing girls with lots of accessories? Not happening here. Looking for moe in your girls? Not happening here either. Even the class idol Aina is toned down compared with your typical action-based harem heroine. As for the guys, you have everything from a chubby, girl-faced weakling to slit-eyed gangsters, you\'re not going to find any bishounens here.Sakamoto has a bit of action but nothing strong enough to call a defining characteristic. Expect a bit of violence and a bit of blood, but it still is just a school-centric slice-of-life so nothing too extreme. There isn\'t any ecchi here, if anything there\'s anti-ecchi in the form of many chubby, older married moms showing up and chasing after the protagonist.[b]Sound:[/b]Sakamoto opens with a rock-based, purposely made song; while unique, I liked neither the randomness of the melody nor the male singer. The ED has a better melody but is also slow enough to put even rowdy children to sleep.

He\'s the envy of everyone who wants to be cool given his talents in everything and so various classmates and other entities do their best to trip him up. Unfortunately, for them, he always seems to be able to outplay everyone, often converting them to his side in the process.The show is pretty episodic for the most part, often with two sub-plots per episode. Honestly, some of these sections are weird (Sakamoto playing walk on the line with elementary kids) and others are a tad off-putting (Yoshinobu\'s crazed mom). I didn\'t find have a particular arc that I thought was standout until the last quarter of the season, where a bit of tension finally builds in the show. There isn\'t much of a climax and the last episode wraps things up fairly nicely.The overall tonality of the show varies, much of it is rather light and playful but there are some serious moments as well.

He\'s everything you\'d want in a man. I didn\'t even say his name but you already know who he is. Sakamoto desu ga? is an anime about a first year named Sakamoto, and his daily misadventures through school life. But while it provides its comedic and dramatic moments, do they add up to make a great combination?Story: Being a school anime, the show is limited to ""follow a school calendar year"" type of thing. The story revolves around what time of year it is, and how relationships have been built up since the last episode. That mixture creates some of the...most interesting stories within the episodes. However, although interesting, there isn\'t much else besides Sakamoto\'s quirks that get through the entire show. That isn\'t bad, per se, but it doesn\'t help the story that much. Although this does occur, that doesn\'t make Sakamoto desu ga? any worse in terms of story, and helps it in some ways.Art: The art is pretty standard. Nothing much here.Sound: Sakamoto is chill, and that\'s reflected in his voice acting. Everything felt like it was the way it should have been, and even the scene in the last episode was voiced with emotion. That aside, we should talk about the opening. I love the opening. It doesn\'t fit the show at all in the way that it sounds like its for an action anime, but it\'s great nonetheless.Characters: The characters here are fairly bare-bones for some, but more fleshed out for others. In this show, it seems that there are more than just main and supporting characters due to how much his classmates are developed. Before getting to them, though, we should talk about Sakamoto and his friend Kubota. Sakamoto is literally a perfect person. That makes him a bit shallow, but the fact that he can be sent to the hall shows that even he has flaws. Since he is basically perfect, however, this makes him have all the traits you would expect in perfect people. It\'s a bit cheap, but that tactic makes you know everything about him, fleshing him out a lot. His friend, Kubota, on the other hand, has many insecurities. Out of everyone, he has the most character. He goes from someone who paid for protection to someone that actually had purpose and could do things his way. His character development became something that allowed for others to develop in a way too, which is a plus for this section. Sakamoto\'s other classmates are all special in their own way too, but they\'re only there to fill in the roles of a class. They all have one or two special traits to them, but they mostly aren\'t too important in the story.Enjoyment: Sakamoto desu ga? is a very enjoyable anime. The random parts of the calendar year all show up to make a fun story that is a good experience.Overall: Although some parts could be drawn out more or have more content put into them, this is a solid show in my opinion.

Don`t worry about the people who gives this anime a low ratingThe guy who gave this show a 4 is a Naruto fan so don`t expect much from him of background story about the main character but there is development when it comes to the relationship of Sakamoto and his classmatesArt           7Is not your moe-shit so that is a plusSound      8I did enjoy the op and ending of this anime and I found the background music of this show fittingCharacter  9This is the forte of the show the different personalities of the characters is what makes this show greatEnjoyment  7You may be wondering why I gave it a 7 but you have to remember they are episodes that can feel like a drag to watchOverall       8This show is not perfect despise having a perfect character but I can wholeheartedly recommend itPS.

It started off pretty amusing (I liked how the three boys were talking to each other while passing the ball at the end of the episode. OR was it the start? It\'s been so long since I watched this lol) and I was interested by Sakamoto\'s premise. He\'s the coolest boy in the school, so jealous people want to make him look un-cool....aannnd that\'s the whole twelve episodes.(spoiler: these jealous people usually end up going gay for Sakamoto)Although, there is a pretty interesting character who Sakamoto helps, named Kubota. He gets quite a bit of character development, since he goes from being bullied to getting a job at McDonalds and getting Sakamoto as a new friend. There\'s also an interesting episode where Sakamoto goes out of his way to help Kubota with a hair-related situation (I\'d go into more detail but that would be spoilers) and I really found myself loving Kubota as a character. Without him, the character rating would\'ve gone down significantly. I\'ve noticed that not many of the reviews here mention him, so I thought I\'d give him a special mention. Kubota\'s not perfect like Sakamoto, so it\'s kind of refreshing to have a character like him on screen.HOWEVER, there\'s a bit of creepiness with Kubota\'s mother having a really big crush on Sakamoto (there\'s even one episode where Kubota\'s mom dresses up as Kubota just so she can get close to Sakamoto... that episode was really creepy) which ruined the series a lot for me, if I\'m honest. The anime would\'ve been a LOT better without the whole \'my-friend\'s-mother-is-a-predator\' vibe it had going on. Without it, my enjoyment could\'ve been a potential 7, but it dampened my liking of the series significantly. It was basically normalising paedophilia, so I really couldn\'t get on board with those episodes... (and before anyone says that\'s \'normal\' in anime, maybe it is. Depends on the type you watch. But I watched this anime for \'slice of life\', not ecchi or whatever genre I can expect it to pop up in.)As you may have noticed, I only watched eleven episodes out of twelve. And to be sincerely honest with you, I don\'t even remember what happened in the eleventh episode. If I saw a synopsis, it would probably jog my memory, but as of now, I don\'t really remember that episode being \'memorable\'. This series isn\'t BAD, but it\'s just not interesting enough that I feel like it\'s worth watching to the end. I lost interest and read some posts about the last episode so that I would know what had happened without having to watch it.As for the art, I didn\'t notice anything wrong. Character designs are diverse and the animation seemed pretty good. I also liked the OP (and of course, Swagamoto\'s fantastic sparkles whenever he does something cool). There\'s not really much I have to say about it.The sound wasn\'t too memorable. Honestly, I can\'t even remember how the OP sounded. I remember the imagery for the OP, I remember how the OP played out, I just can\'t remember the actual song they had for the OP. So, you can see why the art is rated higher than the sound. I gave the sound a 5 since I remember the VAs were fairly good, I thought they suited their characters quite well.So, if you\'re trying to figure out whether to watch this series or not, it all depends on what you like. If you\'re coming from something like Nichijou, you\'ll most likely be disappointed. (If you haven\'t watched Nichijou, I suggest you watch that rather than Sakamoto Desu Ga. Nichijou is far more superior compared to this.) If you\'re a regular in the \'slice of life\' genre, give it a watch. You\'ll like it. Or if you\'re predominately a fan of sports anime like I am, it honestly depends on your tastes at the end of the day.This is by no means a bad anime, not at all. It\'s more or less due to the fact that I watched ""Sakamoto Desu Ga?"" alongside Nichijou, which I thought to be a lot superior compared to this anime. I was watching Nichijou a lot quicker than I was this anime, since it was honestly so BORING compared to Nichijou. That\'s probably why I never properly finished this anime.If you\'re going in with high standards, you\'ll find yourself a little lacking in excitement. But if you\'re just looking for something lighthearted or something to give you a quick laugh, go ahead and give Sakamoto Desu Ga a watch. The first episode was enough to get me watching almost the entire thing, if that makes you more inclined to watch it. aannnd that\'s the whole twelve episodes.(spoiler: these jealous people usually end up going gay for Sakamoto)Although, there is a pretty interesting character who Sakamoto helps, named Kubota.

Our protagonist is essentially a perfect Japanese dandy-man. He aces in studies and sports, is utterly popular among all the silly girls and boys, and can do anything at any moment and still be cool. Maybe I was biased because he reminds me of some of the cool kids in school while I was the so-so?And more than that, his sidekicks consists of a wannabe comedian/model (man, Shikamaru in the future really changed), a fixated girl who’d do anything to get his attention, and an unattractively pitiful weakling (I’d like to insist I...don’t relate myself to him, if it’s of any use…).Even the bad guys aren’t very interesting. Their motives seem to just revolve around getting a one up on him or to satisfy their own pride. The voice acting is average overall, though Mr Dandy’s is spot on. Not surprising, as the voice actor also plays Yoshino from Clannad, another cool dandy-like character. The animation is alright, I found it amusing how some characters are made particularly unattractive (no hate please, SJWs). Also a few parts just made me frown with disbelief.But yet, the way this dandy-man goes about his crazy days is hilarious, from simple things like putting out a fire and dramatic things like evading middle-aged cougars. Throw any problem at him, and he’ll resolve with such style and flair that you’d end up laughing at how absurd it is. Even normal stuff becomes hilarious when he does it. Like sweeping the ceiling, yeah, that’s right… the ceiling. And when things get real, it only gets better as almost all your expectations are wiped out by this guy.Anytime he speaks, you end up wondering more and more how on earth his mind ticks. And that only makes it all the funnier because while everyone else thinks and acts rationally according to their characters, he’s that wild card that you can bet would do something others would never consider. And when he decides to do something, everything ultimately ends up going his way in a manner that is not at all boring. Also, almost everything he says can be taken in multiple ways or has some sort of poetic ring to it. Very clever, very sly.While I did say that some voice acting could be better, the soundtrack fits perfectly. That jazz tune whenever he takes the spotlight is the anthem for this show, and the opening and closing songs are pretty good. This show throws some amazing curveballs at you. It’s great fun trying to think what on earth will happen, only to end up chuckling when it is revealed.And then comes the last episode, when for the very first time, we see our dandy man show real human emotions for just a few seconds. Beautiful, just beautiful.So, in short? He’s that creature Haruhi Suzumiya is seeking. He is Sasuke’s cool genius with Naruto’s spontaneous badassery. And, the only way I can justify the plausibility of his existence is to claim he is an alien, which has been hinted quite a few times in the show, especially regarding his dream career. Yes. He is an alien from the Citadel, sent to Earth to elevate humanity to a new level of evolution and discover the Charon mass relay.So if you’re looking for a good laugh and not an intricate plotline that involves flowcharts and relationship diagrams, this is for you. don’t relate myself to him, if it’s of any use…).Even the bad guys aren’t very interesting.

Sakamoto was a really great character as well, being quite mysterious and\xa0reserved, but also really involved and stylish, which makes him perfect for the prementioned trope. It also leads to a...lot\xa0of really\xa0solid\xa0comedy. The\xa0issue is that beyond that, it felt kind of weak. Sakamoto himself is cool, but beyond that he doesn\'t really have any character. Hence in terms of substance, the focus is on him interacting with others and\xa0their development in interacting with him. However, there\xa0really\xa0weren\'t any character arcs that were good, all of them feeling shallow. There were lots of great moments, but nothing substantial overall. And plot wise, that was it. There were some hints of a larger narrative with a villain, but that was resolved so easily at the end that it felt pointless. Beyond that, the ending was a pretty solid way to end things, focusing on everything that happened up to that point in regards to Sakamoto\'s class and how they grew, but\xa0ultimately\xa0I don\'t feel that\xa0growth\xa0was enough to support such an ending so it didn\'t really have all that strong of an impact.The OP was amazing, with a great song and awesome visuals. The ED was okay. The soundtrack wasn\'t particularly memorable outside of ""The Devil"" being used once.\xa0The\xa0art wasn\'t all that great. The animation was decent. Also, the OVA was half rehash and half just weird nonsense. lot\xa0of really\xa0solid\xa0comedy. The\xa0issue is that beyond that, it felt kind of weak.

I’m Sakamoto, the last anime that I watched to completion was about a year or two ago. For the past few years I have been making continuous efforts to try and get into back to watching a medium that I truly enjoyed and so I finally decided on watching this show. And in retrospect, because of this I may have set my expectations unfairly high because I found Haven’t You Heard; I’m Sakamoto as a somewhat fun however highly forgettable and very frustrating show.Contains Minor SpoilersStoryThe story of Haven’t You Heard? I’m Sakamoto Is about a near perfect high...school student, Sakamoto, and his schoolmates and classmates. The episodes are structured like western animated series where episodes are divided into two, sometimes three, segments where each segment contains its own story. I liked the idea of the story of a cool boy scout like character that is popular but that also butts heads with the people he interacts with a school setting. The story starts off pretty strong but struggles to maintain momentum as the show progresses. At the start, it is fun to see how the characters who dislike Sakamoto try to make him slip up and lose his cool in front of his class, yet Sakamoto manages to maintain his cool and suave demeanour and turns his adversaries’ plans on its head.However, the story veers off with this set up because you clearly cannot show a characters trying to maintain his cool while his classmates try to make him slip up for 12 episodes. However, thinking back, I would have rather have preferred that to a lot of what followed. Suffice to say, there is very little story in show. Without spoiling anything, one segment of an episode literally just revolves around Sakamoto walking. I’m not over exaggerating when I say that in one episode, the story is basically Sakamoto walking from Point A to Point B.You can watch the first two episodes of the series and then the final two and you would not miss anything important with everything in between feeling like filler. I have no problem with the structure of the show because there are animated titles that have 10 minute episodic segments where each segment has a beginning, middle and an end. And even if these shows do not have strong stories they make up for it with interesting and funny characters and good jokes and funny comedy. Haven’t You Heard? I’m Sakamoto rarely does and barely has any of these things.CharactersThe show’s setup has you believe that the world, and more specifically the school, wherein the story is set, is inhabited by really goofy, wacky and zany characters almost akin to the anime Cromartie High but not to such a large extent. There were some standouts like Kubota Shigemi and Sera Yuuya, however most of the cast is pretty uninteresting and boring. The novelty of seeing Sakamoto being perfect and cool wears off quickly because you know that he won’t slip up and that nothing bad will happen to him. There is no real character development for him or for most of the characters in the series.ArtIt is always difficult for me to review the art of an anime title when the animation looks just like so many other title. The art and animation was okay however later all of the characters started to look the same, especially the girls. It was just fine.SoundThere is one recurring gag that made me laugh or at least chuckle and it was an extremely melodramatic song from a favourite television show of one of the characters. This was used to milk dramatic and over the top moments for laughs and in these scenes and moments, it works really well and never got tiresome. The rest of the music was fine as was the voice work but that’s about it. Not much else to say.EnjoymentHaven’t You Heard?

Cool, Cooler , Coolest, all superlatives that describe this character, But:Storywise, for starters, it was quite unique, there is no plot just the character itself, in fact everything was made to revolve around this seemingly perfect character. so it was really good for it's uniqueness, but not that good in it's story telling scenario, then again it's a 7 over  for this category.Artwise, it was  decent, 4 over 10 to be exact,  enough to say the least, cu's you won't find anything naughty in here, except of course...for Yūya Sera in a black and white boxer......I can never understand as to why character designer Atsuko Nakajima have to illustrate  him as this fat slob in his boxers.Sound.......a 3 over 10 , since all the characters sounded like adults than teens. Plus the fact that I hate both opening and closing themes.Character, I gave it a 3 over 10, not because there is something wrong with the main character.....actually, that's just it, their is really nothing wrong with the main character Sakamoto that his character can be rendered as BORING, due to that fact that he can get away with anything and I do mean ANYTHING, so that's why life ain't perfect, cu'z it'll loose any reason to live. Basically the main character Sakamoto is actually an embodiment of Japan's  pursue of perfection, no wonder they're lives boring in reality.Enjoyment, well for the the 1st 7 episodes it was enjoyable, but since the anime was all about main character all momentum of interest over this anime has gone, that I've started to just skim the remaining episodes, also, since when did the concept of throwing pie at a top student who is leaving became a tradition, I mean where did writer Nami Sano and director Shinji Takamatsu got  such idea, does such thing really happens in real life in Japan's school? Or was it another misinterpreted western thing that the duo git when they saw some scene in Saturday Night Live?

Frankly, it’s easy to see why. We people naturally want what we feel is better for us, whether it be by improving one’s attributes, or even by obtaining the greatest and latest in, what we believe are, materializations of ecstasy. In a way, such a desire is carved into our genes, forming an inevitable instinct. As such, for centuries, the cycle of humanity’s longing for perfection has gone through constant loops without bearing sufficient enough fruit. Tidbits of the world’s history have accounted the presence of this cycle, both vaguely and...explicitly. Moreover, philosophers have long argued out with each other as to what exactly defines the concept of “perfection” we so seek. Yet, as more theories are regurgitated, more questions arise as to what can exactly be defined as “perfect”, so to speak. Is it found in the state of one’s being, our relationships with other people, or our accomplishments? Despite all our struggles at an attempt towards perfection and grasping its meaning, we’ll likely never reach the age in which we can present to our fellow homo sapiens what exactly defines our desires.Sakamoto of Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, has achieved that very perfection and other aspects of grand calibers in just his very state of adolescence. Undeniably, such is a feat that even the most epic of legends can ever hope to describe in bountiful analogical detail. Having attributes that are the equivalent to that of an omnipotent divinity, Sakamoto constantly excels at everyday difficulties with radiance and class. Dangerous obstacles pose no harm to a modest Sakamoto, quite the contrary. The very obstacles up against Sakamoto’s path rid of their malicious intents via reaching a transcendent of purpose upon the simple touch of Sakamoto’s graceful forgiveness. And very much like those purified obstacles which Sakamoto has benefitted, Sakamoto’s mere presence itself is akin to that of a magnificent fragrance that attracts all and transfigures us all. A mere walk taken by Sakamoto along a mundane park produces the blossoming of a multitude of flowers, along with the rising of the glorious sun. Those behind Sakamoto´s shadow gather around, praising his perfection beyond the extent that a theological figure holds. The rituals in which they participate in know no bounds; all are welcome in the hands of Sakamoto. Not that us plebeians can even absorb anything from Sakamoto\'s teachings without our sinful nature crawling its way out of us. Nonetheless, evidence of a blessing on humanity has never become as evident as Sakamoto\'s existence itself. Truly, there must be some kind of god out there. And that god, by all means, must be Sakamoto.Alright, let’s remove all the memetic mutations Sakamoto has formed and get real. Sakamoto Desu Ga?’s initial premise practically oozes out criticism in a single word: redundancy. After all, its primary genre is slice of life; a genre that invites viewers to immerse themselves into the tiny worlds of characters’ mundane lives. When taking this into consideration, redundancy is definitely a crucial flaw that can easily pry itself in at any moment. Sakamoto Desu Ga?’s premise of its titular character frolicking around as the participant of shenanigans in which he is a metaphorical god in is bound to get tiring fast. It practically discourages any curiosity one might have on wasting their time on a show in which aestheticism is the only thing going for it. In the end of the day, Sakamoto will always have a gallant laugh after having confronted a challenge, drink some wine on a refined glass, and indulge in luxury. And, even then, viewers cannot relate themselves to a being rid of flaws. Whereas disposable characters with the likes of Kirito or Kyousuke from My Little Sister Can´t Be This Cute are structured to be wish-fulfillment, Sakamoto doesn\'t provide any gaps in his existence that one can squeeze themselves into. If anything, watching Sakamoto\'s constant gaining of achievements as the sun sets itself invites irrationality. Whether it be from the fruitless task of watching Sakamoto reach new frontiers effortlessly or pure envy from a lack of understanding Sakamoto\'s divinity. Sakamoto\'s singular quirk of perfection just doesn\'t meet the requirements for enjoyment.Or so one would think after having read the synopsis on paper. I say this as I too was a victim of skepticism as to how exactly Sakamoto desu Ga would play out. Of course, you could always aim for the most obvious executions, such as making the most basic usage of Sakamoto\'s talent through the varying of situations. But with the haunting premise Sakamoto Desu Ga curses itself with, even such an approach isn\'t without its own flaws. The biggest challenge Sakamoto Desu Ga has to deal with is how it will fundamentally differentiate itself each time, not through the situations Sakamoto gets himself in, but rather on how its stylistic tone is each varying situation is implemented. Both as a parodic comedy that laughs at our existence, and as a stock gag series, it has to keep intact what makes it so thematically different without ever boring the audience. However, upon realizing this work was in the hands of Shinji Takamatsu, a director whom I believe is fairly brilliant when working with comedic anime, I knew I had nothing to fear. He\'s the very reason as to why Gintama gained the legacy it so holds today, discarding controversial opinions. And even without Gintama, the guy\'s handling of comedy has been shown to have, not only to be consistent but better throughout the years. Sakamoto\'s premise is by no means a factor one should worry about, as absolute utilization of the exploits in Sakamoto\'s outlines is something Takamatsu can surely handle well. And handled well he did, as Sakamoto Desu Ga´s conveying of comedy is truly a unique experience. While it never manages to even closely reach the impeccable altitude that it\'s titular character has erected, it does manage to reach heights that demand respect.The most fundamental, yet difficult task that has to be dealt with is hooking us into Sakamoto\'s heavenly characteristics. For a majority of the time, regardless of the audience finding Sakamoto as their idolized figure or containment of vented hatred, our attachment to Sakamoto is what will influence our enjoyment throughout the show. This could be done by opting out for the promotional route, either by creating PVs highlighting Sakamoto\'s loftiness or making a Sakamoto-themed 3DS layout. Of course, none of these cheap tactics would\'ve had any effect if I were to just blindly walk into Sakamoto\'s world. The molding of Sakamoto\'s essence within the show he inhabits is what truly matters. Contrary to this, however, Sakamoto Desu Ga? absolutely denies creating any further traits to Sakamoto\'s character beyond what was originally founded. Sakamoto is just an overwhelming cool being. No profound implications, just pure coolness. Don\'t worry about missing this crucial detail; the narrator at the beginning of most episodes will provide you with his description of Sakamoto\'s persona. A clearly direct reminder to us all that Sakamoto is a medium meant to produce coolness.Yet, the maneuvering around any possible flaws such characterization brings is handled with cunningly well. The usage of the adjective ""cool"" under the circumstances of Sakamoto explicitly brings out subjectivity. How exactly one perceives a fellow being as having qualities remarkable enough to encourage casual praise is entirely based one\'s own personal beliefs of what fabricates a figure of sublime respect. Which prompts the question, ""What exactly is it about Sakamoto that makes him cool?"". And that very form of skepticism is something Sakamoto Desu Ga knows its audience will make, as it\'s a necessity to how it\'ll execute its portrayal of Sakamoto. Taking advantage of the seemingly one-note flaws under Sakamoto\'s persona allows a flexible utilization of the character in question. The surroundings around Sakamoto and how he responds to them are all based on the very idea that he\'s ""cool"", but they\'re completely indirect in portraying the slyness of Sakamoto. At one point, Sakamoto\'s breaking physics, at the other, he\'s practicing eccentric behaviors in solitude. If the viewer weren\'t fed on the idea of Sakamoto\'s nature, they\'d possibly put themselves into a stump if they were to describe Sakamoto solely based on his isolated actions. But with the cool-tinted leans Sakamoto Desu Ga provides the viewer with, all the actions he so performs already fall into the default categorization of ""cool"". This form of in-your-face characterization is what stirs up questionability in determining if the very figure in question is indeed as directly described. The instance when you\'ve fallen to that bait is when Sakamoto\'s essence will truly be cast upon your mindset, resulting in the joining of new brethren for Sakamoto\'s praise. Essentially, predetermination in characterization is what allows Sakamoto to shine. Any and all actions Sakamoto performs will now automatically be described as ""cool"" via Word of God, therefore, his character is in complete control simply because he can act in accordance to any whim he so carries without ever breaking the influence held in his presence.Of course, such a tactic can be discarded as wasted if it\'s not used effectively enough to at least maintain an interest in Sakamoto\'s legacy. Similarly, writing that requires a subtle form of manipulation to work to its full effect is practically impossible to maintain throughout. Having a couple of loose strings attached here and there is inevitable. Stubborn people whose pride doesn\'t permit them to watch a show with ""the same joke repeated consecutively"" won\'t infatuate themselves with Sakamoto. People who\'ve been on the Sakamoto train ever since its premiere are prone to wear off their attention if Sakamoto\'s flexibility were to be abused enough to the point of making his extreme activities senselessly mundane. Such a form of inconsistency is something not even Sakamoto himself can control; comedy is most prone to become tiring due to how subjective humor as a whole is. In the case of Sakamoto, excessive exposure is what damages him the most. At times, watching Sakamoto\'s radiance be escalated causes an undesirable blinding light in enjoyment. Thankfully, the prolonging of neglection towards flaws isn\'t allowed. Even with the marginalization its rough edges cause at times, Sakamoto Desu Ga is able to prosper itself by handling the variation of situations its titular character is placed in with a tenderly ease acknowledgment of its strengths and shortcomings.Where the core of Sakamoto\'s comedic value lies is in the situations Sakamoto is utilized in. Despite how conventional such an approach seems at first glance, the factors that depend on the situations are kept in resonance with the eccentric, stylistic charm the show holds. The warping of the original definition that ""cool"" had towards Sakamoto\'s character is done so by the surroundings around him testifying his endurance. Often times, his environments provide materialized obstacles or internal conflicts for Sakamoto to decimate.  Once presented, Sakamoto will begin accumulating towards tactics in which he will break through the problems indicated before a problematic experience fully launches itself on him. On first inspection, the formulaic structure of overcoming challenges is a hindrance that sticks out like a sore thumb. Yet, the issues Sakamoto faces don\'t ponder into the possibility of his outcomes being successful, such a thing is a given. It\'s not so much ""Will Sakamoto open the pickle jar?"", but rather, ""How will Sakamoto open the pickle jar while simultaneously exemplifying his wonderous eroticism?"" The developing of Sakamoto\'s tactical schemes and how he utilizes them in the most prosperous, randomized manner possible is key to the delivering of punchlines. Sometimes, the figure does some inhumanely ludicrous things. Other times, he unexpectedly performs with normality. The more poetic verses Sakamoto spouts while majestically reading a classic on the edge of a school window, the more one becomes curious with how the abilities and techniques Sakamoto will ploy tests the boundaries that his ""coolness"" can reach. This, of course, isn\'t to say the atmosphere he\'s in is merely present to become the victim of Sakamoto. In actuality, it\'s the mundane nature in each atmosphere he\'s implemented in that allows us to sneak a peek on Sakamoto\'s unmeasurable capabilities. The seemingly normal settings Sakamoto gets in are what amplitudes his sheer capacity to convey coolness. The settings don\'t accommodate their natural laws whenever Sakamoto\'s presence enters the field, rather, they welcome Sakamoto with warm hands without any of the irritating fanfare. Sakamoto\'s shenanigans being viewed as ""commonplace"" simply because his charisma allows him to makes his performances feel all the more ""cool"" instead of pathetically forced.Contrary to what one might expect out of his sheer divinity, Sakamoto is not the figure that holds up the entire show on his shoulders. Sure, his legacy is plastered on everywhere as if the entire world were to revolve around Sakamoto and Sakamoto only, but appearances can only be so deceiving. Instead, the very people who envelop themselves to Sakamoto are the individuals who are tasked with structuring the show as a whole. A god\'s foundation cannot exist without any followers, and such is the case with Sakamoto. The side characters that happen to inhabit the same world as Sakamoto are where the value of the show derives from. The whole collective body of side characters are symbolic of the flawed, foolish attributes humanity holds, which is what allows Sakamoto\'s perfection to be properly measured as something far more than a concept. The functionality of the side characters isn\'t largely the equivalent of that of a peanut gallery, however. This isn\'t to say that their purpose at times doesn\'t come up to be as such, it does. After all, if it weren\'t, we wouldn\'t be able to properly perceive Sakamoto\'s display of transcendentalism as the extraordinary thing that it is. But they can only indulge in such praise because they themselves have none of the attributes Sakamoto possess. While it never invites for tone-breaking seriousness, the fact that each of the side characters shares their own self-conscious flaws is largely what determines their purpose in the narrative. For instance, fellow male adolescents in Sakamoto\'s class will let their jealousy towards Sakamoto\'s universal harem corrupt them. So much so that they take the action to become an obstacle in Sakamoto\'s path, in hopes of ruining his image. This forces Sakamoto to participate in their internal struggle in hopes of reaching a solution only he himself can achieve. If angsty delinquents aren\'t what\'s troubling Sakamoto today, then it\'ll be pubescent girls aiming to get a glimpse of the forbidden fruit. All of which are dealt with a small dose of Sakamoto´s mercy. Essentially, the opposition of conflicts between the side characters\' struggles and Sakamoto\'s carefree state of perfection are what compose the show as a whole.Despite how cursorily the side characters are presented at times, Sakamoto Desu Ga does not aim to make itself a satire on humanity\'s futile grasping for power and ideals by having its embodiment of perfection kicking on them as if they were mere pebbles on the road. At any point, such an execution of Sakamoto\'s character would have made the premise justifiable, enough to make the snarkiness that surrounds the show all the more ensuing. Yet, Sakamoto Desu Ga opts itself out for a much more different road. Instead of exemplifying his gracefulness through the mockery of others, Sakamoto\'s way of going about others dilemma is much more benevolent. All the approaches Sakamoto takes whenever confronted with an internal struggle is beneficial, not to him, but to the people that he aids. Sakamoto does so by simply reaching out his hand to whoever calls out for enlightenment, in one way or another. In the end of the day, however, the people in his aid aren\'t rid of any of the flaws they hold just because Sakamoto helped them. No one ever reaches heights close to that of Sakamoto, but that\'s only because they don\'t need to anymore. Sakamoto\'s perfection is utilized by making side characters come to the realization that what they desire isn\'t perfection in everything, but rather a peaceful acceptance of their flaws. Whenever Sakamoto accomplishes such a task, the side characters simply move on with their lives under the teachings Sakamoto conveyed. Such scenes become unexpectedly heartwarming and genuinely endearing at times. And while they will by no means gauge out all your bodily fluids out of your eyes, they do add a complimentary layer of meaning to the show as a whole. Integrating light thematic substance into shows of Sakamoto\'s kind is considerably difficult to carry out. Once one line akin to that of teenage poetry is spouted with serious intents, a breaking of the comical atmosphere is bound to occur. The existence of Sakamoto\'s figure, however, prevents such a thing from happening. As Sakamoto is consistently within the stylistic deadpan aestheticism of coolness, so is the very show itself in its execution of events. All the enlightenments Sakamoto performs are done with the same class he does other actions with, making what would\'ve felt as a horned-in PSA feel natural within the show\'s style. It helps that Sakamoto Desu Ga is an exceptional comedy that keeps its continuity in check, much unlike that of irritating romcoms. Whenever a previously focused character makes their way into a future scene under the influence of their change, one can\'t help but make a wry smirk, both for the characters in question and for our always-growing entrustment towards Sakamoto\'s coolness.Sakamoto´s meager classmates aren´t the only beings active in the veneration of Sakamoto, however. As with similar regard to the many depictions that have been given to the religious figure that is Jesus, Sakamoto has been painted with the very colors of elegance in his animated portrayal. Mostly thanks to the glorious animation studio that is Studio Deen, Sakamoto´s character design has been vigilantly adapted to captivate the very spiritual fragrance he composes with his brilliant loftiness. Enlightenment itself can be simply achieved with just a simple glance of Sakamoto´s poetic figure. It truly is quite the spectacle. Pseudo-theological jabbering aside, if one were to take a look at Sakamoto without previous knowledge as to what the show he´s the namesake of revolves around, they´d probably succumb to noting a casual remark on the cool persona he vibrates. And such a thing is to be expected of; Sakamoto´s character design itself characterizes him as the being he is without any need for an introduction. His build is robustly defined enough to engulf any passersby into his impacting gravitational pull, yet is equally spiced with the scent of adolescence to convey his comforting approach. His facial features are sharp and refined, being comprised of eloquent eyes with the capability of radiating his charisma, a wonderfully formed chin that will surely invoke some envy in CLAMP characters, and a single divine mole reminiscent of 18th-century nobles. Not to mention his stylishly parted blackened hair that serves as a complementation towards his celestial glasses. It´s no wonder why delinquents and Tumblr bloggers everywhere are dedicating themselves to Sakamoto´s figure in the tributes that are phone wallpapers. Conversely to Sakamoto, the side character´s that accompany him aren´t all that shabby either. While they can never hope to hold a candle to him, their designs certainly set the scene for the quasi-serious comical atmosphere of the show. Albeit comparing them to Sakamoto might be too grand of a scale, all the inhabiting characters are rather simplistic in how they´re designed. Besides Sakamoto´s exceptional display, designs throughout the show don´t convey any particular style to them. Occasionally, they´ll carry minimal traits to physically define themselves with and that´ll be it, which is sufficient in making them distinctive. The very simplicity they carry, much like their written characteristics, is a clear opposition to Sakamoto, which in return makes his greatness stand out more than it already has.Yet, the character designs and how glamorous they aren´t all that matters. After all, this isn´t the doctrine that is the manga, this is an anime. Experiencing how The Sakamoto´s routines and actions come into play once the animation is added to the formula is one of the fundamentals in grasping his character. One would think that animated characters can only fully capture once their animation is realistically fluid, and such an idea wouldn´t be all that farfetched. However, the said capturing of emotion isn´t all that reliant on how many frames the model of a character is composed of. The sly mention of the animation studio, Deen, has been dropped for a reason. Deen hasn´t exactly been known to be the most vibrant animation studio in Japan; it’s what gave birth to the now deteriorated infamy they had. As such, Sakamoto Desu Ga in the gritty hands of Deen shouldn´t be expected to be chock-full of sakuga or scenery that’s worthy of rivaling Makoto Shinkai. Nor should it be down frowned upon; Deen´s been on quite a roll this recent year, what with the rare piece of art that was Winter 2016´s Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, as well as with Konosuba´s comically ingenious utilization of its “poor” visuals. With Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, pulling off a visual technique that’s both pleasing to the budget at hand and the final product is a bit more on the difficult side. Considering the show´s premise, one would expect visuals as grandiose as the ace himself throughout, but that is not the case here. The visuals of the show, much like some occasional gags that simply missed, tend to lean more towards on the inconsistent side of things. For instance, several times do Sakamoto´s facial attributes blankly disappear in the void that is the off-model. This results in the singular feature of Sakamoto becoming his empty, hollow glasses that display nothing else but an uninviting stare of pure whiteness. One could say that this is a deliberate, almost surreal attempt at conveying a contrasting side of Sakamoto that displays perfection as something to be feared, but I digress. Fortunately, the movement of the character does make up for this. Within the bizarre, yet surely cool habits Sakamoto executes, the animation is what partially allows for his abstract performances come to light. Whether he´s ludicrously brandishing his arms about, carefully pouring salt with his heavenly hands, or running in the style of Darwin´s evolutionary theory, an optimization towards the weak animation is made. Combined with the absurd shoujo special effects in the backgrounds, one can´t help but appreciate his wonder and snap a gif or two to stash in their private Sakamoto folder. On a similar note, the side characters often experience the same phenomenon that is the “off-model”, but on them, it´s much more welcome. There´s no doubt that the minor occasions in which they take place are due to another one of Sakamoto´s extraordinary powers.With how exceptionally Sakamoto excels as a human being, both in his body build and characteristics far beyond that of plebeians, one would think that a voice would not be required to finally resonate the character. Considering how perfect he is, the necessity to convey messages indicative of meaning through vocal abilities wouldn´t confront Sakamoto. Unexpectedly, however, Sakamoto is containment of a particular voice. Luckily, the seiyuu he´s been cast with couldn´t have any more divine: Hikaru Midorikawa has been given the virtue of being able to voice Sakamoto. Admittedly, the guy´s experienced with characters types meant to extract awe out of the viewer, such as in the case of the embodiment of brotherly sentimentalities that is Natsume Kyousuke from the Little Busters, and the most admirable conman and best girl known as Deishuu Kaiki from the Monogatari series. His performance as Sakamoto is by no means a decline in comparison to these two. Midorikawa´s take on Sakamoto is splendid in which it manages to capture all the traits the character possess in one voice without the need for tonal shift. He´s humble and modest enough to attract a passing bird, yet erotic and romantic enough to tingle your sensations with a single whisper into your ear. With such a majestical voice, it’s no wonder why high school girls and delinquents alike reach the peak of ecstasy once confronting Sakamoto. And despite the potential of his voice alone being able to equate to that of a German chorus, surrounding soundtracks happen to accompany Sakamoto in his actions. The score of Sakamoto Desu Ga at first glance might seem like that of a Mozart masterpiece, but upon much closer inspection, it´ll be revealed that is not the case. Abundantly throughout the show do multiple renditions of Sakamoto´s leitmotif play, more often than not whenever Sakamoto is in the process of accomplishing a gag. It´s full of class and jazz, very much like his persona, however, I can only dare to describe it as “Sakamoto-esque”. Unfortunately, the leitmotif in question isn´t sufficient enough a track to be constantly played throughout in almost every single episode. After a while, when the memes die off, it wears off as well. Only then can the fact that other pieces in Sakamoto Desu Ga´s soundtrack exist come into light. But by that point, the leitmotif would have already spread its influence enough to make them, quite frankly, dismissable. Albeit when compared to how the leitmotif exerts the entire style of the show all in one, other pieces simply aren´t sonorous enough to maintain atmosphere beyond their particular usage in a fitting scene.Contrary to the lackluster soundtrack’s inability to fully captivate The Sakamoto, the opening and ending themes of the show are dynamic in their ability at expressing the show’s signature style. The dubbed title of the show´s opening itself, [COOLEST], exemplifies the capacity of Sakamoto´s abilities. Being composed of guitar riffs that are sure to reach out to the heavens, some absurdly befitting lyrics to what follows, and Sakamoto performing everyday tasks in manners in which only he can, [COOLEST] couldn´t have been dubbed by any other name. Customi Z sure fabricated an opening that’s both an earworm to listen to and complimentary to the series. In juxtaposition to the zaniness of the opening, the ending theme, [Nakushita Hibi ni Sayonara] by Suneohair, is of a more melancholic and sentimental tone. Featuring Sakamoto indulging in luxurious pastimes in the midst of a dawn-engulfed afternoon, the emotionally invoking ending theme serves as a curtain call to the subdue thematic implications throughout Sakamoto Desu Ga. Both songs are similar in this regard; they set the mood naturally well as introductions to the show at hand and subtle farewells to the viewers. Plus, what sane person wouldn´t want to jam out to the choruses of “Kuuru, kuuraa, kuurizuto!” directed towards praising Sakamoto?Once all eccentric mannerisms of the titular character have come to a momentary intermission, Sakamoto Desu Ga, despite the conspicuous premise arousing skepticism towards redundant gags, is an unexceptionally engrossing comedy to watch that´s in acknowledgment of its shortcomings without neglecting what makes it brilliant. When inspecting the character´s mannerism both ironically and casually, one can´t help but instantly be enraptured by Sakamoto´s charisma. Despite the constant allusion to him being an embodiment of perfection, when scrutinizing Sakamoto he´s anything but a euphemized figure of boredom. The direction of the show´s stylistic humor is as well-composed as the character himself in merging the obscure mannerisms of Sakamoto in a universe where such frolicsomeness is accepted as the norm.This, however, doesn´t prevent itself from stepping into unknown boundaries well in its reach, being the providing of simplistic themes properly interweaved thoughtfully enough to contain impact without ruining its comical priorities. With its tongue-in-cheek maintenance of its characters reputation and clever exertion of the varying potential he has in his COOLness, Sakamoto Desu Ga plows itself through as a comedy with sheer swagger, resulting in an enchanting experience far beyond that of transcendental happenings and linear punchlines devoid of the gracious touching. explicitly. Moreover, philosophers have long argued out with each other as to what exactly defines the concept of “perfection” we so seek. Yet, as more theories are regurgitated, more questions arise as to what can exactly be defined as “perfect”, so to speak. Is it found in the state of one’s being, our relationships with other people, or our accomplishments? Despite all our struggles at an attempt towards perfection and grasping its meaning, we’ll likely never reach the age in which we can present to our fellow homo sapiens what exactly defines our desires.Sakamoto of Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, has achieved that very perfection and other aspects of grand calibers in just his very state of adolescence. Undeniably, such is a feat that even the most epic of legends can ever hope to describe in bountiful analogical detail. Having attributes that are the equivalent to that of an omnipotent divinity, Sakamoto constantly excels at everyday difficulties with radiance and class. Dangerous obstacles pose no harm to a modest Sakamoto, quite the contrary. The very obstacles up against Sakamoto’s path rid of their malicious intents via reaching a transcendent of purpose upon the simple touch of Sakamoto’s graceful forgiveness. And very much like those purified obstacles which Sakamoto has benefitted, Sakamoto’s mere presence itself is akin to that of a magnificent fragrance that attracts all and transfigures us all. A mere walk taken by Sakamoto along a mundane park produces the blossoming of a multitude of flowers, along with the rising of the glorious sun. Those behind Sakamoto´s shadow gather around, praising his perfection beyond the extent that a theological figure holds. The rituals in which they participate in know no bounds; all are welcome in the hands of Sakamoto. Not that us plebeians can even absorb anything from Sakamoto\'s teachings without our sinful nature crawling its way out of us. Nonetheless, evidence of a blessing on humanity has never become as evident as Sakamoto\'s existence itself. Truly, there must be some kind of god out there. And that god, by all means, must be Sakamoto.Alright, let’s remove all the memetic mutations Sakamoto has formed and get real. Sakamoto Desu Ga?’s initial premise practically oozes out criticism in a single word: redundancy. After all, its primary genre is slice of life; a genre that invites viewers to immerse themselves into the tiny worlds of characters’ mundane lives. When taking this into consideration, redundancy is definitely a crucial flaw that can easily pry itself in at any moment. Sakamoto Desu Ga?’s premise of its titular character frolicking around as the participant of shenanigans in which he is a metaphorical god in is bound to get tiring fast. It practically discourages any curiosity one might have on wasting their time on a show in which aestheticism is the only thing going for it. In the end of the day, Sakamoto will always have a gallant laugh after having confronted a challenge, drink some wine on a refined glass, and indulge in luxury. And, even then, viewers cannot relate themselves to a being rid of flaws. Whereas disposable characters with the likes of Kirito or Kyousuke from My Little Sister Can´t Be This Cute are structured to be wish-fulfillment, Sakamoto doesn\'t provide any gaps in his existence that one can squeeze themselves into. If anything, watching Sakamoto\'s constant gaining of achievements as the sun sets itself invites irrationality. Whether it be from the fruitless task of watching Sakamoto reach new frontiers effortlessly or pure envy from a lack of understanding Sakamoto\'s divinity. Sakamoto\'s singular quirk of perfection just doesn\'t meet the requirements for enjoyment.Or so one would think after having read the synopsis on paper. I say this as I too was a victim of skepticism as to how exactly Sakamoto desu Ga would play out. Of course, you could always aim for the most obvious executions, such as making the most basic usage of Sakamoto\'s talent through the varying of situations. But with the haunting premise Sakamoto Desu Ga curses itself with, even such an approach isn\'t without its own flaws. The biggest challenge Sakamoto Desu Ga has to deal with is how it will fundamentally differentiate itself each time, not through the situations Sakamoto gets himself in, but rather on how its stylistic tone is each varying situation is implemented.

Sakamoto\'s shenanigans being viewed as ""commonplace"" simply because his charisma allows him to makes his performances feel all the more ""cool"" instead of pathetically forced.Contrary to what one might expect out of his sheer divinity, Sakamoto is not the figure that holds up the entire show on his shoulders. Sure, his legacy is plastered on everywhere as if the entire world were to revolve around Sakamoto and Sakamoto only, but appearances can only be so deceiving. Instead, the very people who envelop themselves to Sakamoto are the individuals who are tasked with structuring the show as a whole. A god\'s foundation cannot exist without any followers, and such is the case with Sakamoto. The side characters that happen to inhabit the same world as Sakamoto are where the value of the show derives from. The whole collective body of side characters are symbolic of the flawed, foolish attributes humanity holds, which is what allows Sakamoto\'s perfection to be properly measured as something far more than a concept. The functionality of the side characters isn\'t largely the equivalent of that of a peanut gallery, however. This isn\'t to say that their purpose at times doesn\'t come up to be as such, it does. After all, if it weren\'t, we wouldn\'t be able to properly perceive Sakamoto\'s display of transcendentalism as the extraordinary thing that it is. But they can only indulge in such praise because they themselves have none of the attributes Sakamoto possess. While it never invites for tone-breaking seriousness, the fact that each of the side characters shares their own self-conscious flaws is largely what determines their purpose in the narrative. For instance, fellow male adolescents in Sakamoto\'s class will let their jealousy towards Sakamoto\'s universal harem corrupt them. So much so that they take the action to become an obstacle in Sakamoto\'s path, in hopes of ruining his image. This forces Sakamoto to participate in their internal struggle in hopes of reaching a solution only he himself can achieve. If angsty delinquents aren\'t what\'s troubling Sakamoto today, then it\'ll be pubescent girls aiming to get a glimpse of the forbidden fruit. All of which are dealt with a small dose of Sakamoto´s mercy. Essentially, the opposition of conflicts between the side characters\' struggles and Sakamoto\'s carefree state of perfection are what compose the show as a whole.Despite how cursorily the side characters are presented at times, Sakamoto Desu Ga does not aim to make itself a satire on humanity\'s futile grasping for power and ideals by having its embodiment of perfection kicking on them as if they were mere pebbles on the road. At any point, such an execution of Sakamoto\'s character would have made the premise justifiable, enough to make the snarkiness that surrounds the show all the more ensuing. Yet, Sakamoto Desu Ga opts itself out for a much more different road. Instead of exemplifying his gracefulness through the mockery of others, Sakamoto\'s way of going about others dilemma is much more benevolent. All the approaches Sakamoto takes whenever confronted with an internal struggle is beneficial, not to him, but to the people that he aids. Sakamoto does so by simply reaching out his hand to whoever calls out for enlightenment, in one way or another. In the end of the day, however, the people in his aid aren\'t rid of any of the flaws they hold just because Sakamoto helped them. No one ever reaches heights close to that of Sakamoto, but that\'s only because they don\'t need to anymore. Sakamoto\'s perfection is utilized by making side characters come to the realization that what they desire isn\'t perfection in everything, but rather a peaceful acceptance of their flaws. Whenever Sakamoto accomplishes such a task, the side characters simply move on with their lives under the teachings Sakamoto conveyed. Such scenes become unexpectedly heartwarming and genuinely endearing at times. And while they will by no means gauge out all your bodily fluids out of your eyes, they do add a complimentary layer of meaning to the show as a whole. Integrating light thematic substance into shows of Sakamoto\'s kind is considerably difficult to carry out. Once one line akin to that of teenage poetry is spouted with serious intents, a breaking of the comical atmosphere is bound to occur. The existence of Sakamoto\'s figure, however, prevents such a thing from happening. As Sakamoto is consistently within the stylistic deadpan aestheticism of coolness, so is the very show itself in its execution of events. All the enlightenments Sakamoto performs are done with the same class he does other actions with, making what would\'ve felt as a horned-in PSA feel natural within the show\'s style. It helps that Sakamoto Desu Ga is an exceptional comedy that keeps its continuity in check, much unlike that of irritating romcoms. Whenever a previously focused character makes their way into a future scene under the influence of their change, one can\'t help but make a wry smirk, both for the characters in question and for our always-growing entrustment towards Sakamoto\'s coolness.Sakamoto´s meager classmates aren´t the only beings active in the veneration of Sakamoto, however. As with similar regard to the many depictions that have been given to the religious figure that is Jesus, Sakamoto has been painted with the very colors of elegance in his animated portrayal. Mostly thanks to the glorious animation studio that is Studio Deen, Sakamoto´s character design has been vigilantly adapted to captivate the very spiritual fragrance he composes with his brilliant loftiness. Enlightenment itself can be simply achieved with just a simple glance of Sakamoto´s poetic figure. It truly is quite the spectacle. Pseudo-theological jabbering aside, if one were to take a look at Sakamoto without previous knowledge as to what the show he´s the namesake of revolves around, they´d probably succumb to noting a casual remark on the cool persona he vibrates. And such a thing is to be expected of; Sakamoto´s character design itself characterizes him as the being he is without any need for an introduction. His build is robustly defined enough to engulf any passersby into his impacting gravitational pull, yet is equally spiced with the scent of adolescence to convey his comforting approach. His facial features are sharp and refined, being comprised of eloquent eyes with the capability of radiating his charisma, a wonderfully formed chin that will surely invoke some envy in CLAMP characters, and a single divine mole reminiscent of 18th-century nobles. Not to mention his stylishly parted blackened hair that serves as a complementation towards his celestial glasses. It´s no wonder why delinquents and Tumblr bloggers everywhere are dedicating themselves to Sakamoto´s figure in the tributes that are phone wallpapers. Conversely to Sakamoto, the side character´s that accompany him aren´t all that shabby either. While they can never hope to hold a candle to him, their designs certainly set the scene for the quasi-serious comical atmosphere of the show. Albeit comparing them to Sakamoto might be too grand of a scale, all the inhabiting characters are rather simplistic in how they´re designed. Besides Sakamoto´s exceptional display, designs throughout the show don´t convey any particular style to them. Occasionally, they´ll carry minimal traits to physically define themselves with and that´ll be it, which is sufficient in making them distinctive. The very simplicity they carry, much like their written characteristics, is a clear opposition to Sakamoto, which in return makes his greatness stand out more than it already has.Yet, the character designs and how glamorous they aren´t all that matters. After all, this isn´t the doctrine that is the manga, this is an anime. Experiencing how The Sakamoto´s routines and actions come into play once the animation is added to the formula is one of the fundamentals in grasping his character. One would think that animated characters can only fully capture once their animation is realistically fluid, and such an idea wouldn´t be all that farfetched. However, the said capturing of emotion isn´t all that reliant on how many frames the model of a character is composed of. The sly mention of the animation studio, Deen, has been dropped for a reason. Deen hasn´t exactly been known to be the most vibrant animation studio in Japan; it’s what gave birth to the now deteriorated infamy they had. As such, Sakamoto Desu Ga in the gritty hands of Deen shouldn´t be expected to be chock-full of sakuga or scenery that’s worthy of rivaling Makoto Shinkai. Nor should it be down frowned upon; Deen´s been on quite a roll this recent year, what with the rare piece of art that was Winter 2016´s Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, as well as with Konosuba´s comically ingenious utilization of its “poor” visuals. With Sakamoto Desu Ga, however, pulling off a visual technique that’s both pleasing to the budget at hand and the final product is a bit more on the difficult side. Considering the show´s premise, one would expect visuals as grandiose as the ace himself throughout, but that is not the case here. The visuals of the show, much like some occasional gags that simply missed, tend to lean more towards on the inconsistent side of things. For instance, several times do Sakamoto´s facial attributes blankly disappear in the void that is the off-model. This results in the singular feature of Sakamoto becoming his empty, hollow glasses that display nothing else but an uninviting stare of pure whiteness. One could say that this is a deliberate, almost surreal attempt at conveying a contrasting side of Sakamoto that displays perfection as something to be feared, but I digress. Fortunately, the movement of the character does make up for this. Within the bizarre, yet surely cool habits Sakamoto executes, the animation is what partially allows for his abstract performances come to light. Whether he´s ludicrously brandishing his arms about, carefully pouring salt with his heavenly hands, or running in the style of Darwin´s evolutionary theory, an optimization towards the weak animation is made. Combined with the absurd shoujo special effects in the backgrounds, one can´t help but appreciate his wonder and snap a gif or two to stash in their private Sakamoto folder. On a similar note, the side characters often experience the same phenomenon that is the “off-model”, but on them, it´s much more welcome. There´s no doubt that the minor occasions in which they take place are due to another one of Sakamoto´s extraordinary powers.With how exceptionally Sakamoto excels as a human being, both in his body build and characteristics far beyond that of plebeians, one would think that a voice would not be required to finally resonate the character. Considering how perfect he is, the necessity to convey messages indicative of meaning through vocal abilities wouldn´t confront Sakamoto. Unexpectedly, however, Sakamoto is containment of a particular voice. Luckily, the seiyuu he´s been cast with couldn´t have any more divine: Hikaru Midorikawa has been given the virtue of being able to voice Sakamoto. Admittedly, the guy´s experienced with characters types meant to extract awe out of the viewer, such as in the case of the embodiment of brotherly sentimentalities that is Natsume Kyousuke from the Little Busters, and the most admirable conman and best girl known as Deishuu Kaiki from the Monogatari series. His performance as Sakamoto is by no means a decline in comparison to these two. Midorikawa´s take on Sakamoto is splendid in which it manages to capture all the traits the character possess in one voice without the need for tonal shift. He´s humble and modest enough to attract a passing bird, yet erotic and romantic enough to tingle your sensations with a single whisper into your ear. With such a majestical voice, it’s no wonder why high school girls and delinquents alike reach the peak of ecstasy once confronting Sakamoto. And despite the potential of his voice alone being able to equate to that of a German chorus, surrounding soundtracks happen to accompany Sakamoto in his actions. The score of Sakamoto Desu Ga at first glance might seem like that of a Mozart masterpiece, but upon much closer inspection, it´ll be revealed that is not the case. Abundantly throughout the show do multiple renditions of Sakamoto´s leitmotif play, more often than not whenever Sakamoto is in the process of accomplishing a gag. It´s full of class and jazz, very much like his persona, however, I can only dare to describe it as “Sakamoto-esque”. Unfortunately, the leitmotif in question isn´t sufficient enough a track to be constantly played throughout in almost every single episode. After a while, when the memes die off, it wears off as well. Only then can the fact that other pieces in Sakamoto Desu Ga´s soundtrack exist come into light. But by that point, the leitmotif would have already spread its influence enough to make them, quite frankly, dismissable. Albeit when compared to how the leitmotif exerts the entire style of the show all in one, other pieces simply aren´t sonorous enough to maintain atmosphere beyond their particular usage in a fitting scene.Contrary to the lackluster soundtrack’s inability to fully captivate The Sakamoto, the opening and ending themes of the show are dynamic in their ability at expressing the show’s signature style. The dubbed title of the show´s opening itself, [COOLEST], exemplifies the capacity of Sakamoto´s abilities. Being composed of guitar riffs that are sure to reach out to the heavens, some absurdly befitting lyrics to what follows, and Sakamoto performing everyday tasks in manners in which only he can, [COOLEST] couldn´t have been dubbed by any other name. Customi Z sure fabricated an opening that’s both an earworm to listen to and complimentary to the series. In juxtaposition to the zaniness of the opening, the ending theme, [Nakushita Hibi ni Sayonara] by Suneohair, is of a more melancholic and sentimental tone. Featuring Sakamoto indulging in luxurious pastimes in the midst of a dawn-engulfed afternoon, the emotionally invoking ending theme serves as a curtain call to the subdue thematic implications throughout Sakamoto Desu Ga. Both songs are similar in this regard; they set the mood naturally well as introductions to the show at hand and subtle farewells to the viewers. Plus, what sane person wouldn´t want to jam out to the choruses of “Kuuru, kuuraa, kuurizuto!” directed towards praising Sakamoto?Once all eccentric mannerisms of the titular character have come to a momentary intermission, Sakamoto Desu Ga, despite the conspicuous premise arousing skepticism towards redundant gags, is an unexceptionally engrossing comedy to watch that´s in acknowledgment of its shortcomings without neglecting what makes it brilliant. When inspecting the character´s mannerism both ironically and casually, one can´t help but instantly be enraptured by Sakamoto´s charisma. Despite the constant allusion to him being an embodiment of perfection, when scrutinizing Sakamoto he´s anything but a euphemized figure of boredom. The direction of the show´s stylistic humor is as well-composed as the character himself in merging the obscure mannerisms of Sakamoto in a universe where such frolicsomeness is accepted as the norm.This, however, doesn´t prevent itself from stepping into unknown boundaries well in its reach, being the providing of simplistic themes properly interweaved thoughtfully enough to contain impact without ruining its comical priorities. With its tongue-in-cheek maintenance of its characters reputation and clever exertion of the varying potential he has in his COOLness, Sakamoto Desu Ga plows itself through as a comedy with sheer swagger, resulting in an enchanting experience far beyond that of transcendental happenings and linear punchlines devoid of the gracious touching.', ""A really fun and unique comedy, with a protagonist who's just the coolest.Story 6/10.There isn't much of a story to the series apart from the comedic situations.Enjoyment 8.5/10Sakamoto's actions are just absurd most of the time, there's no chance to predict what he'll do next, so even if the comedy isn't always the best, it's still really fun to watch.

Right off the bat, the show does everything it can to really hone in on these characters and how their unique traits bounce off each other. The main character Sakamoto is quite of a blank slate, but that allows for the viewer to really get to know the rest of the cast and see them evolve in the show. The main ""antagonists"" (if you can really call them that in a show like this) go through a self discovery character arc, which is really nice to see, and...become better people at the end. The puppet master style villain who controls them is a bit weak, but that doesn\'t really matter, as the show only focuses on him for the last couple of episodes, in which he also serves more as a catalyst to put the regular cast in an interesting spot. The supporting cast is incredibly diverse and all have their own unique quirks that make them fun to watch. I already mentioned the antagonist gang, but the friend to Sakamoto is also very well made. He learns the value of his work and learns to stand up for himself. This is a very heartwarming arc and it is very heavily built up, despite the show looking more like a gag slice of life romp. Regardless, the characters in this show are amazing and you should really watch this show if you enjoy just watching people in interesting situations.Sound:The sound is actually quite interesting. In shows such as this, you typically get some really cliched styles of music, and maybe a couple emotional tracks here and there, which are usually gags.

Obviously there is the main theme for Sakamoto, but this theme is well done and does a great job in characterizing the protagonist as a flamboyant guy always at the right place at the right time. The emotional themes for the rest of the cast are also very well done, and even though sometimes they are played for laughs, towards the end of the show, they really hold a lot of weight. The other incidental music is also handled very well and helps to exemplify the show\'s feelings. The opening theme is extremely punchy and is a good juxtaposition to the show, while still showing off the characters and how odd Sakamoto is. The jazz style is awesome and is a great way to musically represent the show. The ending is pretty standard of a show this type, and is emotional and slow.Art:The art style of this show is pretty good. It\'s not amazing by any means, but the art serves its purpose and is good for what it is. The designs for the characters are well done, and each design tells a story of the character. The gangster characters are very well designed, and showcase their main battles and little idiosyncrasies like one of their members\' infatuation with his hair, and the scar on another one telling the story of his humility. Sakamoto\'s friend is also well made, originally being a scared boy, his design reflects that. However, as he grows, the design becomes less Caricature-esque (meaning less hyperbolic) and more in line with a person. This helps to drive home the idea that the character is growing as a person and becoming a better individual.Overall:This show\'s closest comparison is Saiki K. If you are a big fan of that show, then you will probably get even more out of this show. The action and laughs aren\'t as punchy, but that holds its own charm. This show knows when to pull back the laughs to get development from the characters and the development done is amazing for a show of this type. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good comedy show, but one with a good plot and a well put message at the end. become better people at the end. The puppet master style villain who controls them is a bit weak, but that doesn\'t really matter, as the show only focuses on him for the last couple of episodes, in which he also serves more as a catalyst to put the regular cast in an interesting spot. The supporting cast is incredibly diverse and all have their own unique quirks that make them fun to watch. I already mentioned the antagonist gang, but the friend to Sakamoto is also very well made. He learns the value of his work and learns to stand up for himself. This is a very heartwarming arc and it is very heavily built up, despite the show looking more like a gag slice of life romp. Regardless, the characters in this show are amazing and you should really watch this show if you enjoy just watching people in interesting situations.Sound:The sound is actually quite interesting. In shows such as this, you typically get some really cliched styles of music, and maybe a couple emotional tracks here and there, which are usually gags.

That break of the rules: Sakamoto is not only making fun of his teammates but the strategies seen a thousand times in the manga, that bad gandul that results in rancid and unoriginal scenes and that give rise to comics always built from the Same schemes: the cool poses, the moral hero or the exaggerated and absurd polarities. The work of Nami Sano rejects that boring creation accustomed to cliché and does it based on that parodic humor but purely absurd and exaggerated so typical Japanese.A fun and interesting work that works as a parody of the most viewed and used...cliches in Japanese comics cliches in Japanese comics"", ""Sakamoto Desu ga? is one of those shows that can make you laugh, but this is certainly not a show for everyone. With it's unique sense of humour, and a storyline, which does not actually follow any specific concepts, instead it presents you with various scenarios, that Sakamoto goes through on a daily basis. With his cool headed character, and the way in which he preforms various task, in a matter of fact over exaggerated way, which most of us find ridiculous. But for Sakamoto, no task is truly a challenge, as  he performs it in a matter of fact perfect way. With his...upfront attitude, you simply cannot dislike his character completely. The fact that all of the actions seems to be centred  about him being a perfect class example, and doing everything perfectly, seems a slight drag on. Of course, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the comedic moments of this show, but none the less like most shows out there, there's of course place for improvement. Perhaps the creators, of this how could have given the show different perspectives, like focusing a bit more on how other people around him, react to the way he performs his actions, or maybe have a focus on what they think of him. Of course, not saying that this show was bad, but there could have been more added to it, to make it seem less like a repetitive concept of him being a perfectionist in everything. upfront attitude, you simply cannot dislike his character completely.

(Haven't you heard I'm Sakamoto) is that, it feels a bunch of youtube videos that someone saw and, thought that a show could be made out of it. That is how I got introduced to the show through youtube surfing and, they clips of the show were pretty hilarious.The show itself was very entertaining and, had elements of comedic brilliance with its fair share of laugh out loud moments. Some of the situations the show presented was very unique and, something that we haven't really seen in a school setting. Adding on to that...the high-school environment was used brilliantly such as sports, science and, especially dealing with bullies.The characters of the show were memorable in their own right and, each given a moment to shine. However, because the show was only twelve episodes not all of them received massive development. The biggest victim of development was Sakamoto, he is an awesome character and, defiantly commands your attention when he is on screen. Even though he is totally awesome we know little to nothing about him. We don't know his motivation, backstory or even how he is able to be perfect.Many people compare Sakamoto to Saitama from One Punch Man, they are similar in many ways, but the difference between the two is that we know Saitama's motivation and, we feel a connection towards him in the end. I feel that Skamoto would be a great side character instead of a main character but, I enjoyed watching him on screen. The side characters were, quite entertaining and, some of their stories were great to witness with the standouts being Hayabusa, Maeda Atsushi and,Yoshinobu Kubota. Each of these guys went through a change throughout the show because of Sakamoto. The students of Sakamoto's classroom were all really fun.The biggest downfall of the show is its flow. Each episode feels like two or three clips put together to form an episode. There isn't even a real storyline till the eighth episode, thats two thirds of just filler. I understand that a show like this does not really need a great story as its more character driven but, it certainly needed more time as the execution was rushed and, weak.The animation was well done, Studio Deen (who I've never even heard of) did a really good job on the character and, location designs. The animation of the opening sequence was brilliant and the song coolest perfectly matched the show and, its tone. The OST was overall decent but, aside from the opening none of them are quite memorable. Also, the show has great rain animation, the way the rain was animated in the show was better than a few of the underwater scenes in the Aquaman movie.Overall, Sakamoto Desu ga? was a very entertaining anime I did enjoy but, there was no real substance to the show. It had its moments and, a few clips are definitely with rewatching such as the episode where Skamoto becomes a personal assistant or gets for karaoke but as an overall show its good but, not great. the high-school environment was used brilliantly such as sports, science and, especially dealing with bullies.The characters of the show were memorable in their own right and, each given a moment to shine.

Sakamoto is, of course, already perfect in everything he does and gets no character development. However, very few of the side characters develop in any meaningful way even though they have room to grow. The only character I really cared about ended up being Hayabusa. Although many of Sakamoto's antics can be entertaining to watch, the gags tend to drag on a little too long and suck the life out of the jokes. That being said, there a few jokes that land solidly and don't overstay their...welcome, as well as a couple of genuinely heartfelt moments and incredibly gif-able moments for your meme needs. welcome, as well as a couple of genuinely heartfelt moments and incredibly gif-able moments for your meme needs."", 'Cooler, coolest!Some girls and some boys are too cool, but Sakamoto is coolest!

Nikolai Gogol’s bitter, sarcastic disparagement of the safe and insipid recipients of universal acclaim, if a tad too accusatory for my exact purposes, serves as an appropriate epigraph for a review of Sakamoto desu ga.  As you have no doubt already gathered, Sakamoto himself is the epitome of cool, the apex of aptitude, the Shatner of suave, the sultan of swing, the margrave of magnificence, the Zhong Kui of je ne sais quoi: the Sakamoto of Sakamoto.  Everything he does is exceedingly brilliant and everything he touches turns to gold that will also do your taxes and wash your car.Plenty of people know by now that perfect characters aren’t interesting.  Anyone who cannot possibly be in any danger cannot be counted on to sustain an engaging plot.  All the best characters in any medium are deeply flawed.  We know this by now, and we know it so well that Sakamoto desu ga decides to challenge this basic rule by featuring a perfect protagonist and using him creatively to generate unusual storylines.  To the credit of the series, it does consist of more than merely Sakamoto showing off his endless talents for the benefit of Class 1-2.  Every opportunity for Sakamoto to impress is an opportunity for his classmates and acquaintances to learn how to live in his shadow.  All the other characters must learn to appreciate their own strengths or reach difficult conclusions about themselves when faced with a figure so awe-inspiring and effortlessly competent.  This is a thought-provoking and refreshing way to handle such a scenario, and the first few episodes in particular explore the idea of Sakamoto as a motivation for others very well.In addition, having a perfect protagonist isn’t a circumstances of Sakamoto; it’s the premise.  The whole point of the show is to see what kind of ridiculous solutions Sakamoto can conjure for basic problems and how he can overcome the absurd tests devised by his enemies.  This is a comedy, after all, and most of the comedy stems from Sakamoto’s exaggerated prowess at everything.  Because perfection is the premise of the show and not the result of a lazy, sloppy, or naïve writer who can’t bear the thought of being cruel to their characters, I don’t believe that perfection is what makes Sakamoto unsatisfactory as a show.I simply find the show boring on a substantial level.  After the first few episodes, the show begins to lose whatever deeper layers it had and devolves into a series of skits about how much everyone loves Sakamoto.  The conceit of other characters learning from this singular, titular figure was the main factor that kept the series interesting at first, and when left with only the comedic elements, you begin to realize that Sakamoto desu ga really only has one joke.  One joke isn’t enough to float a series, unfortunately, no matter how many incarnations it has.  I typically find that the series isn’t over-the-top enough, as odd as that might sound in reference to Sakamoto.  To sell a premise like this, you need to pull out absolutely all the stops and get as much mileage as possible; restraint doesn’t really work for this setting.  Sakamoto desu ga isn’t especially over-the-top; it is level with the top and occasionally sloshes over when jostled.  The trio of Acchan and… friends…? …supplies some laughs, but more often than not, the settings build up to “look how cool and handsome Sakamoto is!”  My sense of humor doesn’t completely fall in line with that of the show.Unfortunately, in the real world as in the story’s universe itself, everything about the series revolves around Sakamoto.  Aside from maybe Sera, Sakamoto is the only one with a particularly striking character design.  None of the other characters are all that noteworthy, and the few recurring storylines the show keeps trying to push just don’t feel worth the time.  Sakamoto is the only main character, and he is neither what you would call a conventional character nor a relatable lens through which to view his world.  Overall the art style is pretty generic and devoid of personality; maybe it is supposed to be that way to underscore how singular the protagonist is, but I don’t especially care for it.  The uniforms, setting, dialogue, designs, and most of the soundtrack are all as nondescript as can be.  I am a pretty big fan of the OP, the ED, and certain elements of the soundtrack, and the performances are generally good, but none of that is enough to save the show for me.The goal that Sakamoto desu ga has is more interesting than what Sakamoto desu ga is.  I appreciate the idea of head-on torpedoing this rule against perfect characters and making something fun out of the fragments, but the results aren’t funny or charming or meaningful enough to keep me engaged.  I had high hopes for Sakamoto, but at this point, I have to say I’m ill-inclined to give it another shot or recommend it to others.  The length of time I have taken to explain my problems with the show might suggest that they are larger and more intrusive than they really are; watching the show the first time, I liked it enough to continue to the end, even without taking into account that I have so far refused to drop anything at all anyway, so it’s not like I would have abandoned Sakamoto even if I had hated it, but I mean this as a compliment.

Words have oft held great, sometimes even sacred, import for mankind over the years; whether it be the Ten Commandments or the Five Pillars or the Eightfold Path or what have you, words framed in a holy light last and endure through the musty years, never to be forgotten by their followers.Am I implying that these Five Words, or Three Words in Japanese -- Sakamoto desu ga? -- indicate a sort of divine status for the primary and eponymous character of this anime masterpiece?Why, yes, I am. For after seeing these Twelve Episodes of Absolute Magnificence, you can\'t...help but see Sakamoto in a superhuman light. In our communal journeys through shared education, from elementary to middle to high school to college and beyond, most of us yearn to look good in front of others to some degree. We desire our own coolness.I apologize for disrupting your dreams. For no matter how cool you have become, after watching Sakamoto desu ga? (henceforth abbreviated to SDG, which may or may not also stand for Student Demonstrates Godliness) you will realize how futile your struggles have been. For no matter how hard you try, you can never hope to stand in the shadow of, nay, not even be privileged to stand in the blinding light of, this man named Sakamoto. These Twelve Episodes of Sublime Brilliance tell the common youth and young adult\'s journey to coolness, and ultimately, its sheer lack of worth. Let me explain.So SDG is about this first-year high school student named Sakamoto who impresses his class from the first day on. Of course, as his every action and word is in itself a self-defining and society-defying emblem of majesty, he can\'t help but be in the limelight and capture the hearts of all the girls. Not surprisingly, some boys try to step into the light as well by attempting to make Sakamoto look bad in various ways. Not surprisingly, some girls try to reach Sakamoto as well, helplessly smitten as they are. And obviously what happens? Sakamoto not only evades their efforts, but converts them into something better, usually helping them in the process. Every episode of the Twelve Unforgotten has several such attempts, and each is hilarious. For every episode of the Twelve Empyrean I was trying to contain my otherwise uproarious laughter (unfortunately I watched this in my dorm, usually while my roommates were sleeping) to pounding my knee and almost tearing up. Before SDG, comedy in anime was pretty prevalent; from what I had seen so far, Gintama held the top tier, followed by others such as Steins;Gate and the High School DxD series. But after experiencing the Twelve-fold Comedy of SDG, I realized that what I had believed to be comedy was mere rubbish. In short, SDG is the funniest anime I have ever seen so far, and may hold that spot eternally. The mangaka, the genius who created Sakamoto, is brilliant for coming up with so many actions only worthy of Sakamoto. For example (and I\'ll just give one out of the myriad), when his shoes are tied together during a race, he simply goes on all fours and runs like a cheetah. Everything taken into consideration, Sakamoto is multitudinous talent personified. As you progress through the Twelve Episodes of Wonder, he keeps surprising and awing you with his new feats. So much so that you\'re left thinking whether he\'s actually human. help but see Sakamoto in a superhuman light.

Of course, as his every action and word is in itself a self-defining and society-defying emblem of majesty, he can\'t help but be in the limelight and capture the hearts of all the girls. Not surprisingly, some boys try to step into the light as well by attempting to make Sakamoto look bad in various ways. Not surprisingly, some girls try to reach Sakamoto as well, helplessly smitten as they are. And obviously what happens? Sakamoto not only evades their efforts, but converts them into something better, usually helping them in the process. Every episode of the Twelve Unforgotten has several such attempts, and each is hilarious. For every episode of the Twelve Empyrean I was trying to contain my otherwise uproarious laughter (unfortunately I watched this in my dorm, usually while my roommates were sleeping) to pounding my knee and almost tearing up. Before SDG, comedy in anime was pretty prevalent; from what I had seen so far, Gintama held the top tier, followed by others such as Steins;Gate and the High School DxD series. But after experiencing the Twelve-fold Comedy of SDG, I realized that what I had believed to be comedy was mere rubbish. In short, SDG is the funniest anime I have ever seen so far, and may hold that spot eternally. The mangaka, the genius who created Sakamoto, is brilliant for coming up with so many actions only worthy of Sakamoto. For example (and I\'ll just give one out of the myriad), when his shoes are tied together during a race, he simply goes on all fours and runs like a cheetah. Everything taken into consideration, Sakamoto is multitudinous talent personified. As you progress through the Twelve Episodes of Wonder, he keeps surprising and awing you with his new feats. So much so that you\'re left thinking whether he\'s actually human.', ""This high-school comedy is based on a 4-volume manga that ended in 2015. The titular chacrcter is a 16 years old boy that is as much an idealized man as Mr. Gray is. Sakamoto is athletic, handsome, studious, but his main attribute is style; to quote from the OP: “Everything he does is cool, cooler, coolest-o”.Being the not-so-obscure object of desire of every girl and her mother (quite literally), is bound to excite the envy of the other boys; all of them want to see Sakamoto's pristine image get blemished. Those boys with delinquent habits, are willing to...make the effort to achieve that. The show has a distinct One-punch-man feeling to it; the villains' careful laid plans are laid to waste by the equivalent of a single punch from Sakamoto. Actually it is a stylish move that looks initially silly, but ends up getting maximum cool points.That way of acting sets the series tone; Sakamoto looks  unapproachable, arrogant, and usually downright stupid; but he always has a selfless plan, to help his classmates while simultaneously manages to be kind to his “enemies”. The comedy stems from the absurdity of the situations that Sakamoto finds himself in and of course from when he increases the level of absurdity to resolve the situation with the aforementioned single cool-looking move.Unfortunately, the comedy sometimes misses its target. Moreover, since there is no story whatsoever, but each episode is a series of sketches, it is vital that most of them are entertaining, which is not the case. The final negative element, probably an emanation of the lack of a storyline, is that there is no development, neither in characters, nor in plot.So, Sakamoto offers a lot of laughs and some very original over-the-top situations. Even though the are a lot of uninteresting sketches, if we couple the good ones with the kindness that the series radiates, we have a good result. The twelfth episode concluded the series, but there is a thirteenth episode in the blu-ray, that the station didn't manage to air due to scheduling conflicts.The worst part about Sakamoto is that it is probably the third-best original anime of the Spring 2016 season; a quite disheartening fact. 6.5/10. make the effort to achieve that.

Sakamoto desu ga? is basically a collection of short stories about how people around Sakamoto interact with his perfectness. There\'s not much of a story, and what\'s there isn\'t even close to good, so if that\'s what you are looking for, go away. It\'s hard to recommend this anime in general due to how inconsistent it is. However, I don\'t regret watching it. Sure, quite a bit of it was boring, and most of it wasn\'t really interesting, but there were some instances of absolute gold spread throughout. Due to that, my memories from watching this...anime are not ""Episode X was so dull I had to force myself to slug through it"", but ""the Y scene on Episode Z was awesome!"".Maybe you should watch the first episode and see how you like it. The comedic style remains the same throughout the series, so if you take a liking to the first episode, you probably won\'t have a problem going through the not-so-good parts while you\'ll enjoy the good ones even more. anime are not ""Episode X was so dull I had to force myself to slug through it"", but ""the Y scene on Episode Z was awesome!"".Maybe you should watch the first episode and see how you like it.

This is the question ""Sakamoto Desu ga?"" seeks to answer. It\'s very obviously not written with the intent of being a cohesive story, creating an interesting fictional world, or following the story of characters as they evolve through their adventures. This show is all about making jokes with Sakamoto\'s impossibly perfect charisma as the punchline. It does this single thing very well and I enjoyed every episode. However, as with all running jokes, it does get old after a while. One season is plenty of time for that to happen. By episode 8 or so I knew...what to expect and while I did enjoy the remaining episodes, they left something to be desired. I would file this one under ""it\'s worth watching merely for its uniqueness"". It\'s a fun show which is proficiently written and artistically up to par, which is why I rate it 6/10. what to expect and while I did enjoy the remaining episodes, they left something to be desired.

He's cool, cooler, the coolest, as the intro suggests. There's nothing he can't do and no situation he can't get out of. His perfection is the running gimmick but there's more going on here than meets the eye.At certain point, one of students wants to know if it's true that Fukase, one of the bad guys in the show, have lived a thousand human lives before. I believe they should be asking this about Sakamoto as well....It's like he lived every single one of those situations and knows exactly what to do every single time. Sometimes all it takes is bringing an umbrella to the bathroom, but if the situation requires more, like say, riding a typhoon to save a little bird, no problem, he has powers that goes far beyond that of an ordinary human.I'm convinced Sakamoto is a bodhisattva that have lived a million highschool students' lives before. That's why he can do everything perfectly. That's why he shows perfect compassion and understanding of the human soul. His solutions are not always obvious but it always lead to the best conclusion. For example, at one point, he witness one of his schoolmates, Kubota, having money stolen by a group of hooligans. Later Kubota asks for Sakamoto's help because he's getting mugged so often he's running out of money. Sakamoto doesn't confront the hooligans. Instead, he and Kubota start working at Wcdonald's. He figured if the problem is Kubota is running out of money... This turns out to be the right move for everyone involved.His perfect loving-kindness means that he actually doesn't have any enemies, just people that doesn't know yet that they want to be friends with him.  This is also a running theme on the show. It's interesting to see how Sakamoto manages to get on everybody's good side acting in inventive, sometimes even tangential ways that ends up making absolutely everything right.It's a feel good type of show.

This show was pretty bland. The comedy was poor, there was no real story, the wackiness and strangeness of the show manages to be somehow unimpressive. Overall I wouldn't recommend.The show is about a boy named Sakamoto and his daily life at school. Sakamoto is super cool, everything he does is stylish and impressive to everyone, including other guys. Simply watch the intro to the anime and it will describe Sakamoto and what the shows antics will look like. He's like a Mary Poppins. Some event will arise that is out of the league...of normal high school students and he will remedy the situation without confronting it directly. He can also go with the flow of any situation to make it feel normal. For example one time a mop bucket goes out of control and rolls to him super fast and he simply jumps in it and rides it to the next class.The art and sound both decent, nothing to write home about.The characters were not bad, in fact the supporting cast made the later episodes enjoyable to me. Mostly the show follows Sakamoto and throws in another character or characters for whatever situation that needs remedied. You have the loser best friend, the clever man hunting woman, the bossy class rep, and some delinquents. As we all know from our high school days, this is the typical class line up. The first half of the show was to show off Sakamoto as everyone fell in love with him. The second half of the show was more of exploring other characters a bit, though nothing deep. We never know a lot about anyone.I didn't much enjoy this show. It had a moment or two of interest. I particularly liked the episodes where Sakamoto and Hayabusa, Shou would do something together. I liked Hayabusa's character and before I finished it I thought it would play into a small story arc, which I guess technically it did, though it was rather anti climatic. Other than those few episodes though I found myself bored. Comedy is Sakamoto doing something cool, girls and guys both swooning. Not something bad to pick up if your bored or are between shows. Not something I would recommend though.TLDR: Sakamoto is cool, too cool and it makes the show boring. No story, bland comedy, decent but pointless characters. of normal high school students and he will remedy the situation without confronting it directly.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryThere really isn\'t much of a story in Sakamoto. it\'s the usual high school life up to a graduation, but this Anime main goal is of course comedy. And I gotta say, it has a very unique and odd comedy, which is simply priceless. So as far the plot goes, it\'s simply presentation of a ultra elegant and gentleman of a man called Sakamoto. The elegance is taken up to a whole new level and in a comedic manner. For the most part it\'s very enjoyable episodic...comedy show with a really odd style to it that ain\'t supposed to taken seriously at all.But, here is as well a issue. A lot of jokes end up end up being very stale, overextended and repetitive, in not a good way. As far as ""random comedy"" Anime go, this one felt a bit weak. It did have quite few moments that gave me a good chuckle but at the same time there were a lot of moments where it felt simply ""tedious"" and eventually even started fast-forwarding. Which is simply a not good mark.But in the end, it was good enough and had plenty of funny ""elegance"" moments.✦Art&SoundWell, animation and art was good. Nothing too impressive, but fairly enjoyable and pleasing as needed.On the other hand, music had some gold tracks. Main theme was simply catchy and joyful and some of the songs were as well actually quite good. Plus the utter classic moment was probably one of my favorite moments of this Anime.✦Enjoyment&OverallUnique, odd, elegant. The dream of every girl on every planet and target of jealousy of every male. Jokes aside, it was simply fun Anime, but as mentioned, it was at the same time quite often stale, repetitive and tedious.The good part is, it got my praise from it. And I feel like praising it by giving final score of 7 rather than 6. My stamp of ""Approval"".

You can imagine it.', ""You don't always stumble across Anime like this one, you want to settle for a one-off gag show and move on to something else but end up getting more than you were waiting for. The gags are there, they have a strong drive and present on the plot's progression, but there is also a character than came to stay, “cool”, “cooler”, “coolest”, as the narrator says, let me add to that, “cooliest”. If that word isn't on the dictionary then Sakamoto has it already reserved, and this show says why that is.- Story (8/10):If you're coming at the show as a challenge to your connoisseur...taste in storytelling, don't expect anything else, as the norm has it, gags are just there as comic relief that fills up boring padding in the story and lights up the atmosphere if needed, but here it's a stable of the plot, something that alters it at a moment's notice all for the sake of a coherent progression.The pacing of the show varies from mini-arc to another, each episode features at least two different skits show why Sakamoto is a cool as he is, solidifying his personality and immortalizing it in your head, but that could also be due to that popular “theory” that I'm not a big subscriber of but it does make sense by the end of the show.This is a comedy standup that draws you in with how funny and light-hearted it is while discussing some real-world problems that everyone can relate to. Loneliness, Being bullied, Unaquired love, all are gently tackled by Sakamoto in the coolest way until the show ends up on a bittersweet note that both contradicts and emphasizes the wholesomeness that floating around the show.- Art (8/10):This one was weird. A close mix of 90's Shojo and modern trash Shounen, the characters change styles according to the circumstance which is a great plus. The backgrounds are nothing special given the setting of the story, so no nitpick from that part. A proper way to put it, good enough to keep you watching.- Sound (8/10):When it came to voice acting, it wasn't the strongest point of the Anime. Aside from Sakamoto who's voice was luxury to get to hear, the rest of the cast was decent, no bad performance or anything, just decent on the grander scale of things. The openings and endings, however, were bangers and the OST is so memorable and classy it fits perfectly.- Characters (9/10):This is probably the best thing about this show. Gag series should really focus more on its characters, they are the means the show delivers its jokes, they are the vessel that carries the dialog, and Sakamoto desu ga nails that aspect perfectly. Sakamoto is a genuinely likable character starting from the very first second he's introduced at. He's calm, daring, and cool, he affects the story on a great scale just like what a protagonist following the book should. The supporting cast is amazing, both the friend and the foe, they fulfill their roles in the most suitable way making you both love and hate them according to the situation. I can't find a single character to hate for the sake of being a badly written character, not even Fukase. congratulations on your graduation by the way.- Enjoyment (10/10):What a sit-through. I'm glad I haven't bloated through this series in a single sitting, I feel like an idol such as Sakamoto is the kind of character you need to see and hear from on a daily basis with proper breaks in between, the relationship you end up having with this fictional character is only clearly visible when you realize you're at the last 3 minutes of the series. God, I'm going to miss this show.- Overall (8.6/10):I came in for “your perfect merry-sue of your highschool” gag and came out as a follower of the Sakamoto cult, this show works wonders. Some individual skits have the potential to branch off in, to their own separate series, that's how good some of the skits were. It gets extremely wholesome and funny sometimes but some other times you are hit with the hardest ball of feels that you never see coming, it's how unpredictable it is what makes most of this show.

He literally cannot mess up. He cannot be embarrassed. No matter what happens to him, he finds the most elegant, graceful, and might I add, comedic, way through the situation.The reason this show doesn\'t quite reach that 10 mark is because the gag can start feeling repetitive around the last part of...the season.

But enough about me. We're here for our cool and suave Gary Stu, Swagamoto.In the eyes of the students at Gakubun Prefectural High School, Sakamoto is the epitome of perfection. Flawless in everything he does, he captures the hearts of young maidens in their own hazy youthful distress and garners the admiration of the average male students. I mean who else could recover so elegantly from having their chair pulled out from under...them? But all popularity comes with a price of course. Not only is he the object of admiration, but also scorn. Those who covet his reputation plot to disgrace him yet he always emerges ever more attractive.The show manages to put a comical spin on fairly human problems, problems that are so reminiscent of a typical high school setting but leave a far greater impact with their absurd resolutions. Despite facing these same problems, real life always manages to capture us in a stasis, leaving us wanting change after the last big thing. However, with Sakamoto around, there's never a dull moment. In this gray setting, he drops a splash of colour that permeates the existence of those around him. What the show manages to do is capture and recreate that ordinary youth filled with subjective spice and keep you engaged in the problems faced by the students. We resonate not with the manifestation of such exemplariness, Lord Swagamoto himself, but with those seeking his services. Any character development is the end product of one of Sakomoto's absurd skits. By simply being Sakamoto, he imparts wisdom into the lives of others in a fashion that doesn't seem over-indulgent of his niche.  Strangely enough, it makes you want to engage more in your own life, or at least that's how it was for me. We all aspire to be like Sakamoto.As alluded to before, the comedic punch in this show comes from how Sakamoto finds the most absurd solutions to every problem, facilitated by how perfectly he can execute everything. A problem a lot of people have with the show is the repetitiveness of the gags and the lack of a coherent story line. But subjectively viewed, this is a compilation of episodic character arcs which imparts morals and all that jazz I talked about earlier with each resolution. The pacing of this show and the arrangement of contrastingly-toned segments in each episode does well to mitigate the repetitiveness of the gags. However, I can understand why this show might not be for everyone.Would I recommend it? Absolutely, if it means viewers can come to appreciate what makes Sakamoto so great. Conversely, if you find yourself disillusioned with the ideals and comedy portrayed in this show, at least now you've heard - he's Sakamoto. them? But all popularity comes with a price of course.

However, I can understand why this show might not be for everyone.Would I recommend it? Absolutely, if it means viewers can come to appreciate what makes Sakamoto so great. Conversely, if you find yourself disillusioned with the ideals and comedy portrayed in this show, at least now you've heard - he's Sakamoto."", ""*SPOILER ALERT*Story: 6/10Okay so there's no actual plot in Sakamoto Desu ga. It's purely episodic with a cluster of independent plotlines about how people are drawn to Sakamoto perfect-kun due to jealousy/attraction/admiration in an attempt to either impress or degrade him but in the end Sakamoto perfect-kun overcomes all odds & obstacles and shines brighter than your dad's hair gel. The pair of short stories every episode were overall fun with some moments being really really fun while others being meh or extremely cringey.Art: 8/10Colors are great. Characters look good (Sadly most of them ONLY look good)....Sound: 10/10Ngl the opening is a banger and it's prolly one of my top anime ops of all time. The ending is also very nice.Character : 2/10Technically, you can divide the characters in three tiers. 1) Sakamoto 2) Hayabusa and 3) One-dimensional boring piece of crap. I'll try to briefly explain my opinion on each of these three tiers one-by-one.1) Sakamoto : 9/10Okay, straight up, this story is about Sakamoto and JUST Sakamoto and how good he is at everything. Honestly, I really like their approach towards drawing his character. He's not actually very emotionally invested in anyone. Infact a lot of his activities are rather robotic even though he still shows empathy and kindness to a lot of people around him. Also, here's another interpretation, in the ending it's shown that Sakamoto is leaving the school and is (clearly) lying about joining NASA so it's highly assumed that Sakamoto chose not to be super close or attached to anyone because a sad fate awaits him (Popular Theory : Sakamoto is dying) & he only wanted to be kind and generous to people during his time in school. Taking this as a fact, I think Sakamoto's character was overall perfect. Yes, I'd also write my quiet, composed and good-at-everything character the same way if I had to give him 12 episodes to live his life to the fullest. Keeping that analysis aside, Sakamoto is drawn to be perfect and invincible. He never fails at anything. All the girls go ga-ga over him, the thugs are trying to bring him down & insult him and quite frankly, it works. So, If you can focus on this show only through the main character - Perfect Sakamoto, you can make it to the end, AWAKE2) Hayabusa : 7/10This is the only, I repeat, the only LIKABLE character apart from Sakamoto with some fragments of personality. He looks good, he's shown to be witty, a lot aggressive but also portrayed to be a kind and caring brother in later part of the series. The set-up for Hayabusa was great and I liked him every time I saw him on screen but the problem is you don't see enough of him and that makes his entire appearance a bit lack-lusture and mostly INCOMPLETE.3) The rest of the cast : Overall a 1/10 maybe?Okay. So the entire supporting cast of the show apart from Hayabusa are just boring, One-dimensional and utterly useless. There were times when I kinda liked characters like Acchan, Kubota and Sera but it quickly faded away due to constantly being shadowed by Sakamoto & the abnormal Sakamoto-fan syndrome that surrounded the cast. Kubota's mother was so creepy and disgusting, it made me want to throw-up. I wish there was atleast one girl with an interesting outlook but every girl in the show is straight up fucking annoying. The intent to everyone admiring Sakamoto was meant to be comedic but how a lot of characters just utter 'Sakamoto-kun' for like 99% of the time they are on screen & nothing else makes them extremely unlikable and cringey.Enjoyment : 5/10I enjoyed it. At times that is. But yeah, not all the while. There were a few times I was cracking up really bad but there were other times when the jokes didn't work. Overall it was quite fun until the POV shifted from Sakamoto/Hayabusa to the rest of the cast because all you see is random creepy blushes & 'Sakamoto' 'Sakamoto-kun' and literally nothing else.Overall : 5/10For me, it was an okay show. Yes the entire supporting cast suck ass but prolly that is why the story is mostly focused on Sakamoto and not anyone else. If you're keen on watching anyway, I'd say try to ignore the rest of the cast apart from the two characters I mentioned and you can actually enjoy the show without cringing your ass off, well not exactly but that's for the best.

I was bursting out laughing during almost every episode. with all the different slice-of-life, high school anime out there, this one really sticks out. This is anything but another generic anime, especial with a protagonist such as Sakamoto. Not only does it entertain, but can be very heartwarming at times. It is such a fresh of breath air to not have some wimpy coward as the protagonist but instead someone people can rely on and helps to boost the people around them. This is certainly one anime I will be going...back to every few years. I am happy to say Sakamoto desu ga? is one anime I highly recommend to people wanting a more lighthearted, comedy anime. back to every few years.

The comedy is perfect, the character are loveable and the music is amazing. Not single episode went by without audible laughs from my part. Furthermore, the story was amazing, the characters developed and despite the protagonist being a perfect human being (whom in most shows would be boring) he managed to warp the people around into better versions of themselves in interesting ways. It was even realistic (aside from the hilarious Sakamoto shenanigans).A must watch for any self respecting comedy watcher. EVERYONE I KNOW LIKES THIS SHOWI long to find an anime this good ever again ', ""I watched Sakamoto Desu ga. Here are my thoughts:This is actually really funny. I consistently laughed out loud at every episode.I'd describe the humour as kind of a combination of absurdist and situational. The gags themselves are really creative too, as opposed to the same recycled humour/jokes that we've seen countless times in anime.Other characters play off of the main character (Sakamoto) well to create humour.The jazz-like OST suits the series really well and enhances the humour.The most common criticism of this anime is that it is repetitive. It's true that the humour tends to follow a similar theme (Sakamoto and his interactions with others),...but I found that there was plenty of variety among the gags themselves to entertain me. A lot of the gags were completely unpredictable (often due to their absurdity). I'm laughing to myself as I write this just thinking about it. Much of my enjoyment came from wondering what ridiculous scenario would come next and how Sakamoto would react to it.I rate this anime 8/10.One of the funniest series I've watched in recent memory. I put on every episode with happy anticipation and I was never disappointed. but I found that there was plenty of variety among the gags themselves to entertain me.

Animation isnt super good but i would say great it would look like 2014 anime even though its a 2016 one I would still commend its staff for doing...their best to make this anime their best to make this anime', ""If you want to watch a cool character doing his swag moves in a stylish manner with precise technique and add ons like meaning and message then this is the anime you're looking for.The story is about a high school boy Sakamoto who is the coolest guy ever and is stylish in every way possible.

Sakamoto will always remain stylish despite being in unfavorable situations most of the time. The episodes are in a...linear manner with a good ending.The directing, artwork, opening, and ending music were some of the best and was spot on.

Main inspiration is clearly Gintama (Aina is Otae and same kind of jokes but less crazy), they even used one of the OSTs. Probably also took one from Kaichou wa Maid-sama and changed it, it could very be an inspiration, Sakamoto being similar in attitude to Usui. They actually made an anime where not much happens, but at the end it feels like it was the most epic story ever. Nothing unnecessary like fan service, or serious...romance that dosen't go anywhere.Sakamoto is unsurprisingly always stylish but he still is human as showed as the anime goes on. It is surprisingly deep, but still is like a random popcorn show. As the anime goes on you start to learn more and more about the classmates and even the teachers. They all feel unique even if their personality is not very original. Sakamoto's motivations are not clear, the show is proposing he is just acting stylish because it's funny as a show but there is clearly something more going on. The two last scenes really do a good job in explaining it, and they couldn't have done better.As I said the show dosen't stain itself by trying to attract viewers with things like fan service, as it dosen't go with the tone of the anime. Well the girls do get a shot of his muscular legs, but it goes with the moment and this was a bad joke attempt.As for romance , the girls are interested in Sakamoto and there is a rivalry between them going on, but it is only used for jokes only, never is it implied that it will get serious. I could compare it with maid-sama where romance is clearly the main subject even if it is not the only one. This is obvious even without the thumbnail (I don't have the word, I'm a foreign tongue).Finally, It's enjoyable from start to finish, it dosen't try to mislead you and there is still a story and character developement in between the jokes.

', 'For all of you who accuse this anime of being too simple and repetitive, trust me it\'s not, it\'s actually quiet deep.Remember the song that he sang in the club? The German one?

Kara no Kyoukai Remix: Gate of Seventh Heaven,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6624/Kara_no_Kyoukai_Remix__Gate_of_Seventh_Heaven,"['Kara no Kyoukai Review Part 7What is fanservice?To many fans of anime and manga the term is used to denote content that in many other media would be considered ""questionable"", and a number of studios have begun using ecchi or near pornographic tactics in an effort to bolster the sales of DVDs, BluRays and associated merchandise. Unfortunately the average viewer continues to fall for what is effectively nothing more than a marketing tool (sex sells after all), without ever thinking that they could have more than stripes and jiggling. The resulting marginal increase in sales is then taken as proof positive that ""fanservice"" in its...current form is a viable method for marketing and selling anime, and thus there has been a gradual increase in the number of shows that feature panty shots, large breasts, lolis, moe, and the kind of nonsense that has more to in common with adolescent wet dreams than actual entertainment.It seems that the industry bigwigs have forgotten that fanservice can be a simple message of appreciation from the studios, and that contrary to popular belief it doesn\'t have to stroke the viewers ... ego. Thankfully there are a few things out there that take a slightly more wholesome stance when it comes to servicing the fans, but sadly these are rapidly becoming a rarity in an age where the focus seems more on the the area below the viewer\'s waist than the one above the neck.Gate Of The Seventh Heaven may initially appear to be nothing more than another clip show, but in truth it\'s a type of fanservice that doesn\'t demean the studio, the creators, the viewers, and anyone else associated with the franchise.Now fans of Kara no Kyoukai may already be familiar with the adventures of Ryougi Shiki, Kokutou Mikiya and Aozaki Touko as they go around solving all manner of supernatural shenanigans, usually in a fairly exciting manner. This special episode strings together a collection of choice moments from the first six installments in the series, and while the sequence of events is much abridged, the manner in which Gate Of The Seventh Heaven is constructed allows for a degree of accessibility that makes this a great introduction to the world that TYPE-MOON and Ufotable have created. The simplicity of proceedings and the straightforward approach to chronology also serves as something of an anodyne to those who had difficulty getting their head around the various jumps in time from one episode to the next, as well as addressing one of the biggest criticisms that people have had of the franchise thus far.The movies were originally released in a non chronological order similar to that used by Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, and like that series the issue of continuity has been raised several times in the past. Now while Gate Of The Seventh Heaven only touches lightly on the main thrust of the plot for each episode, it allows the viewer to gain an overview of the various events and how they link to each other over the course of the series, and even hints at some things that might occur in the future. One could argue that every clip show does this to a degree, but the difference here is that unlike the shows that feature a time sequential plot line, the Kara no Kyoukai franchise actually needs a few straightforward explanatory notes to help viewers connect events between one movie and the next.It may be surprising for many people to hear, but sometimes a clip show can be more than the sum of its parts.The surprises don\'t stop with new scenes and hints of things to come though. Ufotable have gone the extra mile for the fans, and towards the end of Gate Of The Seventh Heaven viewers can sit back and enjoy a rather well made AMV set to Kalafina\'s Oblivious.Which is a rather fitting segue to the topic of visuals.Now given the nature of this episode pretty much everything I could say about the design has already been said in my other reviews, yet even with that the extra scenes in this installment are well realised and fit neatly into the whole. In truth, the one aspect of Gate Of The Seventh Heaven that stands out is the quality of the visual editing as, contrary to popular belief, making a clip show isn\'t as easy as many people might think. The main issues to be confronted are the pacing of the storyline, the sense of perspective, and most difficult of all for a series like this, promoting the inherent continuity that may not have been obvious before, and it\'s to the credit of Ufotable that they manage to achieve this to a large degree. Granted there are a few small issues here and there, but these can be forgiven in light of the effort that has gone into making what began as a clip show into something more.As for the AMV, while it could be construed as nothing more than Ufotable ""showing off"", it\'s also rather refreshing as it\'s a definite nod to AMV creators all over the world, and a novel way of showing how much the studio have enjoyed working on the franchise.One of the hallmarks of Kara no Kyoukai has been the quality of the audio, from the voice acting and background music to the effects and choreography, and it\'s nice to see that standards have been maintained to a large degree. While a great deal of the quality for this episode is directly handed down from the individual episodes, once again it\'s the editing, timing and choreography that raises this from the realms of the clip show. That said, there are a few oddities to be found in the AMV, but as with the small flaws in the visuals, these are easy to overlook.To be honest, there\'s only one area where people may find criticism, and that\'s with the characters themselves. The Kara no Kyoukai franchise has been continuously hounded by problems with characterisation and development, partly because of the out of sequence manner in which the series has been released, and partly because the run time of each movie places a limitation on growth.The weird thing is that fans may actually criticise Gate Of The Seventh Heaven for making sense. The nature of this episode promotes the idea that the characters develop over time, mainly because of the manner in which the story is told. The fact that events follow a linear path allows viewers to see how much the characters change over the course of the franchise, and this may come as a shock to many people as while the growth of each individual tends to be more of a stop-start affair, it\'s also far more clearly defined because of the sequential nature of the plot.It\'s a well established fact that I have a soft spot for the Kara no Kyoukai franchise, but that doesn\'t mean I\'m willing to sit through an hour long clip show. To say I was surprised when the credits ran after the AMV and the final scene, would be an understatement as not only did I enjoy Gate Of The Seventh Heaven, it also clarified certains aspects of the series that were a tad confusing the first time around. Granted there are flaws here and there, and the core elements of the plot lack a degree of substance due to the highly abbreviated nature of the episode, but these can be forgiven as this installment is an enjoyable addition to the franchise if nothing else.Kara no Kyoukai: Gate Of The Seventh Heaven is about as far as one can get from the current idea of fanservice, and because of this it stands out as an example of how good all those DVD extras, OVA\'s and special episodes could be, so much so in fact that the BluRay box set (priced at $300-$400), sold out in the US in a very short space of time.Hopefully the other studios will take note and realise that fanservice doesn\'t have to be aimed at the groin. current form is a viable method for marketing and selling anime, and thus there has been a gradual increase in the number of shows that feature panty shots, large breasts, lolis, moe, and the kind of nonsense that has more to in common with adolescent wet dreams than actual entertainment.It seems that the industry bigwigs have forgotten that fanservice can be a simple message of appreciation from the studios, and that contrary to popular belief it doesn\'t have to stroke the viewers ... ego.

Granted there are a few small issues here and there, but these can be forgiven in light of the effort that has gone into making what began as a clip show into something more.As for the AMV, while it could be construed as nothing more than Ufotable ""showing off"", it\'s also rather refreshing as it\'s a definite nod to AMV creators all over the world, and a novel way of showing how much the studio have enjoyed working on the franchise.One of the hallmarks of Kara no Kyoukai has been the quality of the audio, from the voice acting and background music to the effects and choreography, and it\'s nice to see that standards have been maintained to a large degree. While a great deal of the quality for this episode is directly handed down from the individual episodes, once again it\'s the editing, timing and choreography that raises this from the realms of the clip show. That said, there are a few oddities to be found in the AMV, but as with the small flaws in the visuals, these are easy to overlook.To be honest, there\'s only one area where people may find criticism, and that\'s with the characters themselves. The Kara no Kyoukai franchise has been continuously hounded by problems with characterisation and development, partly because of the out of sequence manner in which the series has been released, and partly because the run time of each movie places a limitation on growth.The weird thing is that fans may actually criticise Gate Of The Seventh Heaven for making sense. The nature of this episode promotes the idea that the characters develop over time, mainly because of the manner in which the story is told. The fact that events follow a linear path allows viewers to see how much the characters change over the course of the franchise, and this may come as a shock to many people as while the growth of each individual tends to be more of a stop-start affair, it\'s also far more clearly defined because of the sequential nature of the plot.It\'s a well established fact that I have a soft spot for the Kara no Kyoukai franchise, but that doesn\'t mean I\'m willing to sit through an hour long clip show. To say I was surprised when the credits ran after the AMV and the final scene, would be an understatement as not only did I enjoy Gate Of The Seventh Heaven, it also clarified certains aspects of the series that were a tad confusing the first time around. Granted there are flaws here and there, and the core elements of the plot lack a degree of substance due to the highly abbreviated nature of the episode, but these can be forgiven as this installment is an enjoyable addition to the franchise if nothing else.Kara no Kyoukai: Gate Of The Seventh Heaven is about as far as one can get from the current idea of fanservice, and because of this it stands out as an example of how good all those DVD extras, OVA\'s and special episodes could be, so much so in fact that the BluRay box set (priced at $300-$400), sold out in the US in a very short space of time.Hopefully the other studios will take note and realise that fanservice doesn\'t have to be aimed at the groin.', ""The Garden of Sinners: Remix -Gate of Seventh Heaven- is an exceptional anime movie that retells the Kara no Kyoukai movie series in a fresh and cohesive manner.

Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22817/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_Returns,"['- This review does not take any considerations of any previous Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo material, and the series will be treated just by itself -Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns is, of course, a sequel to Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo, which was a long running series (148 episodes) in the 90s that has also inspired, movies, OVAs and a live action series. First thing I\'ll make clear is that you don\'t really need to watch any previous material to enjoy Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns by itself.This series target a very specific type of audience, and that\'s the people who like crime fiction. If you...don\'t like crime fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Hercules Poirot, Conan Edogawa, etc), then you really shouldn\'t waste your time with Kindaichi. Now, if you do like it, you\'ll more than likely enjoy the show.Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns doesn\'t really have a big story that will go progressing. There is a clear antagonist who\'s known as the puppetmaster, but there is not really much story progress with him. The whole series will be different arcs with their particular murder (or more commonly, serial killing), in which Kindaichi, our young protagonist and detective, will be involved and will have to resolve th mystery behind. Pretty much our standard crime fiction.The series manages to create some pretty entertaining cases, and does give the viewer an opportunity to think about the cases and try to resolve them by themselves. In general, they\'re not that difficult to resolve, and giving it a bit of thought and by being attentive to details, you\'ll more than likely figure the killer, and at least part of the method in which he did the killing and/or forge his alibi.They do sometimes come up with things that they just didn\'t tell the viewer before Kindaichi resolved the case, which makes impossible to resolve some cases completely by oneself.The music selection is pretty adequate to the situations and helps creating a good atmosphere, and I find particularly helpful that in every episode they give you a picture with every possible suspect.This is a show you enjoy by not just watching, but by trying to think alongside it. As stated before, there are some flaws sometimes, but the series does invite you to think, and you will miss part of the enjoyment if you don\'t, most likely.There are really only four constant characters throughout the show (maybe five) and they all accomplish their roles very well. There is not much character development, but again, that\'s really not the point in the series.While being something very known as a typical crime fiction, Kindaichi manages to be relatively unique in the anime world, as there are not many anime of this type, probably because they\'re not that easy to write and require a lot of creativity by their authors. Of course, whenever you hear ""Kindaichi"", the first response will more than likely be ""Conan"", and of course, vice-versa (and it should be that way, as they\'re obviously similar anime).If you like crime fiction, aka, mystery with detective stuff, by all means, give Kindaichi a chance. don\'t like crime fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Hercules Poirot, Conan Edogawa, etc), then you really shouldn\'t waste your time with Kindaichi.

Is Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns as good as the original? Not really. But it is a decent series in its own right.The story is very episodic in nature, so there's no need to watch the original series before this. The original series is very episodic in nature as well, so the only thing that really connects the two series is its cast of characters. There is no major overall plot, but a series like this doesn't really need one.The animation isn't...anything special. It's basically an updated, cleaner version of the original series. There isn't anything particularly impressive about the animation, but the animation still gives the viewer a clear idea of what's happening and doesn't look inherently bad. It just isn't anything special, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be.The sound isn't anything special either, but it fulfills its purpose. There are some recycled tunes from the original series, which is a nice little touch. The opening and ending themes aren't terribly memorable, but they aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The soundtrack does do an adequate job of setting the mood for the mysteries, and the voice acting is pretty solid.The series has two main characters and a couple of recurring characters. None of them go through any arcs or development, but given the episodic nature of this series, character development isn't really necessary. We do get introduced some intriguing characters in the mysteries, however. When the mysteries unfold and the motivations become clear, they are often times heartbreaking.Overall, I would say I enjoyed my time watching this series. The cases are generally pretty interesting, and it's always fun trying to guess who the culprit is. I will say this, however: The cases in this series aren't quite as intriguing as the cases in the original series. The cases in the original series are much darker and result in a lot more death. This series does have some dark cases (especially near the end), but the cases in the original, in my opinion, were far more interesting.If you're a fan of Kindaichi, then definitely give this a try.

You can't guess the culprit till Kindaichi reveals it. The reveal and how the culprit did the murder or theft(Mostly murders) is my favorite part. Everything from the start of the case links to the murder and it confuses the watcher who the real culprit is. You think of someone from the suspects to be the murder but someone is.Dislike-The characters are not that great. There is no character development. Other than Kindaichi and Akemichi(An genuis inspector),...everyone seems a fool. The others don't realise the most common things. If a murder has taken place, they would first scream and be surprised like everyone else but the next minute they would go casual. The animation by Toho is not bad, but most of the times it feels that the animation is not in flow.Overall, I liked the story but disliked the characters. everyone seems a fool.

"Lupin III: Episode 0 ""First Contact""",https://myanimelist.net/anime/1418/Lupin_III__Episode_0_First_Contact,"[""*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* (I did try but it's hard not to: the episode's very good)Let's start with the story: it's not the best but it keeps you watching intently. The main reason it achieves this is simply that it is the recollection of how the gang all first met, including Zenigata! My main criticism is the contradiction with previous episodes, or rather the re telling of events at a different time and place. The main example is Goemon, in the original series he meets Lupin with intention of killing him and they have a cool battle of wits resulting in them being friends. What happens here...is not very disimilar or worse, in fact it's better than the original portayal, but since I'd watched the original series before this it just stuck in my head. However, these slight contradictions with the series from the seventies are easily forgivable just after watching the scene in which Jigen and Lupin first meet. Yet, the New York setting just doesn't seem appropriate (I don't know why, because really it should be a perfect setting).The interactions between the characters is highly enjoyable especially Jigen and Lupin, whom have rivalry that just seems to make me grin. This is even more so near the end when the two establish their friendship, particualrly with Lupin's promise to Jigen.The two's actions also reveal the origns of Lupin's famous car.The actions of Zenigata are as usual hilarious but for different reasons: HE WINS FOR ONCE! I know I shouldn't say spoilers but if you're a Zenigata fan you need to see the scene where he beats up an entire bad New York neighbourhood. Plus a there is very good look into why Zenigata becomes so hard headed in his pursuit of Lupin. A nice little additive is that initially Lupin wasn't the reason he was in New York, I'll let you guess who he was there to catch.As usual Lupin is set on stealing a certain item that is owned and guarded by scary people (including Jigen) and sought after those as crafty as himself (i.e. Fujiko).The action sequences are very impressive, particularly for the retelling of Goemon meeting Lupin, and the artwork is flawless for the style chosen. I've just grown attcached to the old feel of both the first and second TV series animations.There several intersting plot devices to keep one hooked for the story and numerous awesome action sequences to serve the same purpose, however the crowning jewel is the ending. Summed up it is Lupin being Lupin at his best and it just makes you want to smile, and spend hours listening to the great jazz edition of the tradmark theme music, while watching Lupin and co outwit Zenigata and everyone else by three steps. is not very disimilar or worse, in fact it's better than the original portayal, but since I'd watched the original series before this it just stuck in my head.

Lupin III , Fujiko , Jigen, Goemon and Inspector Zenigata are the characters in the story. Lupin, Fujiko and Goemon are all after the same artifact and Jigen is working for the mafia that has the treasure. Inspector Zenigata is following a lead on the criminal Fujiko. The setting Takes...place In New York.The story is probally not as acurate on how they met but other than Goemon meeting Lupin im not to sure how Jigen and Fujiko met up with Lupin. What story does that is interesting is that it stays true what would happen when they did meet and how they interact with each other. And they pull this off really good. The setting in New York through me off a little bit because I would imagine they would meet up in Japan but mabey to make the story more intersting New York was the best betThe animation is great it has more of that new anime style while staying true to the character designs. Some of goemon scenes cutting up stuff is really kool to watch.Sound is great the music has top notch jazz stuff. Voice Acting was off the hook. What I really liked to have seen was the great Yasou Yamada (1995) voice Lupin in this special because It was truly worthy of him. Im not taking anything away from Kurita because his voice acting of Lupin was something really special especially the scenes with Jigen and Lupin III.The characters were the best part of the special. They were portrayed exactly how they should be in every special. Lupin III being himself taking nothing serious, Jigen being himself very serious and Stuborn, Goemon also being very stuborn and slashing away at everything In sight when fighting Lupin. Fujiko with her charm and seducing ways to backstab people and Inspector Zenigata who is brilliant and tough yet clumsy but always giving Lupin III headaches.I Really enjoyed this special. I would reccommend Lupin III episode Zero First Contact to anyone Lupin fan or not, Especially If you are looking to get into the Lupin Franchise because this is a great watch. place In New York.The story is probally not as acurate on how they met but other than Goemon meeting Lupin im not to sure how Jigen and Fujiko met up with Lupin.

Mutsu Enmei Ryuu Gaiden: Shura no Toki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/340/Mutsu_Enmei_Ryuu_Gaiden__Shura_no_Toki,"[""In a battle between an armed opponent and an unarmed one, does the armed opponent have an advantage? Not if the unarmed person practices Mutsu Enmei-Ryu.Shura No Toki (Age of Chaos) follows 3 generations of practitioners of the Mutsu Enmei-Ryu UNARMED fighting style. The animation is probably the weakest part of this series but the fighting more than makes up for it, this is the most &quot;technical&quot; martial arts I've seen in an anime, without any of the &quot;style&quot;, &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;special powers&quot; elements interfering with the purity of the art. This alone elevates this series above any other martial arts type anime offerings.The first...arc is about famed swordsman Miyamoto who seeks nothing more than to find an opponent who can &quot;challenge&quot; him in a fight. He turns down a nobleman's bodyguard job offer and instead suggests the nobleman hire a ruffian eating at the nearby road side stall, a ruffian with a strong aura. The ruffian is Yakumo Mutsu, a member of the mutsu clan.  When fights begin, Yakumo distinguishes himself by never using any weapons. One never knows what direction the first arc is heading in, but expects that Miyamoto and Yakumo will have a showdown ... sometime!The second arc is about ONE martial arts tournament. The story centers around revenge but I enjoyed this arc just for exposure to the various martial arts styles and methods of defeating opponents. The martial arts was so good in this arc that I rewatched it 3 times. While I normally like plots, in this arc I felt it got in the way of the martial arts tournament, which was a pure joy to watch.The third and final arc set during the Meiji Revolution is the most plot driven. At times I felt the plot twists detracted too much from the premise of Shura No Toki martial arts, and it did not seem to feature as much martial arts as the previous two arcs. In addition this was set in a later era where there were guns, sigh. No matter how good the plot I found myself comparing this to Rurouni Kenshin, and Shura No Toki's 26 episodes just can't deliver the same amount of storytelling that 100 episodes can. So the ending tried to be too &quot;historical&quot; and skimped on the martial arts action.All in all, I've never seen another anime like Shura No Toki. My buddies who are serious martial arts freaks were all majorly impressed by the fight scenes from a real life technical aspect. We all agreed it was the best example of hand to hand vs. (insert weapon) we've seen. The animation was ok, the sound was good, the story was great, albeit uneven. But everyone enjoyed the characters and action a lot.

In this series they manage to pack so much into each episode without it feeling rushed at all. I really think they did well here because even though each episode was around 20mins it felt just right. The story was pretty good fitting these characters into history which I thought was really good the thing that got me was the 3 different generations, which I thought was awesome. Overall the story is really enjoyable but the last generation is the best. It kept me hooked.Art: Ok, first let me point out that this...series didn't have a huge budget like other anime where they are able have amazing design due to great financial support. Even though this is the case they still do a good job of keep it presentable BUT i think the TRUE art style they wouldn't to use was the style from episode 24 which was stunning. I think it was unfortunate that the whole series wasn't like thisSound: I believe that the sound for this series was pretty good. The sound track was pretty decent overall. The piano piece I think was amazing personally but the other music was ok.Character: One thing about this series was that there weren't any characters that were straight up annoying like SOOOOO many anime. All the featured characters were pretty enjoyable to watch and through character development to started to care for them more and more even though each generation of people is only about 7-9 episodes each.Enjoyment: YES!!! I really enjoyed this anime and recommend it to anyone. As I said before there weren't any annoying characters which is a GREAT plus but also the way that everything flows keeps you wanting to watch and holds your attention. While the fighting isn't flashy due to super powers its still quite interesting seeing the main characters fight bare handed against legendary fighters.Overall: If you are reading this then WATCH THIS ANIME!!! I enjoyed it very much but as I said I think it would've been much better if they had more of a budget because then I think it would've been 10s all the way but can't have everything ^_^ series didn't have a huge budget like other anime where they are able have amazing design due to great financial support.

It has 3 distinct arcs, one around the beginning of theTokugawa reign, where the hero meets Musashi, one in the time of Iemitsu,the third Tokugawa shougun, and one around the time of the Meiji rebellion.Historically, there probably wasn't a roundhouse using martial art in Japantill the 20th century, but if one suspends a bit of historical knowledge,...the martial artist and history buff can both enjoy the series.  It's farmore respectful of history than say, Sengoku Basara. Almost all of themartial arts in the series are realistic.  They sometimes use the popularmartial arts movie technique of showing a move, then going back in slowmotion to show what actually happened.The gerneral animation isn't spectacular. As has been mentioned in other reviews,during fight scenes, the background often disappears, but that's fine, itallows the watcher to pay more attenion to the action.  The drawing of themartial arts movements is well done and realistic.The plots are relatively straightforward.  In the first arc, a Mutsu Enmeipractioner, Mutsu Yakumo meets the famous Musashi.  The monk Takuan, knownto those who have read up on Mushashi, or the Yagyuus, also makes a small appearance.In the second arc,  Mutsu Takato, who is probably his son, drawn the same way thoughwith a different voice actor, participates in a tournament and meets several of the Yagyuus,including Juubei and Munenori (who wrote a treatise that is still around intransation, the Sword and the Mind.)  Those who are fans of Munenori maynot like how he is portrayed here--he's not exactly evil, but he seemssomewhat cowardly and political.  Historically, Munenori once singlehandedlykilled 7 assassins sent after the shougun, but, one does wonder about theactual circumstances as one swordsman against 7 usually only works in themovies.  At any rate, Juubei is the heroic Yagyuu here in this series.The last arc seemed somewhat different. The plot seemed to go a bit moreslowly, but I was moved by the fate of many of the characters.This one takes place around thetime of the Meiji restoration, and Mutsu Izumi, again drawn identically but with a different voie actor,  becomes friends with thestatesman Sakamoto Ryuu.  He also runs into the Shinsengumi, including twoof their most famous members, Okita Souji and Hijikata Toshizou.Although I did enjoy the third arc, it did seem to drag at times, and probably had less action.Some of the fights in this one stuck me as less realistic than the other two arcs.Although much of it was driven by the trope of skilled martial artistlooking for a challenging opponent, one could care about almost all of thecharacters. I liked the interpretations of almost all of the historicalfigures.  There was a certain lack of realism of course--for example,disrespect to a shougun was tolerated in a way that it wouldn't have been inthat time, but I think that any martial artist will forgive its historicalaccuracy lapses and be glad of fight scenes that could actually happen.To go through the standardized ratings quickly.The art was fairly simple, but the fight scenes themselves were well-drawn. As that was one of the most interesting things for me, I didn't care about the background blanking out during the fights.  I'll give it a 7, most for the fight scenes.  However, the rest certainly wasn't terrible--it didn't (for me), detract from the show.As for sound, neither opening nor closing song really moved me, I usually skipped them, so it gets a 6.The characters get an 8.  I think the trope of fighter looking for a challenge is overused, but I enjoyed each presentation of the historical characters.The enjoyment and overall rating are a 9 for me--I think it was probably greater than the sum of its parts.  I don't know how much I would enjoy it had  I not been involved in martial arts, but after seeing so many absurd fights in anime, realistic ones are a refreshing change. the martial artist and history buff can both enjoy the series.

I've started with Shura no Mon, and then towards Shura no Toki (in Manga). Soon after, I found out that there was an anime of it, and quickly rushed to my computer to watch it.This anime is quite unlike most of the martial arts animes, since this is pure fighting. No magic, no energy thingys, etc.This is one of the many factors that makes this anime one of my favorites.The story has 3 arcs, all involving one of the most famous Japanese Samurais.The first one...involves Miyamoto Musashi, very famous in Japan for his two sword style. The main character in the first arc (Mutsu Yagumo) ends up fighting against him.The second one is about 70% fighting. It involves many well known swordsman, including the son-in-law of Miyamoto Musashi, and Yagyuu Juubei, another well known, and famous swordsman. I personally think this was the worst out of the 3 arcs, but it was still great.The third one, is a paradise for Japanese History freaks like me. It involves the end of Edo Era, and many famous swordsman (Sakamoto Ryoma, Hijikata Toshizo, Okita Souji, etc.) This part rather focuses on a tragedy more than a martial art fight, but involves the best fighting combinations ever.For the art, it's not good, but it's not awful. The fighting and the story completely makes up for it. It's not something you can't watch, but it's definitely not one of those cute little anime girls playing around in a paradise. The art style is a little realistic.The sound is great also. Completely fits in with the story, OP+EP = amazing. What more can I say?The characters are another very good factor that helps make this anime amazing. All the characters seem very realistic and all the historical characters are very similar, if not same to themselves.Almost all the samurais love fighting(which was true for Japan) against strong people to make them stronger.All the Mutsu characters have a great, unique personality, making the 3 arcs unique and not redundant.Overall, I really loved this. I don't even know why many people don't know such a great show.If you've read the whole thing, thanks! I hope my review helps you.Also, read the manga if you enjoyed it. It has better arcs in my opinion (Nobunaga and Yoshitune)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you are a Japanese history freak, read this also:If you are worried that this anime will change what actually happened (history), don't worry.The best part about this is that the author solved many mysteries in this world (eg: Miyamoto Musashi writing in his diary/book that he has lost once, which he has never done in real history, the mystery behind Juubei's death, the mystery behind Ryoma's survival at Teradaya, the mystery behind Okita's death, and the mystery behind Hijikata's Death) by adding many characters that was behind the thing. involves Miyamoto Musashi, very famous in Japan for his two sword style.

When did this happen? Since when did Musashi become an idiot? He never challenged someone to fight unless he was certain he was going to win. And Musashi almost NEVER fought fairly. He always used some kind of underhanded trick to ensure that he would win. Anyone who read his book would know that he had no patience for honor or fairness in combat. Also, losing to an unarmed guy?

The fighting in this anime is spot on but has one big flaw. After the first arc the fighting gets tedious. You will see the same moves over and over again causing you to lose interest. The same side step used to get out of the way of a sword is used again and again.This anime had a great first arc with Mitsu Yakumo. This arc itself would grant the anime a 10/10. Sadly there were 4 arcs which over time got worse...and worse. What made the first arc so good was the perfect mix of action and dialogue. From the second arc on more dialogue is used and less fighting. The quality in both seemed to be worse also due to laziness in writing and the sheer fact that we've seen most of the fighting moves many time because of the first arc.If you are going to watch this anime just watch the first arc. The first arc is worth a 10/10 as i said and the rest probably a 7/10. and worse. What made the first arc so good was the perfect mix of action and dialogue.

I can dig it…Ending 7/10NO spoilers, the end was alright… No much to say here…', ""The Good:A story that very much reminded me of Ruroni Kenshin except the main character does not have any qualms with killing a guy.  Set in Japan before it opened its ports in the 1800s so having taken several Japanese history classes it was nice to know a little of what was going on especially in the last arc with the Shinsengumi.  It spans the story over several generations of the main character's family, too bad it never focuses on anything but the current generation and does not show anything of what is happening with the older.  The female leads have unique...personalities and can actually hold their own in a fight...most of the time.  Bromance is the basis of the last arc.  The fights can be interesting to watch especially in the tournament arc with different styles and weapons.  Martial arts without weapons as the main focus is very welcome considering the time period it is set in where the usual focus would be a samurai.The Bad:Art and animation is decent, nothing special.

The main reason this anime gets a 10 is because it delivers on what it sets out to do which is make a martial arts anime. It kept to its nature throughout and told the history of japan pretty well and more specifically of martial arts along with it.The action was amazing, the characters were likeable.If you're going into this show wanting something deep, dont. It's an amazing historical show but not some tear-jerking anime. Enjoy it as an action, martial arts, history anime. ""]"

And since the season just started, the epic battles are yet to come.So for everyone who likes sports anime, give it a try. It\'s worth itFor Prince of tennis fans: ECHIZEN\'S BACK!! ""Mada mada, da ne"" :D ', ""WOW i have never been a fan of prince of tennis but i just saw the new one and i love the new feel of it! definitly an anime I'm going to keep up with :DD and I'm sure that anyone who loved the prince of tennis is going to love this new one! "", 'I liked it. Prince of Tennis is one of my top favorite animes...but this new season...STORYThe story is ok, there is a plot...sort of. It\'s pretty basic, and not very complicated. The comedy is not sidesplitting. The matches seem repeating, but the techniques they have now are not like the first anime; they make you go ""oh cool"", unlike the first season where I was beyond excitement.What devastated me beyond repair is the ending. To not spoil anything, I will not go in detail. It is among the worst ending I have ever watched, and if it\'s not for the following reasons, I am really...annoyed:1) Creating another season2) Mid-breakARTThe art is pretty much the same. I don\'t EVER have a preference in art for anime or manga, unless it\'s unbearable to look at. Whatever the art is, it\'s usually easy to adjust to. The NPOT is not exceptionally detailed like CLAMP, but it\'s not amateur like the really, really old mangas. The expressions shown are understandable.SOUNDI don\'t pay attention to the sound much, unless, of course, it is impossible to decipher any words they are saying. The quality this time was not very good...there was the occasional static around the voices and afterwards. The voices of the actors sometimes sounded muffled. The background sounds were pretty basic sounds, but it\'s as expected, same as the art level. As for the static problem, it might have just been the source, maybe it sounded fine if someone bought the DVDs, whereas I watched it online. And as always, Japanese seiyuus are amazing!ENJOYMENTI enjoyed it as always. I waited eagerly for each episode to come out, and was never disappointed. After finishing one, you just want to watch the next one ASAP! The matches made my attention go down a bit, but I drank in every detail because I am just that big of a fan of POT.OVERALLI would recommend it only for patient or experienced anime watchers. As it is a sports anime, it may be hard for your attention span, and is not a good first impression for an anime newbie. POT is still better, and of course watch that before you watch this! annoyed:1) Creating another season2) Mid-breakARTThe art is pretty much the same.

The New Prince of Tennis is had a completely different atmosphere that I didn\'t expect.Story [7]: The story was acceptable. 50 middle school representatives from the national champions go to the U-17 Japanese representative camp against high school students. I thought it was interesting at first, except when that started to change further in. Then, the story started going downhill from there. I nearly...dropped it because it had nearly nothing to do with tennis. There were barely any tennis matches in the second half and I started to lose interest, but then regained it in the last episodes.The comedy wasn\'t as great, but it was there to an extent.Of course, I think that New Prince of Tennis would have been better if it had more episodes to work with. Most of the matches weren\'t that bad but it would have been more climatic if it were longer.Art [8]: Nothing much to say.. the art is much more modern, brighter and sharp, which is an improvement.Sound [6]: To say the least, I didn\'t like the opening and ending themes to New Prince of Tennis. I thought that it didn\'t fit properly at all, even though I had listened to them multiple times. (I absolutely loved most Prince of Tennis\' opening/ending themes). The seiyuus\' did their job but they weren\'t superbly brilliant.Character [7]: It was nice to see the old characters back with some development and not just Seigaku\'s.  However, others were almost completely left out. A lot of characters just said a few sentences. New characters weren\'t that intense either since they didn\'t show up all that often.Enjoyment [7]: Overall, it was an arguable anime. I did enjoy it but it didn\'t live up to my expectations.Overall [7]: I can\'t give it a higher score for New Prince of Tennis since it screwed up a bit at the midpoint of the story, and it didn\'t have an overload of tennis. (What would you expect? ""New Prince of \'Tennis\'"").New Prince of Tennis is worth watching if you want more material, but don\'t get your hopes too high if you think it\'ll be as good as the original. To me, it definitely is a let down and it didn\'t have a huge impact on me. dropped it because it had nearly nothing to do with tennis.

I absolutely loved the series and am still reading the manga. But I am not here to rate and talk about the whole series. I am here to talk about this particular season, I am going to review the 13 episodes I watched.The story starts off where the last one ended. Seigaku became national champion and almost all of its regular members have left. But where are we now? Now we suddenly are at a U-17 training camp for tennis. And this U-17 camp is for the representatives of Japan....I was really disappointed by this set-up. It would have been interesting to see Tezuka, Fuji and the rest fade to the background while Arai and others become regulars and face a hard time trying to defend their title. Instead we get this. A clusterfuck of characters where each of them get 5 minutes of actually playing tennis and not creating a single good match. I am here to watch a lengthy exciting tennis match, damn it!Like I said, the characters getting about 5 minutes of screen time each is disappointing. Another thing which was quite Prince of Tennis like was a training camp. Oh wait, again? Yes, again. And to be honest it isn\'t even exciting, there is not some kind of big challenge ahead. And the only thing we see them doing is run around saying ""I can\'t accept this training"" and then ""I finally understand the meaning of this.""What I am saying with this is; a good build up is wasted without a (proper) story. In the case of New Prince of Tennis it might be different, this time around they only got 13 episodes to air and for such a slow paced anime which likes to take its time to create amazing matches. It has been far too little.Art. There is not a lot to say about it. It is as good as it was in its prequel. Which may sound disappointing, but certainly is not. The faces of the characters seem alive and lots variances in their faces.Animation is also superb like it was. The actual tennis has lots of moving around and nothing sloppy for me to criticise.Sound is a part of the review which never is heavy for my final score. Because frankly there is not too much to talk about, the opening was not to my tastes. It doesn\'t fit a usually action packed anime like Prince of Tennis. The voice actors didn\'t change from the previous series as far as I noticed.The one problem Prince of Tennis always had is: Characters. It had way too many of them. And it also unnecessarily revives supporting characters over and over again too give the already big bunch of main characters even less screen time. Not saying any of them really sucks, but they are unneeded. I think if it cut back on the characters used for this 13 episode anime. There would have been a lot more actual action and tennis matches.Though I will say this. Even though it always had way too much characters. All of them were entertaining too watch when put them up against each other and the ""evil"" team was actually seemingly a bit malicious.Overall I didn\'t enjoy this. The plot wasn\'t what I would have liked it to be. And the characters were in to many numbers and little of them contributed to the plot.Strong points:- The variety of characters were not similar and all of them had their own little thing.- The goal for the protagonist was set high and was not overcome with ""resolve"".- The comedy was quite good.Weak points:- You need not look further than the characters page, it has way too many and created for little plot.- Cut-off matches. Only small portions of a tennis match were shown and far too less happened.- The opening song did not fit for its theme: Tennis.So if you loved the prequel for its characters and was not a too big fan of the action, you will probably dislike this one.Life lesson learnt: Quality over quantity.

This is more or less an analysis of New Prince of Tennis, as it pertains to the original anime, so it\'s less structured and doesn\'t go in-depth on anything that isn\'t being compared to the original Prince of Tennis.*To say that I had high hopes for New Prince of Tennis would be, you guessed it, an understatement. The original Prince of Tennis was not just an anime, it was THE anime, to me. It was that enigma that, despite seeming to be ""just a sports anime,"" managed to capture my heart and rose above...all other anime in my favorites list. That\'s not to say that it\'s better or even that I like it more than any of my other favorites, it is simply ""above,"" because it\'s the one anime that I feel the closest connection to, it\'s that anime where I feel most centered.So yes, I had very high hopes for New Prince of Tennis!I started out skeptical, and this skepticism quickly grew in its intensity. The opening song didn\'t really match well with the visuals, the setting had switched from the comfort of Seigaku to a never-before-mentioned hardcore high school training camp that seems to be all sorts of hostile, and worst of all, it felt like the people making this anime were just trying to pander to long-time Prince of Tennis fans by over-using the shallowest aspect of each character, rather than allow them to act naturally. I dare you to find more than 2 consecutive lines from Inui that weren\'t just stating some arbitrary percentages. I felt anything but at home with this anime at the beginning, and this lasted for about 7 episodes.But after that, everything was right again. They actually had matches that took up whole episodes (you just don\'t get that same emotional impact when the matches are short enough to fit 4 or more into a single episode), the characters weren\'t stale any more, finally, FINALLY it felt like Prince of Tennis again! I was prepared to dismiss this entire anime as a failure, but I\'m very pleased that I stuck with it, because the second half or so is quite good. If you are a Prince of Tennis fan, you certainly should not miss New Prince of Tennis. The weird mismatched opening sequence even started growing on me after a while.However, despite how good it got at the end, the first half should not be overlooked. The writers are partially to blame for the bad pacing and shallow, well, everything about those episodes, but I attribute most of the sense of awkwardness to the fact that this anime is only 13 episodes long. A Prince of Tennis story of this magnitude should not be confined to so few episodes, and from what I remember of the manga, a LOT is left out in this anime, and that just doesn\'t work as well as one would hope. This is the only thing that\'s keeping me from adding this to my collection of ""perfect 10"" Prince of Tennis arcs/seasons on MAL.But what can I say, it\'s Prince of Tennis. It\'s a good time, you should watch it if you liked the first anime. all other anime in my favorites list.

OMG New Prince of Tennis takes place after the Nationals Tournaments arc. Echizen Ryoma and everyone is back!!!! Yeah!!!! Down to the story- it seems that Team Seigaku and the other teams are invited to this institute U-17 to see who is the best players- Middle school and High School players.My guess the best players would be put into a team later on in the series(guessed based on the OP song)  So they are pitted against one another. Player ranks from 1-10. 1 being the...best and 10 and lower weakest. We meet 3 High school players who are the main focus of this series. They are in top 5 court ranks. Prince of Tennis Fan Rejoice!!!!!! 10/10  I love Prince of Tennis !!! best and 10 and lower weakest. We meet 3 High school players who are the main focus of this series.

Good to see this new series, albeit a short one.Just for starter, everybody is in this series, and I mean everybody, from Tezuka to Atobe,. The series rely on your familiarity of PoT in general. Oh, they are also adding the high school players. This may alienate new viewers, but the story is fairly simple that it shouldn\'t be a big issue. Just don\'t expect much. It\'s only 13 episodes.And that\'s where the story is a bit of a letdown. The opening made it seem like they would form a new ""ultimate"" team at the...end of the series, but obviously it won\'t happen in just 13 episodes. This feels more like a teaser, for the upcoming season(s), maybe. The episode where Tezuka played with Seigaku\'s former captain was the highlight of the series for me. It\'s still the typical PoT pattern (or pretty much any sports/fighting anime), and features even more ridiculous training and tennis moves in addition to fan favorites, but the short series made it so a lot of the matches being cut short/over-simplified. This is true especially in the end. But at least the fan service is there. I mean come on, who doesn\'t want to see Tezuka zone one more time? In short, it\'s a teaser series for the fans.Everything else, it\'s PoT. The same animation, moves, etc. It\'s fair. If you are a PoT fan, you already know what to expect. If you\'re new to the series, it won\'t hurt to watch the previous series first and/or consult your online sources to get some background on the multitude of characters.

Please forgive me in advance for i know for sure that i\'ll commit a ton of errors whether in the usage of the words and anything else for i am not that inclined in the English language. This is gonna be my second review so please be considerate if there are unforgivable errors. Note: Comparisons will be surely mentionedOkay, Let me start off this review by giving my own opinion on it\'s story then after that giving my rating to the other aspects in reviewing...an anime.Story: 7/10At first, When I saw this coming. I was like ""doubting"" if i should watch this or not \'cause i\'ve been a fan of it\'s 1st season and the 1st installment was actually good. I really never knew that they will be airing a second season \'cause i think it was the end (I am not a manga reader that\'s why). Above all that, I gave this one a mediocre 7 \'cause it\'s like the first one. There are plot developments going on but it didn\'t really implant a sense of viewership for me. Tbh, The first one was a lot better but this one\'s good enough to keepn the viewer going on what he/she is watching.Art: 8/10Compared to the 1st season, the art is a little bit upgraded with slight changes. Its enough to keep the viewer on watching. I have no other comments than this one \'cause they\'ve done pretty well with the art. It\'s more like an innovated Prince of Tennis art style. Much better than the 1st installment.Sound: 7/10Sound? It\'s Good. I have nothing to say about this. I guess I\'ll go with ""It\'s good enough"" The voice actors did a good job and I have no complaints or whatsoever. The sound effects were good but it can be worked out due in order to be better.Character: 8/10Very Good. Completely the same with the first one. There were some that were deep and there were some that were shallow. In fact, the characters does imply some good values that needs to be learned in a field of sport, Not only sports but a wide variety of fields. whether it may be on something good or  something bad (You can even apply it in real life so+1 there).Enjoyment: 6/10I\'m Glad that I enjoyed this one even if it was not that great in terms in keeping me in tact with it. Good so far but could be better. There was a lack of awesome fights that\'s why i didn\'t enjoy it that much.Overall: 7/10Pretty Good Series with a good charcter development and story development.

Mediocre Series.Great Series if your a sport fan.', 'So the most arrogant sports protagonist with the equally most arrogant characters returns in the anime world again with its new series.With a new series comes with a new story as the majority of the players from the previous one are gathered in a training camp. There are new and much bigger obstacles that the players have to face. It is way harder than all the obstacles they’ve faced before. There’s also a whole new and different kind of drama. The previous one was interesting enough but I think it was still lacking with the certain excitement that would make you anticipate what was really...happening. This time, I believe it is way more interesting and exciting as there are some twists in the story.I am not really following the manga so I am not sure with the time gap from the last one but I am pretty sure it’s not that long since the national tournament but I think there are some characters who noticeably grown, particularly Ryoma. Oftentimes, I am genuinely wondering if these guys are really middle schoolers. It is given that with a new series comes with new characters as well. But the fun and interesting part is that we get to see almost all the characters from different schools working together. Enemies of yesterday are “nakamas” of today. As the characters are divided, we get to see who will improve more. It’s the battle of the players training in the modern way with the most advance technology or the players training in the most primitive way of survival in the mountains. We also get to see characters that seemed so invincible before, push to their limits and actually get beaten for the first time which really proves that the opponents this time are in a complete different level.I strongly believe that the most obvious improvement and change is the animation. Now, we get to see what the series would look like if it’s done today. There are tremendous improvements in the character designs. Some of the nasty looking characters are now gorgeous looking. Sometimes, it feels surreal seeing their 2012 versions. Before I know it, I am already snapping away lots of pictures with just the first few episodes of it. But what I am more excited about is how the moves and techniques improved this time around. As always, this series just loves exaggerated moves which makes it look like it is no longer tennis at all but that’s just the way this series is. But the good thing is, it really improves now. It is no longer overly done. It is cleaner and a lot sophisticated compared to the lousy ones before. You can really feel that it is latest.I genuinely like this one way, way more compared to the ones. It definitely improved a lot in almost all important aspects of it.

It is no longer what it used to be in its previous seasons, the plot itself of this new adaptation is very basic and simply happens for the convenience of the show and wants to extend something more than necessary.This time we are introduced to our Seigaku team to attend a special invitation training camp of the U-17 national team. At first glance one could say that...the proposal is striking and interesting, however when following the show with 2 or 3 chapters you will realize that this premise is too superficial and monotonous, it does not really seek to put a clear objective within it and the line That it traces history is very evident, bringing Ryoma to the top of the national team, which is not a problem because we know it beforehand at this point in history. The real problem is everything else, the reuse of characters from their previous installments for the obvious convenience of the show and that they also do not provide too much dynamism and occupy necessary time, continuing with the typical execution of ""arrival to a new environment, fail, train and return to beat them all. ""Finally, the matches, that if they had already been a topic that in the national championship only lasted 1 chapter per match, imagine now that there are only a few matches and most of them are not very flashy and do not last more than about 10 minutes?In short, there is little to rescue and I am sorry to give it such a low score, but there is no way to save it.Art: 8.75Animation, designs and colors is undoubtedly the only thing that saves this adaptation and far surpasses its predecessor deliveries, since by having the collaboration of ""IG Productions"" it gains great strength both in fluid character movements and very striking colors for the viewer to see.Sound: 4As for the sound section, the good thing is that some very pleasant and identifiable OSTs with the series that remain despite the seasons and that do not abuse their reuse constantly compared to some of their prequels, Unfortunately both the OP / ED overshadow the background music work, with some very unfortunate openings and closings and little thematic for the occasion, you can really come to think that you are about to start a series of music or dance rather than relate it to tennisCharacters: 3Here it is similar and at the same time it goes hand in hand with the story that mentions the reinsertion of most of Seigaku\'s rivals to put them in this more as a support and companions in the same situation, but the reality is that of the many schools who attend high school as Seigaku who are 50, only 1 or 2 characters per school are really interesting to appreciate and see how they develop in the most difficult situations. The rest is simply to take minutes in the program and extend it as much as possible. While of the new high school characters that make up the U-17s are only striking in appearance and some not even that, they are not given too much emphasis or shown to have a predominant role within the plot, it is as if they simply need to fill those vacancies .Entertainment: 2Honestly, it was a terrible pass this season, it was literally more fun to see the ceiling, since all the events are manual, and we do not get anything flashy or captivating that generates a good expectation, let me explain. In previous adaptations there was always a clear objective or reasons to catch the viewer, in the first season, we have the formation of the team, better developed matches, very good comedy chapters, characters that we are getting to know, etc., While in the adaptations of the ""championship national ""is the expectations placed on whether they could achieve the title and see that new rivals could give Seigaku a fight (although most of the games were summarized).

It’s a modern example of how a show that could have been a big hit of the year that ultimately translated into a messy series that self-destructed. It’s not just a flop but serves as a metaphor for how original series struggles to keep ideas effective. Don’t get me wrong. The series’ premise about story worlds clashing with sci-fi and fantasy elements sounds very intriguing. Yet somehow, it found many ways to ultimately make this look like an attempt at easy crash grab for the unexpected.At first glance, this series sounds really interesting. As an original anime, the creators seems to have...decided to take a risk and mix many genres together. Fantasy, sci-fi, magic, isekai, and even mecha are just a few among these. However, what really caught my attention for this series is the fictional worlds and their characters. Every world has its own unique story as well. Not to mention, these stories has its creators and the characters they created. While all this really sets up the show as a mesmerizing story, I can’t help but find this series to be a flop in the most disappointing ways possible.The first few episodes of the show wastes little time to introduce the main characters. That’s good news since the cast seems to feature a unique set with characters of all different types. Magical girl, mecha pilot, princely knight, supernatural NPCs, anti-heroes, you name it. The most normal character among them is a young man named Souta Mizushino. He is inspired to become a light novel author but somehow manages to get caught into fierce fight one day. Souta gets involved in the conflict with the clash of fictional worlds, creators, and the characters. From the start, I can honestly say that the show actually has a mystique that kept me interested. Many questions pop up and it makes me wonder how this anime plans to resolve them. The characters also brings the attention of their purpose and why they are there in the first place.Unfortunately, I can’t really say these characters are creatively presented. For instance, there’s Selestia Upitiria, the main protagonist of ‘Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier’ (light novel adaptation of the same name). She stands out more as generic sword fighter with skills to operate a mecha. We don’t find out much about her until later in the show but from the surface, she’s saturated with generic characteristics. Then, there’s Meteora, an intelligent NPC with a dry sense of humor. I honestly can’t remember the last time I ever laughed at her character just because of how diehard this show attempts to make her entertaining. On the other hand, the show has other characters such as anti-hero Yuuya, the noble knight Alicetaria, mecha pilot Rui Kanoya, magical girl Mamika, and former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. These characters all have their own stories although among them, Blitz is probably the only one that I found truly interesting. That’s because the motives of these characters really feel flat and uninspiring. I mean, a noble knight trying to get revenge for a fallen friend. I’m sure you’ve heard that somewhere before. Still, there are two characters that kept me interested throughout the show. Those are Magane Chikujouin and the Military Uniform Princess. Why do these two intrigues me the most? It’s because both of them make their own luck and destiny. Magane is a highly unpredictable character with a devious personality. She is very sarcastic with a dangerous ability. What sets her apart is that she is on her own side throughout the show and seems to play along the story like a game. Meanwhile, the Military Uniform Princess is by no shadow of a doubt the most mysterious character in the show. Her motives from the start is very unclear and most of her dialogues spoken in this show seems to have some sort of hidden message. She also seems to have some sort of connection with Souta but that remains a mystery throughout a decent amount of this show. So perhaps in many ways, these two characters create spectacles as viewers try to anticipate their role from the story.At its core, the creators and created play the main role although I can’t really say that I’m impressed by the character relationships. They just seem all over the place and almost none of them really feel special. The show attempts to make us feel something for the characters whether it’s their personalities or motives. Yet as I watched more and more of this show, I can’t really say that any of them are particularly memorable. At times, I thought this show was trying to make us sympathize with the characters. However, I really felt nothing for the characters. Even Selestia, one of the main female protagonists didn’t stand out as the show didn’t develop her enough as a character. She just seems to be there to play her role as a female fighter. The main male protagonist, Souta is far from interesting from any angle. The only time he ever drew my attention was during his interactions with Magane and it’s when she’s the one doing the talking.On the other hand, the story shows some promise as it ties together the characters and their roles. The background story of Souta is perhaps one of the more interesting and also most important part of this series. As a very talky show with heavy exposition, each episode does build more and more of the story together to avoid loose ends. When you mix so many genres together all at the same time, it can be quite difficult to tie everything together. Yet, somehow this show does manage to achieve such a feat when its storytelling manages to be convincing despite being predictable. That’s of course speaking from the first half of the show. From the latter half, I can’t really say the story is impressive. It bobbles down to exploring events from previous relationships and how that influences character motivations in the present. Certain new characters introduced in the latter half really feel out of place like as if they are just there to make the story flow more. However, it really felt unnecessary and just make the series longer than it should’ve been.You’re probably thinking: “Oh but you can enjoy this show if you don’t take everything so seriously and accept the story more openly!” That would be the case if the comedy of the show didn’t come out as so dry. The jokes in this show often feel forced and mixed with a dry sense of humor. Meteora is probably the guiltiest of this as her character personality demonstrates this throughout the show. There are also occasional adult humor-like jokes thrown in at random and otaku references that just comes out as flat. On the other hand, the action and choreography is well made. When making original anime, Troyca seems to pour a decent amount of effort to make their work look like an action flick.Well, I guess I’ll admit it. Re:Creators’ animation quality as a whole looks solid on multiple fronts. From the battle choreography to character designs, everything seems to fall in place in order. The characters from the fictional worlds look creatively unique that suits with their role. Even the mecha designs has its dynamic features that avoids CGI pitfalls. The most innovative design that had my eyes glued to the screen is no doubt the Military Uniform Princess. I’ve rarely seen a character with such a look and that really took my attention. Unfortunately, the other fictional worlds didn’t get too much spotlight as we only see glimpse of them. The majority of the show takes place on Earth and we all know how dull that is. Nonetheless, Re:Creators succeeds at crafting its visual elements through its character designs, action sequences, and world fiction.Unless you’ve been living under a rock in recent years, then it’s obvious that the soundtrack of the show is created by the modern talent of Sawano Hiroyuki. The OST is stellar with its dramatic choreography and precisely timed. The OP & ED theme songs are very catchy with hidden messages. Character voice mannerisms are also memorable in particular with Military Uniform Princess, Magane, and Meteora.In the end, Re:Creators is a mediocre a show that tried far too hard to make itself look cool. By mixing a variety of genres, I expected a show to capitalize on them. Instead, what I got is a show that relied far too much on its characters to do the storytelling. And that ended up being a risk taken with little reward. In many ways, this show can be recommendable to people if you’re looking for some fun action and typical fictional story. Just be aware that it’s also very talky with exposition. The comedy is very mixed depending on perspective. For me, Re:Creators wore itself out almost like a meme. decided to take a risk and mix many genres together. Fantasy, sci-fi, magic, isekai, and even mecha are just a few among these. However, what really caught my attention for this series is the fictional worlds and their characters. Every world has its own unique story as well.

Still, there are two characters that kept me interested throughout the show. Those are Magane Chikujouin and the Military Uniform Princess. Why do these two intrigues me the most? It’s because both of them make their own luck and destiny. Magane is a highly unpredictable character with a devious personality. She is very sarcastic with a dangerous ability. What sets her apart is that she is on her own side throughout the show and seems to play along the story like a game. Meanwhile, the Military Uniform Princess is by no shadow of a doubt the most mysterious character in the show. Her motives from the start is very unclear and most of her dialogues spoken in this show seems to have some sort of hidden message. She also seems to have some sort of connection with Souta but that remains a mystery throughout a decent amount of this show. So perhaps in many ways, these two characters create spectacles as viewers try to anticipate their role from the story.At its core, the creators and created play the main role although I can’t really say that I’m impressed by the character relationships. They just seem all over the place and almost none of them really feel special. The show attempts to make us feel something for the characters whether it’s their personalities or motives. Yet as I watched more and more of this show, I can’t really say that any of them are particularly memorable. At times, I thought this show was trying to make us sympathize with the characters. However, I really felt nothing for the characters. Even Selestia, one of the main female protagonists didn’t stand out as the show didn’t develop her enough as a character. She just seems to be there to play her role as a female fighter. The main male protagonist, Souta is far from interesting from any angle. The only time he ever drew my attention was during his interactions with Magane and it’s when she’s the one doing the talking.On the other hand, the story shows some promise as it ties together the characters and their roles. The background story of Souta is perhaps one of the more interesting and also most important part of this series. As a very talky show with heavy exposition, each episode does build more and more of the story together to avoid loose ends. When you mix so many genres together all at the same time, it can be quite difficult to tie everything together. Yet, somehow this show does manage to achieve such a feat when its storytelling manages to be convincing despite being predictable. That’s of course speaking from the first half of the show. From the latter half, I can’t really say the story is impressive. It bobbles down to exploring events from previous relationships and how that influences character motivations in the present. Certain new characters introduced in the latter half really feel out of place like as if they are just there to make the story flow more. However, it really felt unnecessary and just make the series longer than it should’ve been.You’re probably thinking: “Oh but you can enjoy this show if you don’t take everything so seriously and accept the story more openly!” That would be the case if the comedy of the show didn’t come out as so dry. The jokes in this show often feel forced and mixed with a dry sense of humor. Meteora is probably the guiltiest of this as her character personality demonstrates this throughout the show. There are also occasional adult humor-like jokes thrown in at random and otaku references that just comes out as flat. On the other hand, the action and choreography is well made. When making original anime, Troyca seems to pour a decent amount of effort to make their work look like an action flick.Well, I guess I’ll admit it. Re:Creators’ animation quality as a whole looks solid on multiple fronts. From the battle choreography to character designs, everything seems to fall in place in order. The characters from the fictional worlds look creatively unique that suits with their role. Even the mecha designs has its dynamic features that avoids CGI pitfalls. The most innovative design that had my eyes glued to the screen is no doubt the Military Uniform Princess. I’ve rarely seen a character with such a look and that really took my attention. Unfortunately, the other fictional worlds didn’t get too much spotlight as we only see glimpse of them. The majority of the show takes place on Earth and we all know how dull that is. Nonetheless, Re:Creators succeeds at crafting its visual elements through its character designs, action sequences, and world fiction.Unless you’ve been living under a rock in recent years, then it’s obvious that the soundtrack of the show is created by the modern talent of Sawano Hiroyuki. The OST is stellar with its dramatic choreography and precisely timed. The OP & ED theme songs are very catchy with hidden messages. Character voice mannerisms are also memorable in particular with Military Uniform Princess, Magane, and Meteora.In the end, Re:Creators is a mediocre a show that tried far too hard to make itself look cool. By mixing a variety of genres, I expected a show to capitalize on them. Instead, what I got is a show that relied far too much on its characters to do the storytelling. And that ended up being a risk taken with little reward. In many ways, this show can be recommendable to people if you’re looking for some fun action and typical fictional story. Just be aware that it’s also very talky with exposition. The comedy is very mixed depending on perspective. For me, Re:Creators wore itself out almost like a meme.', 'I believe I mentioned this before, but I find it consistently harder to write in praise of an anime than to bash it, to the point that the only manner in which I could be satisfied on doing so, would be to break down each episode while highlighting why I believe certain scenes or bits of dialogue are so great and important to the big picture. As you can imagine, the highest I value something, the harder it feels to explain, so let it be known right from the start: I do see Re:Creators in VERY high regard!Story and CharactersTo begin to understand why the...show works so well, the first good hint would be the original writer, Rei Hiroe, who wrote the story that led to the anime. For those unfortunate enough to not know who Hiroe is, he’s the author of the Black Lagoon manga and the responsible for the dynamic between Rock and Revy, two of the finest characters crafted in the media. In Black Lagoon, he demonstrated his strength at crafting witty and meaningful character studies, while in Re:C he displays, with some aid from Ei Aoki (director of Fate/Zero), his efficiency at developing cohesive, effective and strong plot.Some comparisons I’ve seen be made about the nature of Re:C in regards to other anime vary from a knock-off of Fate/Zero’s concept, for those who see the combination of colorful fighters of multiple origins as somehow related to F/Z and nothing else, to a shallow piece of propaganda fellating the Japanese government and military, in the same fashion as GATE, for people who are too obtuse to notice the obvious differences and like to make asinine comparisons (you know who you are!). The closest I’ve seen to actually hit the mark was to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, since both works are commentaries on the media they’re a part of. This comparison doesn’t adequately prepare you to get into Re:C, but it is a better assessment of the nature of the show. While Haruhi is purely a dissection (or you might even say a “deconstruction”, if you can believe it) of the tropes that are to this day prevalent in anime, that made itself brilliant by twisting the role of the protagonist and titular character, along with the ones that personify those tropes, Re:C is a commentary on our relationship with fiction, both from the perspective of the creators as well as the audience, and it makes itself brilliant by making what would be natural parts of that relation into integral, tangible elements of the plot. I’ll discuss the perspective a bit more when we get to the characters, but for now let’s talk about the strength of the narrativeBesides characters, which I consider to be the most important thing in a story, something I also find of great importance when analyzing is how well structured is the narrative. That takes into consideration things like pacing, as in the rate in which the story progresses or new information is introduced, the role different characters play and how meaningful they are on that role and, specially, when things happen for a reason. Re:Creators shines in that regard, among other reasons, because it wastes almost no time. Every episode in this show is there for a reason (yes, even the hot-spring episode) and nearly EVERY scene has something to help bring out new information, develop the numerous figures of the cast or reinforce what is already known, character and narrative-wise, through a new method or situation. Want an example? The events of episodes 9 and 10, for once, might seem to have no effect in the rest of the plot, at first glance, but looking closely you might notice that they made for the perfect set-up for the main characters to confirm a plot point that would prove itself vital for their future plans, as well as kick into motion Aliceteria’s character-arc. Take this episode out of the equation and you’ll have that plan turn into a complete ass-pull and have Aliceteria’s change of heart be completely unwarranted.If you are reading this review, I’d assume you already know the premise of Re:C, so I’ll not waste much time explaining it. So, a feeble mind would predict the main villains of a story with such premise to be those who were already villains in their original stories, but this is one of the instances where this anime subverts expectations in the best way: the real villain of the story is a character that originally had no purpose, while the one who was originally a villain turns into a wild card. The series tackles motivations and work ethics of the different artists, ranging from those who do that simply to make a living to those who see on the act of crafting a story as their way of expressing themselves in the way that is the most fulfilling. That said, let’s talk about the characters, starting with the main antagonistAltair, or the Princess in Military Uniform, was an original character, created based on one  of a preexisting fictional game called Eternal Wars Megalosphere and is noted from the beginning to be connected to Souta, one of the main characters, and Setsuna, a former friend of Souta who, and I don’t think I’m spoiling much about the first minute of the show, committed suicide a few months earlier. Do you want another example of how finelly crafted is the structure in this anime? Since not much is shown from Setsuna’s perspective prior to her suicide, some viewers might get frustrated at first, feeling that they missed on something important, but that turns out to be a necessary decision, given what we see from her on episode 21, in which her avatar plays a decisive role in the conclusion. This decision is a great factor into making the experience of this episode as meaningful and effective as it is, besides the excellent writing, of course. Altair was a character created without a set purpose, carrying only the emotions of her creator, to whom she feels a strong connection with. Therefore, she takes upon herself the task of avenging her creator, who she feels was wronged by the world. That lack of a reason to exist, coupled with the angst carried by the one she held the dearest led her to see the real world as a cruel story, and what better way to enact her revenge than by causing the world to implode on itself?Mizushino Souta, a highschool-age student, is part of the main cast, but regards himself and is treated by the narrative more as a narrator-type figure. He’s an aspiring illustrator who’s a bit shy about his art and holds a guilt complex in regards to Setsuna’s death, who he believes to have betrayed. He considers himself partially culpable for her suicide, for not coming to her aid when it was needed, and that feeling of guilt is what motivates him to take action during the second half of the story. The conclusion to his is arc is not one of overcoming the guilt, but of learning to shoulder the pain of his mistake and making something positive out of it, through his creations. Episode 21 (seriously, folks, it’s a very important episode) is where that is displayed at full force and he ultimately comes to peace with Setsuna. Souta also provides insight about the perspective of people who enjoy and avidly consume fiction, like on his argument with Aliceteria, where he tells her how characters like her are loved because they motivate people with an ideal, a model of how to act, to be honest and never let themselves be brought down by hardship. He also comments later how the passion for anime, manga and other media gives the viewer the opportunity to see the world through someone else’s perspectiveStarting the hoster of creations with the heroes, we have Selesia, a character from the light novel and anime series Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, an Escaflowne looking, magitech inspired Mecha that I like imagining to be set in phantasy 1920s. In her world, she was the partner of the main male lead, Charon, fighting against the forces of the Avalon Brigade, which gave her a resolute, quick to action personality, but still calm when among friends. In an interaction with Souta, she advises him to take his time and not try to rush his artistic development, because that way he would be able to grow appropriately along with his work. That interaction reflects the experience she had fighting in her universe, experience that also makes for amusing banter between her and her creator, Takashi Matsubara. Initially, she complains to him about why he didn’t make her stronger, not understanding his perspective as the writer. Their relation eventually becomes mildly like father and daughter, and Matsubara comes to be protective of her, cherishing her as his creation. He comments, during a conversation, how writing is his way of telling the world that he has been there, of leaving a mark on other people. He comes off as an experienced writer, who understands what he can and cannot do in order to keep the audience invested on his work.Next in the roster is Meteora, also known as Best Girl, originally a NPC from the RPG game AVALKEN of Reminisce, where she takes the role of a powerful mage and the responsible for the library at the End of the World, right before the final boss. This is a very important detail about her, because it influences the way Meteora relates to the real world and other creations, as well as fiction. She states early on that her world is deeply detailed and fleshed out, having even fiction of its own, therefore she has better appreciation and understanding than other creations have about art, its mechanics and the influence it has over people. Interestingly, in one of the early episodes, she and Selesia contemplate a graffiti, and while Selesia has an amazed look on her face, Meteora displays a colder, more analytical expression, denoting the difference in impact for both of them. Lacking social interaction but being remarkably intelligent, she doesn’t have an easy time expressing her emotions properly, which she tries to mitigate by pulling off horrible puns. We see more of that restrained playful soul in episode 13, the greatest recap episode in the history of anime. A nice, detail about her character is how initially her speech is notoriously long-winded, but over time it’s possible to notice it becoming less prolix and more personable. Her knowledge of fiction allows her to read effectively into other characters and she quickly learns to understand what goes through the heart and mind of people from the real world, making her the one to give Souta the emotional support he needs to come clean about his mistakes and deal with the guilt that torments him. She is definitely the one the boy feels the most confortable to talk to, and their friendly chemistry persists throughout the series.Hell, I ship them!Since she becomes the brain of the group, fact amusingly displayed when nobody knows what to do and quickly turn to look at her, Meteora also develops a professional friendship with Kikuchihara, the government official responsible for dealing with the situation of the fictional characters. Both recognize and grow to respect each other as the one from both groups who knows best how to deal with the situationMirokuji Yuuya is every anti-hero/rival voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto: impetuous, self-reliant, prideful, hedonistic and occasionally clever. Funny enough, his rival from his original story, Sho, is himself voiced by Okamoto, which might be the most amazingly subtle reference ever. Both come from Yatoji Ryou’s manga Lockout Ward Underground: Dark Night, with Yuuya being laid-back and uninterested in doing what others tell him, hanging out with the heroes simply for the fun of fighting the villains, while Sho is obsessed with killing Yuuya, whom he believes to be his sister and best friend’s killer. Perhaps mirroring Yuuya’s personality, Yatoji is arrogant and a bit difficult to deal with, but softens up fast due to their dire situation. He and Matsubara worked together in the past and don’t go very well with each other, but it’s hinted that Matsubara appreciates Yatoji’s work and still worries about him being able to continue, as shown when Yuuya decides to beat up his own creator.By now we had the light novel female warrior lead, the RPG kuudere, the adolescent power phantasy and fujoshi bait, it’s time for our Gundam boy. Yes, Kanoya is the “Gundam” representative; he went looking for some young poon-tang on his first week in the real world, so he cannot possibly be the Shinji look-alike. His author, Nakanogane-san, wrote him to be someone who gets easily defensive, but also quite heated-up in battle, but as soon as he comes to the real world, the kid decides he doesn’t want to fight anymore. What? Did you expect the Gundam kid to not have his “get in the robot” moment? Silly you!Kanoya’s small but charming character arc involves him realizing that the obligations he shoulders in his original world are not arbitrary, but something that only he as the protagonist can fulfill, which gives the kid newfound sense of responsibility. His conversation with Souta in episode 11, while superficially seeming like just a fine motivational moment, also highlights an important part of creating effective stories: that characters need to have a purpose to guide their development and actions, creating a sound narrative. Nakanogane-san doesn’t have trouble finding his place, though. The creators here don’t just sit around while their characters fight to save the world: they take initiative on putting together the pieces of Altair’s past and goals to find the best course of action.Lastly, there’s Hikayu, the visual novel heroin created by Nishio Ohnishi (har har!), who’s a pervert. A good-hearted one, don’t be too harsh on the guy, he means well. Since her game of origin was primarily an eroge, Hykayu is disheartened to learn how exposed she’s to the world, which makes for some of the best comedic moments on the show, like when she does her badass entry during the heat of the combat, shouts her passionate entry lines, while feverishly blushing in shame of her outfit. Surprisingly, or maybe not, her game is not exclusively made of fap material and contains emotional moments that she carries over to her experience in the real world. Could this be a tangential commentary about the tastes of the stereotypically perverted otaku, who can accept a story having blatant smut as well as heartstring-pulling narrative? Perhaps a jab at how we feel the need to justify liking questionable material with the argument that it has a serious and emotionally gripping story? Who knows, but it does add more substance and weight to the notion that the writers and staff do know the ins, outs and running trends of the media they are representing in the anime, instead of simply crafting half-assed references.Chikujouin Magane (creator not important) is the one creation to have been a villain in her story, but like Yuuya, prefers to act by herself and have fun with people’s suffering. She takes quite the liking or the real world and for Souta’s emotional struggle, taking him and the creations as her main source of enjoyment for the first half of the show. She doesn’t seem to like Meteora very much, though, since the girl doesn’t fall easily for Magane’s mind tricks.On Altair’s side, the first ones to appear are Aliceteria, the idealistic knight, and Mamika, the unlucky Magical Girl.Mamika comes from a show for kids, where the morality is black & white, villains are recognizable at first glance, good people who don’t immediately side with the heroin just need to be beaten into agreement and violence is bloodless, so for her it’s a shock to learn that in this new reality her powers might inflict serious harm on people. Kind-hearted and naïve, she doesn’t so much change her nature as the series goes on, but instead learns about the complexities of the new world and takes different methods to bring end to conflict. Aliceteria, in the other hand, comes from an equally black & white reality, but one severely more violent, bloody and harsh than that of Mamika. Aliceteria is stubbornly idealistic, to a point where the anime makes it clear she fooled herself into believing the real world is really a home of sadistic, cynical gods, who created her reality just to amuse themselves with the suffering of the people in it, so it’s her duty to force her god, Takarada-san, to fix her world and free it from evil. Takarada himself looks like a young, emergent author who still hasn’t mastered the creation of layered and complex characters, relying on the archetypical noble hero to focus his work on. It’s partially through Souta’s intervention and passionate speech about why figures like Aliceteria are beloved on his world that she begins to realize how disconnected she is from the true motivations of her fans.Mamika and Aliceteria form a strong bond in their short time together, despite the difference in mentality. For once, when going to recruit a new creation, Mamika hopes it’s a good person, while Alice hopes it’s someone trustworthy and strong (to their dismay it’s neither), and it’s the similarity in values, despite the difference in priority, coupled with the courage and backbone that warms the knight to the young magical girl.These two characters, among others, help put into perspective one of the brilliant ideas applied on Re:Creators: the anime purposefully built one-dimensional characters into the narrative because in context they come from stories that aren’t as well fleshed out or detailed. Selesia and Meteora, were created by authors who intricately crafted their personalities, worldviews or universe, so when they come to the real world they act more human, but also can better understand the morality of their creators, while Mamika and Alice were shallow characters, created to be good and righteous, but lacking understanding of complex notions of right and wrong, so they become easy prey for a villain who can spout ideas that sound good and presents easy solutions to their problem. That shallowness is not the final state for them either, but a jumping point from where they develop into layered and intelligent individuals capable of understanding the new reality and taking the best decisions based on their own morals.Lastly, because going further would be spoiler, there’s Blitz Talker, the hard-boiled supporting character from the manga Code-Babylon, written and drawn by Suruga Shunma. Blitz clearly knows of Altair’s true intentions from the beginning, but stays with her because of his desire to protect her, whom he sees as weaker than she lets transpire. Suruga is an intriguing character because she keeps a low profile most of the time, not showing much of her personality and mindset. Most of the time she comes off as an aloof workaholic, constantly drawing, barely taking her eyes off the paper, only to look woefully uninterested when she did, but in her confrontation with her Blitz, she delivers plenty of substance. She makes for a great parallel to Setsuna. The girl had a sudden boost in notoriety, but didn’t have the time to grow up and learn to deal with the hate that comes with the spotlight and that negativity was too much for her young mind to deal with. Suruga, on the other hand, had to struggle with competition and criticism, suffered with the negativity, finally reaching enough success to be able to sustain herself with her art. Many viewers might think her outlook on fiction or her creative process is cynical, but it’s better to describe it as pragmatic and she shows to genuinely love and take pride on her work.On episode 03 the anime introduces the concept around which the entire plot revolves: audience acceptance. They first note that the characters to appear in the real world tend to be those who had the largest impact among the public, so after Matsubara fails to alter the description of Selesia, it becomes obvious that the creators can’t simply change their characters as they go along. They soon began to theorize that what can really affect their status is if they manage to get enough of the general public to empathize with the changes made to them, idea that is solidly proven in the events of episode 10. It’s based on that concept that the heroes elaborate their plan to defeat Altair, by crafting a story that would be able to gather acceptance from the public to the point where they are able to bait and trap Altair on the Bird Cage, a scenario located within the real and fictional words, where they’d be able to defeat her for good, with the approval of the public. Fun fact: Bird Cage is a reference to Altair’s name coming from the Arab word for bird.Looking at the contextual level it’s not hard to see that the idea of acceptance is a method of commenting on the common fictional elements that have the most success with the public on our own universe, as well as the difficulties faced by writers of popular works, who need to keep constantly in mind what the audience wants from them. Fiction is manipulation by nature, it’s designed to engage the audience in an illusion where the artist pulls the necessary strings to make us feel or think a certain way in relation to what happens to the characters. Bad fiction happens when the illusion is not convincing enough or when the trick is so poorly conveyed that we can see the strings in the background, and no character in Re:C exposes that better than Altair herself in the last few episodes. Not only are her powers the ability to manipulate the fabric of fiction (reason why she can’t simply nuke the world into oblivion), but her speech is constantly centered on the idea of what exactly pleases the audience and gets their acceptance. Her originally neutral condition also contributes to that concept: Altair is a character without cannon beyond the original powers given to her by her creator, so there’s little restraint for other artists to invent new abilities for her, as those new powers can just as easily get approval from the wider audience, contributing to her continuous growth in power and number of tricks up her sleeve. Part of me wonders if this is not a paradoxical trick the writer crafts with the audience. As the viewer, we are conditioned to expect the main villain to not go down until the very last moment, and only against a worthy hero that can pull off the strongest emotional reaction from the audience, therefore, the writers are fooling us into expecting Altair to pull off something new to aid her in battle, knowing that the nature of her powers allows for that.PresentationAcross the multitude of designs presented the anime displays excellence in keeping verisimilitude and coherence. In fact, that might be the most valuable quality of the work’s presentation, beyond the technical aspects, which are not shabby by any means: the directing is excellent, packed with clever transitions and enthralling shot composition (special shout out to that one camera movement in episode 06 that tells us with no effort that Magane just gets it).Every element of character design was conceived in a way that the experienced anime fan could safely note what they make reference to: Selesia and Charon dress in the angular and colorful style that has become a trend among light novel characters, clearly made to please cosplayers instead of having practical combat utility; Meteora sports the distinguishable attire of an RPG mage from works like the Tales franchise, cuz the design is clearly too confortable to be Final Fantasy; Kanoya uses the slick, futuristic uniform of robot pilots across the Mecha genre. All of this is important because it says something about the characters, not only from what kind of story they come from, but also their personalities. Even when in civilian outfits, the choice of clothing tells something about them: Meteora dresses with cute and childlike attire, because she’s a petit woman and is tired of constantly using a thick uniform, while Selesia’s adorably modest choices help flesh out her personality as reserved, possibly chaste.The same care extends to all the fictional websites, products that appear on the show as well as the different magic symbols used by the characters. The designers commented in interviews how there was an entire creative process behind the elaboration of the multiple logos, focused on creating an internally consistent scenario. There’s no “Gaagle” search engine or “PZP” console in this story, all the fictional products, social medias or websites presented here were designed to look and sound believable to the extent that one could easily think that Mauchly, Piclive or Songbird are a real thing, or that SONY might actually create a console called Play Portal, which I imagine would be a portable with meager first and third-party support.The sound department continues the effort in verisimilitude by featuring performances consistent with the universe and genre each character comes from. I’ve already mentioned Nobuhiko Okamoto previously, brilliantly cast as Sho, not just because of the irony but also because he’s can skillfully express Sho’s devoted and naïve mannerisms. Other clever choices are Suzumura Kenichi as Yuuya, fitting since this voice actor has experience with characters who speak in mischievous tone, and Minase Inoue, as Meteora, who previously worked as Rem in Re:Zero and is capable of pulling off a character who speaks stoically without falling into blandness. Now, voice actors are a fun subject and all, but that’s not even the most exciting aspect of how Re:Creators sounds. That would be Sawano Hiroyuki’s amazing soundtrack, tailor made for this anime. Permeated with intense electronic beat and bombastic energy, these songs are never misplaced; the same track can mark the intensity of action sequences but also play to great effect in comedic beats, adding more points to the directorial work. Just look at Selesia trying her new power or Hikayu doing her badass entry and you’ll know what I mean. The lyrics, off course, in songs like Here I Am (Mamika’s theme), God of ink, Layers, Brave the Ocean and World Etude are perfect mirrors for the characters inner thoughts and their goals.Personal RamblingsI first thought about talking about this in the story breakdown, but I decided to leave it for this section, as it is the main reason Meteora became my favorite character in the show and why I began to see this anime with higher appreciation. In episode 04, after learning about the passing of her creator, Meteora decides to play her game on its entirety. Later, she confesses her main grievance from when she came to the real world and talked about her experience with her own game: it was fun, and that’s all that matters, because all she needed was to known if her creator loved her world the same way she did. This moment was particularly relatable to me because it reminds me of a book I’ve read long ago, The Hour of the Star, where the narrator talks about the protagonist of his story, and about how he loved her. Later is that I came to realize that such love was not a traditional sentiment, but the love of the artist for his creation. Meteora’s confession displays the inverse route, from creation to the artist, but to me it emulates the sentiment of the audience, the feeling of experiencing a work that had love put into it, where the people involved were truly invested in created something that would resonate with the player, the reader or the viewer.Re:Creators is an anime I never knew I wanted, but now that I have it I wonder if there’ll ever be something else like it. The way multiple aspects of artistic creation are talked about and analyzed, the portrayal of the audience and Souta’s mindset as a passionate consumer were all relatable and the show frequently would surprise me by doing something I already expected, but in a way that I did not imagine. Rei Hiroe’s writing tends to do that.I sure hope there’s more originated from it, off course. The many works mentioned in the story might as well spawn new franchises in the future, now that they had the perfect introduction. I sure would love to see what they could make out of Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, since those who saw Re:C already know of some spoilers for it, or how they could conceive Mamika’s anime; perhaps as something initially childish-looking that progressively gets more serious and multifaceted. I know Mecha is in life-support nowadays, but it would be nice to see Infinite Divine Machine Mono Magia get its own anime too. The possibilities are not endless, but they sure are plentiful and can be fruitful as long as those works continue to have comparable quality of writing, directing and care put into them as much as it was put in Re:Creators. show works so well, the first good hint would be the original writer, Rei Hiroe, who wrote the story that led to the anime. For those unfortunate enough to not know who Hiroe is, he’s the author of the Black Lagoon manga and the responsible for the dynamic between Rock and Revy, two of the finest characters crafted in the media. In Black Lagoon, he demonstrated his strength at crafting witty and meaningful character studies, while in Re:C he displays, with some aid from Ei Aoki (director of Fate/Zero), his efficiency at developing cohesive, effective and strong plot.Some comparisons I’ve seen be made about the nature of Re:C in regards to other anime vary from a knock-off of Fate/Zero’s concept, for those who see the combination of colorful fighters of multiple origins as somehow related to F/Z and nothing else, to a shallow piece of propaganda fellating the Japanese government and military, in the same fashion as GATE, for people who are too obtuse to notice the obvious differences and like to make asinine comparisons (you know who you are!). The closest I’ve seen to actually hit the mark was to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, since both works are commentaries on the media they’re a part of. This comparison doesn’t adequately prepare you to get into Re:C, but it is a better assessment of the nature of the show. While Haruhi is purely a dissection (or you might even say a “deconstruction”, if you can believe it) of the tropes that are to this day prevalent in anime, that made itself brilliant by twisting the role of the protagonist and titular character, along with the ones that personify those tropes, Re:C is a commentary on our relationship with fiction, both from the perspective of the creators as well as the audience, and it makes itself brilliant by making what would be natural parts of that relation into integral, tangible elements of the plot. I’ll discuss the perspective a bit more when we get to the characters, but for now let’s talk about the strength of the narrativeBesides characters, which I consider to be the most important thing in a story, something I also find of great importance when analyzing is how well structured is the narrative. That takes into consideration things like pacing, as in the rate in which the story progresses or new information is introduced, the role different characters play and how meaningful they are on that role and, specially, when things happen for a reason. Re:Creators shines in that regard, among other reasons, because it wastes almost no time. Every episode in this show is there for a reason (yes, even the hot-spring episode) and nearly EVERY scene has something to help bring out new information, develop the numerous figures of the cast or reinforce what is already known, character and narrative-wise, through a new method or situation.

Take this episode out of the equation and you’ll have that plan turn into a complete ass-pull and have Aliceteria’s change of heart be completely unwarranted.If you are reading this review, I’d assume you already know the premise of Re:C, so I’ll not waste much time explaining it. So, a feeble mind would predict the main villains of a story with such premise to be those who were already villains in their original stories, but this is one of the instances where this anime subverts expectations in the best way: the real villain of the story is a character that originally had no purpose, while the one who was originally a villain turns into a wild card. The series tackles motivations and work ethics of the different artists, ranging from those who do that simply to make a living to those who see on the act of crafting a story as their way of expressing themselves in the way that is the most fulfilling. That said, let’s talk about the characters, starting with the main antagonistAltair, or the Princess in Military Uniform, was an original character, created based on one  of a preexisting fictional game called Eternal Wars Megalosphere and is noted from the beginning to be connected to Souta, one of the main characters, and Setsuna, a former friend of Souta who, and I don’t think I’m spoiling much about the first minute of the show, committed suicide a few months earlier. Do you want another example of how finelly crafted is the structure in this anime? Since not much is shown from Setsuna’s perspective prior to her suicide, some viewers might get frustrated at first, feeling that they missed on something important, but that turns out to be a necessary decision, given what we see from her on episode 21, in which her avatar plays a decisive role in the conclusion. This decision is a great factor into making the experience of this episode as meaningful and effective as it is, besides the excellent writing, of course. Altair was a character created without a set purpose, carrying only the emotions of her creator, to whom she feels a strong connection with. Therefore, she takes upon herself the task of avenging her creator, who she feels was wronged by the world. That lack of a reason to exist, coupled with the angst carried by the one she held the dearest led her to see the real world as a cruel story, and what better way to enact her revenge than by causing the world to implode on itself?Mizushino Souta, a highschool-age student, is part of the main cast, but regards himself and is treated by the narrative more as a narrator-type figure. He’s an aspiring illustrator who’s a bit shy about his art and holds a guilt complex in regards to Setsuna’s death, who he believes to have betrayed. He considers himself partially culpable for her suicide, for not coming to her aid when it was needed, and that feeling of guilt is what motivates him to take action during the second half of the story. The conclusion to his is arc is not one of overcoming the guilt, but of learning to shoulder the pain of his mistake and making something positive out of it, through his creations. Episode 21 (seriously, folks, it’s a very important episode) is where that is displayed at full force and he ultimately comes to peace with Setsuna. Souta also provides insight about the perspective of people who enjoy and avidly consume fiction, like on his argument with Aliceteria, where he tells her how characters like her are loved because they motivate people with an ideal, a model of how to act, to be honest and never let themselves be brought down by hardship. He also comments later how the passion for anime, manga and other media gives the viewer the opportunity to see the world through someone else’s perspectiveStarting the hoster of creations with the heroes, we have Selesia, a character from the light novel and anime series Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, an Escaflowne looking, magitech inspired Mecha that I like imagining to be set in phantasy 1920s. In her world, she was the partner of the main male lead, Charon, fighting against the forces of the Avalon Brigade, which gave her a resolute, quick to action personality, but still calm when among friends. In an interaction with Souta, she advises him to take his time and not try to rush his artistic development, because that way he would be able to grow appropriately along with his work. That interaction reflects the experience she had fighting in her universe, experience that also makes for amusing banter between her and her creator, Takashi Matsubara. Initially, she complains to him about why he didn’t make her stronger, not understanding his perspective as the writer. Their relation eventually becomes mildly like father and daughter, and Matsubara comes to be protective of her, cherishing her as his creation. He comments, during a conversation, how writing is his way of telling the world that he has been there, of leaving a mark on other people. He comes off as an experienced writer, who understands what he can and cannot do in order to keep the audience invested on his work.Next in the roster is Meteora, also known as Best Girl, originally a NPC from the RPG game AVALKEN of Reminisce, where she takes the role of a powerful mage and the responsible for the library at the End of the World, right before the final boss. This is a very important detail about her, because it influences the way Meteora relates to the real world and other creations, as well as fiction. She states early on that her world is deeply detailed and fleshed out, having even fiction of its own, therefore she has better appreciation and understanding than other creations have about art, its mechanics and the influence it has over people. Interestingly, in one of the early episodes, she and Selesia contemplate a graffiti, and while Selesia has an amazed look on her face, Meteora displays a colder, more analytical expression, denoting the difference in impact for both of them. Lacking social interaction but being remarkably intelligent, she doesn’t have an easy time expressing her emotions properly, which she tries to mitigate by pulling off horrible puns. We see more of that restrained playful soul in episode 13, the greatest recap episode in the history of anime. A nice, detail about her character is how initially her speech is notoriously long-winded, but over time it’s possible to notice it becoming less prolix and more personable. Her knowledge of fiction allows her to read effectively into other characters and she quickly learns to understand what goes through the heart and mind of people from the real world, making her the one to give Souta the emotional support he needs to come clean about his mistakes and deal with the guilt that torments him. She is definitely the one the boy feels the most confortable to talk to, and their friendly chemistry persists throughout the series.Hell, I ship them!Since she becomes the brain of the group, fact amusingly displayed when nobody knows what to do and quickly turn to look at her, Meteora also develops a professional friendship with Kikuchihara, the government official responsible for dealing with the situation of the fictional characters. Both recognize and grow to respect each other as the one from both groups who knows best how to deal with the situationMirokuji Yuuya is every anti-hero/rival voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto: impetuous, self-reliant, prideful, hedonistic and occasionally clever. Funny enough, his rival from his original story, Sho, is himself voiced by Okamoto, which might be the most amazingly subtle reference ever. Both come from Yatoji Ryou’s manga Lockout Ward Underground: Dark Night, with Yuuya being laid-back and uninterested in doing what others tell him, hanging out with the heroes simply for the fun of fighting the villains, while Sho is obsessed with killing Yuuya, whom he believes to be his sister and best friend’s killer. Perhaps mirroring Yuuya’s personality, Yatoji is arrogant and a bit difficult to deal with, but softens up fast due to their dire situation. He and Matsubara worked together in the past and don’t go very well with each other, but it’s hinted that Matsubara appreciates Yatoji’s work and still worries about him being able to continue, as shown when Yuuya decides to beat up his own creator.By now we had the light novel female warrior lead, the RPG kuudere, the adolescent power phantasy and fujoshi bait, it’s time for our Gundam boy. Yes, Kanoya is the “Gundam” representative; he went looking for some young poon-tang on his first week in the real world, so he cannot possibly be the Shinji look-alike. His author, Nakanogane-san, wrote him to be someone who gets easily defensive, but also quite heated-up in battle, but as soon as he comes to the real world, the kid decides he doesn’t want to fight anymore. What? Did you expect the Gundam kid to not have his “get in the robot” moment? Silly you!Kanoya’s small but charming character arc involves him realizing that the obligations he shoulders in his original world are not arbitrary, but something that only he as the protagonist can fulfill, which gives the kid newfound sense of responsibility. His conversation with Souta in episode 11, while superficially seeming like just a fine motivational moment, also highlights an important part of creating effective stories: that characters need to have a purpose to guide their development and actions, creating a sound narrative. Nakanogane-san doesn’t have trouble finding his place, though. The creators here don’t just sit around while their characters fight to save the world: they take initiative on putting together the pieces of Altair’s past and goals to find the best course of action.Lastly, there’s Hikayu, the visual novel heroin created by Nishio Ohnishi (har har!), who’s a pervert. A good-hearted one, don’t be too harsh on the guy, he means well. Since her game of origin was primarily an eroge, Hykayu is disheartened to learn how exposed she’s to the world, which makes for some of the best comedic moments on the show, like when she does her badass entry during the heat of the combat, shouts her passionate entry lines, while feverishly blushing in shame of her outfit. Surprisingly, or maybe not, her game is not exclusively made of fap material and contains emotional moments that she carries over to her experience in the real world. Could this be a tangential commentary about the tastes of the stereotypically perverted otaku, who can accept a story having blatant smut as well as heartstring-pulling narrative? Perhaps a jab at how we feel the need to justify liking questionable material with the argument that it has a serious and emotionally gripping story? Who knows, but it does add more substance and weight to the notion that the writers and staff do know the ins, outs and running trends of the media they are representing in the anime, instead of simply crafting half-assed references.Chikujouin Magane (creator not important) is the one creation to have been a villain in her story, but like Yuuya, prefers to act by herself and have fun with people’s suffering. She takes quite the liking or the real world and for Souta’s emotional struggle, taking him and the creations as her main source of enjoyment for the first half of the show. She doesn’t seem to like Meteora very much, though, since the girl doesn’t fall easily for Magane’s mind tricks.On Altair’s side, the first ones to appear are Aliceteria, the idealistic knight, and Mamika, the unlucky Magical Girl.Mamika comes from a show for kids, where the morality is black & white, villains are recognizable at first glance, good people who don’t immediately side with the heroin just need to be beaten into agreement and violence is bloodless, so for her it’s a shock to learn that in this new reality her powers might inflict serious harm on people. Kind-hearted and naïve, she doesn’t so much change her nature as the series goes on, but instead learns about the complexities of the new world and takes different methods to bring end to conflict. Aliceteria, in the other hand, comes from an equally black & white reality, but one severely more violent, bloody and harsh than that of Mamika. Aliceteria is stubbornly idealistic, to a point where the anime makes it clear she fooled herself into believing the real world is really a home of sadistic, cynical gods, who created her reality just to amuse themselves with the suffering of the people in it, so it’s her duty to force her god, Takarada-san, to fix her world and free it from evil. Takarada himself looks like a young, emergent author who still hasn’t mastered the creation of layered and complex characters, relying on the archetypical noble hero to focus his work on. It’s partially through Souta’s intervention and passionate speech about why figures like Aliceteria are beloved on his world that she begins to realize how disconnected she is from the true motivations of her fans.Mamika and Aliceteria form a strong bond in their short time together, despite the difference in mentality. For once, when going to recruit a new creation, Mamika hopes it’s a good person, while Alice hopes it’s someone trustworthy and strong (to their dismay it’s neither), and it’s the similarity in values, despite the difference in priority, coupled with the courage and backbone that warms the knight to the young magical girl.These two characters, among others, help put into perspective one of the brilliant ideas applied on Re:Creators: the anime purposefully built one-dimensional characters into the narrative because in context they come from stories that aren’t as well fleshed out or detailed. Selesia and Meteora, were created by authors who intricately crafted their personalities, worldviews or universe, so when they come to the real world they act more human, but also can better understand the morality of their creators, while Mamika and Alice were shallow characters, created to be good and righteous, but lacking understanding of complex notions of right and wrong, so they become easy prey for a villain who can spout ideas that sound good and presents easy solutions to their problem. That shallowness is not the final state for them either, but a jumping point from where they develop into layered and intelligent individuals capable of understanding the new reality and taking the best decisions based on their own morals.Lastly, because going further would be spoiler, there’s Blitz Talker, the hard-boiled supporting character from the manga Code-Babylon, written and drawn by Suruga Shunma. Blitz clearly knows of Altair’s true intentions from the beginning, but stays with her because of his desire to protect her, whom he sees as weaker than she lets transpire. Suruga is an intriguing character because she keeps a low profile most of the time, not showing much of her personality and mindset. Most of the time she comes off as an aloof workaholic, constantly drawing, barely taking her eyes off the paper, only to look woefully uninterested when she did, but in her confrontation with her Blitz, she delivers plenty of substance. She makes for a great parallel to Setsuna. The girl had a sudden boost in notoriety, but didn’t have the time to grow up and learn to deal with the hate that comes with the spotlight and that negativity was too much for her young mind to deal with. Suruga, on the other hand, had to struggle with competition and criticism, suffered with the negativity, finally reaching enough success to be able to sustain herself with her art. Many viewers might think her outlook on fiction or her creative process is cynical, but it’s better to describe it as pragmatic and she shows to genuinely love and take pride on her work.On episode 03 the anime introduces the concept around which the entire plot revolves: audience acceptance. They first note that the characters to appear in the real world tend to be those who had the largest impact among the public, so after Matsubara fails to alter the description of Selesia, it becomes obvious that the creators can’t simply change their characters as they go along. They soon began to theorize that what can really affect their status is if they manage to get enough of the general public to empathize with the changes made to them, idea that is solidly proven in the events of episode 10. It’s based on that concept that the heroes elaborate their plan to defeat Altair, by crafting a story that would be able to gather acceptance from the public to the point where they are able to bait and trap Altair on the Bird Cage, a scenario located within the real and fictional words, where they’d be able to defeat her for good, with the approval of the public. Fun fact: Bird Cage is a reference to Altair’s name coming from the Arab word for bird.Looking at the contextual level it’s not hard to see that the idea of acceptance is a method of commenting on the common fictional elements that have the most success with the public on our own universe, as well as the difficulties faced by writers of popular works, who need to keep constantly in mind what the audience wants from them. Fiction is manipulation by nature, it’s designed to engage the audience in an illusion where the artist pulls the necessary strings to make us feel or think a certain way in relation to what happens to the characters. Bad fiction happens when the illusion is not convincing enough or when the trick is so poorly conveyed that we can see the strings in the background, and no character in Re:C exposes that better than Altair herself in the last few episodes. Not only are her powers the ability to manipulate the fabric of fiction (reason why she can’t simply nuke the world into oblivion), but her speech is constantly centered on the idea of what exactly pleases the audience and gets their acceptance. Her originally neutral condition also contributes to that concept: Altair is a character without cannon beyond the original powers given to her by her creator, so there’s little restraint for other artists to invent new abilities for her, as those new powers can just as easily get approval from the wider audience, contributing to her continuous growth in power and number of tricks up her sleeve. Part of me wonders if this is not a paradoxical trick the writer crafts with the audience. As the viewer, we are conditioned to expect the main villain to not go down until the very last moment, and only against a worthy hero that can pull off the strongest emotional reaction from the audience, therefore, the writers are fooling us into expecting Altair to pull off something new to aid her in battle, knowing that the nature of her powers allows for that.PresentationAcross the multitude of designs presented the anime displays excellence in keeping verisimilitude and coherence. In fact, that might be the most valuable quality of the work’s presentation, beyond the technical aspects, which are not shabby by any means: the directing is excellent, packed with clever transitions and enthralling shot composition (special shout out to that one camera movement in episode 06 that tells us with no effort that Magane just gets it).Every element of character design was conceived in a way that the experienced anime fan could safely note what they make reference to: Selesia and Charon dress in the angular and colorful style that has become a trend among light novel characters, clearly made to please cosplayers instead of having practical combat utility; Meteora sports the distinguishable attire of an RPG mage from works like the Tales franchise, cuz the design is clearly too confortable to be Final Fantasy; Kanoya uses the slick, futuristic uniform of robot pilots across the Mecha genre. All of this is important because it says something about the characters, not only from what kind of story they come from, but also their personalities. Even when in civilian outfits, the choice of clothing tells something about them: Meteora dresses with cute and childlike attire, because she’s a petit woman and is tired of constantly using a thick uniform, while Selesia’s adorably modest choices help flesh out her personality as reserved, possibly chaste.The same care extends to all the fictional websites, products that appear on the show as well as the different magic symbols used by the characters. The designers commented in interviews how there was an entire creative process behind the elaboration of the multiple logos, focused on creating an internally consistent scenario. There’s no “Gaagle” search engine or “PZP” console in this story, all the fictional products, social medias or websites presented here were designed to look and sound believable to the extent that one could easily think that Mauchly, Piclive or Songbird are a real thing, or that SONY might actually create a console called Play Portal, which I imagine would be a portable with meager first and third-party support.The sound department continues the effort in verisimilitude by featuring performances consistent with the universe and genre each character comes from. I’ve already mentioned Nobuhiko Okamoto previously, brilliantly cast as Sho, not just because of the irony but also because he’s can skillfully express Sho’s devoted and naïve mannerisms. Other clever choices are Suzumura Kenichi as Yuuya, fitting since this voice actor has experience with characters who speak in mischievous tone, and Minase Inoue, as Meteora, who previously worked as Rem in Re:Zero and is capable of pulling off a character who speaks stoically without falling into blandness. Now, voice actors are a fun subject and all, but that’s not even the most exciting aspect of how Re:Creators sounds. That would be Sawano Hiroyuki’s amazing soundtrack, tailor made for this anime. Permeated with intense electronic beat and bombastic energy, these songs are never misplaced; the same track can mark the intensity of action sequences but also play to great effect in comedic beats, adding more points to the directorial work. Just look at Selesia trying her new power or Hikayu doing her badass entry and you’ll know what I mean. The lyrics, off course, in songs like Here I Am (Mamika’s theme), God of ink, Layers, Brave the Ocean and World Etude are perfect mirrors for the characters inner thoughts and their goals.Personal RamblingsI first thought about talking about this in the story breakdown, but I decided to leave it for this section, as it is the main reason Meteora became my favorite character in the show and why I began to see this anime with higher appreciation. In episode 04, after learning about the passing of her creator, Meteora decides to play her game on its entirety. Later, she confesses her main grievance from when she came to the real world and talked about her experience with her own game: it was fun, and that’s all that matters, because all she needed was to known if her creator loved her world the same way she did. This moment was particularly relatable to me because it reminds me of a book I’ve read long ago, The Hour of the Star, where the narrator talks about the protagonist of his story, and about how he loved her. Later is that I came to realize that such love was not a traditional sentiment, but the love of the artist for his creation. Meteora’s confession displays the inverse route, from creation to the artist, but to me it emulates the sentiment of the audience, the feeling of experiencing a work that had love put into it, where the people involved were truly invested in created something that would resonate with the player, the reader or the viewer.Re:Creators is an anime I never knew I wanted, but now that I have it I wonder if there’ll ever be something else like it. The way multiple aspects of artistic creation are talked about and analyzed, the portrayal of the audience and Souta’s mindset as a passionate consumer were all relatable and the show frequently would surprise me by doing something I already expected, but in a way that I did not imagine. Rei Hiroe’s writing tends to do that.I sure hope there’s more originated from it, off course. The many works mentioned in the story might as well spawn new franchises in the future, now that they had the perfect introduction. I sure would love to see what they could make out of Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, since those who saw Re:C already know of some spoilers for it, or how they could conceive Mamika’s anime; perhaps as something initially childish-looking that progressively gets more serious and multifaceted. I know Mecha is in life-support nowadays, but it would be nice to see Infinite Divine Machine Mono Magia get its own anime too. The possibilities are not endless, but they sure are plentiful and can be fruitful as long as those works continue to have comparable quality of writing, directing and care put into them as much as it was put in Re:Creators.', 'Re: Creators is an awful but in the same time a unique series in a sense that it directly tells the viewers the reasons for its existence: the fact that hundreds of thousands of people can spend their time on and, most importantly, breathlessly enjoy and pay money for an ugly badly-written constantly fourth-wall breaking horribly directed nobody-on-the-staff-list-ever-cared pissing-on-the-other-shows pack of completely unrelated action scenes.When making an anime from some source material (manga/light novel), writers usually have trouble packing all the events in a video format. This is one of the reasons why so much shows are filled with exposition, scenes of characters thinking and...other ""better off reading it"" elements. But for these types of shows, this is mostly forgivable. However, if an anime-original content is also a bunch of ""characters talking and narrating, doing essentially nothing for a few episodes straight"" it should probably be noted that writers never even cared. The calamity of nothingness is especially noticeable in the beginning of the second part of the show; these episodes are just characters talking around without any emotion.But even such a show can be, at some level, enjoyable. Not the case with this one. The moment you realize the true depth of never-even-cared storywriting is somewhere at the end of the series. The interactions happening among the characters become to be much like this: ""Your plan failed! Ahahaha!"" or ""I\'ll definitely bring you down!"" or ""You\'ve been deceived. I am the good guy"" - ""Oh, ok"". And the problem is not the content of the phrases. The problem is that the characters\' interactions are narrowed down to this. And, as a result, the composition of the show essentially becomes an emotionless logbook of who did what.To be fair, the first half of the show looks a bit decent. Disregarding the fact that the first half of the second episode is already a pile of shameless exposition the things happening generally raise a certain level of emotion and tend to follow some logic. That is probably the reason why a certain someone declared this to be a ""classic anime in the making"". And I should probably mention that a lot of people like the music. I generally enjoyed it. However, in my opinion it is really generic to the point where I can swear I\'ve heard ED 2 (especially 0:09-0:22) somewhere before. But I\'m no expert in music so I\'ll leave it at that.It should be noted the show is not redeemed by these few good things I\'ve just mentioned. To add to the point, this show also contains the usual trope that half of bad stuff wouldn\'t have happened if the characters just kept doing something very simple. Which they obviously don\'t do cause logic means no plot.Overall, Re: Creators is an overhyped quick cash grab made by people who never cared. other ""better off reading it"" elements.

Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley.What began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening.This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the...theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion.Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it.If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide.The main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing.Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to.Overall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking.Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now. theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it.

Otherwise, I love this show and want it to improve. i want more show and not telli give it a 8 out of 10 the story is enough to keep you watching but don't be surprised if you want to skip through at points."", '""Being predictable is a sign that the show isn\'t amazing. It was an interesting ride that ended in an unexpected way.""****Personal comment: Original the score was 8.0 due to all the complaints from certain individuals and the unhealthy criticism about my incoherent score and my review I changed the score to 6.0. However, after consideration I thought, it is my review. ReCreators has several issues as I explain but I liked several parts of the anime so who cares. I thank all the persons that found and will find this review helpful****A reunion between fictional creations and a real world was possible in Re: Creators....A show with a high potential and entertainment. Sadly, it didn\'t fulfill all the expectations and could pass in the history as another predictable anime with a good art quality and a wasted character development.In the end, we will get a final that won\'t fit with all the sacrifices, characters descriptions, mature story progression but will please the fans.Score 7.6--- rounded 8.0. A story with plot craters and constant pacing change. The anime has some great parts. For example, the characters background, art, and sound. As several persons said to me, good art quality and sound can\'t save all the plot failures explained above but tastes are tastes, I liked it, yes could have been better.Story: 5.5 (Plot holes, predictable, average ending, waste of character building)Art:9.0Music: 9.0Characters: 7.0 (One of them have unexplained holes --> Altair).Enjoyment: 7.5 (Lack of right pacing, predictable, waste of great value characters, average ending).The story: The world is full of stories, we have fictional heroes, villains, all kind of characters. One day some creation (Altair) was able of transcending the fictional world and became a part the real world. She was full of hate and rage since her creator suffered and suicided. Altair couldn\'t accept this. She wanted revenge. She intends to destroy the reality. To achieve this small goal, she decided to move other fictional characters to the real world and convince them to help her. Nice, right?This story was very refreshing. Sadly, the authors filled it with several holes that could be compared with the surface of the moon. They failed to explain ""how"" Altair appeared in this world in first place. If Altair was near to be omnipotent, she didn\'t need the help of anyone, she could have waited for more acceptance, and in her, near Goddess state, she could have destroyed all the reality.No matter these RIDICULOUS conclusions the show is very predictable. In episode 11 you can start guessing how this is going to end and that is a sign that the story isn\'t refined. Furthermore, a narrative full of holes and with a lame explanation from the authors.For example, the nowhere illogical ""hole fill"" from a metaphysic event. The character has an essential background. If the creator omits information, it is restored or added by an unknown event that fixes plot holes. Will you believe that silly explanation from the authors? They didn\'t have a creative way to explain their concept mistakes, and they only say ""it is a blank character and the rest of the background information was added by (add an imaginary event here)."" (Hiroe gave a similar explanation in an interview)Also, the authors failed in creating an appropriate pacing. The first episodes are slow and tedious. We end listening bricks of information, seeing the same place and the same office, etc. We can ""build"" the characters with the motion that\'s why is called ""animation."" Let\'s not mistake creating a character background with a simple rhetorical conversation. In other words, they ignored the motion in the first episodes. In the end of the series (17 - 22) the pace improved, but they rushed a bit. In general, the speed isn\'t appropriate, reduces the enjoyment, and increases the series drops.The characters are the redeemable part of the series. Wistfully,  most of them are DISPOSABLE (even if we don\'t want to accept it). Some have a great background and build, few are annoying. They spend time developing them but, the authors have the bright idea of killing the most interesting characters. I know, it is right under certain circumstances (that change the central story core DIRECTLY), but they killed them in a way to maintain the spectators in front of the screen. Since the beginning, we can guess the solution and the creator of it. The other characters aren\'t needed for it.The main character, Souta. I read a lot of complaints of Souta (including the series lover ones). Who is Souta? A character that wasn\'t well developed and that evolved. He is annoying in the first part of the story, and at the end, he is having more guts than most of the heroes. That was sarcasm.About Altair, I like that villain a lot, but her character has several holes. The authors never give her an appropriate background. She is a pool of emotional disparity. Some persons will consider her a villain others a disturbed overpower person. It is funny seeing persons saying that she is an ""angel."" Do not make me laugh. It is like seeing Freeza petting a cat or saying that Light\'s actions from Death Note were right.Altair\'s powers, they do not have any context or background. The only way to explain her powers is saying ""a secondary creator added that power"" and contradicts the ""audience acceptance"" explanation from the whole show. All this mess created a lot of debate in the social media. Besides, all the discussion generates a never-ending loop. It is better not trying to explain this deep hole because we can\'t.There are some wasted characters, for example, Magane. From my perspective, this character could have been the worst villain and one with the greatest potentials around. The writers added her to explain ""why certain ideas worked"" and concluded her original background and built. Same for Meteora, a character that ended as a vessel that only activates events.The other main character Selestia. She ended as a secondary filler with an ""expendable"" sign on her forehead. What can I say, she is the ""real"" heroine here. The authors again erased the background, her reason for existence and failed. All her character development was flushed (spoiler alert) in an explosion. A total waste that explains us the disposable concept here. Selestia is another victim that will die for the sake of the rating.The remaining characters are for entertainment, and we couldn\'t see their story developed. Now we have more questions than answers.Example of debates: If Altair has several alternate versions, the other favorite characters will too and are more familiar. Some persons will say ""but her creator died, that\'s why she can get powers from other creators."" ""She has the Holopsicon."" Someone else will answer: Magane and Meteora\'s authors died too, and they aren\'t that overpowered. Even if she has the Holopsicon that doesn\'t explain HOW she appeared in the world. Pipe: Matsubara could give a copy of the Holopsicon to Magane or Meteora. He already created a copy of Altair so giving the Holopsicon to them isn\'t hard. The never-ending-loop. A simple explanation that shows us the lack of attention to the details from the writers. That\'s why we see narrative and plot holes every time.In conclusion, the characters have a significant development and background. However, the authors failed to make most of them essential for the story. For example, remove Selestia. You will conclude that nothing will change if she isn\'t there, the main story will end in the same way. Additionally, they didn\'t try to fix the ""background and plot holes.""The sound. It is good, the mix between the score, the fights are well made, and they did a marvelous work. About the songs, the OP1 and ED1 were part of the Oricon Jpop and Jap Billboard rankings for 2 - 3 weeks.The art is stunning compared with other series from the season. The fights maintain a high quality. They use an extensive palette color and design that changes from character to characters. A plus because the characters came from different worlds. In general, the art was well made. Maybe the budget didn\'t allow them to have a better motion in the first episodes.Finally, the show is predictable, and that\'s a negative aspect. There are some great parts, but the lack of a smooth motion in the first episodes and the plot issues will lower the enjoyment. No matter these problems the show can offer some entertainment. In the end, you will have some fun, but you will think that they could change some parts for a better result. You will conclude, Re:Creators isn\'t amazing and that they wasted a great potential in a show that could have been a masterpiece. A show with a high potential and entertainment.

You will conclude, Re:Creators isn\'t amazing and that they wasted a great potential in a show that could have been a masterpiece.', '*Beware of massive spoilers*Creativity is something to be cherished, at least when it\'s not used for malicious intent. Creativity is part of the soul of all good stories, and even the most generic, lifeless trite has at least something creative to call its own, for better or worse. Creators of fiction create their own worlds, characters, situations, etc., and exploring what would happen when their creations transcend fiction and leap into the realm of reality is, well, one of the most creative premises ever conceived in fiction, inevitable puns aside. However, premise draws is to a show, but execution is what keeps us away or...coming back, happy, disappointed, excited, or enraged. Luckily, this show actually knows what it\'s talking about, giving a real reason to stay invested every time it slows down. It\'s a fascinating show, to say the least, and I love it, blunders and all, thanks to its wonderful intrigue, character interactions, fights, and designs. Is this the best show of the year, certainly not, but it\'s damn good. It\'s going to be rather hard to make my review as meticulous as this show is, given that this review is probably the hardest I’ll ever make, but I’m willing to try, thanks to the power of taking notes for this wonderful show.So as I reach my proverbial hand, I ask you two things: will you join me on this magical journey, and do you have any questions? Hopefully, you said yes to both of these, but I will certainly never know. Regardless, provided that your question is one that this review can answer, let’s find out, shall we?This series glorifies the audience, treating them as actual gods. After all, our reception of a show, on the whole, is what determines its success, and so do our wallets, especially our wallets. We determine a show’s success by watching it and decides to spend money on it. This series knows that so it assumes that we tend to only do that for quality shows. Hence, it makes sure that each of the fictional stories these characters are pulled from are from series that many people in-universe find to be of good quality. It expects that we only watch the good stuff or at least support what we consider good. This isn\'t entirely true for real life audiences, but it\'s nice to see a show treat us so kindly as a whole. It also pays special attention to detail with audiences. It doesn\'t just show perfectly accepting and cheering audiences like all other series that have fictional audiences do, it even shows some that are very perceptive, saying stuff like “that\'s our writer, classic him” or even “man, haha, this is so stupid” which many of us are definitely like, especially myself.The series also downplays the power of creators. We’d like to think that they can always have full control over their stories and change them up on a whim, and thus assign them all the credit or blame. That simply isn\'t true, and the show knows this. It shows they you can\'t just revise a product and expect that to fly with the audiences, you need to add something that will work instead of changing things to something already established. Sometimes there are many writers that have to come to some kind of agreement or end up dealing with what other writers wrote down before them. I know this show didn\'t the to show the executive meddling side of things but that happens too. Characters try to get their creators to make massive changes and that doesn\'t work for the reasons mentioned above.I love how there are certain story actions that only certain characters end up doing. Of course, Selesia ends up having a minute long dialogue about why she’s doing what she’s doing in her big combat scene in episode 19, she’s a character of a Light Novel adaptation. Of course, Rui with his mech has to be the one to kill someone he cares about who is in another mech. Have you seen Gundam? Of course, he gets a plastic model kit for his robot. Again, Gundam.There here is some great foreshadowing here at play too. We get great foreshadowing as to why Sota refuses to tell anyone about Altair’s creator when they need to know and he already knows, he feels horrible about what happened to her creator, Setsuna, since he wasn\'t there for her when she needed some semblance of emotional support. Setsuna being a character in episode 20 for the show they were doing to take down Altair? Sota pinned the idea a few episodes back and they thought it would be a crazy and controversial move (turns out it was but they made a cover story). Charon being an antagonist? Marie flat out told this to Selesia back in episode 3, unaware that this was the anime adaptation version and not the original novel version, where she was betrayed.The pacing in this anime is really slow, like, Ergo Proxy levels of slow, but that\'s ok. The dialogue in this show is almost always necessary because it\'s slowly but surely feeding us more important information about the world or exploring the themes via the characters interacting with each other and their stories in some way. Almost never is a scene remotely wasted, and in fact, they probably should\'ve added a few scenes about the spinoffs leading into the big gargle so that some of the reveals don\'t come off as asspulls because of them needing to do something and saying “well, the characters told each other about this and you knew these were a thing so it\'s ok”. Maybe part of the spa scene in episode 16 could\'ve been taken out for that but it\'s more than just the plot dragging its feet like what some may claim.Of course, I can\'t spoil the series without talking about how it all ends. Think back the whole Setsuna episode 20 deal. This was the perfect way to beat Altair, as well as a very creative one. Altair had always felt resentment over how Setsuna’s fate went thanks to the ridicule she received upon the creation of Altair. Using this to their advantage was a brilliant move by Sota. Of course, most OP end villains are defeated through the hero becoming insanely strong and then killing them or otherwise sealing them up completely, but here, she\'s convinced and consoled dialogue, dialogue between her and the one she cared about, as their last resort, and none of it came off as anti-climactic. After all, this was the end of Altair’s character arc, resentful of the world for what it did to Setsuna and now finally meeting her and then finally relenting in everything.With the remaining creation characters sans Magane and the characters that died (or basically allowed themselves to reside at the end of the story at the end of episode 21 meant to contain Altair), we see everyone give their final goodbyes and move forward. Barring Meteora (and the ones above), the rest of the creations say goodbye to their creators and head back to their worlds with the kind of banter you\'d expect from them and their relationships with their writers, and everyone heads off to their old lives again, with new projects and anime adaptations in the works. Thus, we come back to Sota and Meteora, who submit their scripts and we see the title one last time, with every creation sans Altair just hanging out in a drawing. We now see the anime adaptation of the show Selesia was in end, in a way that seems like she’s giving encouragement to the audience, so by extension, Sota Nearly brought a tear to my eye with how great that ending was.Of course, this narrative isn\'t perfect. Even excluding some problems mentioned earlier, the series can really beat us over the head with the whole “creator” and “audience acceptance” bit and it can feel borderline pretentious towards the end at times. There are holes regarding Sota’s seemingly absent mom and the idea that he goes to school but we never see him go to school. We have no idea how Altair managed to become sentient let alone get into the real world, and despite teasing us the connection between Altair and Sota, they never interact even once, which is honestly mind-boggling. The dialogue in episode 11 in particular can get intrigue given that no one makes a move in that episode’s fight until after 20 seconds of someone talking. There are also a few minor missed opportunities as well but honestly the surprisingly rickety narrative is still pretty rich.A large chunk of what made this show great comes down to two things: character dynamics, and the “creations” themselves. They, along with certain things I’ll get to in a bit, make this cast so great, despite the fact that they probably shouldn’t be. I’ll tackle some of the creators first.Sota is...interesting. A lot of people complained that he was weak and unable to do much other than support until the end, but that\'s kinda the point. He’s an ordinary kid surrounded by ordinary yet fully grown adults and epic badasses with superpowers. I doubt you can say that he can get much done without it coming off as forced and stupid. Sure, a ton of things revolve around him in some way or another, but he only gets to do something epic in the end, that writing Setsuna into the story to be the one thing that stops Altair, all for the purpose of telling her something he wishes he could\'ve told her while she was still alive. After all, he wasn\'t exactly a great guy before, finding some glee in her ridicule and not being there when she needed someone the most, all out of jealousy. It\'s this character arc that makes him so appealing, seeing him try to deal with what he had done, even if it meant hindering the group until someone broke the truth out of him, forcing him to accept it and bite the bullet for his team. Besides, while you can consider him the main character, don\'t. In episode 1, he actively states that above all else, he’s just the guy who gets to bring us into this world where he is one of many characters whose perspectives are largely shown. Regardless, he’s still a great character for what he is.The other creators don\'t get as of an ability to be memorable. I actively forget the names of most of them, though I do still like some of them, especially Suruga and to a lesser extent Matsubara, whose sort of snarky yet eventually caring father/daughter-esque relationship became really nice to see. I like seeing what happens to a creator emotionally when he sees his creation die, in that he feels like a family member of his died. The only creator I really can\'t stand is Nishio. He is the typical ultra perv character and to see him as a creator was disconcerting. Thankfully he gets the least actual plot significance because everything about this guy is insufferable. Back to what makes Suruga the best creator character: the scene with her and Blitz. This scene was epic, showing just how much she understands her characters and how she was eventually able to convince him to betray Altair. She even came prepared with a bullet-proof vest because she’s that awesome.There are now two non-creation characters to really talk about now: Marine and Setsuna. Marine draws some obvious Setsuna parallels in that she sometimes feels ridiculed and saddened by what she is passionate about yet proceeds to keep drawing, much like Setsuna did prior to suicide, and she almost always feels like when she tries to do something right, she ends up making things worse. That made it even better when she managed to give Selesia that fire sword attack in episode 10, which was already an epic moment. I\'ve already touched on Setsuna’s suicide and how I feel like there should\'ve been more seen on her end as to why she committed it but she was still an alright character, just a typical shy but mostly happy teen who became depressed at the harsh reality of what success can bring you. It\'s a shame we don\'t get to know much about her, but the scene with her and Altair was, again, incredible. Now, with that said, time to move on the real stars of the show: the creations themselves!The creations, the first 9 anyway, are what drive this section home. They are responsible for most of the best banter in the show and most of the exploration of these themes that to them, are very existential. Their personalities are also the ones that challenge and get challenged constantly, more so than any of the human characters sans Sota, though it\'s more of his past actions and hiding from them that get challenged rather than his personality and motivations. Some of them draw especially major parallels with certain characters from shows of our world, and I\'ll address major ones I see along the way. Welp, let’s dive right in.Selesia is easily my favorite of the bunch. From her character design to her overall immense beauty, to her expressions and overall character, I love her more than any other character in the show. She’s the first we see have to really be hit with the reality her she is a fictional character, and I find it really amusing that this is the anime adaptation of her exclusively, so she eldest know what happens later in the novels. She had one it the weaker personalities on the whole but that\'s where the banter and facial expressions come in. Her facial expressions, particularly those of the dialogue-heavy, yet casual situations, are always hilarious and I like how she ends up arguing with Matsubara a lot until the halfway mark, and how she reacts to some situations like the exact way Rui shot her down in episode 5 or how insufferable Nishio was being in episode 15. It\'s also funny to see that she refuses to read the novel of her or watch the anime because she feels it\'s awkward and embarrassing. It\'s a shame she had to die, but hey, what can you do?Meteora is an interesting one. I can understand her boring many viewers, as even in her game she was mainly exposition, and that carried over immensely, so that\'s an understandable trait of hers, but especially early on in the show, we see her being the one who drives the meta themes home, like about how she ended up really enjoying her game and shaking her view based on the passion put into her game by the now deceased creator, or how she still recognizes Sota as someone who played the game as the protagonist. The recap episode with her was uproarious though, seeing her find a way to diss anyone she can from this story and even come up with a crazy alternate scenario that results in her winning against Altair easily to end the story. Of course, it would be her bro hung up complaints from the studio itself and the fact that the recap episode was planned from the beginning. Of course, she’s the first one to really form a friendship with Kikuchihara given their similar personalities, and it\'s nice to see that at the end, she’s the only one that ends up staying to become a writer herself.Yuuya and Rui are the two of the 9 I have the least to say about to they get to share. Yuuya’s a fun jackass for most of the show and it\'s funny seeing him come up with a weird nickname for Meteora. The dude has no qualms about who he fights and probably more than most characters, Magane (who I\'ll really get to soon) repulses him greatly. As for Rui, he really draws a lot of parallels with Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam, especially at the beginning. Think about it: a whiny, angsty, blue-haired mecha pilot who grows into someone better over time. I wish I could\'ve seen the development instead of knowing that he came back a changed man, but it was nice seeing him and Yuuya become bros and seeing him try to encourage Sota to be less scared and emotional.Hikayu’s easily the weakest of the bunch, both physically and as a character. She’s very timid and eventually gets superpowers, and she does a little bit of moralizing, but she doesn\'t really have a strong presence or dynamic, let alone anything she really brings to the table other than some flashy moves and more fanservice. Then again, both of the characters that get introduced after the ⅔ mark are kinda lame, and we’ll get to the other one later.A common trait you\'ll realize about these characters is how complex and informed they are. They\'re of stories that aren\'t hellholes or black and white morality shows, so they get to be very complex and actually willing to be as informed as possible about his world and the nature of creators, unlike the antagonists. Before we get to them though, we have one last character to talk about.Magane is a complete wildcard, and I\'m probably not the only one who hated her for a while, for right and wrong reasons. She doesn\'t care about anything other than having fun, and she finds the struggle and suffering of others to be really, really fun, just like one of my favorite villains of all time, Terumi from Blazblue, especially when she manages to really bring Sota to despair by making him doubt his team and bring back his repressed guilt of not being there for Setsuna prior to her dear. She fucks with him especially hard, making it even more cathartic in episode 19 when he accepts that like her, he’s not exactly a good person (though he isn\'t as bad as she is). She challenged so many characters’ own morals and feelings, including the more black and white morality of characters such as Alice and Mamika. I initially grew to hate her mannerisms and eagerness to repeat a word multiple times before continuing her dialogue, but I grew to kinda enjoy her presence towards the end, especially when she helps out our heroes in episodes 19 and 20 with her reality-warping powers. With her out of the way, time to move onto the antagonists.Mamika is clearly the most sympathetic of the group since she’s a magical girl protagonist. This means that her morality is so black and white that she perceives those to some listen to her words of peace as bad guys. It\'s epic to see how the attacks that are usually fairly harmless and acceptable in her world cause massive hysteria and destruction in real life, causing her to panic and feel horrible. I especially like her relationship with Alice, as while they are from stories of polar opposite tones and moods, their ideologies on how they want to save the world and defeat evil are one and the same, and they bond over that in an almost sisterly fashion, making Alice want revenge for Mamika’s death. Then again, a magical girl with “Mami” in the name is pretty much destined to die, and both of these two characters die in their pursuit of heroism and saving the world, with Altair doing both of them in. This means I\'ve basically described Alice as well, unfortunately, but that at least saves me some time. There is one thing about her to mention though, her Saber parallels. Blonde blade wielder from a sort of medieval-esque origin, her pose and background in the first OP being like that one set of Saber standing in a bloody battlefield of swords and armor, her almost naïve sense of justice. You see it too, don\'t you?Blitz is also interesting. Out of the people working under Altair, he’s the only one exclusively from a manga, at least the only one explosively stated as such from what I understand. He knows he isn\'t some big hero, so he isn\'t manipulated by Altair from that perspective. He’s just doing what he can to assist her because he feels resentment over his writer’s narrative in which he’s forced to kill his daughter, who looks kinda similar to Nunnally from Code Geass (it\'s like they know me). He feels like he’s a failure as a father and he, again, knows he’s not some grand hero, so he finds it odd to see his comrades behave the way they do, and his payoff in episode 18 after the already glorious confrontation between him and Suruga, as I already mentioned is great.Altair is easily the best of the antagonists though. She’s as bitter as she is pretentious. She can manipulate everyone with ease and her powers are beyond broken. Some people say that\'s automatically a bad thing, to have a villain sue character (a villain who is OP and constantly winning), but in this case, it really isn\'t, for reasons I\'m about to mention. Despite the fact that she stands around too much, she’s always one step ahead for most part, especially in the second half when she uses the good guys’ main plan against them and slowly and sadistically picks them off one by one. Everything she does is for Setsuna, as she feels outraged by what the world did to her, which is an interesting motivation for a villain, as we can see her so vulnerable so many times and just have an epic emotional outburst that feels reasonable for everyone. And again, the way she is defeated was perfect.Chiron and Shou are also kinda weak and don\'t get much time to really be fleshed out, but I like the foreshadowing for Chirion being an antagonist all the way back in episode 3 as that he does all of this because he’s tired of the fighting and suffering. Shou just wants revenge for his family, which is a decent motivation too, and his powers are also cool as shit though, so both of these guys are at least better late characters than Hikayu.So, you can no doubt see two common traits with some of these guys here. Some of them feel absolute resentment involving their creators while others feel like this is their duty, but all of them sans Altair are woefully uninformed of the abilities of the creator, completely overestimating them. I also find it interesting that none of them are created as villain characters, just heroes and one character that adopted the role as the villain due to having no role and nothing but hate, when the only character created as a villain, Magane, is just a brutal wildcard.Again, it\'s not just the personalities that make most of these characters great, but far more so what they represent and their relationships with each other that make them stand out. Obviously, I didn\'t bother giving everyone, as not everyone is really worth mentioning, and some of these characters are still weak, so I wouldn\'t say it\'s an all-around fantastic cast, but even still, the better ones here are amazing enough to elevate everything to nearly reach that level anyway. They\'re about as good from a characterization and writing standpoint as they are from a visual standpoint on the whole, and speaking of which...TROYCA was the spearhead behind this ambitious show, and the characters look pretty good. The writers and other normal people look...exactly that, plain and ordinary. After all, they\'re mere mortals in this real world, nothing inherently special. The character designs of the true fictional characters are pretty good, and I am an especially big fan of the designs for Selesia and Altair. Selesia looks genuinely lovely no matter what outfit she\'s in (and she gets to be in a ton of casual outfits that look fantastic on her, so these guys either have great fashion sense or she’s generally just that good, but I love that they did that) and Alrair’s design is physically pretty complex and interesting, with the detailed suit and gauntlet and even the eyes with the red pupil and blue top of the iris and black bottom side of the iris, to the point where it\'s accepted in canon that she’s a pain for the team to animate (yet they never mess up, good on them).The character expressions (especially Selesia’s) can be real funny when they need to be and despite them all coming from different genres, their art styles all work perfectly here. The action is pretty fun as well, with no real fault in the choreography, though the camera is sometimes in the way. Still, these set pieces are really cool and fun and so are some of the powers, and there is a ton of flashy abilities on display here, and adds specific moments that look exceptional. The CGI can range from pretty decent such as Selesia’s mech which is a gigantic pain to name, to really bad, especially Shou’s CGI mecha knight-looking thing, though they\'re only used for the mechs and cars. Their designs can look decent though, like Selesia’s mech (again). There is an insane amount of dialogue so there are plenty of moments where there isn\'t a whole lot of animation happening, unfortunately, and the environments aren\'t interesting enough to hold our attention, so thankfully the character interactions and great Sawano OST for most part do that job just fine, especially in the first half.It is a commonly accepted belief that Hiroyuki Sawano is among the greatest anime music composers to date, with famously beloved OSTs for Guilty Crown, Attack on Titan, and Kill la Kill. This one is no exception and is one of the few actually good popular anime that he had the luxury of working on. There are a plethora of really good tracks for this show, including both versions of “Layers” and “Brave the Ocean” (though I much prefer the original over the MOD version for both). Many of these tracks are good enough to help bolster the enjoyment of the more dialogue-heavy scenes, especially for game-changing discoveries (such as the track “creator”) so you can imagine how well they work for the fight scenes. This Sawano OST isn\'t his best unfortunately, as while it\'s pretty good, it\'s highs aren\'t as epic as those of his AoT and Kabaneri OSTs, nor do they really match the Gundam Unicorn OST, which I feel is his best anime OST to date, even if tracks like ""Re:Suspense"" are up there and are still numerous. That should come off as less of a knock on the show and more of a testament to his musical prowess that great isn\'t one of the best.OP 1, ""gravityWall"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie is a very catchy and epic tune that really preps you up for this crazy ride you’re about to have, and one of the best OPs of the Spring 2017 season. OP2, ""sh0ut"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie, is even more epic and empowering, especially with the buildup before the now famous “Sawano drop” moment where after the epic build up, the song shifts into high gear. This is easily one of the best OPs of Summer 2017, and sometimes I struggle between choosing which of these two OPs is the better of the two, they’re both that good. ED1, ""NEWLOOK"" by Mashiro Ayano, while a decent song and ED in its own right, is a bit disappointing since many shows that Sawano did the music for bad both great OPs and great EDs, like Attack On Titan, Gundam Unicorn Re:0096, and last year’s Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The episode 13 ED, ""world Étude"" by Aki Toyosaki, is a bit better and I like that it’s the trailer theme from Altair’s planned series that was discussed in this show, but it\'s still only ok. ED 2, ""Rubikon (ルビコン)"" by Sangatsu no Phantasia, really grew on me. At first, I kinda thought it was alright and that what they did with the visuals was way better by it fits really well with everything and is a really nice and happy song in and of itself. I especially enjoy what they did with the visuals and the mixing of the show’s animated elements and different art styles with real life stuff, making it a really pleasant cross between everything it talks about. You kinda need to see for yourself how great and inventive it is. Overall, Sawano did another really solid job, as he’s known for, even if this isn\'t his most epic work.I had a ton of fun with this show, and the way it handled its ingenious premise. The dialogue was usually riveting, if a bit nervously heavy-handed at times, the characters, especially the “creations” were great, the foreshadowing and attempts at causing suspicion were great (especially for the reveals of Altiar’s creator and the fact that Chirion, Selesia’s best friend, was an antagonist), the comedy was almost always spot on and uproarious, and the fights were fun as hell. Again, a lot of people are gonna feel bored with this one, especially thanks to its slow yet necessary pace and the fact that it is infinitely more dialogue-heavy than we were initially led to believe, but the dialogue is almost always interesting for aforementioned reasons, and barring maybe the first half of episode 16, every scene is necessary, nothing is wasted, so despite it feeling like it drags at times, it almost never truly stalls. I like how it basically glorifies the audience as like a wrathful god that only likes good entertainment (we wish), even if the show sometimes feels like it has to hammer the point of some things home (probably out of fear, even though this backfired for many people).Back when this show was still coming out, I heard the mixed to negative reception of this show from many of my friends. Needless to say, I was beyond worried, and I began pleading for this show to be good. I am so released to say that I\'m not disappointed in the slightest. Re:Creators is anything but recycled garbage, it’s actually ambitious, interesting, and creative. Are there missed opportunities? Yeah. Is it heavy-handed and at times boring? Sure. Are there a few downright asinine aspects to this series. Certainly. That doesn’t stop how smart and epic this show is with its amazing premise or wonderful character interactions. This show kind of glorifies and expects a ton from you, which is charming in its own way. It’s in no way pretentious, but it’s more ambitious than most anime of this year, using so many kinds of tropes and characters from other genres perfectly and juxtaposing them with real life, as well as showing how a real setting that can allow for many more scenarios than a typical storyline for these characters can bring out so many different sides of them and incite some actual change from them. That makes it hilariously ironic given that this is a work of fiction though, and I’m not entirely sure if it’s aware of that or not. Even still, this is definitely one of the standout titles of the year, as it\'s a wonderful ode to creators and the work they put everything into. Now, as always, I bid you adieu. coming back, happy, disappointed, excited, or enraged. Luckily, this show actually knows what it\'s talking about, giving a real reason to stay invested every time it slows down. It\'s a fascinating show, to say the least, and I love it, blunders and all, thanks to its wonderful intrigue, character interactions, fights, and designs. Is this the best show of the year, certainly not, but it\'s damn good. It\'s going to be rather hard to make my review as meticulous as this show is, given that this review is probably the hardest I’ll ever make, but I’m willing to try, thanks to the power of taking notes for this wonderful show.So as I reach my proverbial hand, I ask you two things: will you join me on this magical journey, and do you have any questions? Hopefully, you said yes to both of these, but I will certainly never know. Regardless, provided that your question is one that this review can answer, let’s find out, shall we?This series glorifies the audience, treating them as actual gods. After all, our reception of a show, on the whole, is what determines its success, and so do our wallets, especially our wallets. We determine a show’s success by watching it and decides to spend money on it. This series knows that so it assumes that we tend to only do that for quality shows. Hence, it makes sure that each of the fictional stories these characters are pulled from are from series that many people in-universe find to be of good quality. It expects that we only watch the good stuff or at least support what we consider good. This isn\'t entirely true for real life audiences, but it\'s nice to see a show treat us so kindly as a whole. It also pays special attention to detail with audiences. It doesn\'t just show perfectly accepting and cheering audiences like all other series that have fictional audiences do, it even shows some that are very perceptive, saying stuff like “that\'s our writer, classic him” or even “man, haha, this is so stupid” which many of us are definitely like, especially myself.The series also downplays the power of creators. We’d like to think that they can always have full control over their stories and change them up on a whim, and thus assign them all the credit or blame. That simply isn\'t true, and the show knows this. It shows they you can\'t just revise a product and expect that to fly with the audiences, you need to add something that will work instead of changing things to something already established. Sometimes there are many writers that have to come to some kind of agreement or end up dealing with what other writers wrote down before them. I know this show didn\'t the to show the executive meddling side of things but that happens too. Characters try to get their creators to make massive changes and that doesn\'t work for the reasons mentioned above.I love how there are certain story actions that only certain characters end up doing. Of course, Selesia ends up having a minute long dialogue about why she’s doing what she’s doing in her big combat scene in episode 19, she’s a character of a Light Novel adaptation. Of course, Rui with his mech has to be the one to kill someone he cares about who is in another mech. Have you seen Gundam? Of course, he gets a plastic model kit for his robot. Again, Gundam.There here is some great foreshadowing here at play too. We get great foreshadowing as to why Sota refuses to tell anyone about Altair’s creator when they need to know and he already knows, he feels horrible about what happened to her creator, Setsuna, since he wasn\'t there for her when she needed some semblance of emotional support. Setsuna being a character in episode 20 for the show they were doing to take down Altair? Sota pinned the idea a few episodes back and they thought it would be a crazy and controversial move (turns out it was but they made a cover story). Charon being an antagonist? Marie flat out told this to Selesia back in episode 3, unaware that this was the anime adaptation version and not the original novel version, where she was betrayed.The pacing in this anime is really slow, like, Ergo Proxy levels of slow, but that\'s ok. The dialogue in this show is almost always necessary because it\'s slowly but surely feeding us more important information about the world or exploring the themes via the characters interacting with each other and their stories in some way. Almost never is a scene remotely wasted, and in fact, they probably should\'ve added a few scenes about the spinoffs leading into the big gargle so that some of the reveals don\'t come off as asspulls because of them needing to do something and saying “well, the characters told each other about this and you knew these were a thing so it\'s ok”. Maybe part of the spa scene in episode 16 could\'ve been taken out for that but it\'s more than just the plot dragging its feet like what some may claim.Of course, I can\'t spoil the series without talking about how it all ends. Think back the whole Setsuna episode 20 deal. This was the perfect way to beat Altair, as well as a very creative one. Altair had always felt resentment over how Setsuna’s fate went thanks to the ridicule she received upon the creation of Altair. Using this to their advantage was a brilliant move by Sota. Of course, most OP end villains are defeated through the hero becoming insanely strong and then killing them or otherwise sealing them up completely, but here, she\'s convinced and consoled dialogue, dialogue between her and the one she cared about, as their last resort, and none of it came off as anti-climactic. After all, this was the end of Altair’s character arc, resentful of the world for what it did to Setsuna and now finally meeting her and then finally relenting in everything.With the remaining creation characters sans Magane and the characters that died (or basically allowed themselves to reside at the end of the story at the end of episode 21 meant to contain Altair), we see everyone give their final goodbyes and move forward. Barring Meteora (and the ones above), the rest of the creations say goodbye to their creators and head back to their worlds with the kind of banter you\'d expect from them and their relationships with their writers, and everyone heads off to their old lives again, with new projects and anime adaptations in the works. Thus, we come back to Sota and Meteora, who submit their scripts and we see the title one last time, with every creation sans Altair just hanging out in a drawing. We now see the anime adaptation of the show Selesia was in end, in a way that seems like she’s giving encouragement to the audience, so by extension, Sota Nearly brought a tear to my eye with how great that ending was.Of course, this narrative isn\'t perfect. Even excluding some problems mentioned earlier, the series can really beat us over the head with the whole “creator” and “audience acceptance” bit and it can feel borderline pretentious towards the end at times. There are holes regarding Sota’s seemingly absent mom and the idea that he goes to school but we never see him go to school. We have no idea how Altair managed to become sentient let alone get into the real world, and despite teasing us the connection between Altair and Sota, they never interact even once, which is honestly mind-boggling. The dialogue in episode 11 in particular can get intrigue given that no one makes a move in that episode’s fight until after 20 seconds of someone talking. There are also a few minor missed opportunities as well but honestly the surprisingly rickety narrative is still pretty rich.A large chunk of what made this show great comes down to two things: character dynamics, and the “creations” themselves. They, along with certain things I’ll get to in a bit, make this cast so great, despite the fact that they probably shouldn’t be. I’ll tackle some of the creators first.Sota is...interesting. A lot of people complained that he was weak and unable to do much other than support until the end, but that\'s kinda the point. He’s an ordinary kid surrounded by ordinary yet fully grown adults and epic badasses with superpowers. I doubt you can say that he can get much done without it coming off as forced and stupid. Sure, a ton of things revolve around him in some way or another, but he only gets to do something epic in the end, that writing Setsuna into the story to be the one thing that stops Altair, all for the purpose of telling her something he wishes he could\'ve told her while she was still alive. After all, he wasn\'t exactly a great guy before, finding some glee in her ridicule and not being there when she needed someone the most, all out of jealousy. It\'s this character arc that makes him so appealing, seeing him try to deal with what he had done, even if it meant hindering the group until someone broke the truth out of him, forcing him to accept it and bite the bullet for his team. Besides, while you can consider him the main character, don\'t. In episode 1, he actively states that above all else, he’s just the guy who gets to bring us into this world where he is one of many characters whose perspectives are largely shown. Regardless, he’s still a great character for what he is.The other creators don\'t get as of an ability to be memorable. I actively forget the names of most of them, though I do still like some of them, especially Suruga and to a lesser extent Matsubara, whose sort of snarky yet eventually caring father/daughter-esque relationship became really nice to see. I like seeing what happens to a creator emotionally when he sees his creation die, in that he feels like a family member of his died. The only creator I really can\'t stand is Nishio. He is the typical ultra perv character and to see him as a creator was disconcerting. Thankfully he gets the least actual plot significance because everything about this guy is insufferable. Back to what makes Suruga the best creator character: the scene with her and Blitz. This scene was epic, showing just how much she understands her characters and how she was eventually able to convince him to betray Altair. She even came prepared with a bullet-proof vest because she’s that awesome.There are now two non-creation characters to really talk about now: Marine and Setsuna. Marine draws some obvious Setsuna parallels in that she sometimes feels ridiculed and saddened by what she is passionate about yet proceeds to keep drawing, much like Setsuna did prior to suicide, and she almost always feels like when she tries to do something right, she ends up making things worse. That made it even better when she managed to give Selesia that fire sword attack in episode 10, which was already an epic moment. I\'ve already touched on Setsuna’s suicide and how I feel like there should\'ve been more seen on her end as to why she committed it but she was still an alright character, just a typical shy but mostly happy teen who became depressed at the harsh reality of what success can bring you. It\'s a shame we don\'t get to know much about her, but the scene with her and Altair was, again, incredible. Now, with that said, time to move on the real stars of the show: the creations themselves!The creations, the first 9 anyway, are what drive this section home. They are responsible for most of the best banter in the show and most of the exploration of these themes that to them, are very existential. Their personalities are also the ones that challenge and get challenged constantly, more so than any of the human characters sans Sota, though it\'s more of his past actions and hiding from them that get challenged rather than his personality and motivations. Some of them draw especially major parallels with certain characters from shows of our world, and I\'ll address major ones I see along the way. Welp, let’s dive right in.Selesia is easily my favorite of the bunch. From her character design to her overall immense beauty, to her expressions and overall character, I love her more than any other character in the show. She’s the first we see have to really be hit with the reality her she is a fictional character, and I find it really amusing that this is the anime adaptation of her exclusively, so she eldest know what happens later in the novels. She had one it the weaker personalities on the whole but that\'s where the banter and facial expressions come in. Her facial expressions, particularly those of the dialogue-heavy, yet casual situations, are always hilarious and I like how she ends up arguing with Matsubara a lot until the halfway mark, and how she reacts to some situations like the exact way Rui shot her down in episode 5 or how insufferable Nishio was being in episode 15. It\'s also funny to see that she refuses to read the novel of her or watch the anime because she feels it\'s awkward and embarrassing. It\'s a shame she had to die, but hey, what can you do?Meteora is an interesting one. I can understand her boring many viewers, as even in her game she was mainly exposition, and that carried over immensely, so that\'s an understandable trait of hers, but especially early on in the show, we see her being the one who drives the meta themes home, like about how she ended up really enjoying her game and shaking her view based on the passion put into her game by the now deceased creator, or how she still recognizes Sota as someone who played the game as the protagonist. The recap episode with her was uproarious though, seeing her find a way to diss anyone she can from this story and even come up with a crazy alternate scenario that results in her winning against Altair easily to end the story. Of course, it would be her bro hung up complaints from the studio itself and the fact that the recap episode was planned from the beginning. Of course, she’s the first one to really form a friendship with Kikuchihara given their similar personalities, and it\'s nice to see that at the end, she’s the only one that ends up staying to become a writer herself.Yuuya and Rui are the two of the 9 I have the least to say about to they get to share. Yuuya’s a fun jackass for most of the show and it\'s funny seeing him come up with a weird nickname for Meteora. The dude has no qualms about who he fights and probably more than most characters, Magane (who I\'ll really get to soon) repulses him greatly. As for Rui, he really draws a lot of parallels with Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam, especially at the beginning. Think about it: a whiny, angsty, blue-haired mecha pilot who grows into someone better over time. I wish I could\'ve seen the development instead of knowing that he came back a changed man, but it was nice seeing him and Yuuya become bros and seeing him try to encourage Sota to be less scared and emotional.Hikayu’s easily the weakest of the bunch, both physically and as a character. She’s very timid and eventually gets superpowers, and she does a little bit of moralizing, but she doesn\'t really have a strong presence or dynamic, let alone anything she really brings to the table other than some flashy moves and more fanservice. Then again, both of the characters that get introduced after the ⅔ mark are kinda lame, and we’ll get to the other one later.A common trait you\'ll realize about these characters is how complex and informed they are. They\'re of stories that aren\'t hellholes or black and white morality shows, so they get to be very complex and actually willing to be as informed as possible about his world and the nature of creators, unlike the antagonists. Before we get to them though, we have one last character to talk about.Magane is a complete wildcard, and I\'m probably not the only one who hated her for a while, for right and wrong reasons. She doesn\'t care about anything other than having fun, and she finds the struggle and suffering of others to be really, really fun, just like one of my favorite villains of all time, Terumi from Blazblue, especially when she manages to really bring Sota to despair by making him doubt his team and bring back his repressed guilt of not being there for Setsuna prior to her dear. She fucks with him especially hard, making it even more cathartic in episode 19 when he accepts that like her, he’s not exactly a good person (though he isn\'t as bad as she is). She challenged so many characters’ own morals and feelings, including the more black and white morality of characters such as Alice and Mamika. I initially grew to hate her mannerisms and eagerness to repeat a word multiple times before continuing her dialogue, but I grew to kinda enjoy her presence towards the end, especially when she helps out our heroes in episodes 19 and 20 with her reality-warping powers. With her out of the way, time to move onto the antagonists.Mamika is clearly the most sympathetic of the group since she’s a magical girl protagonist. This means that her morality is so black and white that she perceives those to some listen to her words of peace as bad guys. It\'s epic to see how the attacks that are usually fairly harmless and acceptable in her world cause massive hysteria and destruction in real life, causing her to panic and feel horrible. I especially like her relationship with Alice, as while they are from stories of polar opposite tones and moods, their ideologies on how they want to save the world and defeat evil are one and the same, and they bond over that in an almost sisterly fashion, making Alice want revenge for Mamika’s death. Then again, a magical girl with “Mami” in the name is pretty much destined to die, and both of these two characters die in their pursuit of heroism and saving the world, with Altair doing both of them in. This means I\'ve basically described Alice as well, unfortunately, but that at least saves me some time. There is one thing about her to mention though, her Saber parallels. Blonde blade wielder from a sort of medieval-esque origin, her pose and background in the first OP being like that one set of Saber standing in a bloody battlefield of swords and armor, her almost naïve sense of justice. You see it too, don\'t you?Blitz is also interesting. Out of the people working under Altair, he’s the only one exclusively from a manga, at least the only one explosively stated as such from what I understand. He knows he isn\'t some big hero, so he isn\'t manipulated by Altair from that perspective. He’s just doing what he can to assist her because he feels resentment over his writer’s narrative in which he’s forced to kill his daughter, who looks kinda similar to Nunnally from Code Geass (it\'s like they know me). He feels like he’s a failure as a father and he, again, knows he’s not some grand hero, so he finds it odd to see his comrades behave the way they do, and his payoff in episode 18 after the already glorious confrontation between him and Suruga, as I already mentioned is great.Altair is easily the best of the antagonists though. She’s as bitter as she is pretentious. She can manipulate everyone with ease and her powers are beyond broken. Some people say that\'s automatically a bad thing, to have a villain sue character (a villain who is OP and constantly winning), but in this case, it really isn\'t, for reasons I\'m about to mention. Despite the fact that she stands around too much, she’s always one step ahead for most part, especially in the second half when she uses the good guys’ main plan against them and slowly and sadistically picks them off one by one. Everything she does is for Setsuna, as she feels outraged by what the world did to her, which is an interesting motivation for a villain, as we can see her so vulnerable so many times and just have an epic emotional outburst that feels reasonable for everyone. And again, the way she is defeated was perfect.Chiron and Shou are also kinda weak and don\'t get much time to really be fleshed out, but I like the foreshadowing for Chirion being an antagonist all the way back in episode 3 as that he does all of this because he’s tired of the fighting and suffering. Shou just wants revenge for his family, which is a decent motivation too, and his powers are also cool as shit though, so both of these guys are at least better late characters than Hikayu.So, you can no doubt see two common traits with some of these guys here. Some of them feel absolute resentment involving their creators while others feel like this is their duty, but all of them sans Altair are woefully uninformed of the abilities of the creator, completely overestimating them. I also find it interesting that none of them are created as villain characters, just heroes and one character that adopted the role as the villain due to having no role and nothing but hate, when the only character created as a villain, Magane, is just a brutal wildcard.Again, it\'s not just the personalities that make most of these characters great, but far more so what they represent and their relationships with each other that make them stand out. Obviously, I didn\'t bother giving everyone, as not everyone is really worth mentioning, and some of these characters are still weak, so I wouldn\'t say it\'s an all-around fantastic cast, but even still, the better ones here are amazing enough to elevate everything to nearly reach that level anyway. They\'re about as good from a characterization and writing standpoint as they are from a visual standpoint on the whole, and speaking of which...TROYCA was the spearhead behind this ambitious show, and the characters look pretty good. The writers and other normal people look...exactly that, plain and ordinary. After all, they\'re mere mortals in this real world, nothing inherently special. The character designs of the true fictional characters are pretty good, and I am an especially big fan of the designs for Selesia and Altair. Selesia looks genuinely lovely no matter what outfit she\'s in (and she gets to be in a ton of casual outfits that look fantastic on her, so these guys either have great fashion sense or she’s generally just that good, but I love that they did that) and Alrair’s design is physically pretty complex and interesting, with the detailed suit and gauntlet and even the eyes with the red pupil and blue top of the iris and black bottom side of the iris, to the point where it\'s accepted in canon that she’s a pain for the team to animate (yet they never mess up, good on them).The character expressions (especially Selesia’s) can be real funny when they need to be and despite them all coming from different genres, their art styles all work perfectly here. The action is pretty fun as well, with no real fault in the choreography, though the camera is sometimes in the way. Still, these set pieces are really cool and fun and so are some of the powers, and there is a ton of flashy abilities on display here, and adds specific moments that look exceptional. The CGI can range from pretty decent such as Selesia’s mech which is a gigantic pain to name, to really bad, especially Shou’s CGI mecha knight-looking thing, though they\'re only used for the mechs and cars. Their designs can look decent though, like Selesia’s mech (again). There is an insane amount of dialogue so there are plenty of moments where there isn\'t a whole lot of animation happening, unfortunately, and the environments aren\'t interesting enough to hold our attention, so thankfully the character interactions and great Sawano OST for most part do that job just fine, especially in the first half.It is a commonly accepted belief that Hiroyuki Sawano is among the greatest anime music composers to date, with famously beloved OSTs for Guilty Crown, Attack on Titan, and Kill la Kill. This one is no exception and is one of the few actually good popular anime that he had the luxury of working on. There are a plethora of really good tracks for this show, including both versions of “Layers” and “Brave the Ocean” (though I much prefer the original over the MOD version for both). Many of these tracks are good enough to help bolster the enjoyment of the more dialogue-heavy scenes, especially for game-changing discoveries (such as the track “creator”) so you can imagine how well they work for the fight scenes. This Sawano OST isn\'t his best unfortunately, as while it\'s pretty good, it\'s highs aren\'t as epic as those of his AoT and Kabaneri OSTs, nor do they really match the Gundam Unicorn OST, which I feel is his best anime OST to date, even if tracks like ""Re:Suspense"" are up there and are still numerous. That should come off as less of a knock on the show and more of a testament to his musical prowess that great isn\'t one of the best.OP 1, ""gravityWall"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie is a very catchy and epic tune that really preps you up for this crazy ride you’re about to have, and one of the best OPs of the Spring 2017 season. OP2, ""sh0ut"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie, is even more epic and empowering, especially with the buildup before the now famous “Sawano drop” moment where after the epic build up, the song shifts into high gear. This is easily one of the best OPs of Summer 2017, and sometimes I struggle between choosing which of these two OPs is the better of the two, they’re both that good. ED1, ""NEWLOOK"" by Mashiro Ayano, while a decent song and ED in its own right, is a bit disappointing since many shows that Sawano did the music for bad both great OPs and great EDs, like Attack On Titan, Gundam Unicorn Re:0096, and last year’s Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The episode 13 ED, ""world Étude"" by Aki Toyosaki, is a bit better and I like that it’s the trailer theme from Altair’s planned series that was discussed in this show, but it\'s still only ok. ED 2, ""Rubikon (ルビコン)"" by Sangatsu no Phantasia, really grew on me. At first, I kinda thought it was alright and that what they did with the visuals was way better by it fits really well with everything and is a really nice and happy song in and of itself. I especially enjoy what they did with the visuals and the mixing of the show’s animated elements and different art styles with real life stuff, making it a really pleasant cross between everything it talks about. You kinda need to see for yourself how great and inventive it is. Overall, Sawano did another really solid job, as he’s known for, even if this isn\'t his most epic work.I had a ton of fun with this show, and the way it handled its ingenious premise. The dialogue was usually riveting, if a bit nervously heavy-handed at times, the characters, especially the “creations” were great, the foreshadowing and attempts at causing suspicion were great (especially for the reveals of Altiar’s creator and the fact that Chirion, Selesia’s best friend, was an antagonist), the comedy was almost always spot on and uproarious, and the fights were fun as hell. Again, a lot of people are gonna feel bored with this one, especially thanks to its slow yet necessary pace and the fact that it is infinitely more dialogue-heavy than we were initially led to believe, but the dialogue is almost always interesting for aforementioned reasons, and barring maybe the first half of episode 16, every scene is necessary, nothing is wasted, so despite it feeling like it drags at times, it almost never truly stalls. I like how it basically glorifies the audience as like a wrathful god that only likes good entertainment (we wish), even if the show sometimes feels like it has to hammer the point of some things home (probably out of fear, even though this backfired for many people).Back when this show was still coming out, I heard the mixed to negative reception of this show from many of my friends. Needless to say, I was beyond worried, and I began pleading for this show to be good. I am so released to say that I\'m not disappointed in the slightest. Re:Creators is anything but recycled garbage, it’s actually ambitious, interesting, and creative. Are there missed opportunities? Yeah. Is it heavy-handed and at times boring? Sure. Are there a few downright asinine aspects to this series. Certainly. That doesn’t stop how smart and epic this show is with its amazing premise or wonderful character interactions. This show kind of glorifies and expects a ton from you, which is charming in its own way. It’s in no way pretentious, but it’s more ambitious than most anime of this year, using so many kinds of tropes and characters from other genres perfectly and juxtaposing them with real life, as well as showing how a real setting that can allow for many more scenarios than a typical storyline for these characters can bring out so many different sides of them and incite some actual change from them. That makes it hilariously ironic given that this is a work of fiction though, and I’m not entirely sure if it’s aware of that or not. Even still, this is definitely one of the standout titles of the year, as it\'s a wonderful ode to creators and the work they put everything into. Now, as always, I bid you adieu.', ""Many of us, especially those newer to anime, consider Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann to be among the best, most powerful, and most well-written anime out there, and this final consideration is given by the fact its genius playwright author, Kazuki Nakashima, masterfully constructed its world to be one in which the existence of plot holes was almost completely null and void thanks to the cleverness of a single in-universe mechanic. Spiral Power, the ability to do anything and everything with the right amount of classic shounen fighting spirit, could justify any occurrence whatsoever so long as the characters’ motivations were properly preestablished and consistent. Not...only was this mechanic used to orchestrate some of the most spectacular developments in anime history without compromising the internal logical and immersion of the show at hand, but it was used more meaningfully to deeply theme itself with the ultimate display of universal human empowerment and denial of determinism. If the community at large could understand, appreciate, and accept this and install TTGL as the cultural icon it has since become, then I don’t quite understand why no one seemed to do the same for Re:Creators, a show which not only did just about the same thing, but did it in a way which made far more sense.Re:Creators is an otaku culture potpourri of meta-commentary revolving around Creations, pop-media characters being brought to life by their own prominence in the real world, a measure which is decided by how thoroughly and ubiquitously they and their stories have influenced real people in their real lives—which is something I’m sure you and I can both heavily relate to as anime fans. The show does a shockingly realistic job at showing you in intimate detail how the natural propensities of these characters can be dangerous or dissociative when brought into reality under the right circumstances despite being completely understandable in the fictitious worlds they’d been living in up until this point, like a Warrior who resents our society for engaging with her narrative as entertainment when she was actually there experiencing it as a real, war-torn hellscape, or a magical girl who isn’t afraid to dish out apocalyptic levels of violence because in her world explosions only leave behind pixie dust, not corpses. Since the show doesn’t bother churning through all the Creations’ backstories and past lives to force their character development down our throats, it gets to use its time delivering on some juicy “show don’t tell” storytelling, letting us bear witness to their conversations and altercations with one another and their respective Creators, their authors, and judge them for ourselves by both their actions and their words. I loved Re:Creators first and foremost for not handling the humanity of its cast with the same ham-fisted dialogue and obnoxious flashbacks I’ve come to expect from anime, but through genuine discussion and interaction. And for this scripting expertise which assumes you’re not so dense as to miss out on the nuance and subtext, we have to thank none other than the legendary manga author who you’d never expect director Ei Aoki to get on board to write this thing: Rei Hiroe. Yup, this uncharacteristically intelligent, excessively talkative, plot-heavy narrative about how our hyperconnected society conditions us to be reclusive and how the pains of our lives can be transmitted through and reflected by art is also filled to the brim with incredible action, as if it didn’t already have enough going for it.Before you start worrying this anime juggles too many genres with the amount of ideas it explores with the amount of characters it does so with, I’ll just come out and concede that, indeed, it does, but while there is a small time skip, the plot of Re:Creators is totally linear and essentially boils down to a smarter version of any battle royale show of its ilk right up until its finale when it goes all out on the TTGL action I began with discussing. There’s no stupid or barely explained death game plotline underlying the Creations being brought to life, but rather a naturally flowing story in which people subconsciously bring themselves into conflict with one another based on serious and well-considered philosophical disagreements and truly passionate motivations any viewer with even the most modest opinions on society will have no trouble connecting with or investing in. You are always keenly aware of exactly why everyone is angry with whoever they’re angry with and precisely what about said individual or individuals triggered them to fight, because everything always makes logical sense in regard to the plot and motivational sense concerning the characters and how the events which took place lead them to where they’re currently standing (which then makes the rudimentary strategy employed by the characters in conflict seem that much more foreshadowed and smartly written). Whereas most battle royales will prolong confrontations by separating opponents who should’ve had one another in mortal combat, Re:Creators makes itself something of thriller at times—at least in its fast-paced and mysterious opening arc—introducing new elements to the already obscure mechanics at play and already obfuscated players on the field to make any twists, turns, and delays feel less like asspulls and lazy writing and more like an exciting addition to an already creatively overflowing story. Perhaps I’m merely lampshading a more damning issue with the series, but only once all the cards are on the table do the limiters pop off and let the production values of this beauty really strut their stuff.As shamelessly teased by the conclusions of both previous paragraphs, the action in this show is outstanding, and while action is typically something of little value in my eyes when compared to some thoughtful dialogue, resonant characterization, or deeper themes, when a show has all those bases covered to at least some degree as Re:Creators most certainly does, that’s when the indulgence in the spectacle can begin. Given that the Creations are literally fiction within fiction, their powers are all original and from entirely different worlds, and I can easily see why this might scare viewers away given the natural assumption all of these powers come with their own overblown Hunter x Hunter exposition dump to explain in painful detail their own asinine light novel magic system and how it measures up to those of the other Creations and their own asinine light novel magic system. Luckily, this ambitious monster of an original anime was written by the author of Black Lagoon, who takes pride in giving tugboats airtime and arming maids with shotgun-umbrellas, obviously lacking all the inhibition in the world, and thereby being one who feels no need to stress over the details most shounen anime end up feeling even dumber for for even taking seriously in the first place. He happily assumes you have enough capacity for enjoyment to recognize these are literally fictional characters within a fictional anime, and their powers are from anime within said anime, so of course you don’t know exactly what you're looking at. To top it all off, the spectacle TROYCA effortlessly tosses around is of the production quality which can stand tall next to the best studios around, and given the fact they’re backed by Ei Aoki’s expert visual direction and Hiroyuki Sawano’s characteristically awe-inspiring soundtrack, the reality this is all meant to ride on cinematic punch as opposed to analytical realism becomes all the more clear and all the more fun. It just wants you to take a seat in this rollicking roller coaster ride next to Sōta, our “fish out of water” protagonist who stands back gawking at the flair just as you and I do, and enjoy the ride to its fullest, and the fact the line to get on this ride doesn’t start outside the park is honestly baffling to me.To explain why others may misguidedly lead you into believing this show is bad, I’ll have to state one MAJOR SPOILER from episode ten, so if you don’t wish to be spoiled, please skip to the final paragraph and finish this review should you so wish.———In episode ten, you learn the Creators have the power to change the nature and the abilities of their Creations via “audience acceptance.” They had tried to draw new powers into the story in a controlled and private environment to see if they could alter the Creations in real time to give them an upper hand in battle, but it didn’t work, so they abandoned the idea and assumed the Creations could only exist as they were when they were initially summoned from their world into reality. When a character is fatally wounded in episode ten, their Creator desperately Tweets out the new concept they had previously used to now try and alter their Creation by making the concept public. Once the audience sees it and accepts the new vision of the character as canon, she suddenly gains the power, gets up, and wins the fight. People dislike this show because the idea of “audience acceptance” is used more and more like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann’s Spiral Power as the show goes on, and people see this as lazy writing and careless plot holes, when it’s actually quite meaningful and relevant to the characters. The audience’s passion ends up playing a huge role in their beloved characters’ stories and resolutions, and I find it beautiful.———In the end, Re:Creators was conceptually brilliant, and it’s a real shame people who didn’t understand it or somehow failed to empathize with it insisted on characterizing its public reception with undeserved derision. Whether you’re looking for timely, intelligent, non-presumptuous social commentary, psychological deconstructions seated in character archetypes you thought couldn’t be more boring, emotional character studies within a genuinely passionate and inspired cast, or just some damn gorgeous action with irreplaceably unique ideas animated to phenomenal production values, Re:Creators will be a delight to your senses and sensibilities for all the reasons I’ve done my best to describe, and none of this is even mentioning the fact I’ve managed to do so with detail and isolated specifics without even telling you the literal plot of the show. Re:Creators is actually not the standard battle royale you’re familiar with, and is instead a story about a young aspiring artist whose past unintentional actions come back to haunt him when one of our fiction-within-fiction personalities comes down like Lucifer from Heaven boasting a backstory so compellingly horrible and motivations so complex and sadly justifiable, I would never dare spoil them. And as this incredible villain manipulates information and garners the favor of more and more misguided Creations as they’re summoned into reality, she orchestrates a conflict of monumental proportions pitting Creations against Creations which I certainly won’t be forgetting any time soon. I already admitted it’s messy. I already admitted it juggles far too many ideas to completely keep its balance, so now it’s your turn to admit the rest is refreshing, laudably ambitious, and absolutely fucking awesome.Thank you for reading. only was this mechanic used to orchestrate some of the most spectacular developments in anime history without compromising the internal logical and immersion of the show at hand, but it was used more meaningfully to deeply theme itself with the ultimate display of universal human empowerment and denial of determinism.

That and the long ass build up was too cringey to stomach the entire show after experiencing.The characters in general are the main reason for this show being a massive disappointment, which it was as it had some potential as an initial idea. They all seemed to have no real development or anything interesting about them, especially after listening to their long boring and tedious conversations. Each character seemed like they could be the interesting...one that I'd finally care about, but no they never were.The story and plot is also very boring and tedious. Nothing really flowed, and the initial idea seems good until you realise what a shit job they have done with those ideas. Characters motivations made no sense and the whole thing seemed to move at the pace of a disabled snail.The art and the fight scenes were okay, but nothing special, and as such weren't anything to write home about or increase my opinion about the show in any way.Overall, I just felt the characters and plot were too boring and uninteresting to make me even vaguely wish to keep on watching from this point. Don't get why this one has high ratings, but I would never recommend it. one that I'd finally care about, but no they never were.The story and plot is also very boring and tedious.

(Re:Creators)To be honest I had no interest in watching Re:Creators mainly due to the director Ei Aoki. despite him directing Fate/Zero which by the way was a great...show he also directed one of the biggest anime train-wrecks from this decade Aldonah Zero. It was a big disgrace to mecha fans that represent everything that is wrong with the mecha within 24 episodes.One month later of around may 2017 I decided to watch Re:Creators after hearing a lot of great things about it from my friends and fellow YouTubers.So is Re:Creators worth watching?Is this show is a classic or it just another forgettable anime?Let's answer that question, shall we?The story of Re:Creators follow Sota Mizushino who is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own light novel. One day while watching the anime adaptation of the mecha novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier to look for inspiration, the tablet that he was watching sputters and drags him into the anime world where he witnesses a battle between the anime character named Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning to the real world with a Selesia, Soon Sota discovers that other anime characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world with some of them aligned with the military uniform girl, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions.Now Sota and Selena must find the other characters and bring them home as well as defeating the military uniform girl princess who wants to bring untold destruction to every world that exists.I have mixed feelings about the story Re:Creators as it has a lot of good things in it but at the same time a lot of meh things.For starters, the show does a great job of introducing its cast of characters in a unique and clever way.The recap episode of the show was nice, very memorable and well written. I surprised they made a good recap episode because almost all recap episodes in anime due to how rushed they are and they only exist to add more episode count into a series.The shows tackle's themes of dreams, teamwork, understanding one another, creation, adapting and becoming a better person and for the most part, the show does well on exploring those themes. However, I will admit the show can be a bit preachy at times with its themes.One thing you should note is that Re:Creators is quite a dialogue-heavy show especially in the first half which may tune off some people but I found the heavy dialogue to be pretty decent for the most part.Now we get into the show's flaws starting with slow pacing in the first half.Episode 1 was well paced but after that, the show slowed down to the point where most of the first half pacing moved at a snail's pace. I know the first half was meant to establishing its large cast of characters which the show mostly does a good job but at times the show moves way slow for an average viewer to handle and some people may get bored or drop the show because of it.It doesn't help the fact where half of the time the characters are all in one room just exposition stuff and events of the story Thankfully the second half is very well paced with very little hiccups.The second half despite being very entertaining and a step up in terms of writing was ultimately predictable. It doesn't help that show has a couple of plot holes and the authors themselves in the show just give a barebones explanation for the majority of the eventsWhen it comes to the characters for Re:Creators I thought they were pretty enjoyable overall minus a few characters that I dislike.One thing to note that the show doesn't rely on the main protagonist.I honestly Sota was an okay character overall.Sure he can be whiny and a bit annoying at times but I thought he was a decent character overall who had decent character development in the second half.Now am going to talk about every creation character in the show starting Selena.Selesia is a badass female character who is very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked her interactions and her relation with her own creator Matsubara.Meteora is a book lover who likes to exposition about stuff.Some people may find her exposition to be annoying but for the most part, I found her to kinda tolerable despite her talking way too much at times.Yuya and Kanoya are cool characters and I really liked the characters interactions with each other despite them from being different genres. Also, they were pretty likeable.If I had to pick my favorite character in Re:Creators than it would be Mamika. She's a magical girl who doesn't know how things work out in the real world and she thinks everything is all colours and rainbows. After a few events that happened in the show, she evolves into a much better person who understands how the world works. She was the main highlight of the show for me.I never really liked Alicetaria due to her making stupid decisions left and right throughout the series. Her personality got on my nerves due to how preachy she is. If I had to pick the worst character in Re:Creators than it would be her because unlike Sota who actually became a decent character in the second half and had development she does the same annoying crap and she barely changes as a character.Magane is a pretty cool chaotic neutral character who is fun to watch on screen. That's about it really.Blitz is an okay character, okay but I will admit he got a bit better as the series went on after a certain event of the show.Hikayu and Shou are pretty fun characters, and I had no issues with them.Altair (Military Uniform Princess) is a pretty good villain overall and I liked her personally even tho she has a quite a bit of hole due to the authors not giving her a background and context of her powers.The rest of the characters are fine for what they are, and I had no issues with them.One thing that I liked about the characters were the creations relationships with the creators. Matsubara's and Selena relations is one of the main highlights from the show as the relations with keeps building up as they grow and change as characters as the show progresses.Another thing I praise the characters are the overall character interactions. Despite coming from different worlds and media, the creations can make great character interactions with one another or even start having good relations like for example Yuya and Rui. I much as I dislike Aliceteria her relation with Mamika was great as it triggers Mamika's character development.Now am going to address my the problems with the characters for Re:Creators. Most of them are underdeveloped.Characters, for example, Magane Meteora and Aliceteria, would be more interesting they had real character development instead of having no development or doing a half-fast one.(Spoiler Alert)Alicetaria was the Military Uniform Princess puppet through the series, and she was constantly fighting against Selesia, Sota and the other good guys even when after when Mamika was killed off. However, during a certain battle in the second half, she developed but moments later she gets killed by Military Uniform Princess aka Altair. How can anyone care for a character who was unlikable for the majority of the series becomes somewhat likeable in one moment than gets killed off? This is just bad writing here.(End of Spoilers)Now for my other problem. Certain characters talk way too much.As much I enjoyed the most of the heavy dialogue some of these characters talk way too much especially Meteora who never wants to shut up at times. It also doesn't help where half of the time of the first half they are all in a circle in one room and certain characters just talk their lungs out without giving the viewer to thinkOverall the characters are pretty enjoyable for that they were. However, I wished certain characters had character development instead of talking too much for a livingVisually Re:Creators is pretty good for the most part.The character designs for the creations for each genre were great, and they portray the genre very nicely.The rest of the characters designs were pretty decent, and they are nothing to write home about.As for actual animation, it's pretty good with some well-animated fight sequences. However, it suffers from bad CG mainly seen from the last few episodes and to make my point there was a fight of Alicetaria and Rul were fighting and the show switched from good-looking 2D to shitty looking 3D in instant. I can understand why they attempted to do it consider the scenarios the characters that are in but having a character like Alicetraina who is primarily a 2D character then suddenly switching her in CG so she can fight the Rui CG mecha is just distracting. Least it's not Berserk 2016/2017 levels of bad CG.Overall despite having bad CG the show overall looks pretty good.The soundtrack for Re:Creators is simply amazing and well-directed.All of the tracks were great it fits very well with each scene perfectly and it makes the show more enjoyable to watch. Also, the sound effects are just wonderful to listen as it blends in with the background music perfectly without it being distracting.The openings are fantastic amazing,The first opening theme gravityWall is a fast-paced catchy opening theme while the second opening Shout is just an epic song that fits the tone of the second half perfectly,Both ending themes are pretty good overall.The voice acting is top-notch.All the seiyuus did a wonderful job with roles and it makes the show more impactful.At this time of the review Re:Creators hasn't got a dub, but I like to see a dub announcement for it in the future because this is one of those shows that needs a dub.Re:Creators is a flawed but fun ride of animeSure it has its problems such as being quite predictable along with pacing issues in the first half as well as having a few annoying characters and bad CG the show has more good things in it than bad. Most of the characters were pretty good and enjoyable to watch despite some of them lacking development.The visuals were good for the most part. The soundtrack was epic and voice acting was amazing.This show may not be for everyone but if you can handle heavy dialogue in anime than I recommend this anime to people.It may not Ei Aoki best work but least it's a being improvement over Aldonah Zero.It may not be the best anime of 2017 but was still a pretty good anime overall despite its issues. show he also directed one of the biggest anime train-wrecks from this decade Aldonah Zero. It was a big disgrace to mecha fans that represent everything that is wrong with the mecha within 24 episodes.One month later of around may 2017 I decided to watch Re:Creators after hearing a lot of great things about it from my friends and fellow YouTubers.So is Re:Creators worth watching?Is this show is a classic or it just another forgettable anime?Let's answer that question, shall we?The story of Re:Creators follow Sota Mizushino who is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own light novel. One day while watching the anime adaptation of the mecha novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier to look for inspiration, the tablet that he was watching sputters and drags him into the anime world where he witnesses a battle between the anime character named Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning to the real world with a Selesia, Soon Sota discovers that other anime characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world with some of them aligned with the military uniform girl, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions.Now Sota and Selena must find the other characters and bring them home as well as defeating the military uniform girl princess who wants to bring untold destruction to every world that exists.I have mixed feelings about the story Re:Creators as it has a lot of good things in it but at the same time a lot of meh things.For starters, the show does a great job of introducing its cast of characters in a unique and clever way.The recap episode of the show was nice, very memorable and well written. I surprised they made a good recap episode because almost all recap episodes in anime due to how rushed they are and they only exist to add more episode count into a series.The shows tackle's themes of dreams, teamwork, understanding one another, creation, adapting and becoming a better person and for the most part, the show does well on exploring those themes. However, I will admit the show can be a bit preachy at times with its themes.One thing you should note is that Re:Creators is quite a dialogue-heavy show especially in the first half which may tune off some people but I found the heavy dialogue to be pretty decent for the most part.Now we get into the show's flaws starting with slow pacing in the first half.Episode 1 was well paced but after that, the show slowed down to the point where most of the first half pacing moved at a snail's pace. I know the first half was meant to establishing its large cast of characters which the show mostly does a good job but at times the show moves way slow for an average viewer to handle and some people may get bored or drop the show because of it.It doesn't help the fact where half of the time the characters are all in one room just exposition stuff and events of the story Thankfully the second half is very well paced with very little hiccups.The second half despite being very entertaining and a step up in terms of writing was ultimately predictable. It doesn't help that show has a couple of plot holes and the authors themselves in the show just give a barebones explanation for the majority of the eventsWhen it comes to the characters for Re:Creators I thought they were pretty enjoyable overall minus a few characters that I dislike.One thing to note that the show doesn't rely on the main protagonist.I honestly Sota was an okay character overall.Sure he can be whiny and a bit annoying at times but I thought he was a decent character overall who had decent character development in the second half.Now am going to talk about every creation character in the show starting Selena.Selesia is a badass female character who is very likeable and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked her interactions and her relation with her own creator Matsubara.Meteora is a book lover who likes to exposition about stuff.Some people may find her exposition to be annoying but for the most part, I found her to kinda tolerable despite her talking way too much at times.Yuya and Kanoya are cool characters and I really liked the characters interactions with each other despite them from being different genres. Also, they were pretty likeable.If I had to pick my favorite character in Re:Creators than it would be Mamika. She's a magical girl who doesn't know how things work out in the real world and she thinks everything is all colours and rainbows. After a few events that happened in the show, she evolves into a much better person who understands how the world works. She was the main highlight of the show for me.I never really liked Alicetaria due to her making stupid decisions left and right throughout the series. Her personality got on my nerves due to how preachy she is. If I had to pick the worst character in Re:Creators than it would be her because unlike Sota who actually became a decent character in the second half and had development she does the same annoying crap and she barely changes as a character.Magane is a pretty cool chaotic neutral character who is fun to watch on screen. That's about it really.Blitz is an okay character, okay but I will admit he got a bit better as the series went on after a certain event of the show.Hikayu and Shou are pretty fun characters, and I had no issues with them.Altair (Military Uniform Princess) is a pretty good villain overall and I liked her personally even tho she has a quite a bit of hole due to the authors not giving her a background and context of her powers.The rest of the characters are fine for what they are, and I had no issues with them.One thing that I liked about the characters were the creations relationships with the creators. Matsubara's and Selena relations is one of the main highlights from the show as the relations with keeps building up as they grow and change as characters as the show progresses.Another thing I praise the characters are the overall character interactions. Despite coming from different worlds and media, the creations can make great character interactions with one another or even start having good relations like for example Yuya and Rui. I much as I dislike Aliceteria her relation with Mamika was great as it triggers Mamika's character development.Now am going to address my the problems with the characters for Re:Creators. Most of them are underdeveloped.Characters, for example, Magane Meteora and Aliceteria, would be more interesting they had real character development instead of having no development or doing a half-fast one.(Spoiler Alert)Alicetaria was the Military Uniform Princess puppet through the series, and she was constantly fighting against Selesia, Sota and the other good guys even when after when Mamika was killed off. However, during a certain battle in the second half, she developed but moments later she gets killed by Military Uniform Princess aka Altair. How can anyone care for a character who was unlikable for the majority of the series becomes somewhat likeable in one moment than gets killed off? This is just bad writing here.(End of Spoilers)Now for my other problem. Certain characters talk way too much.As much I enjoyed the most of the heavy dialogue some of these characters talk way too much especially Meteora who never wants to shut up at times. It also doesn't help where half of the time of the first half they are all in a circle in one room and certain characters just talk their lungs out without giving the viewer to thinkOverall the characters are pretty enjoyable for that they were. However, I wished certain characters had character development instead of talking too much for a livingVisually Re:Creators is pretty good for the most part.The character designs for the creations for each genre were great, and they portray the genre very nicely.The rest of the characters designs were pretty decent, and they are nothing to write home about.As for actual animation, it's pretty good with some well-animated fight sequences. However, it suffers from bad CG mainly seen from the last few episodes and to make my point there was a fight of Alicetaria and Rul were fighting and the show switched from good-looking 2D to shitty looking 3D in instant. I can understand why they attempted to do it consider the scenarios the characters that are in but having a character like Alicetraina who is primarily a 2D character then suddenly switching her in CG so she can fight the Rui CG mecha is just distracting. Least it's not Berserk 2016/2017 levels of bad CG.Overall despite having bad CG the show overall looks pretty good.The soundtrack for Re:Creators is simply amazing and well-directed.All of the tracks were great it fits very well with each scene perfectly and it makes the show more enjoyable to watch.

(it’s meta commentary on storytelling guys, it’s deep!)This Modern Classic example of how not to...write an original anime is brought to you by a staff who really should have been able to pull off an interesting, engaging series, yet it utterly fails on so many basic levels it feels like they either didn’t care at all or passed off most of the work to some underpaid interns.I don’t know what it is about original animation projects, they have all the freedom to be whatever they want and they almost always come out as cliched, stupid messes of a show that aren’t worth watching. That is, if the show came out in the 2010s. Sure there are good original shows sometimes, but most of them end up being like this, or Comet Lucifer. What’s that, you don’t remember Comet Lucifer? Good. I certainly hope this show will go the way of that trainwreck, but a passionate fanbase has already decided to declare this a modern classic anime, one of their favorites.And why wouldn’t it be your favorite anime? It broke new ground! By digging itself deeper and deeper into the ground with every episode’s downward spiral from mediocre beginning to mind numbingly idiotic finale! We start with a decent idea for a show, fictional characters come to life and have to deal with the reality of being characters from a story, interacting with their writers along the way.And then they all have a bunch of dumb fight scenes for no reason cause that idea above requires actual writing to pull off. It’s far, far easier to write a dumb fight scene then it is to write a decent dialog scene. Not that Re:Classic didn’t try to write dialog, in fact, there’s so much you might forget it was an action show!“Did I just contradict myself there?”, you might ask, but no, I wouldn’t write blatantly conflicting pieces of information so close together, I’m not the writer of Re:Creators. The dialog in Re:Creators tries very hard to be smart, but at the end all it amounts to is glue between more stupid, badly animated fight scenes. Characters will switch sides of the conflict on the drop of a hat, generally with a dialog that looks like this: “The information you had was wrong, you’re the villain here!” “Whoa you’re right, I guess I’m a good guy again it’s not like I just shot somebody in cold blood two minutes ago, forget that!”The characters of this show are all so stupid, if any of them actually stopped and questioned their own actions the plot would end in like two episodes. The plot that is a ton of fight scenes that lead up to a LITERAL deus ex machina ending, people like those right? Oh wait, those have been an overused cliché since ancient greece!I clapped when I saw the zero foreshadowing devinatart OC show up and wins the fight for the heroes cause the writer’s wrote themselves into a corner! It broke new ground!Why is this show even remotely popular?In what universe does a character go from NOW I’VE LOST IT, I KNOW I CAN KILL to “We’re best friends forever now” because of a single conversation, they didn’t even go through a redemption arc, they’re just heroes now.One of the biggest complaints about Sword Art Online is that it’s filled with Cafe Scenes, where characters explain the plot to each other in boring dry dialog. Well, innovator it is, Re:Creators deftly deconstructs this tired trope by having not only cafe scenes, but family restaurant scenes, sushi bar scenes, fast food restaurant scenes, you name it and they’ve probably eaten it while explaining the paper thin plot to Sota, the audience self insert character who adds nothing but gets to hang around the cool kids anyways.Sota is a dumb nerd who watches anime and reads light novels and wears glasses, just like YOU, the viewer, can’t you relate to his struggles?? As he stands in the background and occasionally asks questions.Is this even a review, is there any structure to what’s happening here? And this is where I blow your minds when I reveal that this lack of structure is actually a clever deconstruction of poorly constructed reviews!

However, the strength of the concept is meaningless without the execution, something recreators itself seems aware of despite delivering an incredibly trite, poorly made series that coasts due to it’s premise and character designs, which are just similar enough to real characters that people can project their like of that character onto them so you don’t have to write or design a real character, it’s brilliant!Oh yeah, the show has bad production values outside of writing too.  The animation is cheap at best and atrocious at worst. The music is Sawano’s weakest so far. Now Sawano gets a lot of hate, but I’m not one of them really, I’ve liked several osts of his, including some in series I don’t particularly like or enjoy, like Aldnoah Zero.

And who the hell doesn't want another slice of that amazing cake? I miss his amazing and well developed characters, his mature approach to write Seinen with all the deepness of works like Cowboy Beebop but without the psychological thickness of works like Evangelion.In a nutshell, I expect quite a lot of Rei Hiroe. And when I looked into direction, I got a very amazing surprise to know it was going to be directed by...Ei Aoki.  And if it does not ring a bell for you, well my friend, Ei Aoki is one of the best directors out there. Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, Aldonoah.Zero, Ga-Rei Zero are masterpieces that serve as testimony of my words. The guy knows how to direct Seinien, not a single doubt.Then I found myself with another BIG NAME: Hiroyuki Sawano. He is composer for works such as Blue Exorcist, Kill la Kill, Aldonoah.Zero and MOST IMPORTANT: Shingeki no Kyujin (Attack on Titan).And with such a cast of talented individuals, my expectations for Re:Creators started very, very high.Many individuals have very accurately decomposed several aspects of this amazing work so I won't bother to repeat it again. Instead, let me approach this review from another perspective:THE AMAZNG Re:Creators POTENTIALThis anime has all that is needed to make a long lasting time-proof masterpiece. And some kids are actually not liking it (therefore it was a lot of mixed reviews) because this is not what they expected. In Re:Creators is not about Fan Service, is not about Action Scenes (although it contains some very amazing ones), it is also NOT a male harem. Is a (sometimes) slow paced anime full of dialog, introspection, philosophy and a very original perspective on how anime, manga and game characters perceive us (instead of us, viewers, perceiving them).If you are looking for a mature and interesting perspective about what may happen when fantasy worlds and the real work collide, look no further. It will remind you of Fate/Zero as well as Re:Zero. However, Re:Creators has it's original flavor and the cliché characters are designed specifically to go beyond their own clichés. An amazing example is Mamika. Oh Gosh Mamika is such an amazing character.All that said. I expect Re:Creators to become a masterpiece. So far, so good. We will see what Fate has to say. Ei Aoki.

It is possible to figure out the rough idea of what is going on in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and slightly adjust information in the second.Detailed breakdown below:Story: 2/10The story writing is exceptionally poor, and the main issue is that the story writer did not have a good idea about presenting new events. So, when the story needs to introduce you to some sort of idea, characters sit down in a circle and talk for 15 minutes. Sometimes they...invent ""theories"" out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted. Everything between fights is incredibly dull, and characters - all of them - act almost in the same fashion. Once again, we have ""spineless male protagonist in glasses"", and even though this is not a harem, this kind of character is incredibly annoying. There\'s ONE surprisingly well done character of a magical girl, but she doesn\'t get enough screen time.Also, dramatic and tragic scenes are handled in surprisingly poor and tasteless fashion.In general - huge number of dull scenes, or scenes where somebody explains something for a very long time, plus interactions between characters are incredibly awkward.Art: 6/10:The art is actually fairly good and characters have decent design. There some noticeable instances of CG use, and characters could use a bit more detail, but overall it is decent.Sound: 5/10:Thoroughly mediocre soundtrack, that sometimes gets annoying. The anime features annoying ""jester-type"" villain and when that one was talking on several occasions I\'ve felt disconnect between words and character.  This doesn\'t happen often in anime, but happened in this case.Characters: 3/10:There\'s amazingly well done a character of a naive magical girl in the series, who looks genuine in every scene she arrives, and is incredibly sympathetic. However, everybody else is pretty much a carton cutout, and either act in completely stupid way, or follows some sort of cliched role. Interactions between characters are neither believable nor interesting most of the time. ""Protagonist"" is unlikeable, and is a classic ""shy spineless otaku school boy in glasses"" (I hoped this stereotype has died, but guess not).Enjoyment: 3/10:This is a disappointment. The potential of the main idea was high, but poor execution and bad storywriting ultimately ruined it.Overall: 3/10:The best idea is to skip it. Aside from one well done character, there\'s little reason to watch it. If you\'re bored out of your mind, perhaps you you\'ll enjoy fights (plenty of those), but the dull character interactions and very long talking sequences are very likely to kill the fun. invent ""theories"" out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted.

I\'ve seen it, you\'ve seen it, everyone\'s seen it. I think it\'s safe to say that, while certain individuals are to blame as well, the major fault lays in the thing that we\'re gathered around. Anime isn\'t particularly subtle about its tropes or its origin. Stuff that\'s acceptable in Japan is often times seen as weird, unnaturally obscure or even morally wrong in other parts of the world.What I always believed was the major issue however, was the way anime itself has been presenting its fans over the past couple of years. How many characters that...that are anime fans were shown in a clearly positive and acceptable way in the last couple of years? Most of them are hikkikomoris, shut-ins, socially awkward or straight up mad people. While I know that this sort of stuff has mostly been portrayed as an example of what you shouldn\'t become, I always noticed the distinct lack of people like us, people who watch anime in their free time, who still have a social life, who go to school and study like normal human beings. Perhaps some that already go to work and watch anime as a way to spend their free time.How about people that are passionate about creating their own work based on anime? We had Shirobako, but besides that? I don\'t think I remember someone who wasn\'t a somewhat negative example of a passionate fan. Anime has inspired many to create art and to write. So many in fact that nowadays we see the growth of people from overseas who work in the anime industry. There was always a distinct lack of representation of those types of people as well! Until...In summer of 2017, a new original anime from studio TROYCA has started its 22 episode run. It received a fairly mixed feedback with several reasonable arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Fast forward to the 26th of May, same year. Mother\'s Basement releases a video by the name ""Re:Creators is a Classic Anime in the Making"", and at that point, all hell breaks loose.People who wholeheartedly believed that Re:Creators is simply a bad anime get louder and louder around the internet, negative reviews start to flood in and in almost every single one of them, a word ""classic"" can be found, most notably in the context of that Re:Creators is the opposite of that, something that\'s forgettable and won\'t be remembered upon its finish.So, what is it really? Was it truly a classic in the making? What are the arguments that both sides voice out in their attempt to defend their opinion? Did the show portray anime fans better than any other show? Is Re:Creators something that will fade out, or stay in my head for a while? Let\'s get right into answering those questions, shall we?*Spoilers included*The show starts off when Souta Mizushino, who\'s an artist and an otaku, gets transported into the world of an anime that he\'s watching. Few moments later and he, alongside the main character from that anime by the name of Selesia Upitiria, teleport back to the real world. Turns out that she\'s not the only one who has appeared. They get into a big brawl with a mysterious, unknown character that they call ""Military Uniform Princess"", and later on meet other characters who have been ripped out straight from their story. Two camps end up being born, one that is set on destroying the world of the creators that caused great suffering the worlds of the creations, and one that wants to protect it, for one reason or another.The most important thing to know going into Re:Creators is that your expectations will most likely not be met, and I don\'t mean it in the ""Oh, it\'s not that good"" sort of way, but instead I want to tell you that this series is not quite what it markets itself to be, or what it looks like in the first episode. While you may expect a Battle Royale type of story, or an action oriented one, you\'ll be disappointed with how those things are done.Re:Creators is a show that transcribes itself through dialogue, and culminates through action. Most of its time is spent on set up, exposition and theme exploration, done using a set of strongly identifiable individuals, that are the anime characters, and their creators. The dialogue itself is written very well, with powerful messages getting delivered, clear rules being set and deeper understanding of the narrative or the characters is provided with each set of discussions. You might not be happy with the way the show does it, but it does it really well. Take a look at few conversations from the show, even the ones that didn\'t take place during anything important. Meteora explaining her idea of Altair\'s plan in episode 2 makes you immediately understand the threat she poses to not only individuals, but reality itself, it gives Meteora a smart, cool and collected vibe, and on top of that it gives you a clear understanding of how the show outline\'s will work out, that being big events containing the most important moments from the narrative standpoint will be followed up by both sides figuring stuff out and creating future plans.To establish its characters faster and give the viewer a better understanding of their personalities early on, this show simply relies on the fact that most of it\'s characters are stereotypical. They\'re really, and I mean REALLY easy to read if you\'ve seen the genres they\'re a part of, or anything similar to the product they come from. The one exception is of course Altair, who\'s a compilation of fanart, thus she\'s an unknown and has a mysterious presence to her for a long time. What gives those characters actual personalities in general are, more often than not, their creators, with the exception of Mamika. The passion, care, love and attention to detail you see them put into their characters reflects on the stance of the characters themselves, as they are being ripped straight from their world and their story. All of them are characters that the audience respect and care for deeply, those that are popular and are able to touch people, so it\'s safe to say that all of them are established and characterized well enough to adapt to new circumstances. If a character, at the point they are in their plot, is willing to kill their Gods or have some personal vendetta to attend to against the other character that was summoned, they will most likely side with Altair. If a character isn\'t established properly as a character that would be able to live outside it\'s world, they will have problems adapting and understanding other\'s reasoning for defending their beliefs. This right here is probably one of my favorite ideas I\'ve seen in anime, and it\'s executed extremely well too.As I mentioned, this show uses it\'s strongly defined, stereotypical characters to create a narrative, that being fictional characters judging the real world based on their own worlds. It\'s the base of the entire plot, most of the time is spent on understanding it and taking things away from it. Alicetaria not understanding why her world cannot be changed, Mamika\'s belief of a perfect world or Magane\'s twisted image of using the real world for fun are all views that the world would never experience otherwise, and it\'s clear that people that get in contact with them undergo severe changes by doing so, especially Souta, the protagonist of the story. I can\'t imagine a guy who would need to meet characters from anime and manga more than this guy.I\'m saying that because Souta is an artist, inspired by gaming, anime, manga and all the other parts of otaku culture. He\'s been undergoing a stagnation as a creator for a long time, ever since Setsuna committed suicide. He believes that by not reaching out to her, he is essentially one of the reasons she ended up dying. Of course it was a combination of the online hate and the lack of support, but nevertheless, as a close friend back in the day, realising he was overtaken by jealousy, he takes the blame upon himself, since he\'s most likely the only one that could stop it. Seeing her creation wrecking havoc on the world must\'ve been a hell of an experience for an already destroyed Souta, but he can find comfort in all the heroes he\'s admired throughout the years. Those characters for him, stand for everything that he couldn\'t reach, so confessing his story in front of them, and more importantly finding their approval to go on, is the turning point of his life. He comes back to drawing, and even becomes the key to saving the world because of his work, which he created after that.But Souta is only one of many otaku\'s that this show presents. In fact, this show\'s all about them, but unlike most shows in recent memory, it doesn\'t do anything grand with them. They\'re all normal people, both students and working adults, living their lives and finding comfort by engaging in the culture as a hobby. Painting them in such a light becomes especially important during the last few episodes, which are all about viewer\'s acceptance. All of those people, all of them different and watching anime for different reasons, gather to watch something that they love on a big screen, with numerous other passionate fans, who are also invested in those stories, standing right besides them. The show paints this beautiful picture of a giant crowd cheering their favorites on and wondering how will the event go. something like that can be compared to sport events or concerts, and Re:Creators doesn\'t make it seem weird or out of place, it shows passion at its purest, just like it did throughout the entire show, showing creators and an aspiring artist that is Souta grow an understanding of their work and why do they make it. This entire show at times feels like it\'s a love letter to us, the fans, the people writing about anime, people inspired by it and everyone else involved in the topic, and I don\'t even doubt that it is one. You may call it gratification, but it feels so nice to see that the people who create for us, actually appreciate us, and believe that we appreciate them.Let\'s switch it up for a bit and talk about the negatives though.First one would be the fact that we never truly learn how does Altair move characters and people throughout worlds. It\'s something that bugged me for the entire time. Sure, it\'s not necessary, but it\'s quite a plot hole and definitely something that could influence one\'s experience. The best thing I can come up with is that her omnipotent Holopsicon allowed her to do that, but quite frankly, that would be bullshit. You can\'t just say that if a creator wrote into the story: ""a character can move between worlds and take others with her"" and make that a thing without establishing the fact that the ""real world"" isn\'t actually completely ""real"".Second, the show\'s visuals seem to take a small dip in the middle, and the last few especially have quite... mixed results in that field. The usually crispy clean designs become more blocky and begin to look less detailed. I\'m sure this is something that will be fixed in the official release, like it always is, but that\'s how it was while it was airing.Thirdly, the show markets itself as an action show, while most of it\'s time is spent on dialogues or monologues. While I love how it turned out, the talks took quite some time to get used to initially. Giving a viewer a taste of the great action directing, just to take it away from him as it goes on can be frustrating, and it surely was for me until I really got into the narrative and the characterization.Back to the positives, let\'s talk about the visuals and the music!The director working on Re:Creators was Ei Aoki, who\'s mostly known for his work on Fate/Zero, the script was written by Rei Hiroe, the creator of Black Lagoon (if you wondered who helped on those awesome points of the show, he\'s most likely the one, and Aoki just made it flashier and prettier I\'d bet), and the music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who you might know for composing the OST\'s of Attack on Titan, Blue Exorcist and Guilty Crown, among many others.Ei Aoki is quite an interesting figure, in that he himself stated that he\'s inspired by Hollywood, and especially Christopher Nolan. You can definitely see that influence in the ending, which is grandiose and mind-blowing, completely out of the scale of anything that happened before it, but still believable to a degree. They both achieve that without sacrificing much of any other parts of their project. The Hollywood influence can also be seen just in the fight scenes. Nobody\'s going to tell me that the last fight with Altair wasn\'t influenced at least a tiny bit by superhero movies, those all vs one scenarios, which usually diverge into multiple smaller storylines during a big fight. It\'s definitely clear that this is Aoki\'s style, and he\'s not bad at it. I\'m glad that he\'s brining both Hollywood-esque ideas into anime, and brining some Nolan into it too. He did a great job at directing the talking scenes, he seems to have had quite a few ideas for them, like Blitz\'s talk with Altair after which the viewer realizes that they\'ve been hiding inside a church after a zoom out, or any talk with Magane and her movement during her speeches.The art as well is of high quality, especially the designs of the characters. They bring out the most recognizable, stereotypical, yet cool and fancy attires for each of them. They all look completely different as well, with different figures, a lot of variations of facial shapes, and different color pallet fitting them all in their own ways (Selesia\'s boldness = red, Alicetaria\'s knighthood and strive for justice = gold and so on). The mechas\' look very interesting and fresh as well, Selesia\'s smaller, white robot contrasting with Rui\'s Giant Robo and all the idea of how they fight, one with a sword and the other one with this big laser coming from his elbow combined with the sheer mass of the machine itself.Even more importantly, Sawano\'s back and he\'s got drops for days! Nothing gets me quite as excited as a good Sawano soundtrack to be honest, and hearing Re:Creators alongside Attack on Titan\'s Second Season in Spring was just the best. In Re:Creators, we hear a good mix of his tamer side, as well as a good few tracks that can get you pumped for what\'s coming next. The electronic tracks can be cheesy, but that\'s Sawano, and he knows how to use that cheesiness and make it amazing. If you digged any of his other projects, no doubt you\'ll enjoy him here, there\'s no better praise I can give him, he\'s just this consistent at making things real.And on that high note, I\'m going to sum this up.Re:Creators is a hell of an anime. Hell of a flawed anime too. It\'s definitely quite a task to suspend your disbelief for a lot of its stronger moments, but the explanations, the payoff, the eye candy, the ear candy, it\'s all there if you can give it a shot. I can\'t say it enough, but it\'s definitely worth a try, for some of you it might even be a favorite contender, and in time the show itself might grow into an obscure classic that you might be inclined to watch anyway. It has enough Nolan-ism in it that I think some will consider it as one at least.I know I had a blast with Re:Creators, quite frankly I simply enjoyed it. It\'s a fun show to both watch for me, and a fun one to think about, it tackles things that I\'d never thought of and pleases me greatly at the same time. Again, I can\'t recommend giving it a shot quite enough, if you think you might like it, please do attempt to watch it, even if it\'ll be a risky move. Seriously, do it.As always, this is purely my opinion, I highly recommend you to develop your own. that are anime fans were shown in a clearly positive and acceptable way in the last couple of years? Most of them are hikkikomoris, shut-ins, socially awkward or straight up mad people. While I know that this sort of stuff has mostly been portrayed as an example of what you shouldn\'t become, I always noticed the distinct lack of people like us, people who watch anime in their free time, who still have a social life, who go to school and study like normal human beings. Perhaps some that already go to work and watch anime as a way to spend their free time.How about people that are passionate about creating their own work based on anime? We had Shirobako, but besides that? I don\'t think I remember someone who wasn\'t a somewhat negative example of a passionate fan. Anime has inspired many to create art and to write. So many in fact that nowadays we see the growth of people from overseas who work in the anime industry. There was always a distinct lack of representation of those types of people as well! Until...In summer of 2017, a new original anime from studio TROYCA has started its 22 episode run. It received a fairly mixed feedback with several reasonable arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Fast forward to the 26th of May, same year. Mother\'s Basement releases a video by the name ""Re:Creators is a Classic Anime in the Making"", and at that point, all hell breaks loose.People who wholeheartedly believed that Re:Creators is simply a bad anime get louder and louder around the internet, negative reviews start to flood in and in almost every single one of them, a word ""classic"" can be found, most notably in the context of that Re:Creators is the opposite of that, something that\'s forgettable and won\'t be remembered upon its finish.So, what is it really? Was it truly a classic in the making? What are the arguments that both sides voice out in their attempt to defend their opinion? Did the show portray anime fans better than any other show? Is Re:Creators something that will fade out, or stay in my head for a while? Let\'s get right into answering those questions, shall we?*Spoilers included*The show starts off when Souta Mizushino, who\'s an artist and an otaku, gets transported into the world of an anime that he\'s watching. Few moments later and he, alongside the main character from that anime by the name of Selesia Upitiria, teleport back to the real world. Turns out that she\'s not the only one who has appeared. They get into a big brawl with a mysterious, unknown character that they call ""Military Uniform Princess"", and later on meet other characters who have been ripped out straight from their story.

Seriously, do it.As always, this is purely my opinion, I highly recommend you to develop your own.', 'Now-a-days many good anime become mediocre or plain out boring due to the repetition of the almost identical storyline/plotline and the audience (us) being exposed to these clichés or developments numerous times. Thus, whenever a new anime with a different plot arrives, it peaks my interest. Re-Creators belongs to that category and the criminally low score and constant online bashing of this anime spurred me to write my first review on MAL.It sets itself apart due to its somewhat opposing setting to the ‘Isekai’ (other world) genre, where typically the MC gets transported to the imaginary world and becomes the hero. In this case, the...characters, both villains and protagonists, from different works such as Shounen anime, Magical Girl anime, Mecha anime, Visual Novel and Games are transported in the real world. The realization of them being characters dawns upon them and the sense of being ‘entertainment’ pours out a variety of emotions ranging from bewilderment, anger and excitement from being in a new fun play area. Thus, in order to be as much spoiler free as possible, the ideologies of these characters clash and along with it they fight for what they feel will lead to their goal. The most important pull factor for me became the premise of characters with different fighting styles from various genres battling against each other and the unpredictability of these clashes. Music is the strong point of this series, especially the battle music they play in almost every fight scene. It really makes the fights a hundred times more exciting.Now, the dissatisfaction usually boils down to the first episode being awesome and the succeeding episodes being void of any action. The simple answer to that is that these episodes are used in explaining the premise of this series, which may arguably contribute to boring episodes in contrast to the first episode. Some (including me) point to the unlikeable MC, Souta, but miss the general point that this anime makes him take the back seat and the rest of the cast makes it much more enjoyable and entertaining. My view on this is to stick with it for a few episodes as it would ultimately lead to better understanding of the setting, plot, battles and in the end more fun to watch. I believe that Re-Creators is a hidden gem and a wonder in the making, causing it to be a must watch. characters, both villains and protagonists, from different works such as Shounen anime, Magical Girl anime, Mecha anime, Visual Novel and Games are transported in the real world.

Even after the impressive first episode, the director and the studio attached to this project was enough to raise some eyebrows. it's almost a curse of sorts, after Aldnoah Zero wasted the talents of the Fate/Zero director and writer (for the first few episodes anyway), Re:creators seems to follow the same formula. Only this time it's the writer for Black Lagoon. Surely by now Troyca would have learnt their lesson? Wouldn't they?Join me, dear reader, as we examine what went wrong with...the series. No spoilers. The anime is so forgettable I'm having a hard time recalling what happened the previous episode.Re:Creators is a reverse Isekai, i.e. instead of the MC travelling to an alternate universe, characters from various manga/anime/LNs travel to the real world. This makes for a very interesting premise, as the first episode shows that not all is fine and dandy when anime characters enter reality. Government interventions and general panic spreads throughout Tokyo as everyone, the audience included tries to figure out the cause behind this mysterious phenomenon.Except...well, that doesn't happen. The anime's pacing grinds to a staggering halt once you reach the 2nd episode, wherein it just becomes no different than a university lecture. Even watching the anime at 2x the speed doesn't remedy much, although it did make things more interesting. As more and more creations start entering the real world, you'd expect the real world to retaliate by going mad or something of that manner. A climax is reached as our heroes don't seem as powerful as they think they are...And then the anime just stopped. Really. Break after break and filler episodes with no bearing on the plot and no development for any of the main characters. And then it hits you with a recap episode. An admittedly amusing recap episode.

Before you know it, the plot just accelerates and you're at the final episode already! Great job everyone! Time to go home.You're left wondering why is it Sawano's catchy music gets attached to trainwrecks like these.You're left wondering why they bothered commissioning the beautiful character designs to talented fanartists and why bother making a faux-Pixiv to display their talents.You're left wondering why the voice talents of these amazing characters in this Battle Royale Crossover anime of your dreams gets wasted on a project like this.You're left wondering if Nintendo made a Super Smash Bros. anime, would they hire these jokers.And finally, you're left wondering why you bothered wasting 440 minutes of your life watching this dumpster fire when you could be doing something more productive with your life like helping a soup kitchen.2/10Please don't bother. the series.

Time to go home.You're left wondering why is it Sawano's catchy music gets attached to trainwrecks like these.You're left wondering why they bothered commissioning the beautiful character designs to talented fanartists and why bother making a faux-Pixiv to display their talents.You're left wondering why the voice talents of these amazing characters in this Battle Royale Crossover anime of your dreams gets wasted on a project like this.You're left wondering if Nintendo made a Super Smash Bros. anime, would they hire these jokers.And finally, you're left wondering why you bothered wasting 440 minutes of your life watching this dumpster fire when you could be doing something more productive with your life like helping a soup kitchen.2/10Please don't bother."", 'I’m certain that at some point, you’ve envisioned getting transported into one of your favorite works of fiction so that you could interact with and fight alongside your favorite characters. However, in all honestly, we would most likely fail spectacularly in many of these vivid yet grueling worlds due to our lack of special abilities and general mediocrity when compared to fictional characters. But now I want you to picture the better and more convenient alternative; the characters that you’ve dreamed of meeting get teleported to OUR world. This sums up the general premise of Re:Creators, thus instigating a tale of the interactions between creators...and their creations.Here’s a basic overview of the anime. Re:Creators is a classic “save the world from destruction” kind of show in that it has a completely overpowered antagonist who wants to annihilate society. Our villain, The Military Uniform Princess (What a mouthful. Let’s just call her Altair, her actual name), carries out her plan by bringing fictional beings from stories into reality to upset the order of the universe, causing it to collapse. At least that’s what heroine Meteora concludes after analyzing the situation. Some join Altair’s side with the desire to force their creators, the ones who wrote their stories, to change them for the better. Others realize that this is just a farce and decide to oppose Altair. Both sides conjure up plans to defeat the other and have many battles, culminating in a final epic confrontation involving all of the creations watched by an audience of thousands.While this seems interesting enough, I was relatively indifferent towards the first half of the anime. Now don’t get me wrong, I believe that many aspects of the show were executed adequately. The plot is unique and incredibly layered; the producers made sure to explain every last detail of the story to viewers. The characters are quite diverse and each bring a little something to the table, though many are admittedly overshadowed by the core cast.  However the predominant issue that I found with Re:Creators is its presentation.Let me elaborate. A commonality amongst practically all forms of media is something called an information dump. Used in order to enlighten viewers on details surrounding the plot, these info dumps are commonly executed by having one or more of the cast explain story details to other characters. As you can imagine, its somewhat difficult to pull this off without creating a sense of boredom in the viewer since these scenes generally have boring visuals and just seem to drag on. However, Re:Creators fails miserably in that it has one of these in EVERY EPISODE up until the episode 13 recap. I’ve never seen a show have so many info dumps, and what’s more is that they were executed in the most mind-numbing way imaginable. I can’t stress enough how painful it was to watch one character bloviate about the plot as the listening characters just stood there doing NOTHING. They didn’t contribute to the conversation and hardly even moved. I respect the fact that Re:Creators has a lot of depth to its story and needed to be properly explained to the audience, but the way in which this was accomplished was absolutely horrible.The recap was more interesting than the previous episodes because of Meteora’s humorous dialogue. It was literally a retelling of all of the information learned previously through the painstakingly boring info dump episodes, yet it was presented in a way that was actually able to grasp my attention, unlike every prior episode of the anime. I guess the producers were so desperate to get their viewers invested in the show that they created a sexy version of Meteora that was solely made for fanservice. How shallow.…It totally worked.*Ahem* Anyway, I was pleased with the presentation of the second portion of the anime. Conversations became more impactful and were no longer one-sided. That’s right, they actually had two people discussing their ideals and conflicting beliefs instead of having a single character monologuing for half an episode. It was very refreshing.There are a lot of characters in Re:Creators, though it won’t seem like it due to the lack of screen time that many of them receive. Prime examples include the magical girl Mamika, the mecha pilot Rui, and the former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. They each received a modicum of screen time and probably could have made for great supporting characters. They really stood out during their few moments in the spotlight, but it wasn’t enough to really flesh out their characters, which is unfortunate. The fiery swordswoman Selesia seemed like the main heroine after episode one, but her importance sort of faded as the anime shifted its attention to other characters. She was cool, but nothing special. The bad boy Yuuya looks and acts pretty awesome, but is barely developed. The antagonist, Altair, is definitely the best designed character. Her powers are inventive and her motivation for being the villain is appropriate.Souta Mizushino is supposedly the main character of the story. I’m hesitant to classify him as the protagonist due to his lack of importance. Like Selesia, he faded into the background after episode one. In fact, if you completely removed his presence from half of the episodes, everything would proceed in exactly the same manner. He finally becomes important after revealing his connection to Altair to the rest of the cast. Souta starts off weak, but exhibits many human qualities, which is a point in his favor since he’s just an insecure kid who isn’t at the level of the super powered characters, so his weaknesses are to be expected. He also gains some development and confidence in the latter portion of the anime which somewhat redeemed him in my eyes.Meteora receives far more screen time and accomplishes a lot more then Souta, which leads me to classify her as the true protagonist. She’s the one who develops the strategies used to oppose Altair and displays the most common sense and knowledge out of all of the characters. I also found her to be the funniest character (though that’s not saying much) even though she falls under the emotionless girl trope. While her sesquipedalian monologues were incredibly boring, she made up for it in other ways, and overall made for a pretty good lead.Magane steadily rose to become my personal favorite character of the show. I simply found her to be the most interesting and entertaining member of the cast, and not just because she’s a chaotic maniac. Magane is also a surprisingly thought provoking character, mainly due to her unique power, which I won’t discuss because of spoilers. I loved the way that she manipulated others characters into saying what she wanted them to. Her intelligence and uncanny knack for twisting the truth made me really start to like her character. Simultaneously, I also held some malicious feelings towards her due to her villainous actions. I find that a character is well written when I can both love and hate them, so I tip my hat to the creators for making Magane the way she is.The soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who never fails to deliver high quality music. Both of the opening themes, Gravity Wall and Sh0ut, are fantastic compositions that instantly became my favorite anime openings of 2017. The soundtrack is filled with powerful pieces that command the attention of listeners, and the music easily became one of my favorite part of the anime. Many great seiyuu appear as well, including Maaya Sakamoto (Oshino Shinobu, Ciel Phantomhive) as Magane, Aki Toyosaki (Yui Hirasawa, Momo Deviluke) as The Military Uniform Princess, and Inori Minase (Rem) who voiced Meteora. Re:Creators definitely boast a strong selection of voice actors.A few of the background visuals tended to be animated with fine precision. Specifically the outdoor scenery, which in some cases would really stand out to me with great color schemes and high detail. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the majority of the character designs. They were rather poor in quality when the characters were both stagnant and in motion. It also didn’t help that many of the scenes took place in dull locations (like office rooms and living rooms) that were filled with completely motionless characters doing nothing but opening and closing their mouths. This is a perfect example of lazy animating, and the lack of effort really shows.Re:Creators brought a lot to the table, but wasn’t always able to deliver. While we were presented with an assiduously conceived story, the producers just couldn’t figure out how to effectively provide viewers with plot details. This left the anime feeling hollow and uninteresting, an issue that plagued Re:Creators for a dozen episodes. Many of the show’s characters had the capability to become great, however they weren’t given nearly enough screen time or depth, so they often ended up being simply mediocre. Overall, I sort of liked Re:Creators, but its shortcomings prevented me from truly enjoying the anime. I would recommend watching this if you enjoy the fantasy and reality colliding setting and are able to put up with unnecessarily long information dumps. and their creations.Here’s a basic overview of the anime.

But if Re:Zero and Madoka have taught us anything it's that cliche sounding premises may not be so cliche after all, and that sometimes shows need time to get the ball rolling especially for a two cour. This show is ballooning with potential, I'm just hoping that balloon doesn't popRe:Creators is truly a gift that keeps on giving, as it really does have 9s across the board so far for me and is set to keep up that pace. The first thing I have to praise...is actually the supposedly cliche premise. The idea of bring other characters into our world from different universes isn't exactly the newest thing ever, but it has never been executed in this way. These characters from fiction are actually aware of the oddity of their existence in the modern world, and the other characters are too. We see magical girls surprised by how much destruction and pain their attacks can cause, single minded driven characters that appear foolish when placed in circumstances with real consequence, and very typical anime stereotypes explored as if they were real people. And the best part is, they grow out of those stereotypes as they learn the realities of the world of their creators.The interactions between the creators and created are also great. To some creations their creators are like gods, but to others they're more like parents. I'm pleasantly surprised to see interactions that aren't entirely unrealistic from pretty much every character in the show. The real live humans behave rationally for the most part, and the anime characters behave like anime characters. As the show goes on, even the more boring characters(like the MC) are fleshed out much more until they become legitimately interesting.The great thing about original anime is that their stories are usually better since they don't have to hack something together to try to give the illusion of finishing a story when the source material is unfinished or sometimes not possible to adapt fully. Re:Creators seems to have a grander plot occurring in the background and I couldn't be more excited to see where it goes. At this point I could see this becoming a classic as iconic as the first two I mentioned in my review. is actually the supposedly cliche premise.

This was far from good, instead it was disappointing. Chapter 1 was promising so i kept watching. It kept my hype until episode 6 where it dropped, plain and boring. Episode 7, 8 and 9 where the most boring of them all. Boring fights as well as boring dialogue. They talk about the same topic over 20 minutes, yet the story doesn\'t go on. We get to see some action scenes in all episodes, yet they don\'t finish them in the next one, they cut it with interruptions of some sort. I get that not...everything should be action, indeed a good conversation is needed, but in this case, there\'s no progress, they are always at the same point.There\'s barely to no character development, everyone is just dull, empty and boring (Asides that they are useless), i\'d say that the creators have more development than everyone else. Nothing to say about the protagonist, he was boring and weak, but we can\'t expect anything from him. And to this point they just dragged the story for 12 episodes, because his smart-ass aka small pride was hiding something about the ""main antagonist"" which was pretty obvious.The anime could\'ve been a great one for the season, yet they ruined it. The art and sounds are nice but that\'s it. I do enjoy conversation in anime, if they are part of the plot. In this case, the plot was everything, but the things they talked. Dropped with no chance to re-watch. Boring and plain. I have no idea what the studio was thinking, it was such a good premise, but ended up being your typical shounen anime. I don\'t really understand where did all the i hype i had come from.I don\'t really care if you don\'t agree with this, but please refrain from calling me a troll, just because i didn\'t like something you loved.Story:2 (Dreadful)Art:6 (Fair)Sound:6 (Fair)Character:1 (Pathetic)Enjoyment:2 (Dreadful)Overall:3 (Poor) everything should be action, indeed a good conversation is needed, but in this case, there\'s no progress, they are always at the same point.There\'s barely to no character development, everyone is just dull, empty and boring (Asides that they are useless), i\'d say that the creators have more development than everyone else.

A miracle can happen, forming a new thing that is greater than all of the mixed.Cliches, negations, inadmissible.  Those kinds of things. They often appear a lot inside anime series and movies. Because they are unavoidable. Nothing is perfect. Anime is simply just a form of representation for those kinds of things. Acting like a mirror that we, anime fans, see everyday and judge it’s imperfectionness despite the fact that we too are as imperfect as, or even more than the anime, the mirror itself.Story ( 10/10 )Re:Creators is such a mess. Yet...it managed to appeal me up until the point where I shed tears and spent the fewer hours I have left of the day completing the show. The show was very realistic when it comes to handling. There are characters which came from the world of anime, manga and games. But regardless of the many possibilities of cliches that may happen due to that alone. The story handles it well and makes it an acceptable factor which is appealing.Political aspects are used to stabilize the story. They made it simple to understand without me needing to get my head around it much. Moreover, it's also not over explained up until the point where the show becomes engulfed by politics.The story development of this show is solid and progressive. It keeps me intrigued and constrains me within its story. Forcing me to continue until the end. There are only one or two flaws for story development, and that is the overuse of cliches that it nearly become unacceptable. Nearly. Another flaw of the story is the“A good story does not have to necessarily be the one that is accepted by the majority. But it can always be the one that is approved by your heart.”When I began Re:Creators I knew right away that I was up to something that I’d never forget. The story is straight out 10/10 so as because it’s exactly what I needed. A unique isekai with the story that could teach us many life lessons.Art ( 10/10 )Troyca’s not really recognized that much. The only anime I’ve seen from them are Sakurako-san and Yagate kimi ni Naru ( excluding Re:Creators ).Their art style and quality are high-tier. They never once made me doubt their animation at all. It’s good, and I like it. Re:Creators probably have the best animation and quality amongst the other two anime I’ve seen from Troyca. I’ve noticed this after seeing a couple of fights within the show. It’s high quality and flashy with no low budget drops that makes me feel disgusted for a second or more. The animation and quality is maintained really well for Re:Creators and that contributes to my overall enjoyment for the show.Sound ( 10/10 )The workforce behind the shadows that allowed the show to maximize its potential. The sounds of the show.Although the openings and endings may seem mediocre at first glance. As feelings become attached to it, they will turn from a mere time waster to an inconceivable art. Just like how any food can taste better when seasoned. The openings and endings became a factor that strengthened the show and enhanced my overall satisfaction towards Re:Creators.The OSTs also have the same role. They’re ACTUALLY beautiful and it made everything so much better. They’re so onpoint with the scenes and catchy that I just can’t use any other words to describe it except the word “masterpiece”.Voice acting is also outstanding. The voice actors have done well to voice with the sound and tone that exactly matches the characters they’re voice acting as. They also do well with expressing the emotions of the characters according to what they’re expressing at the moment. And that makes the show even better!Character ( 10/10 )If this anime was interpreted as a system with subsystems. Then the characters of this show would be the system. It connects everything together and makes everything work despite the fact that the “everything” is quite a mess. How do they manage to do this exactly?The first thing to understand is to acknowledge that this show is about “anime, games & manga becoming reality”.With that set as a mindset. Enjoying the show wouldn’t be as hard as trying to masturbate in less than 5 minutes. The characters come well in both designs & traits. With of course the matching voice and personality which suits their character design. The show makes use of the characters realistically and efficiently. Even supporting characters are given a sufficient amount of role and recognition.Keep in mind that this show is categorized as fantasy. Yet the show tries to make it seem as realistic as possible but still doesn’t make it go over the top in order to maintain that appeal of the “cliches that work”. The characters do a big role in this because there is only one main character who isn’t from another world. They are the reasons why most of the things which have happened in the show are acceptable. They work with the story like they are one with it.However… One of the most confusing yet acceptable things about this show is the character developments. It’s so full of plots that it’s making my mind go crazy. Sadly, it is also one of the things that pulled this show down a little.1 ) They overuse plot armors and plots that it nearly felt not right. Nearly. I nearly doubted the show just because of it. ( probably already mentioned in story )2 ) Because they overused them. It makes the ending satisfactory and not a masterpiece. It’s the same feeling as when your friend’s going to leave but then decided to stay with you for 10 minutes longer.Overall not bad though. The rest of the show makes up for the satisfactory ending that could’ve been way better.Enjoyment ( 10/10 )I really enjoyed this show. I could even say that it’s the best isekai I’ve ever seen in my life. Though it is categorized as mecha, my worst nightmare. The show’s barely about mechas so it doesn’t even matter.This show teases and makes you WANT the cliches to happen. It’s very hard to accept cliches, but this show knows how to make it appealing before my very eyes. Incredible. Just absolutely incredible. I think I’m running out of what to say now.Overall ( 10/10 )Absolute madlad. This anime was a gift from the gods. I’m glad I watched this. This will be something that I will never forget.Recommended to everybody honestly. it managed to appeal me up until the point where I shed tears and spent the fewer hours I have left of the day completing the show.

It’s so full of plots that it’s making my mind go crazy. Sadly, it is also one of the things that pulled this show down a little.1 ) They overuse plot armors and plots that it nearly felt not right. Nearly. I nearly doubted the show just because of it. ( probably already mentioned in story )2 ) Because they overused them. It makes the ending satisfactory and not a masterpiece. It’s the same feeling as when your friend’s going to leave but then decided to stay with you for 10 minutes longer.Overall not bad though. The rest of the show makes up for the satisfactory ending that could’ve been way better.Enjoyment ( 10/10 )I really enjoyed this show. I could even say that it’s the best isekai I’ve ever seen in my life. Though it is categorized as mecha, my worst nightmare. The show’s barely about mechas so it doesn’t even matter.This show teases and makes you WANT the cliches to happen. It’s very hard to accept cliches, but this show knows how to make it appealing before my very eyes. Incredible. Just absolutely incredible. I think I’m running out of what to say now.Overall ( 10/10 )Absolute madlad. This anime was a gift from the gods. I’m glad I watched this. This will be something that I will never forget.Recommended to everybody honestly."", ""First few episodes shows promise.  I didn't mind the talking at first, but after 9 episodes full of convoluted mishmash philosophical nonsense, I gave up.  They use it as filler to extend time.  I think this anime would have been over in 5 episodes if not for the senseless talking.  It got me so frustrated I almost had a heart attack from shouting at the screen to move the stupid plot along.The only thing I liked about the show is Mamika, and how her character is developed and killed off.  I like that plot.  The rest is just mishmashJust...like this review requirement, I will show an example of what the show is doing to fill the time it needs in order to be a full episode show.  And do you know what I think about this requirement?  I think this requirement is good.  It makes the reviewer really invest in the show.  But you know what, I could be lying.  I don't really think I like this review requirement, but then again, I think it is important.So, save yourselves the frustration and disappointment.  Watch some other shows. like this review requirement, I will show an example of what the show is doing to fill the time it needs in order to be a full episode show.

Its actors are of the finest fold; beyond exquisite. Thus, I believe you will find it enthralling”-\tMercurius, Dies IraeFor anyone who liked Re;Creators, go experience Dies Irae. Ignore the crappy anime version and get the 50-hour Visual Novel. Don’t ask questions. Don’t look at spoilers. Just go play it. Now.There are a lot of flaws with Re;Creators. The setting is dubious at parts. Some character’s decisions are questionable. The protagonist is kind of an annoying wimpy kid. There’s a...lot of handwaving, deus-ex-machina-ing etc... And, the characters don’t exactly reach the “finest fold” that Dies Irae reaches. Yet, I am going to posit something very paradoxical. It is PRECISELY because of its flaws, that Re;Creators is amazing. When you think about what “acceptance” means within the world of Re;Creators, and what it means to sustain “acceptance” amongst an audience – and when you take into account the entirety of the journey – suddenly something amazing happens. The anime itself becomes the very PROOF of that idea of “acceptance”.Because none of the story worlds that the characters come from are adequately explained, this allows them to manifest any power that the show sees fit. By the end, it has reached proportions of insanity which SHOULD break one’s suspension of disbelief. If such a show were any normal battle show, the audience SHOULD be rolling their eyes already.Yet, compared to other battle shows, we don’t roll our eyes. We don’t because the show plays with boundaries, and because the show knows that it is animation – which is a lie that can be enforced through sheer force of image.In other words – while shows normally invokes metafiction to criticize or satirize a story – to break down the parts of it and create irony. In other words, to break down the foundation of the story. Re;Creators uses metafiction to MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATION OF RE:CREATORS. Without the metafictional element, we would NOT BELIEVE THE WORLD OF RE;CREATORS. It shows us reality to ENFORCE THE ILLUSION.That is exactly proof of “acceptance”. This is the insane paradox that the show itself admits, and uses with utmost sincerity – despite being full of ironies as well.And, in this way, the entire show becomes a thematic loop from start to finish. Its flaws are the very proof of the struggles of the creator characters within the anime itself. Suddenly, it feels that the work has an amazing beating heart – and one of the best love letters to the entire industry itself.

At this point all the known pieces have been placed, and even though the characters weren’t well developed at least they had a speck of motivation going for them. However that wasn’t the case at all as there was still another dozen episodes to go through, and with each new episodes my tolerance of the show would continue to go down.Re:C is a show about fictional characters being pulled into the real...world, but these are no ordinary fictional characters but rather characters from the great mediums of nippon, namely anime, manga, light novels, and video games. All these characters brought into the real world by a girl named Altair who’s able to traverse fiction and reality, and is the one pulling the characters into reality. This in turn allows for the creations to meet their creators which is akin to a human meeting their god except he isn’t omnipotent, omnipresent and is basically just a human. This is also added to the fact that the creations still have their powers and are stronger than the people who created them which means they can do whatever they want including forcing their creators to change their story. This becomes the conflict as the creations are placed in two camps of those who are ok with their stories and those with Altair who want to force their creators to change their world. While this is basically the main premise at the beginning of the show, the way it all plays out is rather dull.Chunks of this show is spent on exposition where people will continuously talk without really saying anything as they continuously talk in circles about things they’ve done, understood, and will do. Even with the small nuggets of substance they may have, it’s sandwiched between these long winded conversations.  Other parts of the show are gathering other characters to join either side while having skirmishes with both sides retreating in the end. This all finally comes to the main revelation of the story as our main character reveal many things that all explain why he was dragged into the conflict. This is only the first half  of the show, and it was mediocre not only for this but also the characters.While the fictional characters were brought into the real world which is basically a reversed isekai. The way the characters are portrayed are more closely similar to the servants of fate/stay night, except instead of pseudo-/historical characters we have obvious character archetypes from different mediums. some of them are even closely similar to franchises that many viewers may know. However that’s just it, they’re archetypes, and unlike F/SN it doesn’t have the benefit of having characters with history behind them already conceived and with a trip to the wiki can reveal more about them without the author putting in the effort. Instead we get archetypes that never get fully developed or fleshed out, and their motivation as dull as a pencil after a written test.  This went for both the creations and the creators as neither were complex or multi-facted to hold my interest. I could have made exceptions such as mamika but the way it all plays out has already have become a generic staple at this point.  But still the show still had 9 more episodes left to fully develop them right? No no no no no, instead it’s more fighting and bullshit.The second half is just planning for the big final battle with the stakes raised more as Altair actually wants to destroy the whole world, and then the final battle comes which is sooo lacking of excitement that i needed to gulp down a bag of sugar just to keep myself awake and focused. It’s also becomes upsetting that instead of working on characters already there and further developing them, instead more characters are thrown into the mix, and suffer if not worse from the same things the other characters have. This is evident with selsia partner from the same story as he is hinted at half-way through the show only to finally reveal himself for one episode, and then go away. It tried to show how emotional it was for selsia to fight against her former comrade, as they had so much history together, but it was only for one episode which lessened any impact and was just a vapid episode. The show just cumulates into one big dud that while trying to make a point, it doesn't know how to follow through with it.This is a show that is built from the beginning up to the end with contrivance. It leaves behind many plot holes as it goes along that looking into the hows and whys of the show easily break it apart.The production value for this show was shoddy at worst and decent at best. The character designs came off as bland and generic both for the way the characters dressed as well as the way they looked and emote. The only one with distinction is obviously Altair. The background is mostly a contemporary japanese city  #324, so probably tokyo. Can’t say the action was great either from a narrative standpoint or an animation and directing standpoint. Especially with directing which has a lot f sequence breaking both in fights and throughout the rest of the show. The Ost for the show was good that is certain, but did it work well in the show? No. while some did stand out it was only because i found that they didn’t work with the show, and everything else was just background noise unable to convey any emotion.I think you can tell that i don’t like this show, but it’s more than that.

Nothing about this show was enjoyable and i had to take pause breaks every few times each episode so that my brain wouldn’t have an aneurysm to all the things happening in this show.Overall the show is just a mess that couldn’t be bothered to fix itself even though it had time to do so.

Gradually, the interest in the series kept dropping to the point more people were talking about garbage tier light novel adaptations (Akashic Records, Eromanga Sensei) which were nowhere near the catchy premise of Re:creators.This is extra strange when said premise is basically Fate/Stay Night all over again. No, seriously, they are the exact same story.A bunch of famous personalities, each one using superpowers, are brought into modern Japan,...where they are having a battle royale, with the winner getting a reality warping wish. Most of the plot is short skirmishes, followed by ridiculously long monologues where they are infodumping rules, discuss philosophies, and have cockteasing moments regarding a bland self insert lead being surrounded by pretty chicks.On paper, Re:creators should have been regarded as a thought provoking masterpiece, just like that porn game adaptation. And yet it wasn’t. In fact, it was being mocked for being exactly that. What happened? The answer is, Re:creators was not tapping into as many layers of pandering as Fate/Stay Night did. It followed the same formula, but didn’t have the same ingredients. And by ingredients, I mean:1) The pretty colorsStudio Troyca was nowhere near the level of Ufotable. Without jaw dropping animation, the sakuga audience didn’t care about it, and thus found reasons not to like it. Meaning, Re:creators didn’t have the illusion of making itself seem way better than what it actually was.2) The source materialIt didn’t have one. Unlike Type Moon which had a huge fanbase of porn gamers overhyping its bullshit for over a decade, Re:creators was an original work. Nobody was blowing out of proportion what it was all about, it had no fanatic fanbase attacking anyone who dares to speak against it, and thus it was open to all forms of criticism. As it should be the case for any title.3) The archetypesThe fighters of Re:creators were essentially representations of typical heroes and villains from well known genres. This made them monolithic, dry, predictable, and one dimensional. The heroic spirits of Fate/Stay Night were based on historical figures, which were giving off the illusion of being multilayered and with a rich backdrop story, even if we didn’t see it and it was all implied. Meaning, the fan fiction nerds didn’t care about the cast of Re:creators, because they were just bland archetypes. In Fate/Stay Night, when they were hearing characters talking about ideologies and philosophy, their imagination was having an orgasm by seeing people across history coming together to have a fight with cool superpowers. In Re:creators, when characters talked about ideologies and philosophy, they just saw a typical magical girl talking to a typical medieval knight.4) The competitionIt came out at the worst possible moment, since the other 3 shows 99% of anime fans were watching, already had everything Re:creators failed to tap into. Pretty colors, a fanbase from the source material, and characters who did not feel like bland archetypes, because of how they were fleshed out from previous seasons.5) The pacing and the infodumpsThe above reasons explain why Re:creators fell from grace, in comparison to other shows of that time. They don’t explain why as a stand-alone show it was still not a very good watch despite sounding really amazing at first; so lets clarify that as well. Most of the duration was comprised of really long and boring monologues about the concept of the show, instead of its execution. The audience was constantly being told what was going on instead of being allowed to see it. The characters were mostly sitting on a table and talking about what they will do, instead of doing something about it. It was a really big chore to get through the constant talking, and the pacing was snail-slow.The final episodes were filled with the battle royale action we were promised, but even then it came down to everyone versus one, instead of an actual “all for themselves” type of deal. It was hollow and insignificant, since nobody was actually dying but was rather returning to his fictional world. There was nothing really at stake and all the blame was thrown at the person who initiated the whole fuss. Nothing was grey or thought-provoking as it seemed to be at first, since it demonized an individual and deified everybody else, thus losing the grey morality it was going for.So yeah, it’s not nearly as good as it sounds and it makes sense why it was quickly dropped by most.

The only episode I enjoyed was the recap episode because it felt like it was the only time the show was actually doing anything fun and creative with its premise, when the show itself is mostly just a white bread boring action series. The direction is so flat and stale and there is absolutely zero energy to anything in this show, it\'s one of the most mind-numbingly boring...things I\'ve ever seen.The first ED sequence shows the reverse-isekai\'d characters doing slice of life stuff like going shopping, going to a water park, and other silly things like that. The second ED sequence shows the characters hanging around in the IRL anime studio and watching the anime get made. These sequences pissed me off because they just made me go ""I wish the show was either of these things even a little bit because then I\'d get any enjoyment out of it at all."" things I\'ve ever seen.The first ED sequence shows the reverse-isekai\'d characters doing slice of life stuff like going shopping, going to a water park, and other silly things like that.

For real, Meteora was my favourite character until she opened her mouth... and never quite managed to close it.Just like everyone else. My god, the dialogue never ends, and there's nothing remotely interesting about it; no clever angles, variation in sentence length, or true emotion to help invest you in the characters. There are scenes that last over TEN MINUTES of the characters just discussing what's just happened, what might be happening, and what could happen in the future, all sounding bored out of their minds (even after a giant mecha just appeared in...someone's backyard...). For an action series--this is an action show, isn't it?--everyone seems awfully static.Carrying on this theme of monotony and drudgery, we have the characters themselves. They all have unique enough characteristics to differentiate them, but there's an undercurrent of seriousness to them all that prevents anyone from truly standing out; it's as if they were all cut from the same base model and given slightly different paint jobs. Also, does anyone have a sense of humour in this show? Literally, do they have the sense for comedy? These guys could really use a laugh now and then.They have a lot of tropes to play with, but the magical school girl feels like one in appearance only; and while this is addressed, and could be considered a deconstruction to a degree, there's so much bland dialogue I'm hardly emotionally invested in her 'transformation'.As a minor point that could just be subjective, the colours in this show are just as flat as everything else. Nothing quite 'pops' or draws the eye, even in battle scenes with explosions galore. Which seems odd, because anime characters are notorious for their bright and unconventional colour schemes, and the plot provides the perfect excuse to go crazy with that concept. Maybe they meant to display the characters as more realistic, leaving their respective animated worlds to come to the real one, but there's no change in animation between universes that shows this idea, which, while not solving the issue, would at least provide some justification for it.All in all, I'm very disappointed with this show. It had an interesting plot with a lot of potential and it's just floundered through its first eight episodes with barely an impression left on me. Maybe it picks up and lives up to the potential as the series progresses, but I can't sit through another thirty minutes of exposition to find out. someone's backyard...). For an action series--this is an action show, isn't it?--everyone seems awfully static.Carrying on this theme of monotony and drudgery, we have the characters themselves. They all have unique enough characteristics to differentiate them, but there's an undercurrent of seriousness to them all that prevents anyone from truly standing out; it's as if they were all cut from the same base model and given slightly different paint jobs. Also, does anyone have a sense of humour in this show? Literally, do they have the sense for comedy? These guys could really use a laugh now and then.They have a lot of tropes to play with, but the magical school girl feels like one in appearance only; and while this is addressed, and could be considered a deconstruction to a degree, there's so much bland dialogue I'm hardly emotionally invested in her 'transformation'.As a minor point that could just be subjective, the colours in this show are just as flat as everything else.

A long while ago when it only had 4 episodes, I were trying to make a preview because I was pissed as how people were bashing on it, saying that it didn\'t make any sense, that it lacks action-wise, that the info dump were extreme, and another bunch of stuff against this anime, at that time I was confused and decided to rant against the haters. Gladly, for various reasons, I didn\'t, the main reason was that I couldn\'t really state what I liked about Re:Creators. The second one was, because I thought that maybe I could save my opinion in case I...changed my mind later. After the second half of this season, I knew something wrong was happening with this anime, and episode by episode, I started to feel very disappointed, this anime had an immense potential and TROYCA managed to waste it and trash it. The sad thing is that I knew the possible outcomes for this anime, I knew that one of the sides were going to be extremely broken, but I didn\'t knew that she could reach THAT level of broken.This folks, is the consequences of breaking a villain to the point that you don\'t fucking know how to defeat it, and the only thing you can think of, is either doing an asspull in order to eradicate your extremely broken villain, or doing the pussy way out. This isn\'t the first time I\'ve seen this happening, I saw it happening on Bleach, ""The Thousand Year Blood War"" arc, where Tite Kubo pulled out a villain that could use the hax, and you could even tell how Yhwach were steps ahead from his own writer. Sadly for Mr. Kubo, Shounen Jump decided to screw him over and the only thing he could think of doing was the pussy way out. And here we can see how TROYCA managed to ruin a series that had almost infinite ways to develop in a good way. Let\'s see why.TL;DR: Overall SectionFirst, the story: The story is set up on a world where characters from anime, video games, light novels and even fanarts, can be summoned in the real world (The Creators world) only if they have enough acceptation from its fan base. Then we get to know that one of these creations were summoned in order to avenge her fallen creator. Her name is Altair: the villain of this series. So, as you might have guessed, the other creators must stop her from destroying the world, but for some reason, Altair managed to get some pawns on her numbers.I\'m not gonna lie, the whole idea were great at the beginning, on my mind, this anime had many ways to succeed on its plot without getting on a way that it could transform into Dragon Ball levels of nonsense (like watching who has the biggest dick) having godlike vs godlike fights that serves no purpose but to show how broken they can be. Sadly, I was right, the anime headed the way I feared and Re:Creators transformed into your typical action anime with lots of asspulls, and even though this asspulls were actually explained, there is no excuse for them to make Altair extremely broken. Let\'s not forget how many holes this plot has, and how ridiculous the pace can feel at times, you can tell how TROYCA wasn\'t even trying anymore when they decided to make an unnecessary recap episode (Main reason of why this could have been better with less episodes) and having several weeks off. This tho, doesn\'t really affect to those that will probably watch it non-stop. but it can be pretty exhausting having to wait more when the show itself just gets worse within time.now, lets talk about the power ups in this anime that got off the rails completely, I can accept people making Altair powerful when they do fan arts of her, but what I can\'t accept, is that they gave her really convenient powers!. How the fuck can someone accept those ridiculous powers she got? And who the fuck thought of that kind of power? are we meant to believe that these fan art artists just doomed the entire world without even knowing? Why didn\'t the government think of closing this web sites? There are many things on this anime that just doesn\'t make sense and makes me think that the whole cast of characters can\'t think outside of the box. Lets not forget how conveniently they made the MC a pussy just to extend the anime to 22 episodes, this way they could waste a lot of time with more episodes than needed, trying to find a way to defeat Altair when HE ALREADY KNEW something about Altair, something that could have stopped her a long while ago, yet, he would risk the extermination of mankind just because he felt guilty for the death of his friend and he couldn\'t just say anything about it, not until he gets himself into a corner where the only way out is to confess.I don\'t have to talk about the characters at this point, since you can tell pretty well that most of them ends being completely wasted. Its quite sad because the designs of the creations were actually cool looking and they had the potential to be great characters. The only one I managed to like was Magane, sadly she didn\'t have that much of screen time to save this show. In the end, all the characters that died, had a meaningless death, to the point where their existence wouldn\'t even change a thing, everything because a certain someone couldn\'t spit out valuable information that could have worked a long ago instead of letting Altair get more broken episode by episode. You could actually tell how cornered they were at the end, where every single idea went to the trash pretty easily in a very predictable way just to give us the pussy way out which I predicted after witnessing how broken Altair became. (And then the show tries to give you a ""sad"" goodbye epilogue that serves no purpose whatsoever)I\'ll get to the other points of this show before I lost my mind. The animation and art on this show is pretty good overall, there were some really cool fights that were quite fluid and the effects used on some scenes were really epic, if you don\'t pay much attention to the details that, in my opinion, killed the anime, you will surely enjoy these fights while you hear at the good soundtrack that Sawano composed for this anime. Its quite important to have a fitting soundtrack in order to have memorable scenes that you will probably remember when you hear the OST after a while. I\'m pretty sure too that you will be able to enjoy the anime if you put the bad details on the other side, sadly, I got a big bag of disappointment on my back... maybe I was expecting way too much.Overall 5/10: Great Idea goes wrong, plot conveniences and holes, asspulls, broken villain, irrelevant characters, better name it ""Asspulls: The Animation"", Bleach\'s continuation with the female version of Yhwach and a good soundtrack and animation that are enjoyable for those who can put its flaws aside. changed my mind later.

The dialogues are sometimes long and exposition heavy and the action scenes clearly take a backseat compared to character building. Also the supposed main character feels weak and uninvolved in most of the more dramatic scenes in the show. However I am someone that does not mind exposition when it leads to a fullfilling result in the end which Re:Creators delivered for me. Also I don\'t mind Souta\'s weak nature, cause that way he has room to grow over the course of the season. What impressed me the most about the show, was how well the inital concept was handled and how the author tied the authors into the story without deminishing the feeling of power and superiority from the Creations. Throughout the whole show most of the creations felt frightenigly strong and could cause mass destruction at any moment.Also I liked the Slice of Life parts were the Creations from Fantasy/Sci-Fi genres explored our world and the games from which they originated from. The opposing views on their origin the unfairness that was brought with it. The realisation that everything they did up until that point was for someone elses entertainment and the way they dealt with that knowledge on one side. On the other side the thankfullness to their author that they created them with all their heart and effort. That their existence brings joy to many people and that they want to protect the things that are important to their author. Overll I really enjoyed Re:Creators and I hope for an OVA in the future to tie up the last remaining lose ends. - At first set up to be a battle of two different mindsets with a wildcard in between- there were not that many fight scenes, however those that were in the show arewell choreographed in their different stages and are set up properly- Complete Episodes dedicated to exposition and setups- The Exposition delivery could drag at times with a lot of it being delivered throughmonologues and dialogues instead of actions- Funny and interesting recap episode that was more than just retelling the story tillthat point- Through the huge cast of characters, characterization took more of the forfrontthan storytelling for a big part of the show- Really well executed and logical ending that was satisfying to watch and tied upmost of the characters personal stories (rest will probably be handled in a later OVAepisode)- in some parts the show was rather predictable- some of the events that happen feel a bit forcedCharacters 4.5/5- A big cast that expands further as the show progresses- Inspite of a big cast most of the character motivations are fleshed out and welldeveloped giving the viewer a clear image of what the characters want to achivethroughout the story and how they want to get there.- A lot of emphasis on the relationship between the creators and their creations(similar to the master and servant bounding in Fate, but without the masterscontrolling the servants)- There is a number of main characters and not one standout main character otherthan Souta and, which is more used as a narating bystander compared to the othercharacters.- I think that one of Soutas main purposes in the story is to show the differencebetween these godlike beings and ordinary humans.- Besides Souta the most prominent character from the ""Fantasy Worlds"" wasMeteora.

[Also even the anime is forgot about her existence, as she just stopped getting included in the episodes and nobody reacted at all, about searching for her whereabouts.]The ending was great (especially the emotional beats), even with the...lackluster preparation, if the other parts would be just as good it would approach a strong 9.The animation was lazy at times, especially with the backgrounds and masking.All in all it's a 7.5/10, for the ending I would say it is worthwhile to watch it.Also it is frustrating how the anime forgot to even mention, about the lack of free will it implies for certain characters, and how those characters just never deal with the fact that basically they gained sentience and they will probably lose it and could become mindless pawns again. lackluster preparation, if the other parts would be just as good it would approach a strong 9.The animation was lazy at times, especially with the backgrounds and masking.All in all it's a 7.5/10, for the ending I would say it is worthwhile to watch it.Also it is frustrating how the anime forgot to even mention, about the lack of free will it implies for certain characters, and how those characters just never deal with the fact that basically they gained sentience and they will probably lose it and could become mindless pawns again."", ""This show is excellent. It starts from an interesting concept, the idea that characters from many genres have been brought into our world, and uses that concept to simultaneously create a fantastic story, and offer a commentary on the creative process itself.That being said, Re:Creators is not a show that everyone will like. If you are looking for a pure action series, you will likely enjoy the first episode, only to be let down by the slower pace that follows. Keep that in mind, it is an excellent show, the characters are fantastic, the story is excellent, but it is more about the development...of those character than it is about action and combat.If you are looking for a powerful story, and you don't mind a slower pace, you will not regret watching this show. of those character than it is about action and combat.If you are looking for a powerful story, and you don't mind a slower pace, you will not regret watching this show."", 'I\'ll actually move my ass and write a review, because seeing all the pseudo-experts spewing bullshit about this anime is just painful.Let\'s start with the most obvious part, art/animation.It\'s gorgeous, even distant shots of characters have a certain degree of detail and quality. You will not see derpy animation with characters ""spilling out"" due to too little frames or rushed drawing. Art attempts to be as realistic as possible for an animation and it succeeds, characters look different, they have distinct features and the way they look suits their personalities, that goes for supporting characters, like the Creators too. Animation\'s flow is great, there\'s...no ""too fast to see"" bullshit. Sword fights are especially well done with viewer being able to catch every movement. What I really like about this show, however, is how sparingly it uses lighting to improve the art. We don\'t get blurry shots of characters to make them look more appealing. It\'s not that artists were lazy, the show simply doesn\'t need it.The next one would be sound and I\'ll include voice acting here.Starting with the most obvious, the opening. It builds up the tension quite nicely only to release it in melodic and optimistic chorus, which at the same time lacks overcolourized emotions, feeling quite natural. The lyrics combine Japanese and English, the latter being quite good (which seems to slowly become a standard in anime).The second opening goes along very similar lines with verses giving it a bit more mysterious feeling, while the chorus has a lot more pop feeling, like something you\'d find on the radio. At the same time it feels much more emotional. Again, Japanese and English are being mixed, with a good effect.The first ending brings back memories of Yui\'s Rolling Star and other Bleach openings, soft, melodic and simple J-rock makes for a good candidate to your playlist and surely an ending you don\'t want to skip.Second ending doesn\'t exactly suit my taste, it has, by far, the most powerful background of all the opening and ending songs, however a high-pitched vocal makes you think of generic anime endings. Despite that the composition is alright, the bridge does well at building tension which is released before chorus.Now, about the BGM. The first opening is extensively used in battle and high tension scenes. Its tempo and groove make up for a great atmosphere during beautifully choreographed and animated fight scenes, while also fitting the more comedic ones. The rest of background music is a mix of different styles, most of vocals are sung in a well sounding English and some of them are based on Western genres. Cutting it short, the BGM consists of various musical styles, it\'s not just epic orchestral music or dramatic drumming, the compositions are quite entertaining and don\'t get boring partially do to being used in a fitting way and rather sparingly. However each time BGM kicks in, you feel hyped like a rich kid before their father\'s payday.Let\'s get down to Re:Creators\' selling point, the characters.I will not lie, characters are rather stereotypical. We have a ""book lover"" Meteora with voice devoid of emotion, magical girl who doesn\'t like fighting and hurting people (yet has no issues blowing up a skyscraper) etc. Do not look for Senjougahara or Hanekawa here. The main dish are not the characters themselves, but their backstories and interpersonal interactions, especially with their respective Creators. Seeing Matsubara\'s and Selesia\'s relation growing and changing is one of this show\'s highlights. Despite coming from different worlds the Creations can create interesting relations as well, like that of Yuya and Kanoya, or Mamika and Aliceteria. As the series goes on their teamwork and ties grow stronger allowing for some utterly awesome moments mixing magic, occult and high tech universes in single scenes. With amazing effects.This being said, it doesn\'t mean that the characters are flat, they sure feel so right after coming to our world, following their character descriptions very closely, yet with time they develop little quirks and additional features which make up for interesting personalities.Then, there\'s the antagonist, Military Uniform Kid/Princess/Girl. Her motives and ties to Souta become known around 9th episode. While her reasoning is rather shallow and childish, her pure overpoweredness and personality of an evil, scheming entertainment mistress, make up for a great villain.In between two warring camps, there is, but one person, who doesn\'t give a shit, namely Magane. A neutral chaotic character doing things her own way, for her own entertainment. She doesn\'t care for either side and just wants to have fun while eating crepes and sowing chaos for audience\'s entertainment. With a power over lies, she can use everything you say against you, making up for some truly great scenes when paired with more impulsive characters. Certainly, waifu of the season.StoryAs noticed by many before me, the premise is interesting. While the first half of the show develops rather slowly, allowing us to get to know a very large cast much better, the story picks up a lot of pace after Souta\'s and Altair\'s relation has been discovered, and new Creations join the fray. Tension raises and is kept high until the very end, and as of episode 20 it\'s still impossible to say who will win, as the Creators pull out heavier and heavier guns in their fight against the Military Uniform Cutie, their ideas going from cheesy to great, like in a proper story.Not only is tension kept high and built in a rather natural way, with more and more information about Creations and Altair being discovered with every episode, allowing for fast and naturally paced developments, but the story itself is well thought out with great writing, which is especially visible when rewatching, with some interesting hints being thrown here and there.There are also some great references to the real world showing how much care was put into coming up with this series, and a lot of 4th wall breaking, Re:Creators style.Similarly to PriPri, this anime is not a good choice if you want to turn off your brain and write a shitty review using some smart words. You have to focus and watch it carefully to catch everything there is to it. I\'m currently at my 1st rewatch, on episode 8 and the entire series looks even better, as I see more and more connections and hints about fates of different characters.Enjoyment/OverallWhat can I say... Great BGM, great animation, very good and well thought out story, with interesting relations between characters. Just saying that I\'ve decided to rewatch it even before it\'s finished, already says a lot about the overall enjoyment. It\'s just a great show with awesome parody elements, poking at stereotypes in anime and manga. It\'s way over the top when it should be, it\'s toned down and dramatic when it should be, resolutions of each character\'s fate are natural and well written.I\'d give it a 10, if it wasn\'t for very few shows which simply do things perfectly, like Monogatari Series. As such, a strong 9/10. no ""too fast to see"" bullshit. Sword fights are especially well done with viewer being able to catch every movement.

It builds up the tension quite nicely only to release it in melodic and optimistic chorus, which at the same time lacks overcolourized emotions, feeling quite natural. The lyrics combine Japanese and English, the latter being quite good (which seems to slowly become a standard in anime).The second opening goes along very similar lines with verses giving it a bit more mysterious feeling, while the chorus has a lot more pop feeling, like something you\'d find on the radio. At the same time it feels much more emotional. Again, Japanese and English are being mixed, with a good effect.The first ending brings back memories of Yui\'s Rolling Star and other Bleach openings, soft, melodic and simple J-rock makes for a good candidate to your playlist and surely an ending you don\'t want to skip.Second ending doesn\'t exactly suit my taste, it has, by far, the most powerful background of all the opening and ending songs, however a high-pitched vocal makes you think of generic anime endings. Despite that the composition is alright, the bridge does well at building tension which is released before chorus.Now, about the BGM. The first opening is extensively used in battle and high tension scenes. Its tempo and groove make up for a great atmosphere during beautifully choreographed and animated fight scenes, while also fitting the more comedic ones. The rest of background music is a mix of different styles, most of vocals are sung in a well sounding English and some of them are based on Western genres. Cutting it short, the BGM consists of various musical styles, it\'s not just epic orchestral music or dramatic drumming, the compositions are quite entertaining and don\'t get boring partially do to being used in a fitting way and rather sparingly. However each time BGM kicks in, you feel hyped like a rich kid before their father\'s payday.Let\'s get down to Re:Creators\' selling point, the characters.I will not lie, characters are rather stereotypical. We have a ""book lover"" Meteora with voice devoid of emotion, magical girl who doesn\'t like fighting and hurting people (yet has no issues blowing up a skyscraper) etc. Do not look for Senjougahara or Hanekawa here. The main dish are not the characters themselves, but their backstories and interpersonal interactions, especially with their respective Creators. Seeing Matsubara\'s and Selesia\'s relation growing and changing is one of this show\'s highlights. Despite coming from different worlds the Creations can create interesting relations as well, like that of Yuya and Kanoya, or Mamika and Aliceteria. As the series goes on their teamwork and ties grow stronger allowing for some utterly awesome moments mixing magic, occult and high tech universes in single scenes. With amazing effects.This being said, it doesn\'t mean that the characters are flat, they sure feel so right after coming to our world, following their character descriptions very closely, yet with time they develop little quirks and additional features which make up for interesting personalities.Then, there\'s the antagonist, Military Uniform Kid/Princess/Girl. Her motives and ties to Souta become known around 9th episode. While her reasoning is rather shallow and childish, her pure overpoweredness and personality of an evil, scheming entertainment mistress, make up for a great villain.In between two warring camps, there is, but one person, who doesn\'t give a shit, namely Magane. A neutral chaotic character doing things her own way, for her own entertainment. She doesn\'t care for either side and just wants to have fun while eating crepes and sowing chaos for audience\'s entertainment. With a power over lies, she can use everything you say against you, making up for some truly great scenes when paired with more impulsive characters. Certainly, waifu of the season.StoryAs noticed by many before me, the premise is interesting. While the first half of the show develops rather slowly, allowing us to get to know a very large cast much better, the story picks up a lot of pace after Souta\'s and Altair\'s relation has been discovered, and new Creations join the fray. Tension raises and is kept high until the very end, and as of episode 20 it\'s still impossible to say who will win, as the Creators pull out heavier and heavier guns in their fight against the Military Uniform Cutie, their ideas going from cheesy to great, like in a proper story.Not only is tension kept high and built in a rather natural way, with more and more information about Creations and Altair being discovered with every episode, allowing for fast and naturally paced developments, but the story itself is well thought out with great writing, which is especially visible when rewatching, with some interesting hints being thrown here and there.There are also some great references to the real world showing how much care was put into coming up with this series, and a lot of 4th wall breaking, Re:Creators style.Similarly to PriPri, this anime is not a good choice if you want to turn off your brain and write a shitty review using some smart words. You have to focus and watch it carefully to catch everything there is to it. I\'m currently at my 1st rewatch, on episode 8 and the entire series looks even better, as I see more and more connections and hints about fates of different characters.Enjoyment/OverallWhat can I say... Great BGM, great animation, very good and well thought out story, with interesting relations between characters. Just saying that I\'ve decided to rewatch it even before it\'s finished, already says a lot about the overall enjoyment. It\'s just a great show with awesome parody elements, poking at stereotypes in anime and manga. It\'s way over the top when it should be, it\'s toned down and dramatic when it should be, resolutions of each character\'s fate are natural and well written.I\'d give it a 10, if it wasn\'t for very few shows which simply do things perfectly, like Monogatari Series. As such, a strong 9/10.', 'The only reason this even gets a 5 is because the premise is great, and the production values are very good too. (Sound design, visuals, animation, etc)There is a lot of potential to be had here..and even some deeper philosophical questions about creation and the meaning of life lingering around...unfortunately, the way it\'s executed ruins everythingover half the show is pure exposition dump done in the most boring possible ways, with mostly dull characters. this is made even worse than usual due to the atrocious dialogue. There\'s some trully novice level mistakes in the writting like characters repeating the same word 10 times in a...few sentences leading to almost comical delivery.you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world\'s gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world""It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show. In one particular episode (i think it was 4) this gets so bad i actually started laughing out loud at the characters...that\'d be great if this was a comedy...alas, it is not.This has been one of the most frustrating things i\'ve ever watched...because beneath all the terribly written exposition dumps anyone can see there is a brilliant premise begging for a better script. few sentences leading to almost comical delivery.you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world\'s gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world""It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show.

As usual, the high secret operative from the government bows down to that character's episodes long speech. As usual, highly trained soldiers and powerful guns do absolutely nothing. As usual, you have characters that would fight first instead of talking and ending confusions and misinterpretations. There was nothing logical about their actions, so I could not relate to any of the characters at all. This is basically Cliche-The Anime. If not for the visuals,...the redeeming episode 6, and the soundtrack, I would have dropped this in episode 2.And the insert song that plays is amazing, but you can't just keep using the same drop every single time! It was so ridiculously corny after the fourth repetition. the redeeming episode 6, and the soundtrack, I would have dropped this in episode 2.And the insert song that plays is amazing, but you can't just keep using the same drop every single time!

I will surely write a full review when this show ends but my goal for now is to encourage you my friend to watch this anime beacause it has a lot of potential and until now (ep 8) its my favourite anime from the season.Many people will say the episodes lose time in ""meaningless conversations"" but its important to realise that its no plain exposition buying time. It may start a bit slow for anyone expecting a battle royale full of explosions and epic moments but Re: Creators is far more...than that. It manages to gives us a set of characters completly different from one another and make them grow in the context of the story.The setting of having anime/game characters coming to the real world gives this show the chance to start with a character that already has been defined by its author and actually make it  grow according to this whole new world.Also another motivation is how good this anime looks and how Hiroyuki Sawano manages to make music epic enough to induce and orgasm in my ears.

Like say what you must about  psudo philosophy battles of fate stay night. But at lest those came from a psudo historical context because King Arthur was a chick apparently  and even if it was psudo.they at lest built  apon and tried it make it interesting.But with re creators is just taking  basic character stereotypes who come from completely different worlds and giving them  a basic moral alinement.Then give the viewer slight information why they are like this and they just run with it.And to me it\'s just Comes off as lazy and poorly written because it doesn\'t really leave much of an impression on me.And This is a battle royal story and I wasn\'t expecting much from it anyway.but good dam when there no action this story is boring is hell.Like 3/4 of the show is just talking and info dumping and it just so many episodes are wasted on just banter and info dumping.Most of the time it isn\'t even relevant  and just wastes episodes.Just so much dead time like in honesty they could have finished this is about 15 episodes not 22 episodes .Especially with the recap episode we had which isn\'t needed because people already now what\'s happened especially because characters will bring it up anyway.So story wise re creators is a cluster  fuck of ideas that have been done better before and there are shows similar to it that are better.Characters, 6/10Main character seasonal anime watcher kun is possibly the most blandest character I have ever seen to date and that\'s saying something.Because the only thing that he has as a character is that he very shy and likes drawing and that\'s the extent  of his character.He just another self insert  character that you will forget in a week in fact I have to keep reminding myself that he actually exists.He feels like a background character that just given the main character role because the writers couldn\'t think up any decent characters.Even if they explained why he important to the story it doesn\'t really matter because he doesn\'t do anything he is just passive as fuck mostly and when I see him on screen I keep on getting PTS flash backs from guilty crown main character shu who was also a Passive.The side characters are a whole lot more interesting than the main character,Well actually to be more precise the fictional characters are the ones who are interesting. Even if they are basic stereotypes at lest they have personally and actually do something.And one thing that surprised me is how they react to there situation.Like one example is that during a huge battle where one of the characters involved was a magical girl and after the fight was finished.She brakes down mentally because she comes from a very idealistic world where the concept of collateral damage or people being hurt And in pain Isn\'t really a concept she used to and when she sees the destruction around her that  she herself has helped cause she just collapses on the ground and brakes down.And while watching this scene I thought that wasAnd another thing which was quite interesting is that the characters themselves are developing more character  traits the longer they stay in the real world because there getting exposed to things they never experienced before or haven\'t experienced yet and there not confined  by the limitations of the respected story\'s they have come from.Which is interesting because these characters or these versions on them have become slightly  different and been apart from there world\'s for so long that they are starting to become there own  entity outside there place of origin.The other side characters who are quote on quite real are boring as fuck and I do t care about them in the slightest.And are mostly used for info dumps or react how normal people would react in those situations.The main villain that I am going to call evil magical girl.Pretty comes off more As a edge-lord/ emo hybrid.Because all she talks about is sadness  and pretentious monologs about Creation and how she will get revenge for her creator.Because  her creator killed her self and thats the rest of humanity fault that happened apparently.So she wants to make every one feel the sadness and dispaer like her creator did In Her last moments alive.And I can understand the reason behind getting revenge for the person that your creator and gave you life.But at the same time her reasoning behind it comes of as petty and childish.It basically this."" I suffer so I make the rest of the world suffer with me ""That\'s pretty much all the reason behind it.The character interactions I find interesting to a point.But after a while they become repetitive and boring.And I stopped caring after a while.Art, 7/10The animation looks pretty decent and flows quite organically.The backgrounds look decent as well.Art pretty is good as well like there a few parts where shits a little off model or things get a little blurry.Now the fight scenes are quite flashy and don\'t exactly hate it.but it would be nice to have some  battles that don\'t just boil down to using flashy gimmicks to win.like it would be nice to see more difference in combat abilities that aren\'t about the super natural powers  or big robots with hyper beam canons that blow up half a city block.I actually quite like the characters destined because there quite varied and remind me of quite a few different shows which I quite liked the trip down memory lane.Sound, 6/10I really like a first opening because I find it it quite engageing ans gets me hyped for each ep. The ending and other op and ending sounds alight,but for me it isn\'t somethings I would go out of my way to listen to.The ost is pretty good, if you liked sword art online or guilty crown ost I think you might like the ost for re:creators. Because there quite similar in music and beat to it.The ost and music was done by Sawano, Hiroyuki who has worked on music and ost for series such as guilty crown, kill la kill and zombie Lon.Voice acting was on point, nothing really sounded out of place to be.Enjoyment, 5/10Well I enjoyed the ride for  what\'s it\'s worth and I was engaged enough to actually pay attention and not get bored. But after a while as the story continued I keep on  losing interest and honestly I keep watching it even though  the novelty of it wore  off completely after 11 episodes Because I wanted to write this review.And it\'s continuing more than it actually has to.Because honestly the could have finished  this  story in about 15 episodes and it would be be ok.Like I probably prefer fate stay night over this.But at lest a got a great drinking  game out this show.because everyone time someone mentions the Japanese government or anime and manga you take a drink and if you do that you will be shit faced by ep 3 or ep 5 depending on your alcohol  toleranceOverall, 5/10If you like shows like fate stay night or future diary then you probably like this show,Because as far as shounen battle series all things considered  it not exactly bad it\'s just another very average and slightly overhyped show.And it\'s definitely not the modern classic that some people hype it up to be because in a few years time this show will be forgotten like most shows of it elk.If your looking for something with more substance and depth and not just  just cool fights. then probably better off just stick with fate stay night or watch hunter X hunter or yu yu hakusho. by high expectations which this show would probably never meet in a million years.Story, 5/10So by dear readers have you ever thought what would happen if say your favorite characters from anime, manga, light novels eta came to life in the real world.If you have ever pondered  this question then I have some good news for youBecause Re creators answers it  in a very generic  way.they fight because of  reasons to numerous to name.Are story begins with bland main character Sōta Mizushino  which for the rest of this review I am going  to call seasonal anime kun.Who though events that are complicated to explain.pretty much what happens is main character goes into an anime.a character from that anime he watching  becomes real and there a magical girl who wants to destroy all of humanity with fictional characters because for various reasons and seasonal anime kun  teams up with more fictional characters that just want to go home and leave humanity in tact.I seriously do question what kind of drugs these people are on to come up with this shit and I also must ask where can I get this stuff from.So re creators is what happens when you mix meta writing,  a bunch anime stereotypes and lots of drugs.when these elements are mixed together they create  an unholy spawn of satan which as been born from the entropy Of a medium    that\'s already on it last legs.Because in all honesty this is probably the most absurd idea for a plot I have seen in quite a while but I will give them props you thinking outside the box a bit.But at the same time the idea of popular Japanese media becoming real because reasons and there fighting each other for a multitude of reasons.It feels like a less coherent version of fate stay night because it has an almost similar concept and plot beat.Because it dose have those philosophy and morality charged battles that fate stay night and other shounen battle titles are famous for having and there enough background plot to keep you slightly interested to the conflict itself.But I ask myself  this question and ask this to my readers as well.What else is there to this story than just a death battle and the background plot of these characters adapting to life in the real world.Well nothing really much because the story itself feels like a badly written fan fic by a weebo high on crack and hyped up for the next battle shounen tournament arc.And even if the battles and the slice of life elements are interesting to an extent.But it gets bogged down because The story and plot itself  has this  odd obsession  with  pseudo Japanese nationalism  and otaku pandering.Which takes away any kind of deepth this story could actually have.But at the same time I shouldn\'t expect much from a show is pretty much a battle royal with popular Japanese media as fighters.Because though out the series itself they show case how effective the Japanese government was able to sort this shit out very  quickly,while also organizing counter measures to stop the evil media characters at bay.And for some reason this show sounds like it\'s sightly jacking  itself off of how it\'s only poplar Japanese media that\'s coming to life in the real world and only the otakus can help stop this crisis.Even most of the dailong  is taking about the Japanese government or a bunch of otaku pandering shit like how great anime and manga is.It\'s comes off like some weird  hybrid of fate stay night and gate.Except it\'s taken the worse aspects of those series and quantified it ten times over.

Episode 1 had a great premise, but it fell in its plot as soon as episode 3 started. Now i get it when we talk about it being an original series (Joke included). It feels like they just kept adding ""Antagonists"" to at least make a plot, while in the ""ally"" side everyone was...procrastinating and being confused. The whole dialogues from this were empty with no resolution, with a lot of misleading info that could be taken as ""dragging the story"" for the sake of 22 episodes.Character: 1/10The Character Development was horrible. Dull, boring and no back story to anything. Let\'s just jump into the plot without introducing anyone and let\'s be best friends after 5 min went by!!! ... That was all i could see in this. All the time the protagonist was hiding something about his precious friend and stuff, but hopefully you already guessed, YES!, they dragged the whole plot to get a hint of it by episode 9-10 but the whole story wasn\'t progressing and instead going back to what it was at the beginning: Something no one knows about, almost like a first timer, you don\'t understand a single thing and the plot looks weird. Yeah.Sound: 4/10Most decent part about the show? ... The audio, music. Most of the music was created by Sawano, althought his music has been used for almost every other anime right now (Meaning that it feels generic, and if you don\'t understand the meaning of generic, pick up dictionary), it was a great selection for the setting of this show. The music in the anime itself was good, put in the right places. The sounds were also good, but exaggerated, lots of bass-drop and ear rape for a ""real feeling of battle"".Art: 4/10The animation was nothing from the other world, indeed the battles had great animation, but the character design is pretty much the same for everyone but with a different hair, there\'s a lot more for creating a character but no one stands out more than the other (Which is good and a bad thing).The whole premise was good, i tell you, but for episode 1 and 2. Then it was just comedy to me as it was more of a slice of life, meaning they do nothing, there isn\'t a real story behind and you get to see the same faces all over again. For some reason, and i don\'t understand why, i got really hyped before this was released.Overall: 2 (Dropped)You might refrain from calling me a troll after reading this, this is my opinion on the show not yours, if i don\'t like something you like, i couldn\'t care less.

Most of the music was created by Sawano, althought his music has been used for almost every other anime right now (Meaning that it feels generic, and if you don\'t understand the meaning of generic, pick up dictionary), it was a great selection for the setting of this show. The music in the anime itself was good, put in the right places. The sounds were also good, but exaggerated, lots of bass-drop and ear rape for a ""real feeling of battle"".Art: 4/10The animation was nothing from the other world, indeed the battles had great animation, but the character design is pretty much the same for everyone but with a different hair, there\'s a lot more for creating a character but no one stands out more than the other (Which is good and a bad thing).The whole premise was good, i tell you, but for episode 1 and 2. Then it was just comedy to me as it was more of a slice of life, meaning they do nothing, there isn\'t a real story behind and you get to see the same faces all over again. For some reason, and i don\'t understand why, i got really hyped before this was released.Overall: 2 (Dropped)You might refrain from calling me a troll after reading this, this is my opinion on the show not yours, if i don\'t like something you like, i couldn\'t care less. You can make your own review explaining why you like it ^^.', ""This anime is one of the best anime I've seen in its genre. Others have dropped it after going only a few episodes in, but this anime is more than what can be summed up in four or five episodes.Story: the premise of this is the main thing that drew me into Re:Creators. Even though some anime streaming sites do not have the best summaries, the first episode drew me in. The plot to Re:Creators lets the story tie into our world. Even though there are some episodes where discussion takes place, this discussion is extremely important to how the plot moves. Action is not...the main focus. The characters are. And boy are the characters well thought out.Characters: Here we have some of the typical character types for different genres: the magical girl, the wise guide from a fantasy game, the mecha kid, and so many others. If the creators of Re:Creators hadn't thought out how to combine all of these different character tropes and types into this one anime, it could have ended badly. Instead, all of the characters change throughout the story. All of them grow. And they don't all join the same side. They all have their different motives and reasons for joining the sides they do join, and there is change within the sides, too.Sound: Everyone keeps saying how the sound is amazing because of the legendary Sawano Hiroyuki, and it's true. The soundtrack to Re:Creators is extremely good. I don't know what to really say about it, except to say you should listen to it.Overall: I highly recommend watching Re:Creators, and do more than the first few episodes. Actually give it a chance. It's not a 13 episode series, so it can spend a few episodes building itself.Slight spoiler (?) below:Re:Creators is also not afraid of killing its characters, whether they're main characters or not.

I feel like a lot of people who are watching this are mistaking it as an action anime turned boring and got turned off.Story: 7- Interesting premise and as an original anime, the story unfolds nicely with some elements of humour but contains a lot of dialogue to swallow in the first 3 or 4 episodes. Characters from different mediums (manga, anime, video games) are now becoming part of the 3D world. One side is trying to disrupt the balance of the real world by seeking vengeance against their creators (whether intentional or not). The other side who sides...with the MC are trying to find all the creations and protect them in order to stop the Uniform Military Princess (the person who brought them to this world) who wishes to bring this world down with her as her creator has already left the world.Art: 8- No complaints, I like each character\'s appearance and I think it matches with their descriptions quite well. The MC is drawn very plain. I guess he is more like the narrator of the story, although he does play an important part to the story. Animation is quite smooth as well, not surprising about that since TROYCA also did Aldnoah Zero.Character: 7- Some of the characters introduced get shoved into the background and didn\'t get much time to shine yet. We get to see a variety of characters splashed on the screen, but only got to explore 2 or 3 so far so I am hoping that they do something with the two or three characters that they just introduced and never really had more screentime after that point. My favourite characters would probably be Meteora (some may find her boring with her long dialogues but thats how she was like in her world as well. I see her developing each episode and I love that she has a gluttonous and mischievous side to her as well ( She is voiced by Rem\'s VA, how can you hate her?). We also have Gunpuku Hime who is the main ""antagonist"" of the show. While we get to see some of her reasons as to why she would come to hate the world, she hasn\'t had that much screentime after ep 1, but she does make a memorable impression and you can see that they spent a lot of time into her character creation. Her battle moves are badass and she clearly is going on her own path without caring about what the MCs think. Freshly introduced in ep 6, we have Magane, who dresses in a high school uniform, but gives off a villainous aura. She has a great sense of humour (in ep 6 where she\'s just sipping on juice while watching the two sides battle it out)and  is the only creation so far to have killed a human (if i\'m not mistaken).Sound: 9- OP is awesome- as expected of Hiroyuki Sawano. He also did the insert tracks for the battles and they are pretty epic as well. I am loving the music in this anime and you can tell they put a lot of effort into it.Enjoyment: 9- I was hooked from the first episode onwards, I even found the episodes with a lot of dialogue quite enjoyable. I feel that it is needed for the world building and progression of plot. Action was good in episode 1, picks up nicely again at episode 5. Episode 6 left off on a high note where all the creations are fighting against one another for the first time. Guess we are only missing the military uniform princess so I\'m expecting her to join in Episode 7.Overall: 8- I will continue watching this as I think these first few episodes are setting the anime up for something greater. I\'m excited to see how this story will progress.

And, it is a mess.the characters are all over the place. You will be unable to understand their motives, desire, and philosophy,... I never had to push myself to finish a show since the character's actions were so confusing and contrived. And the end game was an ass pull out of nowhere talk no Jutsu. The protagonists are so annoying (Selisa for example, who always talks big about how righteous she is such a simp at the end game causing her teammate to lose an arm, Metorea is basically an NPC just like...other characters), the characters have no substance, cardboard.

This is actually my first time posting on this site and I have got to say that I could not hold back any longer from writing a comment due to my own excuse of being 'lazy'. I must say that the first half of the anime rivals all of my top favorite animes I have seen so far. There are so many...vibes I get from watching this anime. I feel like it's a mashup of Sword Art Online and Death Note (The way the show presents things and how it explains each occurrence logically unlike numerous other animes I have seen where things are not explained due to the anime being an adaptation of a manga).This idea is also unique in the anime industry with many cliché tropes being combined into one big story. It is a refreshing break from the seemingly endless amount of 'Very similar' and 'Generic' animes I have seen so far. The art of this anime (in my opinion) is really awesome and I could even go as far as to say almost the entirety of this series is movie-like production quality. (Based on the 14 episodes I have seen so far)There are no filler episodes (except the 13th episode which recaps the first half of the series) and each episode is either action packed or filled with thought provoking subjects that the show spurs you on to think about either the story or how well each loose end the show leaves behind can be rationalized if you try to think of the reason (Except the episode where Selesia's creator had time to open his laptop while a fight was ongoing to publish the work online and have THOUSANDS of likes and views after mere seconds).However thinking about this kind of thing really defeats the purpose of anime overall since anime is not realistic and it is a form of entertainment (Ironically that's a part of the sub-topic the characters in this anime had a discussion on with). If I were to mention every single little thing the show has done right this comment will turn out to be over two thousand words sooner or later.To summarize everything the show has done right (so far):1. Appeal. (Superb opening fight scene)2. Fluidity and smoothness of the plot with inter-linking plot points introduced and made use of.3. Soundtrack is awesome. (For an anime fan like me)4. Almost all characters introduced are part of the plot. (Or related to)5. Good mix of comedy and seriousness without being over the top extreme and exaggerated.6. New, unique, fresh, hybrid, you name it!7. Animation art, SFX (Special Effects), CGI (Computer Generated Images) were all used appropriately and is making the ride that much more enjoyable.8.

Re:Creators might not be for you.I\'ts a heavy and interesting premise with a lot of somewhat hard to understand development. And while the action looks good and is enjoyable, It\'s definitely a secondary part of this anime.While there\'s a very rough part around episodes 2-5, which is when they go into most of the actual mechanics of the premise, those are important because after episode 7 the story gets a lot faster and anyone who didn\'t understand the mechanics would get lost.I\'ve seen people arguing about ""the story isn\'t good,...i can\'t even figure out which one the protagonist is supposed to be"" i promise if you stick it out you will understand.the last few episodes are emotionally powerful in a way i don\'t often see from anime\'s that include action.It\'s a much better anime than people have given it credit for, but I\'ll admit that there are a few episodes early on that are hard to get through. i can\'t even figure out which one the protagonist is supposed to be"" i promise if you stick it out you will understand.the last few episodes are emotionally powerful in a way i don\'t often see from anime\'s that include action.It\'s a much better anime than people have given it credit for, but I\'ll admit that there are a few episodes early on that are hard to get through.', ""Alright, so, this is a really interesting anime. The first few episodes are kinda iffy, but the more you watch, the better it gets.

I won't say what exactly happens, but lets just say, that the anime took a darker turn on episodes 8-9. I really thought that this anime wouldn't have this kind of event in it. The way that the anime is presented in the first few episodes seems lighthearted compared to how it is at episode 9 now....So far, each episode has left me wanting to see the next, which is a really good aspect of the anime. So far, each episode has left me wanting to see the next, which is a really good aspect of the anime."", 'I describe a masterpiece as “a realization of an artistic vision that goes above and beyond what is possible for a normal anime. It implies a level of understanding, thought, and workmanship that stands above anything else in that genre. It is a piece of media that can evoke feelings and emotions within me unique only to it.”Re:Creators fits that label perfectly. It would simply not be possible to tell this story in any other medium. Every aspect, from the theme, to the plot, to the characters, to the visuals, and even the music and vocals manage to perfectly distill what is unique and wonderful...about the medium. Every action scene, every trope that either plays out or is subverted, every moment of tension, speaks of a of an artistic medium that’s truly starting to mature.This is a love story to Anime, and to all the stories it has brought to us.--- Story ---It’s impossible to discuss the story of Re:Creators without first discussing the main theme. The idea that stories are no more, and no less real than any other world. The theme permeates every single scene, from the initial moments, down to the final group shot. It is within the context of this one theme that the true artistry of the show shines through.The story begins like so many isekai shows that have been popular of late: a character gets transferred from one world into another. Right away there’s a catch, the new world isn’t one of swords, or magic, or warring states. Quite the opposite, this new world is exactly what the isekai genre tries to escape; contemporary, early 21st century Japan. What follows is not a story about impossible odds (though those are present), nor about trying to overcome all limitations (though that must happen as well), but a story about what it means to create.Every character and event that plays out is well fleshed out in their own right, but they also stand as a representation of a core element of a genre. In this context, there are two stories being told simultaneously. First is a story of a struggle against a villain seeking to destroy the world for reasons both understandable and terrible. That story is fun, but not much more so than many other series released over the past few years. Second is a story about the meeting of genres, styles, and types of stories that we have started to witness over this same period, and that’s where we get to see a truly breathtaking view into the heart of the medium.What goes through the mind of a mech pilot fighting against impossible odds? What does a magical girl do when confronted with something other than the black and white, good vs evil battle of her genre? Can a hero fighting a tide of impossible odds maintain her resolve when faced with an easy out? Can a grizzled detective understand why he is faced with endless challenges? Can the heroine of a dating sim accept her role in the lives of many lonely people? Do stories truly end when the original author is finished, or does the realm of fan works offer truly endless possibilities?These are just a few of the question that this series manages to tackle, while maintaining a healthy pace, and following an enjoyable set of phase arcs from conflict to climax. The only issue I have with the story is that it adopts quite a few story-telling styles between different arcs, similarly to how it mixes characters from multiple genres. If you are not intimately familiar with all these styles and their common tropes it’s very easy to get confused and lose track of the various ways in which it delivers on its theme. If you fail to make this leap, then you are going to only see the lesser half of what the show can offer you. However, assuming you can navigate these challenges, the story is utterly superb and manages to deliver on all counts, 10/10.--- Characters ---The characters are the other side of the coin that drives forward the plot of a series, and Re:Creators did a lot of things very, very well here, though not without a few stumbling blocks. The show had a LOT of very interesting characters vying for screen time, with a lot of competing personalities. Many of these managed to mesh quite well, but some simply did not have enough development time, and did not have the depth necessary to stand alongside the rest of the lineup.The strongest of the bunch are introduced in the first few episodes. The first few creations, along with their respective creators get the bulk of the screen time, and see the most personality development. I’d also like to give a special mention the villain of the series, and her near perfect representation of the context of fandom creativity. These early scenes give you a great view into the personalities of the characters, and how they are tied to the personalities of the authors creating them.It is through this reflection that we see the core theme come to life. This is what drives home the idea that the creations are alive, and experiencing their own world far beyond what the creators describe. We get to see glimpses into the lives of all the major characters, experience the aspects of their personalities that would never make their way into the original stories, and see them facing challenges utterly different from the ones they were intended to face.Another strong aspect of characters was the realism with which they reacted to events they faced, while still remaining true to their original character descriptions. This show decided to skip the constant stream of misunderstandings, hot headed disputes, and shady dealings by villains that are too smart for their own good. Every event that happened made perfect sense given the world and the characteristics of those involved, and shows a desire to resolve problems while avoiding new ones. Even the big twists made sense from the perspective of those involved.However, not everything is perfect here. Some characters simply did not fit as well into the story, or felt like they were shoe-horned in there to add some fan-service, or create a bit of extra conflict. My main complain would probably be about the male lead. Even though he turned out to be quite pivotal, the amount of actual development he experienced was quite minimal, which is strange given that he had a lot of screen time. I do appreciate the attempt to present him as a normal teenage kid going through normal teenage problems, but his growth arc was too simple even though it had the potential for greatness.That said, I cannot take off too much for failing to capitalize on a few characters, especially when the majority of the cast was so well fleshed out. When the show ended I felt like I truly knew who the characters were, what drove them, and how they changed throughout the story. The way the creations were presented as both characters in their own right, as well as the creative results of their authors was an entirely novel experience, and for that I will say the characters were presented nearly flawlessly, 9/10.--- Animation ---The visuals in this show were crisp, clear and effective, though falling short of the master level animation you might expect from a truly high budget series. It was quite easy to see that the character designers put quite a bit of effort into this show, but there simply wasn’t enough budget to give every scene the love it deserved.The action scenes were reasonably well presented, though certain elements like the explosions were lackluster. Most of the fights felt a bit slow, though that may simply be the nature of the characters. There were certainly some high intensity fights going on near the end. Again, as with all the other sections I have to give props to the animators for managing to capture quite as many styles as they did, with everything from giant mecha fights, to martial art slug fests, to gun battles, and even apocalyptic magic duels.Outside of the action scenes the range of expressions were startlingly varied, though each individual expression was a bit static for my liking. I suppose that’s the price for having such a large number of character designs and styles. That said, the show managed to maintain a dynamic feel by ensuring there would often be small movements in the background, such as idle motions during talking loops, or the characters shifting attention when a new person in a group started to speak. In all, the show managed to catch my attention visually, even throughout some of the many the dialog heavy sections.Finally, the backgrounds were very well done. There were often multiple angles on a single scene based on the best camera position necessary to display a character’s range of emotions. It was common to see both wide angle, and closeup shots of various settings based on the topics being discussed, and even when scenes could have been re-used there was always some amount of change in the backgrounds to prevent things from looking static.In all, the animations were extremely well done given the genre and budget, and though I’ve seen better animation as a whole, I cannot in good conscience count off for that given the scope of what they did here. The artistry with which the characters emotions were presented was masterful in its own right, but the variety of backgrounds sealed the deal, 10/10.--- Sound ---The VAs certainly earned their paycheck for this series. All of the characters voices fit perfectly, and had the emotional range necessary to match the quality of the art on display. Tense scenes dripped on tension, during action scenes you could feel their blood boiling, and when the characters were relaxing it was easy to catch a vibe of relaxation and enjoyment.This was true even across the multiple genres on display, which worked to add to the effect of mixing realities. The vocal work was one of the most powerful elements connecting all the characters together, giving everyone an equal plane to interact on, despite the vast differences in visual design and genre of origin.The music was also extremely well presented. The show made good use of silence, and let the interludes of music both accentuate and hint at events both present and future. The various character themes fit perfectly, the vocal tracks were exciting, and did a great job of capturing the intensity of the pivotal scenes.Even the audio effects were extremely well put together, which ensured that the sometimes-lengthy periods without music fit within the context of the rest of the show. Little details like the sound of traffic in a building near a highway, the soft whisper of the wind in a field, the hum of distant machines in a stadium, the different types of crowd sound loops for the different types of crowds ensured that the world seemed alive. Even little things like furniture clacking when being moved, or the scratch of pencils of paper managed to complete the illusion.As with all the other categories, the audio was an obvious labor of love that went way beyond what I would expect of a normal series, 10/10.--- Enjoyment ---If you made it this far then this result should come without any surprise, but I found Re:Creators to be one of the most enjoyable shows of the past several years. It managed to capture so many ideas that spoke deeply to me, and it executed it within a package of immaculate production values.Re:Creators was an amazing experience from the first scene to the last, and one I hope to revisit again and again in the future. I rate it a masterpiece, and I hope this review might help explain why. about the medium. Every action scene, every trope that either plays out or is subverted, every moment of tension, speaks of a of an artistic medium that’s truly starting to mature.This is a love story to Anime, and to all the stories it has brought to us.--- Story ---It’s impossible to discuss the story of Re:Creators without first discussing the main theme. The idea that stories are no more, and no less real than any other world. The theme permeates every single scene, from the initial moments, down to the final group shot. It is within the context of this one theme that the true artistry of the show shines through.The story begins like so many isekai shows that have been popular of late: a character gets transferred from one world into another. Right away there’s a catch, the new world isn’t one of swords, or magic, or warring states. Quite the opposite, this new world is exactly what the isekai genre tries to escape; contemporary, early 21st century Japan. What follows is not a story about impossible odds (though those are present), nor about trying to overcome all limitations (though that must happen as well), but a story about what it means to create.Every character and event that plays out is well fleshed out in their own right, but they also stand as a representation of a core element of a genre. In this context, there are two stories being told simultaneously. First is a story of a struggle against a villain seeking to destroy the world for reasons both understandable and terrible. That story is fun, but not much more so than many other series released over the past few years. Second is a story about the meeting of genres, styles, and types of stories that we have started to witness over this same period, and that’s where we get to see a truly breathtaking view into the heart of the medium.What goes through the mind of a mech pilot fighting against impossible odds? What does a magical girl do when confronted with something other than the black and white, good vs evil battle of her genre? Can a hero fighting a tide of impossible odds maintain her resolve when faced with an easy out? Can a grizzled detective understand why he is faced with endless challenges? Can the heroine of a dating sim accept her role in the lives of many lonely people? Do stories truly end when the original author is finished, or does the realm of fan works offer truly endless possibilities?These are just a few of the question that this series manages to tackle, while maintaining a healthy pace, and following an enjoyable set of phase arcs from conflict to climax. The only issue I have with the story is that it adopts quite a few story-telling styles between different arcs, similarly to how it mixes characters from multiple genres. If you are not intimately familiar with all these styles and their common tropes it’s very easy to get confused and lose track of the various ways in which it delivers on its theme. If you fail to make this leap, then you are going to only see the lesser half of what the show can offer you. However, assuming you can navigate these challenges, the story is utterly superb and manages to deliver on all counts, 10/10.--- Characters ---The characters are the other side of the coin that drives forward the plot of a series, and Re:Creators did a lot of things very, very well here, though not without a few stumbling blocks. The show had a LOT of very interesting characters vying for screen time, with a lot of competing personalities. Many of these managed to mesh quite well, but some simply did not have enough development time, and did not have the depth necessary to stand alongside the rest of the lineup.The strongest of the bunch are introduced in the first few episodes. The first few creations, along with their respective creators get the bulk of the screen time, and see the most personality development. I’d also like to give a special mention the villain of the series, and her near perfect representation of the context of fandom creativity. These early scenes give you a great view into the personalities of the characters, and how they are tied to the personalities of the authors creating them.It is through this reflection that we see the core theme come to life. This is what drives home the idea that the creations are alive, and experiencing their own world far beyond what the creators describe. We get to see glimpses into the lives of all the major characters, experience the aspects of their personalities that would never make their way into the original stories, and see them facing challenges utterly different from the ones they were intended to face.Another strong aspect of characters was the realism with which they reacted to events they faced, while still remaining true to their original character descriptions. This show decided to skip the constant stream of misunderstandings, hot headed disputes, and shady dealings by villains that are too smart for their own good. Every event that happened made perfect sense given the world and the characteristics of those involved, and shows a desire to resolve problems while avoiding new ones. Even the big twists made sense from the perspective of those involved.However, not everything is perfect here. Some characters simply did not fit as well into the story, or felt like they were shoe-horned in there to add some fan-service, or create a bit of extra conflict. My main complain would probably be about the male lead. Even though he turned out to be quite pivotal, the amount of actual development he experienced was quite minimal, which is strange given that he had a lot of screen time. I do appreciate the attempt to present him as a normal teenage kid going through normal teenage problems, but his growth arc was too simple even though it had the potential for greatness.That said, I cannot take off too much for failing to capitalize on a few characters, especially when the majority of the cast was so well fleshed out. When the show ended I felt like I truly knew who the characters were, what drove them, and how they changed throughout the story. The way the creations were presented as both characters in their own right, as well as the creative results of their authors was an entirely novel experience, and for that I will say the characters were presented nearly flawlessly, 9/10.--- Animation ---The visuals in this show were crisp, clear and effective, though falling short of the master level animation you might expect from a truly high budget series. It was quite easy to see that the character designers put quite a bit of effort into this show, but there simply wasn’t enough budget to give every scene the love it deserved.The action scenes were reasonably well presented, though certain elements like the explosions were lackluster. Most of the fights felt a bit slow, though that may simply be the nature of the characters. There were certainly some high intensity fights going on near the end. Again, as with all the other sections I have to give props to the animators for managing to capture quite as many styles as they did, with everything from giant mecha fights, to martial art slug fests, to gun battles, and even apocalyptic magic duels.Outside of the action scenes the range of expressions were startlingly varied, though each individual expression was a bit static for my liking. I suppose that’s the price for having such a large number of character designs and styles. That said, the show managed to maintain a dynamic feel by ensuring there would often be small movements in the background, such as idle motions during talking loops, or the characters shifting attention when a new person in a group started to speak. In all, the show managed to catch my attention visually, even throughout some of the many the dialog heavy sections.Finally, the backgrounds were very well done. There were often multiple angles on a single scene based on the best camera position necessary to display a character’s range of emotions. It was common to see both wide angle, and closeup shots of various settings based on the topics being discussed, and even when scenes could have been re-used there was always some amount of change in the backgrounds to prevent things from looking static.In all, the animations were extremely well done given the genre and budget, and though I’ve seen better animation as a whole, I cannot in good conscience count off for that given the scope of what they did here. The artistry with which the characters emotions were presented was masterful in its own right, but the variety of backgrounds sealed the deal, 10/10.--- Sound ---The VAs certainly earned their paycheck for this series. All of the characters voices fit perfectly, and had the emotional range necessary to match the quality of the art on display. Tense scenes dripped on tension, during action scenes you could feel their blood boiling, and when the characters were relaxing it was easy to catch a vibe of relaxation and enjoyment.This was true even across the multiple genres on display, which worked to add to the effect of mixing realities. The vocal work was one of the most powerful elements connecting all the characters together, giving everyone an equal plane to interact on, despite the vast differences in visual design and genre of origin.The music was also extremely well presented. The show made good use of silence, and let the interludes of music both accentuate and hint at events both present and future. The various character themes fit perfectly, the vocal tracks were exciting, and did a great job of capturing the intensity of the pivotal scenes.Even the audio effects were extremely well put together, which ensured that the sometimes-lengthy periods without music fit within the context of the rest of the show. Little details like the sound of traffic in a building near a highway, the soft whisper of the wind in a field, the hum of distant machines in a stadium, the different types of crowd sound loops for the different types of crowds ensured that the world seemed alive. Even little things like furniture clacking when being moved, or the scratch of pencils of paper managed to complete the illusion.As with all the other categories, the audio was an obvious labor of love that went way beyond what I would expect of a normal series, 10/10.--- Enjoyment ---If you made it this far then this result should come without any surprise, but I found Re:Creators to be one of the most enjoyable shows of the past several years. It managed to capture so many ideas that spoke deeply to me, and it executed it within a package of immaculate production values.Re:Creators was an amazing experience from the first scene to the last, and one I hope to revisit again and again in the future. I rate it a masterpiece, and I hope this review might help explain why.', 'This is my first review but wanted to give my opinion of this series so far (up to ep 6). The word that comes to mind when thinking about this anime is disappointment. The starting premise is a great idea and fairly original. Characters from different media coming to our world would be amazing. The art is great and the music gets you pumped for the fight scenes. There\'s a good variety of characters and you get really excited to see where the story will take them. Here\'s where the the disappointment comes in.I\'ll start with Souta Mizushino (the main character), I cannot find...the reason he is even in this show. Hes the typical shy MC but we barely learn anything about him. He doesn\'t drive the plot forward, he has no real importance, and he barely seemed to be in episodes. The only purpose he had was to give information, either to the ""creations"" (anime people) or the viewers, and with the introduction of new characters hes not even needed for that now. Another problem with this show is flow. Some episodes have good balance of action, information, and drive. Other episodes are bogged down in dialogue and don\'t go anywhere. There is too much talking in certain episodes, and that\'s not even the main problem I have with the talking in the show. The conversations don\'t have the substance to warrant the time used for them. They say the same things over and over but disguise it with ""big words"" so it sounds important. On top of the long conversations the anime doesn\'t show scenes of what they\'re describing or reflect any of the consequences they talk about in their conversations. Most of the plot is through dialogue and never shown. A very basic rule of good story telling is ""show, don\'t tell"" but this anime does the complete opposite. Even after so much dialogue, you get very little of characters\' backstories or what the worlds are like that they come from. With the problems from the main character and so much dialogue the one aspect that suffers the most is the ""drive"". There\'s no clear A to B,  the reasoning behind characters doing what they do isn\'t established, and there\'s no sense of urgency. There\'s literally a part where they say they don\'t know what to do and they just wait in a room, even though they just discussed a huge problem that needs to be solved. Things just seem to happen and all the characters are just along for the ride.Some parts I will praise the anime on is the realism they try to have. An example is some fights happen in the cities, and of course there\'s collateral damage. Unlike some anime, bystanders actually notice this and the government gets involve. Which I always appreciate when a fictional world reflects off the actions of the main characters, so that\'s a nice touch. It\'s also nice that they chose different characters from different genres and not just one media.So in conclusion, there are good or even great parts about this show (which is why I will continue watching it), but there are a lot of problems that hold it back from being above average. It\'s disappointing because you can see the potential this starting idea/premise had. It\'s still only 6 episodes in, for 22 episode anime so it could (and hopefully) improve, but it will be hard to recommend an anime with ""it gets good around episode 7"". I highly doubt ill drop this anime for it being purely bad, but the wasted potential is a different factor. I\'ll try to update this review when more episodes come out if people found it helpful. the reason he is even in this show. Hes the typical shy MC but we barely learn anything about him.

I\'ll try to update this review when more episodes come out if people found it helpful.', 'My very first review: Let\'s get started.A lot of people expected Re:Creators to be an action-heavy series only to be given a lot of dialogue throughout the show which is fair because that\'s what it looked like in the beginning. And although it played with the concept of being self-referential or meta, I think that what the show is trying to accomplish is to give a message about acceptance. Which is ironic with it\'s reception.The main problem that I got from most reviews about the show is that it wasn\'t able to translate it\'s exposition effectively and while...I can\'t blame them for this, I need to say that the dialogues were not useless as they describe it to be. It does have a lot of talking so if you don\'t like this aspect of the series then, I rest my case.Now, reviewing this show without giving any kind of spoiler is impossible as it\'s going to cut the series short from what it is. Consider this a warning.I find the core theme to revolve around acceptance. Altair; the main antagonist of the show, herself is the very embodiment of the hatred of the REJECTED or rather someone they run to when they are rejected. The whole show begun because the main character Sota, wasn\'t able to ACCEPT that he is a shitty artist just as the creations that got transported to the ""real world"" can\'t ACCEPT the reality that they were not ""real"" in the beginning. The creators can\'t do anything in the show unless their audience ACCEPTS what they made. And the show even resolved it\'s conflict by Sota finally ACCEPTING what he did. Not with fighting but by accepting his feelings about his friend Setsuna. It\'s about realizing and accepting what it means to create and what a creation is. Why do people draw/create stories? What does that drawing/stories mean to them or to others?The show do have lot of flaws especially in the plot department but that only strengthens my point that the story wasn\'t what\'s important. It\'s the message, that it wasn\'t trying to weave an amazing original story rather it\'s a love letter to all the people involved in the community and industry and that includes the viewer. It\'s a message in RE:gard to CREATORS hence the title. Episode 13; not only being cleverly meta specially because of the ending of the series, but also explains the process that goes into the show.I still gave the story a 7 because even though it was driven by emotion a lot more than logic, it dealt with the harshness that comes in a competitive workplace and explained it in a not in a very straight forward way like what Bakuman or Shirobako did (which I both like as well.)The art and animation isn\'t the best but It looks pretty to me and while the character designs were trying to reference characters fromother shows, they weren\'t total knock-offs and actually gives an original take that clearly doesn\'t look ugly. I give it an 8. While some of the music I can understand to sound generic, I find the way it was utilized amazing especially in the sound effects department from the glitchy sounds to the explosions. I give it a 9. The character interactions was one of the strongest part of the show for me when they do actually interact. I loved all the characters because they feel somewhat real and close to me but I\'ll give it an 8.Overall I think it\'s a good show and deserves an 8. I hope my review made sense and convince some people to give the show a chance because I thoroughly enjoyed this show.

My review my have very minor spoilers but nothing major. When I first went into this show I looked at it as a Fate Zero but instead of historical figures we got characters from various forms of media from across many different genres but as the show went on I discovered it was way more than that.The first point I wanted to make is that your enjoyment of the show will probably depend on how deeply you want to...look into it. If you just wanted an action show where the characters beat the bloody piss out of each other until only one is left standing, this is NOT that show. This anime is a commentary on crossovers but is even more so a commentary on creators, their relationships with the fictional characters they have created and their relationship with their audiences as well. A character from a children's story  which has no blood or destruction coming across another character where death and tragedy is a part of their entire story will have very interesting effects on said children's character. Also the tragic character having the opportunity to meet their creator and getting a chance to take whatever actions they choose to him/her for the story they have to suffer through is another layer of intrigue.It doesn't even stop there though and this ties with a major complaint people have with this show and that is predictable (well mostly the ending). This show has almost Gintama levels of breaking the 4th wall. There is an audience within the show as well as us the audience watching the show. This is important because the show uses this as well as character power mechanics as a way to call how the audience will feel about the show as it's happening. Sure maybe some aspects of the show is predictable but if you're not paying attention you might miss little tidbits that suggest that the creators of the show knew we would find it predictable and then use character mechanics to play with said audiences expectations. This was one of the best parts of the show for me. I would look at the comments of a particular episode just to see if the show was doing a great job at measuring audience reaction and it was surprisingly nailing it. Overall there are a lot of layers to this show and if you really wanted to you could spend all day peeling them away to see how smartly written this show actually is.The art of the show overall is really good although the CGI for the robots in this show feels out of place when compared to the 2D dominant style of the show. The fights in this show aren't the best in terms of animation but it is still pretty good when fights do happen.Probably the best part about this show is the music. The openings are incredible. Opening 2 Shout is my pick for best opening of the whole year so far with one season remaining to close out the year. The insert songs that play when fights break out get my blood pumping as characters are throwing themselves in this giant free for all.All in all this might not be a masterpiece but I would be lying if I didn't say this was one of the most creative anime I have seen in quite a long time. I spent a lot of time theory crafting as the show went on and it's blend of Fate and Shirobako/Bakuman made it so that it wasn't just simply another Fate anime.

I make my review,  Götz von Berlichingen!!!!Ya know we always see a lotta anime that involve beings from another dimension invading the human world, but never like this when the inter dimension beings were the fictional creation of man that came to life, and were running amok around the streets of Japan, causing mayhem and destruction with one another, now such concept would have been taken from the following movie like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" ""Cool World"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" but unlike...those, this was more on the sci-fi fantasy side, so Holopscion ""The 1st Movement"" my review:Story, Good 7.Ok so the concept by original creator, Daiki Kase was pretty much taken from the US animation movie that I\'ve mentioned, and thought this isn\'t a live series, it doesn\'t matter, what matter is that it\'s plot is actually cause by a frustrated doujishi wanna be, who has been getting a lotta flak from reviews on social media that has cause her to hate the world very much, now, her hatred has channel to the creation she made in the form of a military uniform girl whose the very representation of evil , now how that happen basically defines the laws of quantum probability and I\'m not even a math genius , but leave it to them Japs to come up with such plot that violates such probability....in a good way, that is since it was really something that everyone would associated with in the real world where our very frustration makes us wanna wish for the world to be rewritten in our own way if we could, that\'s why this category is good, Wave Chat-Toufekai Omnipotents!!!!!!Art, Fair 6.Ok, so what do we have here?????the quintessential white hair girl, 2 of them that is, a red head , 2 of the as well, a blond girl , jaz one, Zettai Ryoki, there is 3 of them. Swords, medieval weapons, Mecha, black suits, the military, 4 eyes, a bokuko, dorky guy and a loli, all check. Shinpantsu, only 2 and uncensored boob flash, none..... what else is there, the only thing hot about Selesia was her in the Vogelchevalier sitting in the straddle position where we can see her butt-cheeks.Sound, Good 7,The score was for the following the opening theme, the background theme, Altair sounding psycho, Selesia having a heroic tone, Meteora\'s monotonic tone, Alice\'s going all out tone, Yuya\'s badass tone and the various chats that I hear around is what makes this category good, Also I like the part where Hiyaku who turned in to this Extreme Final Legend Martial Artist\'s call out the word ""Secret Lethal Strike, Gorai Kassatsu, Cosmic Hell Fist!!!!!!""  and Sho\'s ""Banyard!!!!!!"" and my fave , Altair ""Holopscion!""Character, fair 6.Ok, so the characters were cool, but, I really hated Sota, he blames himself for not reaching out to Setsuna, when she needs him the most, but really I don\'t see any point as to why he has to be around, I mean, what has he done aside from being a witness to a battle that is outta this world, he probably wouldn\'t be able to do anything on episode 21 without Megane, giving him something, frankly, I see him as a male wallflower , who  is only on the sides to loiter around with them creators. Selesia whom is the first one Sota has met was somewhat of a likable character in fact one would see her as Sota\'s love interest or probably be one of Sota\'s harem members together with Meteora, but alas, the feeling was mutual, no love interest, back to Selesia, her character being this headstrong amazon was really good , in fact not bad as a kudere, who can care, fight and be the protagonist. Meteora, is a bit boring, though one would sympathize with her for losing her creator, she is like a child who is an orphan, unlike Megane, who can be classified as a lunatic delinquent, not surprising, since her creator is a drunkard and probably has a bad side......a very bad side that has to be eliminated, so Megane just did that, now Megane is one character whom I find is a fence sitter who wouldn\'t side with anyone, in fact she is only very mischievous fence sitter who would manipulate something when it bored her, too bad she just walk away without us knowing as to wtf has happen or what kind of mayhem she would make, I really would have love to see her get owned either by Altair or by Yuya. Mamika and Hikayu, ok so the first one kicked the bucket after duking and losing to Altair, while the other was a replacement, big deal, none of them stand against the latter, Yuya, Alice and Blizt, well they\'re the badasses around here where they played it well, Charon, Sho, well they\'re introduce very late and not much of an impact since we barely know them, they just merely and added action extras, Now on to Gigas Machina kid, well imo he just a quintessential loli around here, if we can call him that. well either way, there is nothing much for me to say.Enjoyment, Fair 6.It was good, but the final battle was a bit too long where it occupies 5 episodes, also, it was kind frustrating, that Altair went through all that mayhem and destruction only to be calmed down by Setsuna or the visual representation of her creator Setsuna by Sota who was given some iron pyrite, we\'re in my opinion was the whole of Megane\'s powers, and ends up reuniting with her dead creator, well imao, i really wieh that hse would have had a violent ending where she over uses her Holopsicon and what remains of the creations gangs up on her or would have made an ultimate sacrifice to kill her, that\'s the kind of ending I want....then again a happily ever after wouldn\'t be so bad, especially when there is a potential for a Meteora X Sota relationship.Overall Very Good 8.I was all worth it............I really wonder if Megane also did lose her powers like Meteora??????Oh what the fuck, it done and over, no more season 2.Götz von Berlichingen!!!!!!!!!! those, this was more on the sci-fi fantasy side, so Holopscion ""The 1st Movement"" my review:Story, Good 7.Ok so the concept by original creator, Daiki Kase was pretty much taken from the US animation movie that I\'ve mentioned, and thought this isn\'t a live series, it doesn\'t matter, what matter is that it\'s plot is actually cause by a frustrated doujishi wanna be, who has been getting a lotta flak from reviews on social media that has cause her to hate the world very much, now, her hatred has channel to the creation she made in the form of a military uniform girl whose the very representation of evil , now how that happen basically defines the laws of quantum probability and I\'m not even a math genius , but leave it to them Japs to come up with such plot that violates such probability....in a good way, that is since it was really something that everyone would associated with in the real world where our very frustration makes us wanna wish for the world to be rewritten in our own way if we could, that\'s why this category is good, Wave Chat-Toufekai Omnipotents!!!!!!Art, Fair 6.Ok, so what do we have here?????the quintessential white hair girl, 2 of them that is, a red head , 2 of the as well, a blond girl , jaz one, Zettai Ryoki, there is 3 of them. Swords, medieval weapons, Mecha, black suits, the military, 4 eyes, a bokuko, dorky guy and a loli, all check. Shinpantsu, only 2 and uncensored boob flash, none..... what else is there, the only thing hot about Selesia was her in the Vogelchevalier sitting in the straddle position where we can see her butt-cheeks.Sound, Good 7,The score was for the following the opening theme, the background theme, Altair sounding psycho, Selesia having a heroic tone, Meteora\'s monotonic tone, Alice\'s going all out tone, Yuya\'s badass tone and the various chats that I hear around is what makes this category good, Also I like the part where Hiyaku who turned in to this Extreme Final Legend Martial Artist\'s call out the word ""Secret Lethal Strike, Gorai Kassatsu, Cosmic Hell Fist!!!!!!""  and Sho\'s ""Banyard!!!!!!"" and my fave , Altair ""Holopscion!""Character, fair 6.Ok, so the characters were cool, but, I really hated Sota, he blames himself for not reaching out to Setsuna, when she needs him the most, but really I don\'t see any point as to why he has to be around, I mean, what has he done aside from being a witness to a battle that is outta this world, he probably wouldn\'t be able to do anything on episode 21 without Megane, giving him something, frankly, I see him as a male wallflower , who  is only on the sides to loiter around with them creators. Selesia whom is the first one Sota has met was somewhat of a likable character in fact one would see her as Sota\'s love interest or probably be one of Sota\'s harem members together with Meteora, but alas, the feeling was mutual, no love interest, back to Selesia, her character being this headstrong amazon was really good , in fact not bad as a kudere, who can care, fight and be the protagonist.

Like inserting yourself instead of a character in the last show you\'ve seen? Being able to interact with your favorite characters, and looking cool since you know what\'s going to happen through the manga and novel? Well, let\'s flip the chess board and look at it from ""their"" point of view, these characters that you have been watching through...this glass screen of yours, paying no heed to their sufferings. What would be their reaction if they came to our world? Then being told right after that they were created solely for the sake of people\'s ugly fantasies? That\'s Re: Creators for you... It\'s about what it means to meet the god of your world.============================================================Story(8): Following my intro, Re: Creators drills into the idea of the fictional characters, namely the created, being forced into awareness about their reason for existence: Entertainment. And what feelings do they hold towards their God, or as referred to in the show, the ""Creator"" whom they believe, brought upon them all the calamities of their world. Aside from that, it also manages to send some messages without actually phrasing them, Or feeding them directly to the viewers. For example, the scene with Mamika\'s terrified face in episode 2, noticing how much damage she has inflicted using her magic at the end of episode 2, while this has never happened before in her ""Mahou Shoujo world"" where the bad guys are ""reasonable people"", and the world is rated PG-13. Oh, that previous line just took us to the characters\' section, didn\'t it? Well..============================================================Characters (7): Pay attention to this, these characters are all original anime and manga/novel characters, their worlds are quite different from ours. Them keeping their original personality, even with the disastrous change in the settings is quite the fun. Yes, fun!!. Unlike most isekai shows where the main character gets transferred into another show and immediately switches his identity 180°, in Re: Creators, however, they remain the same way their character setting was. Continuing on using Mamika as an example, her world doesn\'t show blood at all. At most, the evil guys probably just poof out of existence. Thus, even when she came to our world, her brain knew one thing, ""bad guys will just poof and everyone will be happy"". For that very reason, all her limiters were set off, and she let loose her power. So Yeah, apply the PG part when letting your kids watch anime, please. The show is somehow disappointing when it comes to utilizing the diversity of characters though. They had diversity going for them, but they weren\'t giving their chance to shine. About only quarter of the cast had their chance, and even less than those have left quite the impression. Maybe the color palette takes the responsibility for that?

The art quality was well-maintained till the very end of the show. However, the shadowing laked consistency and made some scenes look so flat, even when CGI was used. On the other hand, the camera angles during the action scenes are quite neat, they\'ll give you quite the thrill and keep you entertained. The director has done quite a good job with that. Speaking about Entertainment... The OST contributed on a godly level at that!!============================================================Music(9/10): Hiroyuki Sawano.Wait, do you even need to read anymore about the music?Maaah.. FINE!! I\'ve been hearing a lot about this guy being a real OST God, and yes, he might be the closest thing to that. The music itself is extremely addictive, and amusing in its own way. I liked the orchestral feeling to most of the BGM, it really gave me the shivers. The lyrics haven\'t always been on point, but when they hit, they hit hard. Almost all the theme songs are pleasant for your ears and suitable for listening to during the show. They greatly redeem the mood, and the pace through the fights, and the thrilling scenes.Since music is an inborn taste, it\'s 9/10 for me.===============================================================Enjoyment (9/10): Strictly speaking, Re: Creators is a nicely entertaining show. It could have jumped to the level of a masterpiece, but the expected (yet satisfying) happenings limited it to being enjoyable.===============================================================Tl;dr, This anime is all about the action, and the fairly original concept of the story.

A lot.I've seen reviews that say there is too much talking, and then immediately say the characters are plain and bland. While in the 3rd and 4th episodes there is much more talking than action, that just means we are seeing the plot develop, and I say it is a good plot with very good characters.Music and sound effects are masterful, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, one of my favorite anime composers of all-time. I cannot wait for the full version of...the sound track, and some merch to buy.Overall I say go watch it and give it a chance, don't let the others tell you what is and isn't good. the sound track, and some merch to buy.Overall I say go watch it and give it a chance, don't let the others tell you what is and isn't good."", 'Out of all anime I have seen this year, Re:Creators has the most creative premise ever. I went into this blind, not knowing much other than some people saying that this anime could be an anime classic. I can totally see why that is now. The idea of creators meeting their own creations is a fascinating idea that has an endless pool of possibilities. It is a premise that normally fan fictions would be capable of doing. Just to note, I will be saying ""creators"" and ""creations"" a lot in this review, because those terms are important into understanding Re:Creators.I have wanted to see...this kind of idea come to fruition since the first time I have watched crossover media.   The concept of many characters from various genres meeting each other was something I wondered about as a kid. What stimulated such an idea was character chemistry. How would a character from an adventure genre interact with a character from the magical girl genre? What kind of conversations would they talk about? How would they be able to settle their differences and form friendships?With a kind of crossover like this anime though, I realized now it would be hard to make this work as a sensical story without connecting various plots together and doing intense research. Watching Re:Creators fulfilled that part of my imagination that I wanted to see happen in such a long time. I could tell that the creators of this anime put a lot of heart into making this concept because there were lots of interesting ideas explored. Re:Creators, to me, is a celebration of Japanese media.The story really blew my expectations in the first episodes. Not only are these character interactions  happening, but there is also major interaction with the real world, where the creators of these characters live. It further intrigued me, given that this crossover is mainly based on Japanese media (manga, anime, games, light novels). For me, Japanese media has been my hobby for the past several years. Re:Creators having such crossovers of Japanese media with the real world made my mind explode more. Even more ideas and questions expanded in my head while I was watching.I also had this thought in my young mind about creators meeting their own characters too. I wanted to see how the creator would interact with their characters they put much heart into creating. The impossibility of such a situation really stimulated my head and made me think about what the interaction would result in. Would the creator be awestruck, happy, crying? Alas, I never thought about it much more and only played around with the idea in my head, not going beyond the event of creators and creations meeting each other, because I never truly understood a creator\'s motivations on making media back then.Today, as someone who has loved and researched Japanese media, this anime was a dream come true for me. With all of these concepts in Re:Creators, I wondered how the overall story would be executed in this anime? Does this fulfill its potential with its concept? Mostly.Re:Creators explores many interesting relationships between creators and creations. To summarize, each creator has a different philosophy, motivations, and perspective on how they create their stories. There are creators who want to make the best story by deeply exploring their world to ones that that create for pleasure and/or entertainment. There are some creators that go through hardships just to get their stories known to people. Some are poor and live with what they have, while there are some that are lucky and reach huge success. It covers many different types of creators inspired by real-life creators in the Japanese media industry.Then, there are the characters. I really like these characters because they are basically amalgamations of various notable characters in real-life Japanese media in terms of personality and design. If you watched this anime with different anime fans, they will have different opinions on what each character is based on. For example, you could interpret Mamika the magical girl being inspired by Madoka Magica with both of their notable pinkish design, while others could think she is inspired by Sailor Moon or PreCure noting visual traits such as the weapon she wields and the transformation pose. The interpretable quality of these characters helps people identify and understand these characters easily.This is where I talk about the biggest strength of Re: Creators, the interaction between the creators and creations. This is where 90% of the anime focuses on. These conversations are really interesting because you get see the creations ask their opinions and questions to why their story is the way it is. Creators can get life-threatening criticism from their own creations. Through these conversations, it help the creator improve their personal development and fixing their flaws as a story writer. It is an unexpected way of character growth that I really enjoy and can connect to.Creations also get their own development through the realization of being a fictional character. Each development is very unique as there are creations of various genres that deal with situations in amusing and sometimes meta ways. They either decide to accept or decline their creator for creating the story as it is. I could really tell that the real-life creator of Re:Creators put a lot of thought into making a coherent plot and crafting development for these characters. I feel the story created in this anime is such a huge feat accomplished for how many elements play an interesting role in Re:Creators. These are some of the many creative ways Re:Creators does with its overall plot, and I do not want to say more to avoid getting to spoiler territory.To get into the few cons, the dialogue can be potentially boring for those who despise long exposition and/or prefer more action. This never personally bothered me because each conversation between the creator and creation has enough purpose and progress for me to be consistently engaged. By the end of the anime, a few notable characters do not get solved resolutions, which is a bit of a problem. I also felt that there could have been a bit more story potential that could have been done with interaction of creator and creation. These are really the only few problems I have with the anime, but it is not really enough for me to seriously dislike it.To cover the other aspects of Re:Creators, I really enjoy the music utilized in this anime. The soundtrack mainly consists of awesome electronic techno music and a bit of orchestral by the composer Sawano that nails what Re:Creators is about. The music gives a particular feeling an epic battle appropriate for this kind of crossover anime. The art and animation is pretty solid as well. When it comes to the occasional action scenes, they are pretty exhilarating to watch as characters clash against each other. These other aspects complement each other to help make Re:Creators a very entertaining watch.I would also like to address the other problems that people talk about that I personally think are not actually a problem before I close my review. Mainly, it being the lack of in-depth exploration of the creation\'s worlds:There are some people that say that not exploring the character\'s fictional stories enough is a flaw in Re:Creators. In my opinion, the creation\'s worlds in Re:Creators do not really need to explored, because these creations can be easily identified by an audience who watches several anime, you do not need to know their backstory if you have a good background on anime. If this anime had to share their backstory, why would it matter to the premise?  It is irrelevant. Because ultimately, Re:Creators uses the character\'s stories to help create interesting relationships with the creators and creations. Why would I care about a creation\'s story if ultimately the creation/creator relationships matters? It would deride the premise and the goal it is trying to achieve.Overall, I think Re:Creators is one of my favorite anime that I have watched EVER! This anime filled a gap that I wanted to see happen, and fulfilled that premise very well. If you are a fan of Japanese media, I would not dare miss out on this anime! this kind of idea come to fruition since the first time I have watched crossover media.

If you are a fan of Japanese media, I would not dare miss out on this anime!', 'NOTE: This anime has not finished airing as of post dateHere we go, an anime I can confidently say is a masterpiece.Other reviews attack this anime for being boring. Unlike other anime, Re:Creators shows you what goes on ""behind the scenes"" to give you information and build up along with tension between main characters. A lot of these scenes take place in a single room or just one part of a building, but these scenes help you understand each character more and see their motivations for what they do. I personally think most people who rate this low are used to anime telling you...what\'s going to happen then throw you right into the action. If Re:Creators was at the pace of other anime I think reviews would say ""it\'s to rushed"". Right now the pace is prefect.Now for everything else. This show has a unique plot with incredible characters that show emotions that you and might feel. None of that ""I\'m the hero so now i\'m suddenly the strongest character"", you have realistic (to an extent) characters that have their own realistic strengths and weaknesses. The emotions are carried so well between these characters and you through beautiful dialogue and monologues that might get your heart racing or you eyes teary.Music, Music, Music. Sawano Hiroyuki does such an incredible job with this anime. In my personal opinion, GravityWall and sh0ut are the two greatest openings of the past year. Tielle&Gemie deliver stunning, powerful vocals to bring you these beautiful tracks that you just cant skip. With he main battle themes AL:Lu and Layers, you will feel the emotions of the fights and get your adrenaline pumping.Character design is outstanding, each character\'s design is similar to what their Creator made them. Scenery and backgrounds are very well done, with much attention to detail. Extremely visually appealing.To sum it all up, in my book there\'s no anime like this one. Outstanding on all fronts and an overall Masterpiece of an anime. what\'s going to happen then throw you right into the action.

Sawano Hiroyuki does such an incredible job with this anime. In my personal opinion, GravityWall and sh0ut are the two greatest openings of the past year. Tielle&Gemie deliver stunning, powerful vocals to bring you these beautiful tracks that you just cant skip. With he main battle themes AL:Lu and Layers, you will feel the emotions of the fights and get your adrenaline pumping.Character design is outstanding, each character\'s design is similar to what their Creator made them. Scenery and backgrounds are very well done, with much attention to detail. Extremely visually appealing.To sum it all up, in my book there\'s no anime like this one. Outstanding on all fronts and an overall Masterpiece of an anime.', 'Holy moly Re:Creators was something else.  It was a story that could have been great if half the cast was cut and maybe the length of the show was doubled.  There was so much in it that it was difficult to unpack and get a good grasp on.The story was unique and somewhat interesting, however, most of the plot was conveyed through scenes where the characters stand around and talk.  This is something that is pretty boring in live action movies and even worse with animated characters, especially when they have unique abilities.  The show looked and sounded good, but the...characters were high key bad.  You were given very little backstory for them making it difficult to connect with them or understand why they would actually do something.  Each character was also supposed to be involved in a piece of real world media.  Had these characters been from actual games and shows it would have been much easier to understand, but that wasn\'t the case.  Some characters seemed like they were inspired by other shows which allowed for a bit of correlation, but it was pretty much minimized as soon as they opened their mouth.Many characters were on the antagonist\'s side because ""she deceived them"" but we still never really knew how she deceived them aside from a relatively generic phrase. ""Altair told me all about this world.""  I kept watching through the whole thing hoping it would suddenly get great, but it was mostly just weird.I think mediocre sums up this show very well.  The story could have been easier to understand if more effort was put into describing the characters in the show.  As it is, I had to call on knowledge of what those types of games/shows usually had for a character to have an idea of what was going on the whole time. characters were high key bad.

The action scenes are very well-done despite it just being a simple plot device. The real gem hides in the characters. One-dimensional they might seem, but as you watch on, you WILL grow attached to the characters. A really great cast that will capture your heart and make you feel for them. This anime is truly inspiring for creators out there who just need an extra push to continue creating.The line between the ""antagonist"" and ""protagonist"" is very much blurred. And this shows very clearly near the end of the anime. The ""main""...character, Sota, is a very human character. Not the type of protagonist that carries the show. The cast helps to drive it forward and the writers are very grounded and human. If anything, the writing is fantastic. Sure, it may have flaws. But that\'s the essence of creating, isn\'t it? That\'s why I think that this anime is very inspiring. There is room for mistakes so long as you work doubly hard to improve on them and never give up.Truly, an underrated anime. I don\'t even bother to write reviews for shows that I\'ve watched, but I felt that this anime deserves the effort to do it justice. character, Sota, is a very human character.

Its basically tolerating people to judge prematurely. As of right now the show just has one episode left, so I shouldn't be writing a review yet either but my intention is really to just combat the other negative reviews from individuals who have seen only 4-5 episodes.Re:Creators is a show that was completely over shadowed upon its release with other huge hits such as the second seasons of Attack on Titan and Hero Academia. Its quite sad really because if nothing else the show has...art and music on the same level as those two. The art is very pleasing to look at and feels almost like Ufotable was in charge. The music is great. Hiroyuki Sawano does not disappoint as always. Both OP's can arguably be one of the best this year, currently. I dont need to spend much time on the artwork and music because it should be obvious from just one episode that they are really good and even people who didn't enjoy the show could say the same.Now as for the story, its obviously not a masterpiece but it does bring to the table a certain charm. What the plot does is something similar to what shirobako does for its viewers. It really helps you feel the passion of the authors/artists, the creators of the anime and manga we love so much. Honestly if nothing else I can say that I am going to finish the show next week with a greater appreciation for the work these people put in. Now a lot of complaints have been about the show being rather bland/boring in its begining, hence the bad reviews after only 5 episodes. And yes I think its fair to say that in the begining the show does start slow. And that may be one of its biggest faults. However I recomend you continue to watch until at least half way through as the pace picks up and gets much more entertaining.Ok now for the characters which also seem to be a point of complaint. First and foremost the show does not rely on an mc. It has a character who seems to take the role but ultimately he's not the mc. Now it should be said that this character is most certainly why people might immediately criticize the shows characters in general because he really is a somewhat annoying and bland character. That being said the show has a many other characters to offer that are very good. Most noteably the character Magane steals the show along with others like Blitz Talker and Aliceteria. However I also found some of the creators to be very prominent. Like I said the show helps us gain an appreciation of authors and artist and the way it does so is with of course is with the authors and artists within the show. All in all I felt the show had provided wonderful characters. Magane could be one of this years most memorable and I dont see anyone not enjoying her screen time.Overall I think the show has. Lot to offer; great art, music, and memorable characters. The show has a lot of flaws but I think it is worthy of peoples time and shouldn't be thrown under the bus. I really looked forward to watching the show these past Saturday's, even more so than Hero Academia or anything airing currently no cant wait to see the finale. art and music on the same level as those two.

Although this and Yagate Kimi ni Naru\xa0are going to change that. I don't know when I'll actually watch and review that one, but it's going to happen.Story:The premise of the series gets us off to a good start. Basically, every time a writer crafts a work of fiction, they create a world. Mine are full of rainbows and women doing the majority of important things, clearly. Things take a twist when certain, popular characters start crossing over into our world. Some of them want to watch the world burn, others...want to make their creators suffer for giving them dark worlds full of tragedy. It's up to our main protagonist, Blandon, a bunch of heroic characters and the creators to save the day.The biggest problem with the series is that it's all about the themes of creativity and the process of making art but the characters and worlds we see crossing over are all the most generic representations of their genres imaginable, based on what we see. To compound the problem, the twists are also very obvious. And to top it all off, the ultimate climax involves blatant deus ex machina, the ultimate tool of the trash writer. It also doesn't help that the big threat is a fanfiction OC. It would be like our world being threatened by Coldsteel the Hedgehog but less hilarious.And this was a premise that had potential. The idea of creations crossing over into our world and confronting their creators is great and could have been used to great effect. Even the further step of having them fight for the future of our own world could have worked really well. If the execution hadn't been shoddy at every turn.Characters:Describing the characters in this is basically describing trite stereotypes. The action girl heroine. The guide character you get in some RPGs but without the personality that the good ones would infuse her with. The loving magical girl\xa0who just wants to talk things through. The dark fantasy heroine. The street tough dude. The trickster villain. The grizzled old dude. The mecha pilot, young and optimistic variety. So, a big step up from the super angsty version, at least. Nice to see that this story all about creativity couldn't be bothered when it came to its own character creation.The creator characters aren't any better. Their trite lack of real personality just derives from more slice of life tropes instead of the genre specific ones of the creations.Art:Here's one area where I can give Troyca credit. The artwork looks pretty damn good. The backgrounds are detailed. The action sequences flow well. Some of the designs are very blatantly based off of other, better characters, (all of them may be and I just don't recognise some of them) but they don't do them badly.Sound:This is another element where I can give the series credit. They got good actors. People like Minase Inori, Komatsu Mikako, Toyosaki Aki, Murakawa Rie & Hikasa Yoko. Are these their best performances? No. One of the general problems with very bland character writing that I've encountered time after time is that the acting can't really stand out much if the characters don't. But the performances are very capably done.Sawano Hiroyuki's soundtrack is nicely done and definitely has the wow factor. Which isn't surprising. He also did well with Shingeki no Kyojin and decently with Zombie Loan.Ho-yay:There's quite a bit between the dark fantasy heroine & the magical girl. Because of course the magical girl gets les-yay.Areas of Improvement:Flesh out the characters. It's all well and good to use a clichéd version as a base. But what separates a good, great or excellent series from a more middling one is that it builds off of that and turns it into something unique. Which this series couldn't be bothered with.Don't use a fanfiction villain. Part of the premise is that the characters operate off of acceptance from the audience. Well, when you have your main antagonist as an over-powered Mary Sue, I have trouble believing the audience would accept her. Especially when she's fighting against all the bland characters that are hugely popular for inexplicable reasons. Yeah, it might be fun to have Coldsteel or other big fanfiction characters as memes but if something official came out where Coldsteel fought Son Goku, no one would accept Coldsteel winning except Internet trolls.Give us some compelling conversations between creators and their creations. This idea really gets under-used in this series. We get very brief snippets of creators interacting with their characters but there's no real depth to those interactions and the various philosophical points that should come up either don't or are glossed over.Final Thoughts:Re:Creators\xa0isn't a bad series. It has strong fundamentals and a promising premise. Unfortunately, its lacklustre execution brings it down significantly. The weakly written characters, poorly fleshed out story, deus ex machina ending and main villain who canonically comes from fanfiction all serve to make a narrative that's pretty weak.

It creates generic anime heroes and characters from many existing shows and pits them battle royale against each other. The vast majority of the characters are fleshed out well, and coupled with a strong OP, great voice actors and amazing art, for the first half of the show I thought I was watching a masterpiece.At some point, the writers deemed it necessary to buff the antagonist in order to counteract a plot hole...they created in their main character\'s strengths that allowed them to do almost anything the writers dreamed of. From there, they essentially wrote themselves into a hole by making the antagonist essentially unkillable and came up with several elaborate and extremely boring battle episodes which ultimately were ultimately meaningless and overly drawn out.I\'m trying to avoid heavy spoilers so I\'ll just say this. Like many great shows (Game of thrones and Kado being a shining example of this),the writers created this wonderful world with tons of likable characters and a solid plot. At some point they remembered they needed to wrap up the plot and were like HOLY SHIT WHAT DO WE DO????Although this show was never quite the trainwreck that Kado was, the writing quality took a massive nosedive after they started trying to actually defeat the main villain. They never really attempted to explain where the whole ""anime IRL"" thing came from, they gave random characters absurdly overly convenient powers and technology to wrap up the story, and they just made a really, REALLY shitty villain.I honestly was expecting this show to remain brilliant, and I really hope it\'s the start of a new genre of reverse isekai shows. There were enough things about it that kept the story fairly enjoyable even at the end, and the fantastic characters and interesting premise managed to keep it afloat.Would I recommend re:creators? Hell yes I would. Would I call it amazing? Definitely not. Like Kado, it started really strong but ultimately failed to do anything with the story and world it created. At the bare minimum at least it ended the story in a somewhat satisfying way, which is more than 90% of anime out there (Such as Kado).

It started off with a rather unique idea and an interesting plot so the first 3 episodes I thought that it had alot of potential. Now that I finished it I can say that it was not anything super amazing, but it was pretty decent and I did enjoy watching it.Story: 7The plot is very interesting and unique. I liked the idea of this reversed isekai (other world) where the...characters from the other worlds come to this world instead of a main character gets summoned to a fantasy setting. The fact that the main characters dragged the creators of the other worlds into the situation was also a nice and unique idea. But the way the story progressed felt a little bit lackluster and it felt like some things could have resolved so much sooner if the Main character just spoke up, but the anime would've finished alot sooner than in 22 episodes I guess.Sound: 9The BGM in this anime is great. Especially the battle music  (layers) felt a bit like Bios to me from Guilty Crown. Not really much else to say just listen to it xDArt: 8Character: 6The art was really well done. Especially the particle data stuff when something related to the other world was happening.The characters are pretty average. Their design was great, but I feel like a lot of them didn't really play a significant role in the anime or didn't have enough screen time. There were also some plotholes in some characters and in the ending for example with the main villain. The only one that really stood out to me was Meteora. I kind of disliked the MC at the beginning due to his rather wimpy nature and him not wanting to say anything but I'm glad that gets resolved later in the anime.Enjoyment: 8overall I did enjoy the anime very much. it had good art and great sounds. The characters were a bit less but I could still get some joy out of them. The story was good and unique but had some things that could've been done better.Minor detail: The fact that they did their recap episode in a sort of a special way was something that stood out to me and actually the first recap episode that I enjoyed. characters from the other worlds come to this world instead of a main character gets summoned to a fantasy setting.

Some of them handle the revelation well and learn to adjust to living life within our reality while allying with Sota. Others feel repulsed at how the plotting decisions of their ""creators"" caused suffering for their world and ally with the mysterious girl in hopes of altering events within their titles. One particular character plays out as a sort of wild card in the events of the series as they instead revel in their mischief and the current chaos of the conflict while allying with neither side. Their characters get varying degrees of development in learning to cope with the circumstances of their presence within our world and, with exception to a few characters that seemed to largely stick with whatever character type they had coming from their medium, gradually change as they adjust to the situation and learn more of the mysterious girl\'s motives.This solid foundation of character development also includes the Creators of the mentioned Creations within Re: Creators. Each Creator has their own distinct personality, lifestyle, and style of storytelling that give them each their unique individualism as characters and affect the relationship that they have with their Creations. The interactions between them tend to vary with being friendly to hostile depending on the Creation\'s reaction to their situation, and helps create unique and diverse character chemistry between the Creators and Creations that effect their relationships throughout Re: Creator\'s run.Another element of the series with solid storytelling is looking into the origins and motivations of the mysterious antagonist. Hints are dropped of how she came about and having a connection of sorts to Sota as he is shown to be visibly traumatized at the sight of her in early episodes of Re: Creators. This aspect also serves as a source of character development for Sota as he learns to get over a lack of creative motivation for drawing characters due to events related to our mysterious antagonist. Her unique origins also serve as a source to her overpowered abilities that get focused on in later episodes in their connection to fan reception of a title\'s characters and plot developments that affect how characters and plots within said works develop.Praises aside, Re: Creators is not without its imperfections. There are some episodes in the middle of the series focused mostly on infodump over elements of the story and characters, as well as one episode that serves mostly as a recap of events for the anime\'s first half. While the infodump episodes help to add more information on elements of the series, they mostly don\'t aid in advancing the plot of the series in any way and drag its advancement to a halt at points.That issue aside though, Re: Creators is still a good sci-fi adventure-drama series thanks to its unique premise on characters from popular Japanese media entering our world, their reactions to this, and the conflict that develops from the mysterious female antagonist. Anyone looking for a unique premise such as this with Japanese media creators and their characters or having an interest in sci-fi adventure should seek this out. they play within them.

The overall premise for Re Creators is a simple question of what happens when your favourite characters from your favourite media be it Anime, Light Novels, Manga or Games are suddenly brought to the real world and you come face to face with them.  What happens when these characters which are called creations in this show come to the real world from their often war torn or depressing worlds to one that looks to be the realms of god. Now what’s more is that you also get to fight alongside them against a threat to both this real world and their worlds. The concept of wanting to meet your favourite characters from your favourite Manga is one that resonates well with many people especially those that have been long terms fans of such series. Indeed the reason why Re Creators is one of my most favourite anime’s from last season is also because I loved the concept of this simple but unique premise.The overall story for Re Creators is set in modern day Japan and follows quite a large cast of characters as they try to make sense of what brought characters from fictional media to the modern world while also trying to understand the threat that the main villain poses to it as well. Souta Mizushiro is a young high school student and the very picture of a modern day Japanese teenager. An aspiring creator with his ultimate goal of wanting to write a light novel of his own Souta is one day suddenly dragged into the world of one of his favourite anime’s and comes face to face with one of his favourite characters Selesia when she was engaged in combat with a mysterious new girl that has many mysterious powers. After the end of that battle and being sent back to his room Souta dismisses it as merely a dream but stops when he sees Selesia standing in front of him with her sword at his neck. After meeting with other creations like Selesia and creators like him and being made aware of what that mysterious girl is trying to achieve Souta finds his life has suddenly become more excited and dangerous than he ever thought possible as he finds himself working with characters that he knows from novels, manga’s and games and their creators and the government as they try to prevent the destruction of the world that they live in.SelestiaSelesia Upitiria voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Mikako Komatsu of Aldnoah Zero and Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series. A creation that comes from the mecha light novel Elemental Symphony Selesia was one of the first creations that Souta met in the series. A powerful swordswoman that also pilots a rather small mecha Selesia is a strong willed and honourable person and fights with hard to protect both her friends, allies and innocents that are caught in the crossfire. Indeed, Selesia’s is very much like that of the ancient knights and the samurai as Selesia also lives by a code of her own that she uses when in combat to base her decisions on. As benefit of such warrior types Selesia hates the thought of harming civilians and will actively try to protect them from harm if they are caught in the crossfire.  In combat Selesia is a very capable combatant being a swordswoman of unparalleled skill and is able to fight against the best of her opponents pretty well. Due to her skill in combat as well as her experience in unit tactics Selesia often acts as the battle leader and it is shown that she has a good grasp of tactics.  While Selesia is brave she isn’t by any means stupid or foolish and has little pride or ego that gets in her way which puts her in good stead as she can be relied upon to always keep in mind the larger picture. Outside of battle Selesia has a rather interesting comedic side to her personality which I felt was pretty funny and helped offset the seriousness of her personality when she’s in battle.In addition to her honor and her skill at quick thinking Selesia’s other prominent trait is that she always strives to put the needs of her friends and allies before herself which I found to be a trait that was well suited for her. Though Selesia and Souta did not have the best of first encounters it can be seen that the two of them become rather good friends as they fought alongside one another against Altair and her team. Indeed, it can be said that Selesia also played a large role in helping Souta become more braver and instill some conviction into him for his dreams. Selesia’s relationship with and her bonds with the other creations on her team was another of the focuses for her character and watching her gradually learn to accept the others and learn to work together was something that I though was done really well. By the end of the series it can be seen that Selesia had managed to bond with and forge friendships with everyone on her team and also with their creators and support staff as well which is a result of her kind and caring nature towards her friends. Overall, I thought that the character of Selesia was very well designed and that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did an excellent job portraying her. Though I only seen Mikako in one other main role to date I believe that in her portrayal of Selesia is her standout role to me and I will be interested to see where she goes from here.MeteoraMeteora Osterreich voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon fame is one of the main characters of the show. A creation that originates from a well-known RPG video game rather than from a manga or an anime Meteora serves as a great contrast to the first character that was introduced in the series which was Selesia. In appearance Meteora resembles the traditional sage character type that commonly appears in media that make use of fantasy themes as their main theme and true to her appearance Meteora is both a powerful mage and an intelligent person that loves to learn and gather knowledge. Personality wise Meteora is a quiet, smart and calm person that is also extremely perceptive and always has an interesting insight that she can offer to the group. While quiet Meteora’s perception skills are such that she is easily able to tell if something is bothering someone and will try to help them with their problem the best that she can. True to her role as a sage and also because of her intelligence Meteora is considered by many to be the smartest among the group and in this capacity, she acts as the team’s strategist as she works to unravel the enemies plan.  This is a role that I felt was really appropriate for her. True to her personality Meteora is someone that prefers to have arguments that use knowledge and logic to counter the enemies plans and indeed she seems to prefer this than engaging in combat. Unlike Selesia who has trouble in trusting people due to past actions Meteora is someone that can take the long view and always looks at the larger picture before making any decision on whether to do something such as trusting people that were their enemies before.Despite this Meteora is not someone that gets tied to a single plan and she is flexible enough with her planning to allow for new situations to happen and is able to adapt to these relatively well. Despite this Meteora can still be surprised if events are drastic enough on the field.  Due in part to her sage role Meteora is not as combat oriented as characters like Selesia or Rui but that does not mean that she is completely useless in battle as she can hold up reasonably well against enemies. One aspect of Meteora that I particularly liked was her spells which I felt was really well designed particularly their incarnations as they are being activated.  As a character Meteora was smart, kind and fast thinking and while not as capable in combat as the other members of her team she made up for it by her strategic mind and ability to out think her opponents. I been a fan of Meteora’s seiyuu Inori Minase since I saw her performance in Re Zero as Rem and I have to say that her performance as Meteora easily exceeds even that beloved role. She really did a fantastic job here. One of the funniest traits about Meteora that was more prevalent early on was how much she loved to eat which is something that I found to be pretty amusing.SoutaSouta Mizushino played by veteran voice actor Daiki Yamashita of Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student that lives in Japan Souta is someone that can be described as an average teenager that tries to live his life as best as he can without drawing attention to himself. A quiet, good natured and intelligent person that common to teenagers of his age reads manga, LN’s and watches anime Souta differs somewhat from this as he aspires to become an author and indeed seems to be in the midst of creating his own work. Before the start of the series Souta read and watched as lot of the media that was popular in Japan and as such he is familiar with much of them. As a result, each of the creations that turns up in the series is someone that he knows or is familiar with. In the beginning of the series Souta was inadvertently dragged into the fight between Selesia and a mysterious girl as he watching an episode of the anime where Selesia was from. Though initially reluctant to get involved Souta due to both his responsible nature and his curiousness about the mysterious girl soon took on a more central role in the fight between the two sides.Initially Souta while kind, honest and caring acted more as a support role for the other characters and did not really stand out much in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Souta’s secret shame plus his good nature was often used against him. However, as the series progresses Souta’s personality changes and while he retains his trademarked traits of being kind and honest Souta rids himself of his main weakness of being weak to pressure and also manages to gain more self-confidence as a result of being able to work with fellow creators which is the term used to refer to people that creates things in the real world most notably Marine and Selesia’s creator Matsubara. Souta’s secret shame which forms part of his character development I felt was pretty interesting and tragic at the same time. Throughout the series it can be seen that Souta was tormented greatly by the events that caused this shame and his part in it and I was glad that in the end he was able to tell the others about it and from there find strength from the advice that was given by the others. A prominent trait of Souta’s that stems from the fact that he reads and views so many forms of media is the unique view that he has regarding them in that he sees the worlds that are in them as the same as the real world and not fake ones are some people view them and believes that the real world can get a lot of ideas from them. Because of this view Souta is someone that can easily relate to what creations do and think which has often proved useful to Meteora when she’s forming her plans to stop the enemy. The character of Souta I felt was an interesting character and represented your everyday teenager which in the real world is your average audience for the forms of media that is represented in this series. While Souta may have been weak at first glance when compared to characters like Selesia I felt that the development of him was done reasonably well and by the end of the series I was glad that he become a much better person. The secret shame of his that relates to Altair’s creator Setsuna I thought was interesting but also equally sad and tragic. This personal reason for his behavior I thought was a good move and his admittance of this shame to his allies and friends was one scene that was well done as it took a lot of bravery and courage to be able to speak out.  When compared to the creations as a mere human Souta can never be equal to them but I think that in terms of bravery and a determination to atone himself Souta is easily a match for them there.Kanoya RuiRui Kanoya played by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Souta and Meteora’s allies in their struggle against Altair. A creation that originates from a mecha anime that seems to have a rather grim and depressing setting as it makes use of child soldiers like Rui who engage in combat to protect his city from enemy invaders. As bereft of a hero that originates from a mecha anime Rui’s main weapon and armor is his mecha which is called Gigas Machina which is a mecha that is about the size of a mid-sized city block and comparable in size if not firepower to the gundams of the well-known gundam series. Personality wise Rui is a quiet, honest and understanding person and displays a certain amount of pride for himself and his Gigas machina. As a result of his origin story where even as a child soldier Rui is constantly being deployed to the frontlines to defend the city against enemy forces Rui has a tendency of throwing tantrums when being ordered. Indeed, in the beginning of the series after he met up with Selesia and her team Rui displayed a lot of reluctance in needing to engage in combat again in this new world that he has found himself in despite the best attempts of Selesia to persuade him. As the series goes on however and Rui begins to understand the gravity of the threat that is facing this world and his world Rui eventually begins to change becoming more understanding of other people’s feelings and more liable to think of the actions that he has took and the consequences of these actions.Despite an awkward first meeting with Selesia and co Rui eventually forms lasting friendships and bonds with her and her team after seeing how hard they fight to prevent Altair from enacting her plan and becomes very loyal to both the team and their efforts to stop Altair. In particular Rui’s relationship with Selesia was rather significant as before meeting her Rui never really considered himself to be a hero and rather considered himself more of a soldier than anything. However, fighting alongside Selesia and the others against Altair in an effort to protect this world allowed Rui to eventually realize that he too is also a hero in his own right as well. Like the other characters in the show Rui has a number of prominent character traits that make define him. Like Meteora Rui loves to eat and probably more so than Meteora which considering his background is something that I think is perfectly understandable. Rui also has a rather interesting way of dealing with stress and worries and does this by powering up into the sky in his mecha at high speed and letting the speed worry you instead. This type of stress relief I felt was interesting and related to a mecha based character like Rui perfectly.  As a character, I felt Rui was an interesting character that goes on to prove that every person can be a hero if they decide to devote themselves to achieve a noble goal and that hero’s do not need to be knights or mages and can be anyone that can fight with conviction. Rui’s gradual change from someone that was reluctant to fight for an unknown world to someone that was willing to stake every inch of his life and skill to protect it I thought was excellently done. I been a fan of Sora for quite some time and while Rui herself was not as excellent as her standout roles such as Princess Asseylum in Aldnoah Zero I thought that she still managed to pull off an impressive performance portraying Rui.YuyaYuya Mirokuji played by veteran voice actor Kenichi Suzumura of Gundam seed destiny and Naruto shippuuden fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia and Meteora’s allies in their fight against Altair. A fierce swordsman from a well-known action manga Yuya serves as a great contrast to honorable warriors like Selesia and knights like Alicetalia in that Yuya’s attitude and mentality is more akin to a mercenary than anything. In the beginning of the series and when Selesia and co encounter him Yuya was a brash and aggressive person that seemed to have a love of combat and will not hesitate to fight children if he needs to if it meant that he can fight strong foes. However, as the series progresses Yuya’s personality eventually starts to evolve as he begins to understand the plans that Altair plans to enact on the world. While still retaining his brash and somewhat aggressive nature Yuya begins to exhibit more restraint to his aggression and begins to understand when it is time to fight and when it’s time to talk. Although still surprised at what the real world was like out of the creations Yuya was perhaps the one that adapted the fastest to living in this world. Though Yuya was indifferent to the world at first Yuya’s eventual friendship with Selesia and her team had a profound impact on him as he could find allies that shared his ideas and a cause that they all agreed was worthy to protect. This eventually made him one of the team’s strongest assets on the field.Throughout the series Yuya was shown to be someone that enjoyed fighting powerful foes with the more powerful ones being the worthiest ones in his eyes. Indeed, being able to fight against worthy foes with all of his might is perhaps Yuya’s main reason for his existence as a character. In the show, this is best shown in his fights with Blitz and in his brief fight with Sho. As a warrior Yuya is someone that dislikes trickery and magic of any kind however he is not stupid enough to deny that magic itself can be a powerful force on the field. As a result of his dislike of trickery Yuya and Magane have a mutual dislike of each other that I found quite funny. Despite being a mercenary that has somewhat villainous traits Yuya himself has a sense of honor that he tries to adhere to whenever possible which was really surprising to see. On the outside Yuya due to his brash nature can be difficult to know well but once you do he is shown to be a very loyal person if he too believes in the cause. As a combatant Yuya is very similar to Selesia in that he is a swordsman that fights with a bokken that he uses with unmatched skill and can call upon a spirit of sorts to aid him as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuya in my opinion was second best in terms of close combat in the team. As a character, I felt that Yuya was an interesting character that shows that despite being brash and aggressive on the surface people can still change and surprise you in different ways. The gradual change from an overly aggressive and brash swordsman that we see in the beginning to one that learned to show restraint and yet remain committed to a cause that he considers worthy was one that I thought was done well. I also liked the fact that by the latter half Yuya learned that sometimes negotiation with others can also win battles quicker than mere strength of arms. One prominent trait of Yuya’s is his rather funny habit of assigning nicknames to his allies some of which can be quite entertaining such as the one that he gave Meteora. Overall, I thought that Kenichi Suzumura really did a great job portraying the character of Yuya in this show.HikayuHikayu Hoshikawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Shiina Natsukawa of High school fleet and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Selesia and Meteora’s main allies in their fight against Altair. A rather unique creation among the other creations that’s on the show Hikayu is actually a character from a video game rather than say an anime or manga. While characters from video games are not unusual in this regard as Meteora too is from one the uniqueness here is that she’s actually from a dating sim and as such initially she had no combat ability whatsoever. Personality wise Hikayu initially upon arrival in the real world was rather shy and sensitive to others feelings and was rather indecisive in the actions that she should be taking. However, as the series goes on Hikayu gradually starts to develop into a better person notably becoming braver and more determined to protect the real world that she gradually starts to appreciate and admire and her friends.  While still being indecisive at times Hikayu by the end of the show can readily admit that she has this weakness and finds the motivation to overcome this by believing in their just cause and fighting to protect this world and her friends and allies from harm. This understanding of her main weakness also resulted in Hikayu understanding that sometimes you need to make a clear decision no matter what feelings you have towards it advice of which was useful to Selesia in her moment of crisis.Hikayu’s trademarked personality trait is of course her kind and understanding nature which grants her an intimate understanding of the kind of feelings that other people are feeling at times. When Combined with her emotional side that comes from her origin as a dating sim character Hikayu becomes one of the team’s best speakers as she can understand what the other side is feeling beneath their words. Additionally, with this she is also very adept at motivating other people and inspiring them.  Because of her personality Hikayu is someone that hates people that manipulate other people’s feelings as well as those that laugh at what others hold dear to them. As a result, within the story the enemy that she hates the most is Altair because such things are part of her nature. In the show, this translates into several fierce battles between the two near the closing parts of the show that do a good job of showing how much Hikayu has evolved as a character and how motivated she is in trying to stop Altair’s plan. Initially as a result of being a character from a dating sim Hikayu had no combat ability whatsoever but after some creative ideas from his creator Hikayu eventually become a rather capable fighter in her own right as she donned a rather interesting outfit and wielded a tonfa as her arms of choice. The fact that she donned such gear and actively participated in the closing battles was indicative of the motivation that she had to both protect this world and her allies from harm. In this mode of hers Hikayu become a surprisingly powerful combatant and watching her fight on par with combat oriented allies like Selesia and Yuya was really a sight to see. As a character, I felt that Hikayu was a very well-designed character that showed that even impossible things can be done if you have the motivation to do it. Hikayu’s evolution from a meek and innocent schoolgirl to one that was brave and motivated enough to stand on the field of battle was excellently done and I felt that Shiina Natsukawa really did an amazing job at facing her.HimegimiHimegimi No Gunpuku better known to the world as Altair who is played by veteran seiyuu singer Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Black bullet fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main villain for it. A creation that came into this world in a rather unusual way Altair is someone that is not easy to figure out which is probably her most prominent trait. Personality wise Altair is a manipulative, cunning and smart person that while also retaining powerful combat abilities also has an intelligence in her that borders on that of a genius such is her ability to out-think her opponents and think ahead of them. Facing Altair in a battle of minds is like fighting against several chess grand masters combined into one such is her intelligence. While powerful in both combat and adapt at enacting her plans Altair has shown to be possessing of a lot of self-confidence and she makes great use of this to both motivate and direct her teams anger towards her opponents. As the series progresses Altair as both as a villain and a character becomes more and more powerful and smart and is able to use a combination of her might and intelligence to dominate her opponents whether in combat or in frustrating their plans to defeat her. What sets apart Altair from the other creations that’s on the show is the fact that she does not belong to a specific story due to the unique origin story that she has. Combine this with her intimate understanding of how this real world works and she is easily able to improve herself by getting people that accept her. This aspect of her I felt was interesting as it ensured that the fight between her and Selesia’s team will be both a contest of strength and a contest of brainpower a contrast that I felt was appropriate to her character and highlighted the fact that she was no normal opponent that we see in other anime.Apart from her intelligence and her powerful combat abilities Altair’s other prominent trait is her motivation for acting as the villain in the story. As revealed in the series Altair’s origin story was rather unique and really made it to clear to the audience why she actually hated the real world enough in that she would enact such a drastic plan as her main goal. In this while I still believe that Altair was still a villain in her own right I believe that the term of a tragic villain is perhaps a more appropriate term that can be used to describe her. The combination of feeling lonely due to the lack of a creator and the desire to exact revenge for them by hating and destroying the world that caused their death I felt was a strong motivation that I felt was well suited to her character. As a villain, I felt that Altair was very well designed that combined the best elements of a smart and fast thinking villain with the high combat abilities of a fighter. This combination I felt really made her a more challenging foe that really made the fight between her and Selesia’s team much more enjoyable as their fight was more than a mere battle of strength but also a battle that involved deep plans and strategy. I felt that Aki Toyosaki really did a fantastic job at portraying the character of Altair and indeed this is one role that I felt is a stand out one for her as well.AlicetariaAlicetaria February played by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa of No game no life and Trinity seven fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as Selesia and Meteora’s main enemies in the series. A warrior princess and knight that comes from both a manga and some anime adaptation Alice emphases the very image of what a warrior that existed in a grim and fatalistic world where war was constant would look like. As can be expected of a warrior that lived in a world that was whacked by constant war whether with fellow humans or with dangerous beasts Alice’s initial personality was resolute, determined and cautious and was also rather brash in both her actions and her words. In the beginning Alice like many other creations that fought in the war between Altair and Selesia displayed a desire to return to the world that they came from as they wanted to be there with their people but as the series went on she largely as a result of Mamika’s influence grew to appreciate the real world and liked it more than she did initially. As the series goes on Alice’s personality gradually changes for the better. In the beginning as noted Alicetaria was a very rigid person that was quiet and did not interact well with others. These traits also made her rather hard to approach as well. Thanks largely to Mamika a fellow creation that was on the same side that she was that Alice’s personality gradually softened and become kinder and gradually grew to appreciate this world. In fact, the friendship between the two a magical girl from a kid’s anime and a knight from a dark fantasy manga and anime was so unlikely that I was surprised at how effective it turned out to be. The friendship between Mamika and Alicetalia was something that I thought was excellently done and it can be seen that it was something that Alice valued greatly. As a result, it’s easy to see what her reaction will be when her best friend was killed in the battles between the two sides.Beneath the hard steely exterior that Alice created to protect herself in her world Alice is a surprisingly humble person that doesn’t like rewards and prefers instead to just get things done. However, the one thing that Alice truly hates is being underestimated which stems from her pride as both a warrior and a princess. As expected of a warrior and a knight Alicetalia is someone that values honor and the opinions of others and prefers to be able to trust the people that she is fighting alongside with. Though honor bound Alicetaria has shown to have an intense hatred or dislike of evil doers like Magane which can sometimes cause her to lose her trademarked calmness which was surprising. As a character, I felt that Alice was pretty well designed and that if fate had instead let her be found by Selesia rather than Altair she would have been an excellent ally in the end. The gradual evolution of Alice from a cold, steely and quiet person to a more kinder and more understanding person I though was done pretty well. Though I been a fan of Yoko Hikasa for some time I felt that this role of Alicetaria was definitely one of her best roles to date.MamikaMamika Kirameki voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Murakawa of Brave witches and Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and served as Selesia and Meteora’s enemies in the series. A creation from a magical girl anime Mamika as a result of her origin story is a creation of the magical girl type of character. In terms of personality Mamika emphasises the best qualities of a magical girl being a cheerful, kind and positive person that tries her best to help people. Like other creations Mamika was initially very shocked that she was torn from her own world and deposited into the real world but was among the creations that got over this fact relatively fast. Initially Mamika as expected of a magical girl was reluctant to engage in combat with others and instead preferred diplomacy more than anything else. However, despite this when push comes to shove Mamika was shown to have impressive offensive and defensive capabilities which is helped by the fact that abilities in the real world are far more powerful than in their own. As the series goes on Mamika’s personality gradually changes becoming braver and more willing to stop conflict between people so as to promote diplomacy a trait that I particularly admired. A prominent trait of Mamika’s that she shares with Hikayu is her ability to see and understand a person’s inner thoughts and from there determine whether they are a good person or not. From what can be seen of Mamika in these instances she seems to care more about an individual’s own values and personality rather than the power and ability that they actually have. Over the course of the series Mamika due to her positive and cheerful nature is able to befriend several people from both sides notably Alicetaria and Souta. Her relationship and friendship with Alicetaria in particular I felt was really well done and was heartwarming in the fact that she managed to change Alice’s cold steely self to one that was as close to being a human as Alice can be.Mamika’s eventual loss in the series though I felt was really done though also extremely sad as well to both the target audience and to the characters in the show that know her as well. Her desire to discover the truth and her determination to end the threat posed by Altair was admirable as was her attempt to heal Altair’s broken heart. The consequences of her loss as well as the aftereffects that this had on the various characters on the show whether they were creations or humans was also another thing that was handled quite well. Overall, I felt that Rie Murakawa actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Mamika.BlitzBlitz Talker voiced by veteran voice actor Atsuchi Ono is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia’s and Meteora’s main enemies in the series. A creation that stems from a cyberpunk manga and anime Blitz is somewhat different to the other creations that fight in this war as he isn’t actually a main character in his origin story and is rather a secondary character. Despite that I feel that this in no way makes him less interesting than the others. An ex detective that works as a bounty hunter in his origin story that sees him hunt down dangerous enemies that the normal police are unable to handle a job that can be considered to be akin to bounty hunting. A quiet, wise and logical person Blitz is someone that prefers to do things on his own terms and not on other people’s terms which is reflected in how he handles himself in battle and out of it.  As a result of his experience of combat in his world Blitz is well versed in combat and fights with a powerful resolver and a number of special gear that he came up with that proves effective in this world as it does in his world. In combat Blitz’s personality notably changes in that while still remaining aloof he becomes much more determined and ruthless and will use any means necessary to win battles.A notable trait of Blitz is his relationship with Altair. Unlike other creations that were summoned by her for this war Blitz is someone that was rather loyal to her from the beginning something that Altair had already noticed. The reason for doing so in this case was a result of rather tragic backstory that caused him to become a bounty hunter in his story in the first place. I felt that this almost familial relationship between the two was interesting but it also acted as their biggest weakness that was exploited near the end of the series.  As a both a wise person and a capable combatant in his own right Blitz proved to be a powerful opponent for Selesia and her team to handle and indeed the only person that was capable of fighting him evenly was Yuya. Over the course of the series the two exchanged blows countless times and I really liked the battles between the two as it was like a contest between young and old warriors. Blitz I felt was an interesting character though I felt he was a bit underused in the series.MaganeMagane voiced by veteran seiyuu Maaya Sakamoto of Mobile suit gundam seed Destiny and Naruto fame is one of the main enemies that Selesia and Meteora face in the series. A powerful magic user that disguises herself as an energetic school girl that has a personality that revolves around lies Magane is one of the most unique characters that appear in this show. Unlike the rest of the creations that appear in this show who are either main characters or secondary ones Magane is actually the main villain for her own origin story. Though a powerful magic user as stated previously Magane is someone that prefers to use deception to achieve her goals rather than brute force however she is more than capable of fighting toe to toe with the most powerful of creations as shown in her fight against the combat oriented Yuya. Personality wise Magane is sadistic, brutal and deceptive and has all the traits that make up the trickster character type. Indeed, Magane’s personality is such that she prefers to watch things happen from a distance while using her lies to misdirect others and cause havoc. Despite having the traits of a villain, it was quite surprising to see that she took no one’s side during the conflict between the two sides which is a result of her methodology. Apparently, there’s a method to even her madness. Unlike most villains that we see in other forms of media Magane is no ego, no negative feelings and nothing that she wants to achieve with her own powers and instead all she seems to want to do is cause havoc and have fun while she’s at it. The closest comparison to her character will probably be Joker from Dc comics Batman universe. However, while unaligned in the larger scheme of things Magane is someone that does help people that she feels has earned her respect and in this we should be grateful that she did when the time came.Of Magane’s character her ability was actually an interesting one and one that was quite appropriate to her character in that it created something that people didn’t believe existed in the first place which I felt was pretty scary. Overall the character of Magane I felt was well designed and served as an interesting villain for Souta and Yuya. I felt that Maaya Sakamoto really did a great job portraying her.SetsunaSetsuna Shimazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi of Masamune Kun’s revenge fame is one of the main support characters of the show and though more of a guest character than anything actually had a pretty large presence and impact starting from the mid part of the series. An old friend of Souta’s that he connected with prior to the events of the show itself in a way Setsuna was very similar to Souta both in terms of personality and interests. Setsuna was a kind, caring and honest person that like Souta was a bit on the quiet side and as a result had trouble in making friends. Despite being quiet Setsuna is by no means unapproachable and indeed when one gets to know her well enough one can see that she is a kind person that can also be funny at times. Because both Souta and Setsuna shared similar personality traits and were both interested in popular media like anime and manga the two of them quickly become fast friends on their first meeting and grew to rely on each other in a society that they felt was hard to get used to.  While Souta can be said to be adapt at creating and writing worlds where his stories can take place in Setsuna was shown to be a very capable manga artist which I found to be surprising for a high school girl.The friendship between Setsuna and Souta I felt was interesting and well designed and did a great job of showing why Souta’s personality was like that when he and Selesia first met later. The tragic fate that befallen Setsuna I felt was really sad and given the depth of the bond and friendship that Souta had forged with her it can be seen rather easily why it affected him so greatly. However, while Setsuna herself was more of a guest role than anything the impact that she had on the overall story cannot be underestimated and though the events that surrounded her fate provided great pain and trauma to Souta’s psyche she also provided a source of great strength when he got over the role that he played in her death. The romance between the two that while shown only briefly was very real and it can be seen that both she and Souta really loved each other as they were very similar in terms of personality and interests and I felt that it was sad that in the end they were not allowed to be together as a couple. Though featured only briefly in the beginning Setsuna noticeably had a much larger role as the series went on and in the end had a very large impact on the story which I thought was surprising. In the end, I thought that Setsuna as a character was very well designed and her link with both Souta and Altair was excellently done. Her parting words to Souta near the end of the series I felt was really sweet and heartwarming and that scene was one of the most emotional scenes I seen in an anime even for one that has a lot of such good scenes. Ayaka Ohashi I felt really did a fantastic job in portraying the character of Setsuna and her gradual rise in rank from a guest star to a full support character I felt was something that I appreciated.Arts and animationThe arts and animation for the series I felt was really done with the character designs for each of the characters being especially well designed and varied. Each of the outfits and armor that the characters wore I felt were unique and matched well with their personalities and roles in their respective stories. The animation for the series I felt was pretty crisp and sharp and was really clear as well as we are able to see each action that was took by the characters easily. As an anime that featured a large-scale battle between creations that took place in the real world it was important that they got the combat scenes right and made them look cool and in this I felt that they managed to succeed magnificently as each of the fight scenes and battles were excellently paced, designed and detailed and the scale of these were truly amazing. One other aspect of these fight scenes was how unpredictable that they can become which is nice since you really don’t know what will happen in it and who will be the victor here. The settings that are shown in the show while obviously staying within the confines of modern day Japan also showed a large number of variations in the terrains that it made use of and I felt that these looked really gorgeous and beautiful.MusicApart from the excellent story and fights Re Creators also has as one of its main strong points an excellent use of music both in terms of opening and ending themes and scene music. The first opening theme for the anime was gravity well which was sung by Tielle & Gemie with the music behind them arranged by renowned composer Hiroyuki Sawano.  The second opening theme was sh0ut also composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and sung by Tielle & Gemie. Both opening themes I felt was really well done and helped provoke a sense of excitement and anticipation for the series. The series made use of a total of three ending themes for the series though of this one was unique to one episode. The first ending theme was Newlook that was sung by veteran singer Ayano Mashiro that I felt was a great song while the second was world Etude that was sung by Altair’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Aki Tokyosaki. The last ending theme that was used in the show was Rubikon that was sung by Sangatsu no Phantasia. This last ending theme I felt was notable as it conveyed a sense of ending to the episodes which is helped by the visuals that it uses as it shows each of the creations in the midst of being created thus illustrating the fact that they are not from the real world and exist in their own myriad of worlds. With this ending theme, I also thought that each of the characters and their poses actually looked pretty cute as they were being created by their creators. Apart from the strong opening and ending themes Re Creators I noted also had a very strong and a large amount of scene music that I felt was really well designed and used very well within the series. In particular the scene music that they use for the battles and the ones that they use for tense situations as well as revelations were especially well designed in my opinion.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series whether for the main cast or the support cast I felt was really excellent which was helped by the fact that the voice cast featured a large number of veteran seiyuu’s and voice actors that have already proven themselves in the field. In particular though I know a great deal of the seiyuu’s and voice actors featured here having seen many of their performances in other works I felt that a great many of them really outdone themselves here and really pulled off a performance that I feel would shine in their careers. In this regard, I believe that the best ones here will be Mikako Komatsu who portrayed the character of Selesia, Inori Minase who portrayed the character of Meteora, Sora Amamiya who portrayed the character of Rui, Shiina Natsukawa who portrayed the character of Hikayu, Yoko Hikasa who portrayed the character of Alicetalia and finally Aki Toyosaki who portrayed the character of Altair. Lastly though only a support role I felt that Ayaka Ohashi really did an impressive job portraying the character of Setsuna and added a lot of emotion and weight to her character with her portrayal of her.  Excellent voice acting is one of the elements that all animes should have as one of its base requirements and in this I felt that this was achieved spectacularly as each seiyuu and voice actor portrayed their characters to perfection.Overall conclusionIn overall the strongest points for Re creators was its Interesting premise, excellent story, excellent characters, voice acting and music and well-designed fight scenes and beautiful environments that all combined to make this anime one of the strongest ones I seen for some time.The overall premise for the series which was the fact that creations that were created by popular media can suddenly turn up in the real world and battle each other was a premise that had long been a staple of many authors and I was glad that such a simple premise would turn out to be such a good one for the anime. Anyone that reads or watches any of the popular media such as light novels, manga and anime would have characters that they actually adore and admire and taking this simple reason and building a story around it I felt was a really smart move. The premise itself was also made a part of the overall plot with the addition of the audience and acceptance factor which meant that the more the audience sympathize with the creations the stronger they will get something that I agree with as characters will get popular the more people see them and agree with their stories. When used in conjunction with the fact that characters can get more powerful equipment and abilities this really made the premise a bit of a game changer in the story. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty well designed with Altair being one of the best villains I ever seen. Unlike other villains that we see elsewhere Altair was dangerous because apart from being strong in martial might she was also supremely intelligent and able to think several steps ahead which made her a very challenging villain. The fact that her motivation for doing so was so strong also made her more dangerous as well. Of course, Altair was not the whole story as watching each of the creations learn about this world and each other and learn to fight as a team was also part of it as well and in this I loved seeing the comradeship that formed between the creations who despite not meeting each other before were able to find common ground and understanding and work together to fight a common foe. A part of this process was of course the meeting between the creation and creator and it was interesting in seeing the reactions of both here. The gradual bond between the two I felt was done pretty well with the best example being the one between Selesia and her creator Matsubara.One of the most interesting aspects of the story was the combination of all the various branches of the popular media which in this case includes Manga, Anime and Light novels and their respective studios and publishers and having them create a stage for the final battle.  In this I felt that the planning for the final battle was done well and it was impressive in seeing so many different fields working together for one common goal. The final battle for this series though was really something and was extremely impressive to see as it demonstrated not just all the developments that the creations have gone through as the series progressed but also the same in their creators as well. Watching them stake their life on this one last battle was really awe inspiring. Modern animes usually have a lot of trouble in managing to end an anime series successfully by tying up all the loose plot threads and giving a fate to the main characters after the dust has settled from the final battle.  But in this I felt that the studio really put a lot of thought into the ending for both the creations and the creators and I was glad that in the end that they both had an ending that made sense to the audience.  This anime I felt was one of the strongest ones I seen for a long time and is easily a 10/10 in my books. this case Re Creators is definitely one of the best animes of this season.The premise for Re Creators is a rather simple one but in simplicity it has one of its greatest strengths. The overall premise for Re Creators is a simple question of what happens when your favourite characters from your favourite media be it Anime, Light Novels, Manga or Games are suddenly brought to the real world and you come face to face with them.  What happens when these characters which are called creations in this show come to the real world from their often war torn or depressing worlds to one that looks to be the realms of god. Now what’s more is that you also get to fight alongside them against a threat to both this real world and their worlds. The concept of wanting to meet your favourite characters from your favourite Manga is one that resonates well with many people especially those that have been long terms fans of such series. Indeed the reason why Re Creators is one of my most favourite anime’s from last season is also because I loved the concept of this simple but unique premise.The overall story for Re Creators is set in modern day Japan and follows quite a large cast of characters as they try to make sense of what brought characters from fictional media to the modern world while also trying to understand the threat that the main villain poses to it as well. Souta Mizushiro is a young high school student and the very picture of a modern day Japanese teenager. An aspiring creator with his ultimate goal of wanting to write a light novel of his own Souta is one day suddenly dragged into the world of one of his favourite anime’s and comes face to face with one of his favourite characters Selesia when she was engaged in combat with a mysterious new girl that has many mysterious powers. After the end of that battle and being sent back to his room Souta dismisses it as merely a dream but stops when he sees Selesia standing in front of him with her sword at his neck. After meeting with other creations like Selesia and creators like him and being made aware of what that mysterious girl is trying to achieve Souta finds his life has suddenly become more excited and dangerous than he ever thought possible as he finds himself working with characters that he knows from novels, manga’s and games and their creators and the government as they try to prevent the destruction of the world that they live in.SelestiaSelesia Upitiria voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Mikako Komatsu of Aldnoah Zero and Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series. A creation that comes from the mecha light novel Elemental Symphony Selesia was one of the first creations that Souta met in the series. A powerful swordswoman that also pilots a rather small mecha Selesia is a strong willed and honourable person and fights with hard to protect both her friends, allies and innocents that are caught in the crossfire. Indeed, Selesia’s is very much like that of the ancient knights and the samurai as Selesia also lives by a code of her own that she uses when in combat to base her decisions on. As benefit of such warrior types Selesia hates the thought of harming civilians and will actively try to protect them from harm if they are caught in the crossfire.  In combat Selesia is a very capable combatant being a swordswoman of unparalleled skill and is able to fight against the best of her opponents pretty well. Due to her skill in combat as well as her experience in unit tactics Selesia often acts as the battle leader and it is shown that she has a good grasp of tactics.  While Selesia is brave she isn’t by any means stupid or foolish and has little pride or ego that gets in her way which puts her in good stead as she can be relied upon to always keep in mind the larger picture. Outside of battle Selesia has a rather interesting comedic side to her personality which I felt was pretty funny and helped offset the seriousness of her personality when she’s in battle.In addition to her honor and her skill at quick thinking Selesia’s other prominent trait is that she always strives to put the needs of her friends and allies before herself which I found to be a trait that was well suited for her. Though Selesia and Souta did not have the best of first encounters it can be seen that the two of them become rather good friends as they fought alongside one another against Altair and her team. Indeed, it can be said that Selesia also played a large role in helping Souta become more braver and instill some conviction into him for his dreams. Selesia’s relationship with and her bonds with the other creations on her team was another of the focuses for her character and watching her gradually learn to accept the others and learn to work together was something that I though was done really well. By the end of the series it can be seen that Selesia had managed to bond with and forge friendships with everyone on her team and also with their creators and support staff as well which is a result of her kind and caring nature towards her friends. Overall, I thought that the character of Selesia was very well designed and that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did an excellent job portraying her. Though I only seen Mikako in one other main role to date I believe that in her portrayal of Selesia is her standout role to me and I will be interested to see where she goes from here.MeteoraMeteora Osterreich voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon fame is one of the main characters of the show. A creation that originates from a well-known RPG video game rather than from a manga or an anime Meteora serves as a great contrast to the first character that was introduced in the series which was Selesia. In appearance Meteora resembles the traditional sage character type that commonly appears in media that make use of fantasy themes as their main theme and true to her appearance Meteora is both a powerful mage and an intelligent person that loves to learn and gather knowledge. Personality wise Meteora is a quiet, smart and calm person that is also extremely perceptive and always has an interesting insight that she can offer to the group. While quiet Meteora’s perception skills are such that she is easily able to tell if something is bothering someone and will try to help them with their problem the best that she can. True to her role as a sage and also because of her intelligence Meteora is considered by many to be the smartest among the group and in this capacity, she acts as the team’s strategist as she works to unravel the enemies plan.  This is a role that I felt was really appropriate for her. True to her personality Meteora is someone that prefers to have arguments that use knowledge and logic to counter the enemies plans and indeed she seems to prefer this than engaging in combat. Unlike Selesia who has trouble in trusting people due to past actions Meteora is someone that can take the long view and always looks at the larger picture before making any decision on whether to do something such as trusting people that were their enemies before.Despite this Meteora is not someone that gets tied to a single plan and she is flexible enough with her planning to allow for new situations to happen and is able to adapt to these relatively well. Despite this Meteora can still be surprised if events are drastic enough on the field.  Due in part to her sage role Meteora is not as combat oriented as characters like Selesia or Rui but that does not mean that she is completely useless in battle as she can hold up reasonably well against enemies. One aspect of Meteora that I particularly liked was her spells which I felt was really well designed particularly their incarnations as they are being activated.  As a character Meteora was smart, kind and fast thinking and while not as capable in combat as the other members of her team she made up for it by her strategic mind and ability to out think her opponents. I been a fan of Meteora’s seiyuu Inori Minase since I saw her performance in Re Zero as Rem and I have to say that her performance as Meteora easily exceeds even that beloved role. She really did a fantastic job here. One of the funniest traits about Meteora that was more prevalent early on was how much she loved to eat which is something that I found to be pretty amusing.SoutaSouta Mizushino played by veteran voice actor Daiki Yamashita of Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student that lives in Japan Souta is someone that can be described as an average teenager that tries to live his life as best as he can without drawing attention to himself. A quiet, good natured and intelligent person that common to teenagers of his age reads manga, LN’s and watches anime Souta differs somewhat from this as he aspires to become an author and indeed seems to be in the midst of creating his own work. Before the start of the series Souta read and watched as lot of the media that was popular in Japan and as such he is familiar with much of them. As a result, each of the creations that turns up in the series is someone that he knows or is familiar with. In the beginning of the series Souta was inadvertently dragged into the fight between Selesia and a mysterious girl as he watching an episode of the anime where Selesia was from. Though initially reluctant to get involved Souta due to both his responsible nature and his curiousness about the mysterious girl soon took on a more central role in the fight between the two sides.Initially Souta while kind, honest and caring acted more as a support role for the other characters and did not really stand out much in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Souta’s secret shame plus his good nature was often used against him. However, as the series progresses Souta’s personality changes and while he retains his trademarked traits of being kind and honest Souta rids himself of his main weakness of being weak to pressure and also manages to gain more self-confidence as a result of being able to work with fellow creators which is the term used to refer to people that creates things in the real world most notably Marine and Selesia’s creator Matsubara. Souta’s secret shame which forms part of his character development I felt was pretty interesting and tragic at the same time. Throughout the series it can be seen that Souta was tormented greatly by the events that caused this shame and his part in it and I was glad that in the end he was able to tell the others about it and from there find strength from the advice that was given by the others. A prominent trait of Souta’s that stems from the fact that he reads and views so many forms of media is the unique view that he has regarding them in that he sees the worlds that are in them as the same as the real world and not fake ones are some people view them and believes that the real world can get a lot of ideas from them. Because of this view Souta is someone that can easily relate to what creations do and think which has often proved useful to Meteora when she’s forming her plans to stop the enemy. The character of Souta I felt was an interesting character and represented your everyday teenager which in the real world is your average audience for the forms of media that is represented in this series. While Souta may have been weak at first glance when compared to characters like Selesia I felt that the development of him was done reasonably well and by the end of the series I was glad that he become a much better person. The secret shame of his that relates to Altair’s creator Setsuna I thought was interesting but also equally sad and tragic. This personal reason for his behavior I thought was a good move and his admittance of this shame to his allies and friends was one scene that was well done as it took a lot of bravery and courage to be able to speak out.  When compared to the creations as a mere human Souta can never be equal to them but I think that in terms of bravery and a determination to atone himself Souta is easily a match for them there.Kanoya RuiRui Kanoya played by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Souta and Meteora’s allies in their struggle against Altair. A creation that originates from a mecha anime that seems to have a rather grim and depressing setting as it makes use of child soldiers like Rui who engage in combat to protect his city from enemy invaders. As bereft of a hero that originates from a mecha anime Rui’s main weapon and armor is his mecha which is called Gigas Machina which is a mecha that is about the size of a mid-sized city block and comparable in size if not firepower to the gundams of the well-known gundam series. Personality wise Rui is a quiet, honest and understanding person and displays a certain amount of pride for himself and his Gigas machina. As a result of his origin story where even as a child soldier Rui is constantly being deployed to the frontlines to defend the city against enemy forces Rui has a tendency of throwing tantrums when being ordered. Indeed, in the beginning of the series after he met up with Selesia and her team Rui displayed a lot of reluctance in needing to engage in combat again in this new world that he has found himself in despite the best attempts of Selesia to persuade him. As the series goes on however and Rui begins to understand the gravity of the threat that is facing this world and his world Rui eventually begins to change becoming more understanding of other people’s feelings and more liable to think of the actions that he has took and the consequences of these actions.Despite an awkward first meeting with Selesia and co Rui eventually forms lasting friendships and bonds with her and her team after seeing how hard they fight to prevent Altair from enacting her plan and becomes very loyal to both the team and their efforts to stop Altair. In particular Rui’s relationship with Selesia was rather significant as before meeting her Rui never really considered himself to be a hero and rather considered himself more of a soldier than anything. However, fighting alongside Selesia and the others against Altair in an effort to protect this world allowed Rui to eventually realize that he too is also a hero in his own right as well. Like the other characters in the show Rui has a number of prominent character traits that make define him. Like Meteora Rui loves to eat and probably more so than Meteora which considering his background is something that I think is perfectly understandable. Rui also has a rather interesting way of dealing with stress and worries and does this by powering up into the sky in his mecha at high speed and letting the speed worry you instead. This type of stress relief I felt was interesting and related to a mecha based character like Rui perfectly.  As a character, I felt Rui was an interesting character that goes on to prove that every person can be a hero if they decide to devote themselves to achieve a noble goal and that hero’s do not need to be knights or mages and can be anyone that can fight with conviction. Rui’s gradual change from someone that was reluctant to fight for an unknown world to someone that was willing to stake every inch of his life and skill to protect it I thought was excellently done. I been a fan of Sora for quite some time and while Rui herself was not as excellent as her standout roles such as Princess Asseylum in Aldnoah Zero I thought that she still managed to pull off an impressive performance portraying Rui.YuyaYuya Mirokuji played by veteran voice actor Kenichi Suzumura of Gundam seed destiny and Naruto shippuuden fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia and Meteora’s allies in their fight against Altair. A fierce swordsman from a well-known action manga Yuya serves as a great contrast to honorable warriors like Selesia and knights like Alicetalia in that Yuya’s attitude and mentality is more akin to a mercenary than anything. In the beginning of the series and when Selesia and co encounter him Yuya was a brash and aggressive person that seemed to have a love of combat and will not hesitate to fight children if he needs to if it meant that he can fight strong foes. However, as the series progresses Yuya’s personality eventually starts to evolve as he begins to understand the plans that Altair plans to enact on the world. While still retaining his brash and somewhat aggressive nature Yuya begins to exhibit more restraint to his aggression and begins to understand when it is time to fight and when it’s time to talk. Although still surprised at what the real world was like out of the creations Yuya was perhaps the one that adapted the fastest to living in this world. Though Yuya was indifferent to the world at first Yuya’s eventual friendship with Selesia and her team had a profound impact on him as he could find allies that shared his ideas and a cause that they all agreed was worthy to protect. This eventually made him one of the team’s strongest assets on the field.Throughout the series Yuya was shown to be someone that enjoyed fighting powerful foes with the more powerful ones being the worthiest ones in his eyes. Indeed, being able to fight against worthy foes with all of his might is perhaps Yuya’s main reason for his existence as a character. In the show, this is best shown in his fights with Blitz and in his brief fight with Sho. As a warrior Yuya is someone that dislikes trickery and magic of any kind however he is not stupid enough to deny that magic itself can be a powerful force on the field. As a result of his dislike of trickery Yuya and Magane have a mutual dislike of each other that I found quite funny. Despite being a mercenary that has somewhat villainous traits Yuya himself has a sense of honor that he tries to adhere to whenever possible which was really surprising to see. On the outside Yuya due to his brash nature can be difficult to know well but once you do he is shown to be a very loyal person if he too believes in the cause. As a combatant Yuya is very similar to Selesia in that he is a swordsman that fights with a bokken that he uses with unmatched skill and can call upon a spirit of sorts to aid him as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuya in my opinion was second best in terms of close combat in the team. As a character, I felt that Yuya was an interesting character that shows that despite being brash and aggressive on the surface people can still change and surprise you in different ways. The gradual change from an overly aggressive and brash swordsman that we see in the beginning to one that learned to show restraint and yet remain committed to a cause that he considers worthy was one that I thought was done well. I also liked the fact that by the latter half Yuya learned that sometimes negotiation with others can also win battles quicker than mere strength of arms. One prominent trait of Yuya’s is his rather funny habit of assigning nicknames to his allies some of which can be quite entertaining such as the one that he gave Meteora. Overall, I thought that Kenichi Suzumura really did a great job portraying the character of Yuya in this show.HikayuHikayu Hoshikawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Shiina Natsukawa of High school fleet and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Selesia and Meteora’s main allies in their fight against Altair. A rather unique creation among the other creations that’s on the show Hikayu is actually a character from a video game rather than say an anime or manga. While characters from video games are not unusual in this regard as Meteora too is from one the uniqueness here is that she’s actually from a dating sim and as such initially she had no combat ability whatsoever. Personality wise Hikayu initially upon arrival in the real world was rather shy and sensitive to others feelings and was rather indecisive in the actions that she should be taking. However, as the series goes on Hikayu gradually starts to develop into a better person notably becoming braver and more determined to protect the real world that she gradually starts to appreciate and admire and her friends.  While still being indecisive at times Hikayu by the end of the show can readily admit that she has this weakness and finds the motivation to overcome this by believing in their just cause and fighting to protect this world and her friends and allies from harm. This understanding of her main weakness also resulted in Hikayu understanding that sometimes you need to make a clear decision no matter what feelings you have towards it advice of which was useful to Selesia in her moment of crisis.Hikayu’s trademarked personality trait is of course her kind and understanding nature which grants her an intimate understanding of the kind of feelings that other people are feeling at times. When Combined with her emotional side that comes from her origin as a dating sim character Hikayu becomes one of the team’s best speakers as she can understand what the other side is feeling beneath their words. Additionally, with this she is also very adept at motivating other people and inspiring them.  Because of her personality Hikayu is someone that hates people that manipulate other people’s feelings as well as those that laugh at what others hold dear to them. As a result, within the story the enemy that she hates the most is Altair because such things are part of her nature. In the show, this translates into several fierce battles between the two near the closing parts of the show that do a good job of showing how much Hikayu has evolved as a character and how motivated she is in trying to stop Altair’s plan. Initially as a result of being a character from a dating sim Hikayu had no combat ability whatsoever but after some creative ideas from his creator Hikayu eventually become a rather capable fighter in her own right as she donned a rather interesting outfit and wielded a tonfa as her arms of choice. The fact that she donned such gear and actively participated in the closing battles was indicative of the motivation that she had to both protect this world and her allies from harm. In this mode of hers Hikayu become a surprisingly powerful combatant and watching her fight on par with combat oriented allies like Selesia and Yuya was really a sight to see. As a character, I felt that Hikayu was a very well-designed character that showed that even impossible things can be done if you have the motivation to do it. Hikayu’s evolution from a meek and innocent schoolgirl to one that was brave and motivated enough to stand on the field of battle was excellently done and I felt that Shiina Natsukawa really did an amazing job at facing her.HimegimiHimegimi No Gunpuku better known to the world as Altair who is played by veteran seiyuu singer Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Black bullet fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main villain for it. A creation that came into this world in a rather unusual way Altair is someone that is not easy to figure out which is probably her most prominent trait. Personality wise Altair is a manipulative, cunning and smart person that while also retaining powerful combat abilities also has an intelligence in her that borders on that of a genius such is her ability to out-think her opponents and think ahead of them. Facing Altair in a battle of minds is like fighting against several chess grand masters combined into one such is her intelligence. While powerful in both combat and adapt at enacting her plans Altair has shown to be possessing of a lot of self-confidence and she makes great use of this to both motivate and direct her teams anger towards her opponents. As the series progresses Altair as both as a villain and a character becomes more and more powerful and smart and is able to use a combination of her might and intelligence to dominate her opponents whether in combat or in frustrating their plans to defeat her. What sets apart Altair from the other creations that’s on the show is the fact that she does not belong to a specific story due to the unique origin story that she has. Combine this with her intimate understanding of how this real world works and she is easily able to improve herself by getting people that accept her. This aspect of her I felt was interesting as it ensured that the fight between her and Selesia’s team will be both a contest of strength and a contest of brainpower a contrast that I felt was appropriate to her character and highlighted the fact that she was no normal opponent that we see in other anime.Apart from her intelligence and her powerful combat abilities Altair’s other prominent trait is her motivation for acting as the villain in the story. As revealed in the series Altair’s origin story was rather unique and really made it to clear to the audience why she actually hated the real world enough in that she would enact such a drastic plan as her main goal. In this while I still believe that Altair was still a villain in her own right I believe that the term of a tragic villain is perhaps a more appropriate term that can be used to describe her. The combination of feeling lonely due to the lack of a creator and the desire to exact revenge for them by hating and destroying the world that caused their death I felt was a strong motivation that I felt was well suited to her character. As a villain, I felt that Altair was very well designed that combined the best elements of a smart and fast thinking villain with the high combat abilities of a fighter. This combination I felt really made her a more challenging foe that really made the fight between her and Selesia’s team much more enjoyable as their fight was more than a mere battle of strength but also a battle that involved deep plans and strategy. I felt that Aki Toyosaki really did a fantastic job at portraying the character of Altair and indeed this is one role that I felt is a stand out one for her as well.AlicetariaAlicetaria February played by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa of No game no life and Trinity seven fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as Selesia and Meteora’s main enemies in the series. A warrior princess and knight that comes from both a manga and some anime adaptation Alice emphases the very image of what a warrior that existed in a grim and fatalistic world where war was constant would look like. As can be expected of a warrior that lived in a world that was whacked by constant war whether with fellow humans or with dangerous beasts Alice’s initial personality was resolute, determined and cautious and was also rather brash in both her actions and her words. In the beginning Alice like many other creations that fought in the war between Altair and Selesia displayed a desire to return to the world that they came from as they wanted to be there with their people but as the series went on she largely as a result of Mamika’s influence grew to appreciate the real world and liked it more than she did initially. As the series goes on Alice’s personality gradually changes for the better. In the beginning as noted Alicetaria was a very rigid person that was quiet and did not interact well with others. These traits also made her rather hard to approach as well. Thanks largely to Mamika a fellow creation that was on the same side that she was that Alice’s personality gradually softened and become kinder and gradually grew to appreciate this world. In fact, the friendship between the two a magical girl from a kid’s anime and a knight from a dark fantasy manga and anime was so unlikely that I was surprised at how effective it turned out to be. The friendship between Mamika and Alicetalia was something that I thought was excellently done and it can be seen that it was something that Alice valued greatly. As a result, it’s easy to see what her reaction will be when her best friend was killed in the battles between the two sides.Beneath the hard steely exterior that Alice created to protect herself in her world Alice is a surprisingly humble person that doesn’t like rewards and prefers instead to just get things done. However, the one thing that Alice truly hates is being underestimated which stems from her pride as both a warrior and a princess. As expected of a warrior and a knight Alicetalia is someone that values honor and the opinions of others and prefers to be able to trust the people that she is fighting alongside with. Though honor bound Alicetaria has shown to have an intense hatred or dislike of evil doers like Magane which can sometimes cause her to lose her trademarked calmness which was surprising. As a character, I felt that Alice was pretty well designed and that if fate had instead let her be found by Selesia rather than Altair she would have been an excellent ally in the end. The gradual evolution of Alice from a cold, steely and quiet person to a more kinder and more understanding person I though was done pretty well. Though I been a fan of Yoko Hikasa for some time I felt that this role of Alicetaria was definitely one of her best roles to date.MamikaMamika Kirameki voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Murakawa of Brave witches and Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and served as Selesia and Meteora’s enemies in the series. A creation from a magical girl anime Mamika as a result of her origin story is a creation of the magical girl type of character. In terms of personality Mamika emphasises the best qualities of a magical girl being a cheerful, kind and positive person that tries her best to help people. Like other creations Mamika was initially very shocked that she was torn from her own world and deposited into the real world but was among the creations that got over this fact relatively fast. Initially Mamika as expected of a magical girl was reluctant to engage in combat with others and instead preferred diplomacy more than anything else. However, despite this when push comes to shove Mamika was shown to have impressive offensive and defensive capabilities which is helped by the fact that abilities in the real world are far more powerful than in their own. As the series goes on Mamika’s personality gradually changes becoming braver and more willing to stop conflict between people so as to promote diplomacy a trait that I particularly admired. A prominent trait of Mamika’s that she shares with Hikayu is her ability to see and understand a person’s inner thoughts and from there determine whether they are a good person or not. From what can be seen of Mamika in these instances she seems to care more about an individual’s own values and personality rather than the power and ability that they actually have. Over the course of the series Mamika due to her positive and cheerful nature is able to befriend several people from both sides notably Alicetaria and Souta. Her relationship and friendship with Alicetaria in particular I felt was really well done and was heartwarming in the fact that she managed to change Alice’s cold steely self to one that was as close to being a human as Alice can be.Mamika’s eventual loss in the series though I felt was really done though also extremely sad as well to both the target audience and to the characters in the show that know her as well. Her desire to discover the truth and her determination to end the threat posed by Altair was admirable as was her attempt to heal Altair’s broken heart. The consequences of her loss as well as the aftereffects that this had on the various characters on the show whether they were creations or humans was also another thing that was handled quite well. Overall, I felt that Rie Murakawa actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Mamika.BlitzBlitz Talker voiced by veteran voice actor Atsuchi Ono is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia’s and Meteora’s main enemies in the series. A creation that stems from a cyberpunk manga and anime Blitz is somewhat different to the other creations that fight in this war as he isn’t actually a main character in his origin story and is rather a secondary character. Despite that I feel that this in no way makes him less interesting than the others. An ex detective that works as a bounty hunter in his origin story that sees him hunt down dangerous enemies that the normal police are unable to handle a job that can be considered to be akin to bounty hunting. A quiet, wise and logical person Blitz is someone that prefers to do things on his own terms and not on other people’s terms which is reflected in how he handles himself in battle and out of it.  As a result of his experience of combat in his world Blitz is well versed in combat and fights with a powerful resolver and a number of special gear that he came up with that proves effective in this world as it does in his world. In combat Blitz’s personality notably changes in that while still remaining aloof he becomes much more determined and ruthless and will use any means necessary to win battles.A notable trait of Blitz is his relationship with Altair. Unlike other creations that were summoned by her for this war Blitz is someone that was rather loyal to her from the beginning something that Altair had already noticed. The reason for doing so in this case was a result of rather tragic backstory that caused him to become a bounty hunter in his story in the first place. I felt that this almost familial relationship between the two was interesting but it also acted as their biggest weakness that was exploited near the end of the series.  As a both a wise person and a capable combatant in his own right Blitz proved to be a powerful opponent for Selesia and her team to handle and indeed the only person that was capable of fighting him evenly was Yuya. Over the course of the series the two exchanged blows countless times and I really liked the battles between the two as it was like a contest between young and old warriors. Blitz I felt was an interesting character though I felt he was a bit underused in the series.MaganeMagane voiced by veteran seiyuu Maaya Sakamoto of Mobile suit gundam seed Destiny and Naruto fame is one of the main enemies that Selesia and Meteora face in the series. A powerful magic user that disguises herself as an energetic school girl that has a personality that revolves around lies Magane is one of the most unique characters that appear in this show. Unlike the rest of the creations that appear in this show who are either main characters or secondary ones Magane is actually the main villain for her own origin story. Though a powerful magic user as stated previously Magane is someone that prefers to use deception to achieve her goals rather than brute force however she is more than capable of fighting toe to toe with the most powerful of creations as shown in her fight against the combat oriented Yuya. Personality wise Magane is sadistic, brutal and deceptive and has all the traits that make up the trickster character type. Indeed, Magane’s personality is such that she prefers to watch things happen from a distance while using her lies to misdirect others and cause havoc. Despite having the traits of a villain, it was quite surprising to see that she took no one’s side during the conflict between the two sides which is a result of her methodology. Apparently, there’s a method to even her madness. Unlike most villains that we see in other forms of media Magane is no ego, no negative feelings and nothing that she wants to achieve with her own powers and instead all she seems to want to do is cause havoc and have fun while she’s at it. The closest comparison to her character will probably be Joker from Dc comics Batman universe. However, while unaligned in the larger scheme of things Magane is someone that does help people that she feels has earned her respect and in this we should be grateful that she did when the time came.Of Magane’s character her ability was actually an interesting one and one that was quite appropriate to her character in that it created something that people didn’t believe existed in the first place which I felt was pretty scary. Overall the character of Magane I felt was well designed and served as an interesting villain for Souta and Yuya. I felt that Maaya Sakamoto really did a great job portraying her.SetsunaSetsuna Shimazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi of Masamune Kun’s revenge fame is one of the main support characters of the show and though more of a guest character than anything actually had a pretty large presence and impact starting from the mid part of the series. An old friend of Souta’s that he connected with prior to the events of the show itself in a way Setsuna was very similar to Souta both in terms of personality and interests. Setsuna was a kind, caring and honest person that like Souta was a bit on the quiet side and as a result had trouble in making friends. Despite being quiet Setsuna is by no means unapproachable and indeed when one gets to know her well enough one can see that she is a kind person that can also be funny at times. Because both Souta and Setsuna shared similar personality traits and were both interested in popular media like anime and manga the two of them quickly become fast friends on their first meeting and grew to rely on each other in a society that they felt was hard to get used to.  While Souta can be said to be adapt at creating and writing worlds where his stories can take place in Setsuna was shown to be a very capable manga artist which I found to be surprising for a high school girl.The friendship between Setsuna and Souta I felt was interesting and well designed and did a great job of showing why Souta’s personality was like that when he and Selesia first met later. The tragic fate that befallen Setsuna I felt was really sad and given the depth of the bond and friendship that Souta had forged with her it can be seen rather easily why it affected him so greatly. However, while Setsuna herself was more of a guest role than anything the impact that she had on the overall story cannot be underestimated and though the events that surrounded her fate provided great pain and trauma to Souta’s psyche she also provided a source of great strength when he got over the role that he played in her death. The romance between the two that while shown only briefly was very real and it can be seen that both she and Souta really loved each other as they were very similar in terms of personality and interests and I felt that it was sad that in the end they were not allowed to be together as a couple. Though featured only briefly in the beginning Setsuna noticeably had a much larger role as the series went on and in the end had a very large impact on the story which I thought was surprising. In the end, I thought that Setsuna as a character was very well designed and her link with both Souta and Altair was excellently done. Her parting words to Souta near the end of the series I felt was really sweet and heartwarming and that scene was one of the most emotional scenes I seen in an anime even for one that has a lot of such good scenes. Ayaka Ohashi I felt really did a fantastic job in portraying the character of Setsuna and her gradual rise in rank from a guest star to a full support character I felt was something that I appreciated.Arts and animationThe arts and animation for the series I felt was really done with the character designs for each of the characters being especially well designed and varied. Each of the outfits and armor that the characters wore I felt were unique and matched well with their personalities and roles in their respective stories. The animation for the series I felt was pretty crisp and sharp and was really clear as well as we are able to see each action that was took by the characters easily. As an anime that featured a large-scale battle between creations that took place in the real world it was important that they got the combat scenes right and made them look cool and in this I felt that they managed to succeed magnificently as each of the fight scenes and battles were excellently paced, designed and detailed and the scale of these were truly amazing. One other aspect of these fight scenes was how unpredictable that they can become which is nice since you really don’t know what will happen in it and who will be the victor here. The settings that are shown in the show while obviously staying within the confines of modern day Japan also showed a large number of variations in the terrains that it made use of and I felt that these looked really gorgeous and beautiful.MusicApart from the excellent story and fights Re Creators also has as one of its main strong points an excellent use of music both in terms of opening and ending themes and scene music. The first opening theme for the anime was gravity well which was sung by Tielle & Gemie with the music behind them arranged by renowned composer Hiroyuki Sawano.  The second opening theme was sh0ut also composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and sung by Tielle & Gemie. Both opening themes I felt was really well done and helped provoke a sense of excitement and anticipation for the series. The series made use of a total of three ending themes for the series though of this one was unique to one episode. The first ending theme was Newlook that was sung by veteran singer Ayano Mashiro that I felt was a great song while the second was world Etude that was sung by Altair’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Aki Tokyosaki. The last ending theme that was used in the show was Rubikon that was sung by Sangatsu no Phantasia. This last ending theme I felt was notable as it conveyed a sense of ending to the episodes which is helped by the visuals that it uses as it shows each of the creations in the midst of being created thus illustrating the fact that they are not from the real world and exist in their own myriad of worlds. With this ending theme, I also thought that each of the characters and their poses actually looked pretty cute as they were being created by their creators. Apart from the strong opening and ending themes Re Creators I noted also had a very strong and a large amount of scene music that I felt was really well designed and used very well within the series. In particular the scene music that they use for the battles and the ones that they use for tense situations as well as revelations were especially well designed in my opinion.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series whether for the main cast or the support cast I felt was really excellent which was helped by the fact that the voice cast featured a large number of veteran seiyuu’s and voice actors that have already proven themselves in the field. In particular though I know a great deal of the seiyuu’s and voice actors featured here having seen many of their performances in other works I felt that a great many of them really outdone themselves here and really pulled off a performance that I feel would shine in their careers. In this regard, I believe that the best ones here will be Mikako Komatsu who portrayed the character of Selesia, Inori Minase who portrayed the character of Meteora, Sora Amamiya who portrayed the character of Rui, Shiina Natsukawa who portrayed the character of Hikayu, Yoko Hikasa who portrayed the character of Alicetalia and finally Aki Toyosaki who portrayed the character of Altair. Lastly though only a support role I felt that Ayaka Ohashi really did an impressive job portraying the character of Setsuna and added a lot of emotion and weight to her character with her portrayal of her.  Excellent voice acting is one of the elements that all animes should have as one of its base requirements and in this I felt that this was achieved spectacularly as each seiyuu and voice actor portrayed their characters to perfection.Overall conclusionIn overall the strongest points for Re creators was its Interesting premise, excellent story, excellent characters, voice acting and music and well-designed fight scenes and beautiful environments that all combined to make this anime one of the strongest ones I seen for some time.The overall premise for the series which was the fact that creations that were created by popular media can suddenly turn up in the real world and battle each other was a premise that had long been a staple of many authors and I was glad that such a simple premise would turn out to be such a good one for the anime. Anyone that reads or watches any of the popular media such as light novels, manga and anime would have characters that they actually adore and admire and taking this simple reason and building a story around it I felt was a really smart move. The premise itself was also made a part of the overall plot with the addition of the audience and acceptance factor which meant that the more the audience sympathize with the creations the stronger they will get something that I agree with as characters will get popular the more people see them and agree with their stories. When used in conjunction with the fact that characters can get more powerful equipment and abilities this really made the premise a bit of a game changer in the story. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty well designed with Altair being one of the best villains I ever seen. Unlike other villains that we see elsewhere Altair was dangerous because apart from being strong in martial might she was also supremely intelligent and able to think several steps ahead which made her a very challenging villain. The fact that her motivation for doing so was so strong also made her more dangerous as well. Of course, Altair was not the whole story as watching each of the creations learn about this world and each other and learn to fight as a team was also part of it as well and in this I loved seeing the comradeship that formed between the creations who despite not meeting each other before were able to find common ground and understanding and work together to fight a common foe. A part of this process was of course the meeting between the creation and creator and it was interesting in seeing the reactions of both here. The gradual bond between the two I felt was done pretty well with the best example being the one between Selesia and her creator Matsubara.One of the most interesting aspects of the story was the combination of all the various branches of the popular media which in this case includes Manga, Anime and Light novels and their respective studios and publishers and having them create a stage for the final battle.  In this I felt that the planning for the final battle was done well and it was impressive in seeing so many different fields working together for one common goal. The final battle for this series though was really something and was extremely impressive to see as it demonstrated not just all the developments that the creations have gone through as the series progressed but also the same in their creators as well. Watching them stake their life on this one last battle was really awe inspiring. Modern animes usually have a lot of trouble in managing to end an anime series successfully by tying up all the loose plot threads and giving a fate to the main characters after the dust has settled from the final battle.  But in this I felt that the studio really put a lot of thought into the ending for both the creations and the creators and I was glad that in the end that they both had an ending that made sense to the audience.  This anime I felt was one of the strongest ones I seen for a long time and is easily a 10/10 in my books.', '(I\'m not a native speaker, but I\'ll try to write this review in communicative way)When I watched the 1st episode of this series I felt uneasy about it, at first it was a fine anime, so I watched it till 15th episode and started 16th, at the 3rd minute of it I had enough.Story in my opinion was fine, but it tried to hard on the least interesting aspect of it.

All of the named characters throughout the series carries with them a specific role to furthering the plot of the story and a specific message to contribute to the story\'s overall theme, and none are ultimately left to waste.In the end, it all comes down to the story. While Re:CREATORS subscribes to the familiar ""save-the-world"" type of story, it is in HOW the series delivers it that makes it stand out. In a story about stories, it takes its time not only getting into HOW and WHY the world is in danger, giving the villain a very believable and very tragic motive that truly humanizes her, but it also takes a singularly inventive approach in how its heroes try to save it.

That was bad. I've never seen a series that looks and sounds so good have such awful writing since SAO, and this blows SAO out of the water in this regard. It's so sad, because this series has such a great premise that it had a world (no pun intended) of potential.Here's what's good: The soundtrack is great, the overall art quality and animation are amazing, and the fight scenes are well-coreographed and fun.Here's what's bad: The vast majority of the writing, the pacing, the character designs (seriously, they're oddly unappealing despite being very well-drawn), and especially the characterization. Also the writing, the writing,...the writing, and the writing. Whoever wrote this needs to retire now. This peaks (barely since it's all awful) during the second episode which is basically 20 solid minutes of exposition dump in the style of SAO café scenes. Also the ending forgot about an entire character, but let's just pretend that's their pathetic attempt at leaving a thread dangling for a sequel.It's also a shame, because I can tell there are moments in the series where its potential shines through, and somehow the writers had a good day. These moments tend to be a few minutes long at the longest (usually not even a full scene), but they could be described as brilliant moments.

I understand that Re:Creators isn\'t exactly everyone\'s cup of tea, but for those who were only able to make it past a couple of episodes, I highly encourage you to keep watching and give it another chance.As a writer and content creator myself who has been writing stories, creating characters, and trying to make it as an author and screenwriter for a...majority of my young adult life, coming across Re:Creators was by far one of the most enjoyable and cathartic moments I\'ve experienced since I first delved into anime four years ago. I was sold by Re:Creators from the very first episode, and I knew the moment that Selesia came exploding out of that tablet into ""our"" world, that this series would be something incredibly special and memorable.The story of Re:Creators goes far beyond the question of ""What would happen if fictional characters suddenly came into this world to meet their creators?"" Not only does it focus on the lives and emotions of the characters who were ripped from their worlds and forced to deal with the discovery that their lives and worlds were put on display to the entire world of the ""gods"", but it also focuses on the people who created these characters, who spent hours and days and months, and maybe even years, pouring their time, energy, and parts of their souls into creating such characters and worlds that I, as a creator myself, can more than identify with on such a personal level.From each Creation\'s point of view, it\'s easy to understand why someone would be upset with their Creators when their own worlds are filled with so much pain and suffering. Our world isn\'t exactly easy to get by in, either, and I\'m sure if we had the chance to meet the being behind our own creation (if you\'re someone who believes in that), we\'d have a lot of ugly things to say to them, too. But when you\'re a writer, an artist, or any type of content creator, there\'s always so much more to a story than writing a character and making them suffer. There\'s so much detail, so much time, so many personal little qualities that we invest into our characters, their worlds, their personalities, etc., and each of those little things are created with such a passion for what we do and for the people and places we create. I know a lot of my characters would probably come and beat me up if someone opened a portal to bring them to our world, but there\'s no doubt in my mind that I don\'t love them and every little thing I\'ve created for them.Aside from the Creations vs. Creators ""Why are we here"" theme, Re:Creators deals with so many other themes and stories that I know a lot of us can relate to - things like suicide, envy, hopelessness, and guilt, emotions and experiences we deal with every day that we\'re too ashamed or afraid to talk about. When we finally discover the name and story behind ""Military Uniform Princess"", it\'s easy to see why she was such an accepted character to the public, because millions of people could identify with pain like that every day, identify with the desire to hurt the world for hurting us and those we love.The ending of Re:Creators wasn\'t perfect, and it didn\'t answer every single question we had, but it did answer the biggest ones and it did leave me with a strong sense of satisfaction at the end and an even bigger desire to continue to expand on my characters and make them just as lovable and relateable as the characters in this anime. Each and every Creation represented a different genre and different themes, but they all came together flawlessly in this world in a way that made them feel like a Magical Girl wasn\'t necessarily so out of place walking alongside a super-powered medieval knight, or a giant mecha alongside a magical prodigy. The animation style blended each genre beautifully together and every action scene was just as gorgeous, just as vivid, just as fluid as the more subdued, exposition-filled conversational scenes. All of this tied together with one of the most powerful, adrenaline-pumping soundtracks I\'ve heard in a long time has placed Re:Creators forever at the top of my favorite anime list, and I do hope that the lower reviewers will go back and give this anime another chance. majority of my young adult life, coming across Re:Creators was by far one of the most enjoyable and cathartic moments I\'ve experienced since I first delved into anime four years ago.

To those put off by the low reviews and complaints about exposition here: don\'t be. I made the same mistake and have regretted it ever since.To address that complaint first, since it\'s the one I see most often: I feel it\'s greatly exaggerated and here\'s an example to illustrate what I mean: The first episode has plenty of action, while the second episode has the protagonists working to figure out what the heck is going on, before leading into another action sequence in Episode 3.Re:Creators\' functions on its own set of rules so of course someone needs to point one or two...out every now and then. I had no problem at all with this and if you\'ve seen shows like Steins;Gate, Death Note or even other action anime such as Code Geass it shouldn\'t be a problem for you either. You\'ll only be disappointed if you expect every episode to be a Michael Bay fest.Onto the rest of the show:Story and Characters:The story is wholly unique and fantastic - I won\'t go into specifics but it\'s a treat seeing how these different characters react to the real world and how they interact with the ""natives"" and how their characteristics function in this new reality. Each one has their own strengths, flaws, awesome and funny moments and the chemistry between them is superb, especially since every two characters have a chance to interact at some point.Sound:10/10, I don\'t need to explain this one honestly. The OPs and EDs are simply incredible songs. The OPs are upbeat, the EDs are gentle and the animation is amazing. The OST is perfect for action, drama and tense moments and the insert songs are perfectly placed and hit hard. Heck, the OPs and EDs keep showing up on top 10 lists on YouTube for crying out loud!Art:10/10. I\'m not a connoisseur of art but each episode is expertly crafted with no off-model shots. The action is fluid, impactful and perfectly blends characters with CGI models. Characters have a wide range of emotions and the animators even add in little touches to how they move and act that are a treat when noticed.Enjoyment:The characters are fantastic, the story is gripping and rich in feels. The music and art are amazing and of course I\'m giving this and my Overall rating a 10/10 as well.---This is my first review here and I\'m always looking for room to improve. Regardless, I hope this helped you, especially if you have always wanted to watch this anime and kept being put off my middling reviews as I was. Enjoy this incredible story now!

But, after a few episodes, if you\'re not enjoying it, you should drop it. If I say that, it\'s because I was trapped by this anime. I wasn\'t enjoying it at all, but I was telling myself : ""Wait ! It\'s going to get better in a few episodes !"". But it\'s not (except from 2 episodes near the end) !STORY : 3The main asset of this show is in its reversed concept. Usually, in anime, people from the real world end up...in a fictional world. Here, it\'s exactly the opposite : manga characters are invocated in the real world. It could have been really interesting then.However, these manga characters are stereotyped and make this show really weak.If this was the only problem, you would say : ""Well, it\'s not a big deal."" And you would be right as many anime characters are stereotyped in other shows (and sometimes in good ones).The problem of stereotypes doesn\'t concern only the characters. The situations are also stereotyped, which makes this anime too predictable.Finally, a big issue about the story is also that it\'s evolving too slowly. At least,10 episodes would be sufficient to this story. It would be more lively.ART : 4The art is really so-so. It\'s a 2017 anime, but it looks like an average 2010 show.FIGHTS : The fights are not epic at all.Worse than that, the weapons are doing dreadful noises.SOUND : 5I usually like Sawano Hiroyuki work. The first opening is cool but the second one is just ok.The endings are poor.CHARACTER : 2As I said before, the characters are stereotyped. ALL OF THEM !!!!Even though, for me there are 3 interesting characters.My favorite one dies too quickly. I\'m not spoiling its name. This character may appeared as one of the most cliché, but reveals to be the first one to understand Altair (the villain).Also, I liked Blitz and Magane which are the only ambiguous characters.Souta and Meteora are the worst characters.Souta is a weak main character.""Why not. It\'s a fresh change comparing to most of shonen main characters which are powerful characters"", I could say. But NO. Souta is only watching the others fight during all the anime, wondering what he could do when the answer is obvious. He\'s eventually trying something in the last episodes.Meteora deserves the palm of the worst character ever in an anime.SHE\'S TALKING TOO MUCH !!!!WARNING : SPOILER : [Basically, she\'s trying to explain to the others that the invocation of fictional characters in the real world has repercussions and endangers its stability.See ? I said it in a few words. Meteora spends nearly half of each episode to say this (and I\'m not exaggerating that much) ! Indeed, she\'s saying with complicated words what could be said easily. I can\'t remember who said that, but the real intelligence is to make oneself understandable to others. Meteora thinks she\'s intelligent as she uses complicated words...]END OF THE SPOILERENJOYMENT : 3As I already said, the story is evolving too slowly.Only 2 episodes are good, and they\'re near the end...OVERALL : 3Even if the concept is interesting (making creations live in our world), Re:Creators has too many drawbacks like its slowness or its stereotypes which makes it a bad show. in a fictional world.

It has a very unique premise, interesting and multi-dimensional characters, and some really emotionally impactful scenes. It also has way too much talking (in terms of exposition) bogging down the pacing, and a POV character who is arguably unimportant and timid to the point of being frustrating. He's not unlikeable, and he does develop over time, but he is not the draw of the show.Yet despite the POV character being somewhat forgettable, the show redeems itself with its supporting cast of characters. This includes Meteora, who is kind of like the main character, because she gets so much speaking time...that you'll probably get sick of hearing her voice. I skipped over some of her dialogue when I watched this show, so that made it more bearable. But the characters I'm really talking about are the other ones - the good guys, the bad guys, and those in-between. You have all these characters with their own backstories, goals, and personalities that normally shouldn't exist in a single anime, and yet that's what makes Re:Creators unique. Fans of mecha, noir, magical fantasy, RPGs and other genres I can't name should be interested to see how their favorite tropes fit into this world. The main villain, too, is one of the most memorable parts of the show. She's cold and calculating, unreasonably powerful, yet with an emotional side and well-defined motivations that make it hard to dislike her.It's hard to talk about Re:Creators because you have all these iconic, memorable, and emotionally impactful scenes, scattered around a bunch of empty lore talk that still fails to avoid plotholes. But trust me when I say that the best scenes really do stand out, especially towards the end of the show when everything that the story's been building up to finally happens. Expect flashy fights, super high stakes and important character deaths that will leave you dumbfounded. There are amazing scenes in the earlier parts of the anime, but the ending climax really is the highlight of the show. The incredible sound design really comes out in full force here.I think that if you are an artist or storyteller, or at least interested in the creation of good stories, parts of Re:Creators will resonate deeply with you. It explores the relationship between authors and their works/characters in a meaningful, heartfelt way. If any of that sounds interesting, I highly recommend you to give it a watch. that you'll probably get sick of hearing her voice.

Hmph,Uniqueness of this story, I didn't need to tell this uniqueness.Making a good story with animanga character giving vibes with all genre setup..Artstyle is not exception, every design of each and every character is detailed and well described..I like this series like All Popular shows,I haven't any sense of anime rating,it's just based on own enjoyment.If I enjoyed whole show by enduring pain...and boring vibe till the end then i forget that sh*t part..Who doesn't want enjoyment. and boring vibe till the end then i forget that sh*t part..Who doesn't want enjoyment."", 'Honestly had alot of high hopes for this anime that were sadly left unfulfilled. But don\'t get me wrong it\'s still a good anime.Story: 7It\'s amazing at the beginning, but the entire premise of saving the world is trite. As if the entire fate of the world would ever hinge on one singularity. However, I do like the initial premise of bringing anime characters into the real world. If the story was built differently maybe there would be a better storyline. This storyline is complete, but it\'s missing something that hooks you after the initial scenes. Also, the villan is pretty much unbeatable, and the...good guys in this case only won circumstantiallyArt:8Its very good. Crisp animation, sharp lines. Some parts dont look anatomically possible, but whatever its anime. Only reason why it\'s not a 10 is because it falls into the category of a ""Serious"" anime, and i\'ve seen better art for serious-type animes.Sound: 9I like this genre of music, the electro-rock hard bass beats. It\'s all pretty subjective. Nothing much to say about music. For voices, theyre generic, nothing really good, but nothing bad either. It\'s pretty average.Character:9Easily the best part of the story. all of the characters are good characters, and if theres one thing the story is good at it would be meshing different stories/ characters together. Alot of character development, and there are only a few characters that remain static. All major characters undergo some form of development. Theyre all well written charactersEnjoyment: 6It just got old fast. The story kicked in, and it got boring. at first i had high hopes, the first episode was awesome, it looked like an amazing action-romance-fantasy anime. But after the initial wow factor of translocating anime characters into the new world, There isn\'t much else to hook you.Overall: 7Its a good story, good animation, good characters, but it doesn\'r bring anything world changing, and the parts that could have been were underplayed alot. This is at best an anime that brings some good ideas, but not exactly a good idea in itself. It had fun aspects, but overall forgettable.So broken down probably 4 for characters+1 for story +1 for art +1 for enjoyment makes 7 overall. Its a good anime, but sadly thats all that it is.

Thank god it\'s not another rehash of the overused SAO/Re:Zero/Dude goes to Fantasy World with cellphone story.PROBLEMS WITH THE PLOTThere is a ton of dialogue. You should definitely listen to all the dialogue, so you don\'t miss important pieces that have sentimental meaning later on. Some of the dialogue is important, while some of it is just (unfortunately) filling time *cough* Meterora\'s long ass spells *cough*. I do wish there was more action (and I believe it would...be more popular if there were), since the show sells itself on being an action-type anime, but there may be more depth in the way the story played out.My main concern is that the main antagonist was way too OP. This set the protagonists\' goal as virtually unattainable, and prevented them from doing anything at all.. I realistically could see no way for the good guys to win in a fight against the villain. I believe an OP protagonist or an OP antagonist in general will make a show lose value. (Emiya Shirou and Gilgamesh are two great examples -- from the same show!).I also disliked how they (basically) brainwashed a character just for plot progression. I don\'t believe that character with blue hair would\'ve fought on the villain\'s side.SOUND - 9/10The soundtrack is amazing, though I wish they didn\'t play the same song for every build-up action scene. The Openings and Endings are also some of the best this season. I found that I never skipped them. :) If you pay attention during the second ending, there are a ton of missable details (like chibi Sho fondling Selesia, Alice looking somberly toward Mamika..).Takarada\'s VA was phenomenal.The only sound effect that seemed misplaced was the sound used for Giga Machina\'s acceleration. It sounds like a modified drum roll. It is used again when the Holopsicon is used (which made it even weirder for me).ART - 9/10The art is consistently good and easy on the eyes. No noticeable drop in quality.CHARACTERS - 9/10It\'s easy to connect with some of the characters and it\'s really sad to see them go. Paying attention to all the dialogue will help you understand the depth of each character (especially the main ones).I loved that the story tried to capture the idea that each Creation was initially bound to their character description and were able to evolve from that point. Each character responded to a situation in different ways (which was more clear in the earlier episodes), which gave each character their own depth.FINAL THOUGHTS - 7.5/10Though this anime is NOT perfect, it is definitely worth a watch. It is a refreshing anime, that doesn\'t follow a stereotypical story. The anime has some key flaws that prevent it from cementing its place as a ""MUST SEE,"" but I do believe it is a cut above the other ~7.5 animes on MyAnimeList. be more popular if there were), since the show sells itself on being an action-type anime, but there may be more depth in the way the story played out.My main concern is that the main antagonist was way too OP.

Her goal : revenge against the authors (the creators) for creating their worlds with war, injustice and pain. Some characters refused, others accept : two parties against each others. But, to protect the world, the characters need to accept their new existence and strengthen their bounds with their own unperfect creators.Characters 10 : Strong point here. Each characters is developed enough so that they are complex, many layers. Villains...on the ""good side"", knightly heroes on the ""bad side"". Each one have his own reasons to fight and to question his actions. Many are references (not copies) to actual popular anime/manga like Jojo, Madoka, Evangelion, etc.Story 7 : The story start with very strong ideas : what is the relation between creation-creator ? What is the creator\'s responsabilities to his creation ? What is a good story ? After few episodes, you fully understand the goal of the heroes. And THAT\'S WHERE IS START TO FALL DOWN. There\'s no other real ""build up"" of the tension. For 5-7 episodes, the story try really hard to not loose his edge but is too late. Result : when the final scene comes, it\'s very good but it had lost his tension.P.S. Yes, there\'s a lot of ""talking"" but there many action scene too and they are really well-made.Art  8 : Really good but a ""simplified"". The background and the action effects are beautiful.Sound 10 : STRONG point here. The musics, by Sawano Hiroyuki and his collaborators, are amazing.

The two OP rock on !!!Overall 8 : Even if story stumble on his way and loose his edge, the strong characters and the originality of the premise worth plenty the time needed to watch it. Re:CREATORS is a beautiful reflection on creativity and our own relation with the anime medium and characters we love ;)I hope a second season will be made where they will be able to be more concisely but still keep the multi-layers characters and their relation with their creators.P.S. : Sorry for my English... on the ""good side"", knightly heroes on the ""bad side"". Each one have his own reasons to fight and to question his actions. Many are references (not copies) to actual popular anime/manga like Jojo, Madoka, Evangelion, etc.Story 7 : The story start with very strong ideas : what is the relation between creation-creator ? What is the creator\'s responsabilities to his creation ? What is a good story ? After few episodes, you fully understand the goal of the heroes. And THAT\'S WHERE IS START TO FALL DOWN. There\'s no other real ""build up"" of the tension. For 5-7 episodes, the story try really hard to not loose his edge but is too late. Result : when the final scene comes, it\'s very good but it had lost his tension.P.S. Yes, there\'s a lot of ""talking"" but there many action scene too and they are really well-made.Art  8 : Really good but a ""simplified"". The background and the action effects are beautiful.Sound 10 : STRONG point here. The musics, by Sawano Hiroyuki and his collaborators, are amazing.

Instead of a normal anime where the characters and location are similar and based on the genre, this show mashes characters from many different worlds and plot lines then throws all of them into one conflict against an interesting and mysterious antagonist. The way all of the characters interact and flow with each other just feels right as all of the dialogue moves smoothly despite the characters contrasting personality. However the pacing of the story does flop around a fair amount as sudden action sequences occur frequently with little to no build up. There...is a lot of time jumping as between some episodes, especially at the beginning of the final episodes, more time has passed than it feels like should have. The soundtrack for this show is absolutely incredible. With epic music perfectly timed with the fight sequences that will get you to really feel the action and drives the impact of a sudden turn of events, Hiroyuki Sawano, who also did the soundtrack for series like Attack on Titian and Kill la Kill, did an incredible job with this soundtrack.

So if you\'re the kind of person who can\'t enjoy a show if it doesn\'t have an epic battle every episode, I\'d turn away now. It prefers to spend its run time exploring the characters depth, the philosophical questions posed by the appearance of the ""Creations"". I honestly prefer it this way, since it challenges your thinking beyond ""Which superpower man can punch harder?"". That being said,...it\'s the main point of criticism for most, so walk away if it doesn\'t sound like your cup of tea.Since the show spends so much time on the characters talking, you can bet they\'re really well developed. In fact, one character is so heavily developed that even her creator struggles to predict what she might be thinking. And I\'d even go as far as to say that she was one of the more underdeveloped characters in the show. It isn\'t just the characters either, single lines in this show really help develop the environment and setting that this show takes place in. For example, many characters make note of how good the food is compared to ""where they come from"". Since most shows don\'t care to explore how the food of their world taste, it makes sense that it wouldn\'t HAVE taste in the first place. So of course, their food their be infinitely bland compared to real food. Of course, this is just an example.Regardless of what you may say about the frequency of the fights, when they do come up, they make sure to instill the consistent philosophical underlines into them, case and point being Mamika\'s mini-breakdown when she gets in a fight in the real world for the first time compared to the fights in her heavily censored kids show. Not only that, they are very well animated and have a decent soundtrack to boot.If you\'re reading this without a clue what Re:Creators is, I\'d say go for it, but only if what I described above sounds appealing. After all, the act of watching the show and forming a strong enough opinion on it to write a review of it makes me fairly biased. So it may seem worse than what I described. But you miss all the shots you don\'t take, and besides; what do you have to lose besides an hour or two of a Saturday afternoon? it\'s the main point of criticism for most, so walk away if it doesn\'t sound like your cup of tea.Since the show spends so much time on the characters talking, you can bet they\'re really well developed.

Since i cannot express enough that the show has a GREAT ending and a BEST rising action and climax through text....It is a little sad since the ending was not that long enough ( What happen to Meteora when she started making novels? and what happen to Sota when he started to write again? ) those kind of thoughts in my mind.Art and Sound ? 8/10 and a 9/10The art style was decent enough and a use of CG was not hurting my eyes.it does not affect the show.As for the sound, it was also perfect, the execution of each song while the battles are on-going was fabulous and as for me, can't express it enough.Character ? 9/10Well each character or creations, has a grudge why their creator ( Authors or Game Maker ) put them in such horrible place or fight the battles they don't want to and see their friends in blood, after hearing they're sentences for their own grudge made me think that it is me or forshadowing my self in their position.But knowing what the Creator does intended to make them do such things and having a motivation why.. Because of that i want to be a Novelist now or a game creator to show that CREATIVITY and PASSION can have a chain reaction to make new worlds for others to be inspired and take their own as well.Enjoyment ?? 10/10 yup perfect !i really enjoy this and their humor and some jokes to be funny not just dark.I got nothing else to say but i really enjoy this 22 episode show.OVERALL , 10^23/10This anime was OG enough that the story are not generic and characters are decent but can create a waifu war.--------------------------------------Do i Recommend this ?

BE PREPARED"", '(Hint: if you don\'t like long reviews, skip to the end.)Re:Creators was something I looked forward to for a while before I started viewing it. Never reading the manga, the cover and the description of the anime version stood out to me for some reason. Then, I watched it.The first episode was really good. I enjoyed it a lot, and I couldn\'t wait for the next release. But, episode two made my opinion of the anime nosedive exponentially. Don\'t get me wrong; the concept and originality of the anime is very high, actually—I don\'t think I\'ve ever watched an anime or read a manga similar...to this type of ""teleported-to-another-world"" genre before, which is why it was bright with potential at first glance. However, as new episodes kept being released, my need to watch this was slowly shredded to pieces. Bluntly put: I was disappointed to the lowest level, and after reading some of the most popular reviews for this piece—I can safely assume many other people are feeling similar about Re:Creators.Even though I\'m marking Re:Creators as ""dropped,"" I am going to continue to view it until it\'s conclusive ending and I will also continue to track the episodes I\'ve seen. The way I see it; the studio it\'s being released from (I have no idea, I don\'t really care about things like that until I finish the anime) can still fix this if they try hard enough. They have what most of the people want to see down: well-executed combat scenes; character and plot development; good art, sound, and visual displays. But, the one thing they\'re lacking is trying to decrease the number of slow, boring, monotonic conversations between the characters, despite how much information a viewer may receive from these.To tell you the truth: I love the characters in this show. I love their voice actors; they\'re realistic reactions; the way they\'re drawn—everything. I also enjoy how each and every character has their own unique combat ability, even though the most important character in the cast has zero prowess—the so called ""lead character,"" also the first we\'re introduced to: Mizushino Souta. It\'s not that I dislike the main character having the weakest strength, I just dislike the fact that he\'s so defenseless. Now, now, I understand he\'s supposed to be a normal person, but seriously... I don\'t really fancy the anime tropes where the lead is completely useless like he is.Overall, I had high expectations of this anime, but was disappointed in the end. Hopefully, I\'ll learn to like it before the conclusion, because I don\'t really look forward to watching future releases. 5/10 to this type of ""teleported-to-another-world"" genre before, which is why it was bright with potential at first glance.

Don't have enough words to describe it.Characters are really unique. Even those who die early. They are so real i just couldn't stop crying like a baby on tragic moments. Every single person in this anime has a story, real emotions, and motivations.Music is serious buisness. Srly, battle soundtrack is hilarious, moments of switching the background are perfect, opening and ending you will never want to skip.Story itself is not so unusual, but thrilling.

Excellent. 10/10"", ""RE:Creators is a show I want to like, I want to see a good original anime, where the strengths of the medium can be fully exploited. There is an overwhelming saturation of adaptations of VN's, LN's and Manga. Many adaptations are good, however even the best cannot fully capture the breadth of the above mediums. It is unfortunate that given the opportunity to write a story AROUND the medium of an animated series, TROYCA has fallen flat. It is more unfortunate that this will be looked upon and, in a market place where studios want to play it safe, further incentivize adaptations rather than anime...originals.The core of the problem with this series is that there simply isn't a fundamental narrative to tie it all together. Good writing is the foundation that props up a sturdy house, no matter how good the art is, the music, the characters, or even the fictional world, a weak foundation will cause it all to come crashing down. There exists the kernel of great themes in this show, which could have made a powerful narrative about one's existence and indignation of a seemingly cold and indifferent world. However, the staff dropped the ball, meandering aimlessly, they threw their pearls in the mud and settled on a boring coming of age story, which is a poorly masked plot device, and self-important inserts on the creative process.What if I told you that your entire existence was designed, that you had no agency in life? Would you rebel and try to seize the power of agency, or are you happy to play a role, to call it fate? This binary should have been the show's axis, a clash of will's coupled with the struggle to determine one's very ontology. In a world where fictional creations come to the 'real' world, to be confronted with the fact that their existence was the purposeful design of someone else, a creator, one would think this would be the narrative. All the fictional properties in this universe are well designed and believable, even if they aren't fleshed out enough. It is interesting to see the initial alignment of the creations around either Meteora or Altair. Meteora wants to preserve the world she finds herself in, while Altair promises everyone they can get their creators end the suffering endured in their fictional worlds. While it is explicitly obvious that Altair has ulterior motives, why couldn't they be more complicated than simple abandon and rage?Not all stories need to be social commentary or try to invoke big thinking. At some point we want to see interesting people doing interesting things, all a part of a great game. However RE:Creators failed to anchor itself to strong characters by focusing too much on setup episodes involving the scheme to take down Altair. Not only was valuable time wasted, there are characters who are essentially loose ends or exist solely as a plot device. Our theoretical protagonist, Sota is one of said plot devices, while there is a narrative involving his struggle with the past, it really isn't that profound. Sota's sin wasn't explicit malevolence, but rather a LACK of action, and given the nature of his predicament there wasn't much he could really do, thus cheapening the whole thing. There could have been something of a 'innocent sin' arc à la Persona 2, but essentially Sota is the Deus Ex Machina which brings Altair to the world and then makes her go away.On the fictional properties of this series, I could say if I didn't know this show existed, I would have thought them to be real. If there were ever a side project to flesh out these properties, I would love see it. As it stands though, mashing them together in a common world didn't prove to be very successful. As said above, some are just plot devices, or even superfluous. Sure it was interesting to see a baddy like Yuuya align to save the world, while the noble warrior, Alicetaria align with the morally ambiguous Altair. But it turns out Yuuua isn't such a baddy after all and Alicetaria was simply tricked. Mamika exists solely to strengthen Alicetaria's resolve and Magane is just a third wheel to stir things up before vanishing. Hikayu, meanwhile is an eroge character in a story dominated by action characters, in short, useless. Meteora is interesting in that she sidelines Sota as the effective protagonist, but even she could and should have been developed more. Most disappointingly of all, is Altair who is left alone for a good chuck of the series, only to reappear as a generic final boss baddy. Her suave confidence as she picks apart a carefully laid trap while manipulating the masses is interesting to watch, but in the end all she wanted was essentially parental approval. What seemed like a complicated villain with a point is merely a emotional mess of a fan character created by some angst ridden teenager who couldn't handle life.Finally, RE:Creators is at times is rather pretentious, with the fictional authors whining about their creative struggles. The real authors go as far as using a recap episode to complain about how complicated Altair's hair is to animate. While I am grateful for all the very real hard work put in to make something like this, at some point why use an action show where worlds collide as your medium to comment on the creative process? This could easily be done in, I don't know, a documentary? Or maybe a 13 episode slice of life series? While there are strong elements in this show, like the character design, and the fantastic music, RE:Creators has failed to deliver a compelling narrative. What makes it all the worse, is that they HAD the ingredients to make something good, but ended up with some unpalatable, under-cooked mess. originals.The core of the problem with this series is that there simply isn't a fundamental narrative to tie it all together.

It was obviously going to end roughly as it did, but some parts shouldn\'t have been glossed over. And this is accepting the pro-creativity theme they were working with.Uh, it\'ll be hard to not explain it without revealing spoilers, so here goes my vague reasons:There is some character development problems. It was amazing in the first-half as, well, they all had plenty of time to adapt and grow with their...new environment and fellow cast. Two of them introduced in the end made sense to not be too realistic simply due to joining so late in the game. But the other just ... yeah, no. We all knew who they were, but they kept them hidden essentially since the introduction and then we saw nothing until the final stage.And then there\'s Altair who we quite literally didn\'t know what was up with her or her fanbase. The main character/villain. We had plenty of time to learn about how those who follow her story, but it was overlooked so we kept seeing a dang Godmodding Mary Sue.Then we had the final battle. Splitting it into Stages; 1) plan, 2) work, and 3) final battle. We got to see Stages 1 and 3. But Stage 2 got so glossed over that it was lackluster. They didn\'t bother to hint anything for us to be looking forward to. Again, the ending was more-or-less predictable simply due to the type of story this is (pro-creativity).I get this was so Stage 3 would be the primary focus, but it really took away from the dang theme that was showing that being creative is super important! Like, we didn\'t even have a reason to be excited about what was happening during Stage 3 \'cause we didn\'t know what led up to the final battle beyond ""oh Altair\'s here, let\'s start!""Overall it\'s far from awful. But its ""lackluster"" or ""meh"" ending is really the worst part of the show. It\'d be nice if they didn\'t get sloppy towards the end \'cause it really was going great until Stage 2 got skipped. new environment and fellow cast.

Don\'t even compare it to another anime. You simply can\'t, and doing so is a really stupid move. Even moronic by giving it lowest score possible when it was ongoing.Story, the very first reason I have to watch this animeThe story began with slightly biased opening when Setsuna Shimazaki seems commits suicide by throwing herself to the railway and months passed. The story moves to the home of Souta Mizushino and the character introduction started here and it\'s very slow for few episodes, and it...simply because this anime needs a proper introduction.

It could have been a battle royal, a faction war, a thriller, a workplace series hell it could have even been the best Yuri romance of the year. But it was none of those. While Re:CREATORS is an ""original"" anime with an interesting concept, it never quite manages to take any of it\'s ideas to a competent level, let alone a level of excellence.Part of this is tied to the characters. Everyone single one of them are archetypes that don\'t have any distinguishing features. While this can be fine in a series with a large cast...and small runtime, in Re:CREATORS these characters almost never bounce off each other.The show also has a habit of attempting to subvert typical tropes. However this is always done in a rather unimaginative way. If in a typical story ""X"" would happen, in Re:CREATORS the opposite happens. While not bad on it\'s own, the writers seem to be obsessed with it and will try to write it in whether or not it makes any logical sense. This is especially frustrating because every potentially interesting story threads ends with a anticlimactic non ending.The combat animation is fine most of the time. But since the core theme of the show is intertwined with  Deus Ex Machina, the fights never have any serious stakes. The battles are inconsequential and after the first few episodes the visual spectacle is toned down as well.The only interesting thing that is fully explored in the series is how a creator treats his creation. The different authors, artists and game developers all have a different outlook on their works, different work ethics and are interested in the works of their peers. These result in some of the powerful moments in the show. Then again, this is undercut because of some terrible cinematography, stilted character expressions.Which leaves us with the other good aspect of the show, the Yuri romance. Which was given no time to develop. So moving on.A key problem in the show is just how poorly every event is paced. On thing happens after another with no real connection between them. The chain of events feel arbitrary without any real cause linking them together. Making certain parts of an episode exciting and others dull. Things happen because something needs to happen. Whether it be battles, slice of life moments or even cringe worthy otaku parodying gags (?). Curiously the only episode that is enjoyable from start to finish is the recap episode. Which feels more like something out of Deadpool or Trigger rather than a typical episode of Re:CREATORS.At the end Re:CREATORS was watchable. It wasn\'t good at all but it was something that I somehow managed to slog through. I just hope that someone in the future uses the ideas presented in the show to make something better. Though Meteora ending up being the central character of the show was somewhat satisfying.

(although the word evolution is not wise; succession or sequence sounds fairer.)the classical “boy meets girl”… souta, one of the main characters, is your typical loner, weak and a loser (must be a thing these days). he actually meets a girl, and guess what? the only friend he made he betrays and forsakes. such gallantry! and then the classical regret that shadows him throughout the show. nobody would notice or reclaim if he got spirited away.  now, the heroes! meteora (mediocre character - utmost failure), mamika (where have i seen you before?), selesia (plain), alicetaria (plain), blitz (duplicate), hikayu (what a comedy!), yuya (tedious, even as a swordsman) etc., well they simply don’t fit the threshold of a “creation”, but more of a replica out of a game/manga/anime we have all seen before, i’m sure! it is a subtle form of plagiarism. “originality is nothing but judicious imitation. the most original writers borrowed one from another.” Voltaire. i do know that with so many anime series and manga publications, gaming, light novels and even dojinshi having near-characters is a thing, but at least someone tries to give him/her a distinct characteristic, even if in clothing, weaponry, eye/hair colour, or even a catchphrase - something, please! this is ridiculous here! not even gonna mention the mecha element, it’s just sad, and quite a peculiar posture to ride a bot!all this makes Altair the only persona with some ethos and a singular design which is actually cool. (with so many imbecility flying all over the place it comes to a point that the desperate crusade of Altair is everything that makes some sense.) she’s the so called “villain”, just because she wants to “change” the world and her words are distorted into “destroy”. for someone as wise, and she claims to be, as meteora, not knowing the principle of nihilism is a serious philosophical offense. this meteora (and believe me, she never shuts up!) acts as a catalyst here, but, basically, all that she does is talk, talk, talk… incredibly long, boring, meaningless conversations (and even soliloquies), that lead the viewer to nowhere – it is utterly obtuse and confusing. if you like to hear the voice of Minase Inori reading nonsense this is the place for you. i felt that the screenwriters were completely lost at some point, not knowing which direction to take, and then they simply vent some farcical words in an attempt to distract the viewer – i mean, they even had the luxury of making a recap saying absurdity after absurdity all over again. vain characters in a vain war. and, of course, to make their absurd point a valid one, they had no qualms in killing, “heroically”, some characters whom the audience might have had charisma for. note that this is not an actual spoiler, and why? because in this platitude, this truism of an anime is extremely easy to foresee. nothing will surprise you. not even the resurface of someone’s daughter. (can’t comprehend why and how someone like Hiroe Rei came from Black Lagoon to this.)lastly, there’s this chikujouin character that function in some way due to the mystery that encompasses her, but, again, they swiftly killed it. and, in a desperate attempt to make something out of her, they vent again some fancy words trying to culminate in an ending that, supposedly, does not goes against human reason. unreasonable as possible, after all the disarray that transpired through their precarious lines. you guessed it. it’s the ultimate deception – unwise, frivolous, foreseeable and annoying, ending in a prostrated and parodic episode.the art is nothing new, just plain and shallow – no impression whatsoever. has some fine battles, appealing in a way due to the level of Altair’s powers, but quickly ruined by anything that comes after, usually another dense phrase! that or an ill-timed appearance out of nowhere, because they eventually gain the ability to summon any creation of their will. how? meteora is just fantastic, isn’t she?! not only she uses disdainful and low tricks, but now her magic just heightens and we don’t even realize when or how it happened.the music, the second noteworthy aspect, is ingenious, witty. it has that mystique surrounding it - Sawano Hiroyuki-Sensei for the win! Bravo! and that covers it, with two awesome, amazing openings voiced by Tielle.that’s far enough! you may ask why i compelled myself through all with this mess and finished re:creators, and wisely so – that’s because i wanted to witness the folly of this cliché and make sure i was not mistaken. and, sadly, here i am, accurate before what i just saw, writing this in order to convey to you my perspective as an anime fan – stay away from this!! anime. and this is where it all starts, but then you learn of the vacuity of the characters and their lack of development; the crude panorama conveying absurdity and the sterile evolution.

There are a lot of series that are simple in their format, where most of the appeal is front-loaded into the characters and action scenes, and there are just as many series that are the opposite, in that their appeal is set back into relationships between characters and subtleties slipped into dialogue. That\'s fairly obvious to state, especially when it\'s easy to know where that opinion can come from...when looking at various genres (shounen being the former, romance being the latter), but Re:Creators doesn\'t fit that bill as well as people would assume it would. It\'s a mashup of both those styles into an anime that I\'d have to call ""sleeper good"", as it\'s not good unless you\'re skimming thoughts and feelings off of the top of all the action.The early episodes of the series throw a lot of action at you, and it\'s really fun to watch these different anime tropes do battle with each other, not to mention how creative some of them actually are (Altair, I mean you). As I said, it\'s really fun to watch, and the action is great, but ultimately I believe this part of the anime to be little more than fanservice to pull in the audience and keep them watching. As the ball starts rolling, the action exists only as a means to further the story, rather than what it\'s about as you\'d see in a typical shounen anime: e.g. Naruto, Bleach, etc. The protagonists aren\'t simple minded, they\'re not trying to fight whatever they can, but they\'re forced to react when the antagonist, Altair, makes her moves. These characters seem more like high powered janitors than actual protagonists, but they\'re great ways of keeping the audience interested and breaking up the monotony of the character and relationship that is the true focus of the series.I want to repeat that concept plainly once more: Character and relationship building are the true focus of the series. We\'re given the creations, the anime characters, and the creators, the weebs that make them, and when I talk about character building, I really only mean the building of the creators themselves. The creations that are pulled from their respective anime strictly conform to the ideals of those typical tropes. Meteora is a flat personality, because she does more thinking than action. Selesia is a good girl, but understands that killing happens when everyone throws their lives at their beliefs. Alicetaria has a strict code of justice that means rectifying her world\'s issues at any cost. They can\'t deviate from those tropes or sacrifice their beliefs, as that earnest stride towards their convictions is what makes them good characters to begin with. They\'re straightforward, unlike the creators that made them, who have their thoughts and beliefs broken down at multiple points throughout the series as they question why they made that type of character, how important that character is to them, and if that character is real or fake even standing right in front of them. The relationships between creations and their creators is the most important aspect of this series, that\'s consistently reiterated in hopes that the audience will eventually understand that that\'s what they should be paying attention to.A creator puts incredible effort into their work. They create entire worlds, including landscapes, innumerable character designs, and along with that, innumerable character personalities. In creating their main hero/heroine, they inevitably put in a part of themselves, slaving away at crafting a character that is believable, relatable, and respectable to the millions of people that will see it. That\'s why the relationship between them is such an important concept for the audience to understand, as that\'s the entire motivation behind Altair\'s actions to begin with. Her creator, her family, was mistreated and her only desire to is rectify that in memory of her. This idea is so important because it\'s ultimately the solution to the conflict as well.In all of the action scenes, with all of the varying types of characters, Altair was legitimately crafted to be immortal and incontestable. She blatantly overpowered other characters and couldn\'t be killed even when they killed her (this makes sense if you watch it), because she is, as advertised, impossible to defeat. This is one of the incredibly few series that doesn\'t bullshit its way into a solution by having the all powerful character defeated by friendship (Fairy Tail  >.>) or just something that really doesn\'t make sense (Bleach  >.>).Main antagonist was impossible to beat as advertised. The solution was a concept that had been built for the majority of the series, rather than the action that most people were watching for. when looking at various genres (shounen being the former, romance being the latter), but Re:Creators doesn\'t fit that bill as well as people would assume it would.

The strong presentation, development, and overall execution of the literary themes in this anime is the requirements one of those requirements that this anime presents well, meriting it the score I am giving it.With that out of the way, I want to explain...why I\'m specifically giving this anime a high score before going into the show\'s flaws that may have inhibited it from gaining a strong score overall within our community. As I have already mentioned, the strong themes of this anime were its main selling point for me, specifically with regards to the complex idea of what a story truly is. Though ambiguous and undefined initially, the statement of this idea adds a starting point for the anime to develop, allowing for basic and intermediate themes to be included, further supporting the anime\'s main focus. These themes range in terms of both relevancy and relatability, such as with the themes questioning what truth is, presented by Magane\'s character, and taking responsibility for your choices, as with the main character\'s backstory, both of which respectively adds to the motif of thematic development.These ideas synergize well in the overall developmental process of the story, but of course, the unique premise of this anime itself presents an abundance of storytelling possibilities. This area, despite me personally believing the anime handles splendidly, is also room for major critique in terms of creating a hook for the audience. While I watched the first 12 episodes, I noticed that the mood and apparent goals of the anime drastically changed throughout the season. This is also why despite the anime\'s acclaimed popularity, I had initially dropped it, casting it off as simply another generic action-adventure anime. Other viewers may have also dropped this anime, with the reason being that they had already come to watch the anime with critical eyes. Ei Aoki, the director of this anime, is already a prolific figure within our community for his direction of anime like Fate/Zero and his storyboard design for Angel Beats! In addition, Hiroyuki Sawano being the composer of the music to this anime and countless amazing anime also peaked the expectations even higher. This may have already subconsciously created a pseudo-placebo effect within the minds of us viewers, with us forcing ourselves to believe in the flawlessness of this anime. Due to this, when the given conditions in the execution of the exposition did not match our preconditioned expectations in how an exposition should be done, we simply drop the show altogether. In reality, this backfires a lot more with a well-known staff for any given anime, as our expectations are so high that we\'re not given room to think for ourselves of what the director truly wanted. Our job as viewers is not to criticize, but moreover to ask if a show in presentation, is allowing us to see the vision that the creator had. Interestingly enough, I think the point I\'m making loops around also as a key theme WITHIN THIS ANIME, which is what led me to analyze this specific anime slightly differently than I would for most.Anyway, I\'m getting off track. Even if you are in the group that originally dropped the show out of disappointment, I think that the initial impression of this anime was very wrongfully presented in creating an exposition for the myriad of philosophical questions the anime wanted to share. Many of the lower scores for this anime are probably given by those who dropped the show initially around the third or fourth episode. Of course, this is not the fault of the reviewers, but simply the default within our community of ""dropping a show by episode 3 if you\'re going to drop it"". If you\'ve dropped this anime already, or don\'t plan on watching it given the supposed generic execution of a premise with lots of unique potentials, then I highly urge you to reconsider, and at least watch until episode 10 or so before deciding on forgetting about this series. In my (not so) humble opinion, this anime is a hidden gem, which may possibly be forgotten, washed away by the tides in the sea of seasonal anime, so while it\'s here, please experience it! why I\'m specifically giving this anime a high score before going into the show\'s flaws that may have inhibited it from gaining a strong score overall within our community.

The premise, fictional characters entering the ""real"" world, isn\'t particularly unique, stock/stereotypical charactersStory: 1Well, I suppose this is where I complain about how the characters spend 90% of the screentime chatting about things that don\'t matter, are completely irrelevant to the plot and useless to the audience; things that nobody gives a shit about; and things that are just brain-numbingly boring.

It started off pretty decent but then went downhill with lots of filler talks and conversations which proves 89% are useless at the end of the story. How nice? Other than that, it was pretty decent but did improve in the second half of the anime.On top...of that, there are unanswered questions and plot holes.

The other characters range...from barely acceptable to pretty OK.The music was amazingly fitting despite one overused track, similar (yet not a catchy or epic) to Kill LA Kill\'s ""Don\'t Lose Your Way!"".

The effects during fights scenes are probably the stand out for the art department and I will admit are impressive.Character: The characters do a very good job at being both original and copied at the same time. What I mean is they fit well to the trope that you would imagine they associate with but they also have a surprising amount of depth and finding that is...one of the main strong points of the characters and story.Now for the story... The concept is amazing, I love the premise and it made me really interested in watching the show, however I do not think it was executed well, the start is really really good, but it is carried by the characters not the plot itself, then the middle of the show comes around, all the interesting characters do other things and the main character makes several decisions that make no sense at all and its just painful to watch. If you do eventually slog through the middle, you will be impressed with the ending, its a lot better than it has any right to be after the horrendous middle.The main issues that this show suffers from is that the best part, the characters, are not very present during the weakest part of the story, which only compounds the issues you have with the main character and narrative, if you think you can put up with 5-6 episodes that are just bad to get to a decent ending maybe give the show a shot. one of the main strong points of the characters and story.Now for the story...

There's so much unnecessary dialogue that it becomes a pain to soldier through any part Meteora speaks. It's a visual medium and should be used accordingly to show us. The characters feel really one dimensional even the ones from the real world. The battle scenes with people just flying around in the air were pretty cool at the beginning but get old pretty fast.The redeeming factor is the background music which...Sawano does an excellent job especially for the more upbeat tracks for fights. Sawano does an excellent job especially for the more upbeat tracks for fights."", ""Isekai or transported into another world genre has been a genre that defined this decade. With the trendsetter, Log Horizon, and the one that really made this genre boom, Sword Art Online, Isekai genre started to color this decade with different approaches and spices. But never I found that someone or somebody have some guts and creativity to twist this genre more until this anime released back in Spring 2017. Airing for two seasons with 22 episodes in it, this is Re:CREATORS.Re:CREATORS started with a common and generic story of a boy transported into another world of anime, but here's the twist. The boy transported...back to the real world and brought one of the character of that said anime with him and thus begun the reverse Isekai or I would say another world characters got transported into the real world. The twist itself really made the genre twisted and made a very solid beginning for a really interesting story to come having something that have never been done before. The story itself really interesting as the characters from another world struggles to find a way to get back to their own world while having fights with characters that have a completely different view from another. What I love from the story is how they present the conflict with two different views that both of them is seemingly right. The conflict really bringing a purpose for the fights between both side.I would not say much about the animation and art. The character design is simply very good, taking a good amount of references to the recurring genre in the anime community for people to relate. And yes, I would say that the main antagonist's (Altair) character design is pretty hard to redrew over and over (even the recap episode jokes about this) so kudos for the animation team after trying their best to maintain a great animation of this anime.Soundtracks... Well, it is made by Sawano Hiroyuki or someone who loves to do that Sawano drops whenever something started to become epic. It is simply marvelous just like his previous works. He even did the opening and it was so hyped that I never skip the opening when I watched each episode. Sawano Hiroyuki came back this time with more and more epic soundtracks that colors this anime and made this anime more and more epic.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. With twisted story and conflicts that really becoming a breakthrough for the genre of Isekai. Sadly, there's fewer people out there talking about this series even this series is very good on its own. I am hereby giving this anime an overall 9/10 for epic and great story.P.S. : You all should not skip the recap episode of this anime because it was very fun on its very own. back to the real world and brought one of the character of that said anime with him and thus begun the reverse Isekai or I would say another world characters got transported into the real world.

Well to be honest I started this series because of all the praise it got in the first 3 episodes. I watched it and not to lie, I enjoyed it very much. But now after the finale, did my opinion change? Well here\'s my review on Re:Creators, or what I would like to call Re:Talkers.The concept of the anime is interesting. I like how they changed the cliche of ""our main character got transported into another world and started his harem"" into ""anime characters transported into our world finding their creators"". But the problem...is how they played it out and this is where it got pretty disappointing. This is because the characters tend to spend AN ENTIRE EPISODE talking about the tactics and also about how the phenomenon happened. There are a lot of info dumps for us viewers to digest what was happening and it could get pretty confusing at some times. And this doesn\'t happen only once, it happened constantly throughout the series. Some of us may forget what has happened 3 episodes ago because it\'s just too much of an info dump, which isn\'t good for a series to begin with.Moving on let\'s talk about the art and animation for this series. The art, it tends to crumble down at some time but most of the time it\'s steady. Personally, I like the character designs of this series. They look beautiful and was definitely well drawn.  No complaints. Moreover, studio Troyca did an excellent job at animating this series, especially during the battle scenes. During the SoL scenes the animation was also pretty constant. No complaints.The music by Sawano Hiroyuki really added in a lot to the action scenes. But sadly it didn\'t add much to the SoL scenes in this anime, probably because HE IS NOT SUITED TO COMPOSE MUSIC FOR SOL ANIME. Like if this series is action focused like Kabaneri or Attack on Titan then his music will DEFINITELY stand out! But this series spent most of its time on the conversation between the characters.They should choose Kajiura Yuki instead! What a waste! Other than that, the OP and Ed was pretty well made, although both of the OP is misleading AF! This series is definitely not an action filled series. Personally I think both of the ED theme suit the series way better than the OP. The voice actors did a fantastic job, especially Minase Inori, the voice actress for Meteora. I kinda pity her because she is the person who needs to talk the most throughout the series. It must have been a strain on her throat to talk this much.Character-wise, nothing much to say. Each of the character have their own traits but it doesn\'t exclude them from being cliched. My personal favorite character Mamika died halfway through the series. It\'s sad because she was the one who got more development compared to other characters. Other than that, well 5/10 for characters. No development, some character lacks back stories. Our main character is realistic at some time but that doesn\'\'t change the fact that he is boring.Overall, I did somehow enjoyed watching this series and may rewatch it sometime to grasp what was happening, but for now it\'s a solid 6/10 for me, it can be better, but it chose not to.Short ver.Pros:1. Great art and animation2. Great voice acting3. Unique concept4. Action scenes are all well done.Cons:1. TOO MUCH INFO DUMP/TALKING!2. Character lacks development and some lacks backstories. Cliched characters.3. Music doesn\'t fit SoL scenes.4.

On the surface level, it's a story about fictional characters from anime, manga, light novels, and video games being brought to Earth. On another level, it's a somewhat philosophical story about what it means to be a creator and make art. While there are some moments with the creators of this anime venture toward self-referencing and navel-gazing, it never goes too far.I adore all the Creation characters. I make this distinction because many times I found Soto to be completely insufferable, but he becomes slightly more likeable toward the...end (or at least slightly out of the way after he reveals his bigger secrets connected to the story). For the most part, I find the writers did a good job giving each of these characters different moral codes—and seeing how these moral codes shifted after being brought from their individual worlds to Earth. One of my worries going into this show was that it was going to be unnecessarily dark and edgy, but I was pleased in the way that characters interact and overcome conflict. Even some of the darkest moments seem to be nodding to their respective genres (e.g.: Mamika as a nod to Madoka's deconstructed mahou shoujo).From Magane's genuinely terrifying chaotic presence to Alicetaria paladin-like righteousness, each of the characters were interesting to follow. Something I also enjoyed is while these characters sometimes exist as nods to different media (e.g.: Kanoya being a mix between Shinji and a bratty Gundam boy), I never felt like the source inspirations were leaned on too hard. Genre tropes were used tastefully, for the most part, and led to bigger questions about the creators who make words in these individual arenas.In terms of the plotting, sometimes the pacing felt slightly off. While the show is 22 episodes, it could have probably used some tightening and rounded out at about 18. There are moments in the middle where it feels like a lot of exposition and telegraphing dragged on. Without giving too much away, certain Creations (including a dating sim character) added little value to the overall story and felt like filler. For the most part, there was not much that happened that didn't feel strongly hinted at. So while it's not always surprising, it is satisfying to watch.I'm more of a story person, so I can't say too much about sound and art. I didn't find too much of the music to be memorable, but I enjoyed the art and trying to capture various genres under a single umbrella.Overall, I give Re:Creators a 7.5 out of 10, which has been generously rounded up to an 8. end (or at least slightly out of the way after he reveals his bigger secrets connected to the story).

Genre tropes were used tastefully, for the most part, and led to bigger questions about the creators who make words in these individual arenas.In terms of the plotting, sometimes the pacing felt slightly off. While the show is 22 episodes, it could have probably used some tightening and rounded out at about 18. There are moments in the middle where it feels like a lot of exposition and telegraphing dragged on. Without giving too much away, certain Creations (including a dating sim character) added little value to the overall story and felt like filler. For the most part, there was not much that happened that didn't feel strongly hinted at. So while it's not always surprising, it is satisfying to watch.I'm more of a story person, so I can't say too much about sound and art. I didn't find too much of the music to be memorable, but I enjoyed the art and trying to capture various genres under a single umbrella.Overall, I give Re:Creators a 7.5 out of 10, which has been generously rounded up to an 8."", ""Don't get fooled by the first episode, Re:Creators is nothing like it. In reality the show has boring and static plot with underderveloped characters and occasional moments of good animation accompanied by memorable and outstanding music. Just another show with above average production values and miserable script.There might be a good show within Re:Creators. Reduce it to 13 episodes, cut out unnecessary charakters and expositions, focus.Story: Boring, dry and stretched out.Fictional charakters fight to save/destroy the real world. Not much else going on there, besides steady introductions of more and more new characters.70% of the show is dry exposition or explanation...of few events, which is deliverd in boring and expressionless monologues by Meteora in a meeting room, dining room and other iterations of rooms. Any bit of information is cramped in monologue or dialogue and not incorporated in visual story telling. Tell, not show is the slogan. The worst part is, all of this exposition is absolutely meaningless because they are established on baseless calls of Meteora. I was eager to know how all of this has started, yet even after 22 episodes I still have no idea how Creations came to life.When the characters are not discussing upcoming doomsday, they discuss hardships regarding creation of anime or lifes of creative minds in the industry. With this Re:Creators breaks the 4th wall a few times, however, those attempts seem more laughable than witty.An element not present enough in the show is the discussion between Creations and Creators. Creations are not pleased with their worlds or lifes and complain at every opprtunity they get, yet there are no meaningfull discussions about what role fictional characters and stories  play in real world. Or why a story is like it is. One sentece on this topic in a heat of the battle is just not enough.But there was time for a spa episode. And a recap episode.Charakters: Thin and pureposeless.The show has around 10 Creations, their Creators and a handful of additional charakters - a big cast. A good show would struggle to fill so many charakters with life and personality in 22 episodes. Re:Creators is not a good show, so it does not give its charakters any development, personality or meaningfull interactions.The show tends not to show any real recruitment sceene of any Creation, and by doing so it successfuly masks their motivations. Thus it ends up in confusion when Creations from the same world, who had a close relationship, cannot come to any consent and fight to death. Or fights break out without a reason, just because an action scene is needed, there is a perfect comment on this in the show itself (Blitz in ep. 6).A bunch of characters are added in the last third, so they don't have much screentime, development or even purpose - I am looking at you Hikayu or Sirius, and others if you look close enough. Due to a big cast and overwhelming presence of exposition scenes, characters get little development and any drama feels void. It also does not help to try and develope a character in 5 minutes during the final showdown, before they disappear in irrelevance. Re:Creators tries to tie loose ends and solve conflicts, but those attempts end in convenience and just poor writing - eg. Yuuya & Shou or Blitz's arc.

Much of this invloves dialogue, which can certainly be boring at times, broken up with a fight or two every few episodes or so as...new characters are introduced. To be honest, I eventually drifted away to watch other shows at this point. The story didn\'t appear to be making much progress towards an overall ending. I\'d say that it wasn\'t really engaging to me anymore, as there seemed to be no real danger for the protagonists.When I did return to the show, I was able to press through a lot of the episodes at once, which was helpful. During this time, the episodes followed much of the same pattern as before, albeit with the resolution starting to loom over the character\'s heads, providing a sense of urgency. The characters really start to discover themselves and their motivations.In terms of negatives however, I didn\'t like how heavily Re:Creators relied on its Wildcard character to advance the plot. Some of the other antagonists make choices that I found hard to believe, too.Now, having just finished the show, I was not wrong to assume that something ridiculous would end up saving the world. The last few episodes were not what I was expecting and it left me with a feeling of dissapointment. It was very much a ""low-key"" ending and I felt that it left a lot of important questions unanswered.If I were given the same premise, I definitely would have taken a different appraoch. I feel like the show\'s biggest problem is that it tries to split itself between an action show with amazing fights between fictional characters and a thought-piece on the effects of bringing said characters to our world. I think it should have focused more on either one or the other instead of trying to do both, as it did.All-in-all, the show isn\'t bad, in fact I\'d say it\'s one of my favorites this season. It really resonated with me on a personal level because I fancy myself to be a ""Creator,"" it made me wonder what it would be like if one of my own creations came to life and how I would handle them. If you enjoy writing stories (or drawing them), I would definitely recommend watching Re:Creators.

The way it ended made it seem open for a second season but at the same time it doesn\'t. As much as I want a 2nd Season, I\'d like this to be the end, though Fanfiction Writers can do their jobs imagining a new beginning, story, or alternate realities. Whatever floats their boats.So let\'s do an ending rundown on how we can understand each character\'s resolution this episode.-Magane: Traveling the whole world, doing whatever she think will be interesting. Current Location Unknown. Since her Creator is dead thanks to her, there\'s no way to continue...her story unless someone else picks ups where the story left off.-Altair and Setsuna(Creation): They created a pocket dimension, made so that the both of them can continue existing.-Kanoya: Returns to his world with newfound hope that he might survive whatever ordeal he may face. Brings home a Plastic Model Kit of Gigas Machina as a souvenir. Nervous that Marine\'s Swimsuit Illustration of him might make the cut for Season 2 XD-Yuuya and Sho: After finding out the identity of the final boss and spoiling their audience of the twist, they decided to return to their world in hopes of stopping said final boss and expecting a reward from Yatoji.-Hikayu: Returns to her own world to be together with her beloved. Starts to muster up the courage of wearing an even raunchier version of her fighting dress and leaves a message only Ohnishi can hear.-Blitz and Erina Talker: Returns to their world expecting more bad things to happen to them, but Suruga bids them a farewell message that even if she makes their life harder, they should do their best to survive the ordeals she creates for the father-daughter duo.-Kikuchihara: Resigns from her Government Job...I really don\'t understand what happened to her. Did she become a newcomer writer?-Takarada: Won an award for his Novel Series, ""Alicetaria of the Scarlet"" trying to go beyond expectations as a tribute to his Creation\'s sacrifice.-Matsubara: Though he felt that he lost his daughter, he continuous writing ""Vogelchevalier"" so that he would fulfill his promise to Selesia and give his story a happy ending.-Nakanogane: Feels more pumped to write the Second Season of his story after feeling defeated from losing to Altair during the Chamber Battle.-Ohnishi, Yatoji, and Suruga: Continues to write their stories with more vigor than ever.-Sota: Being able to move on from Setsuna Shimazaki\'s Death, he got back to illustrating with inspiration he gained from his experiences and called every Creation he met his ""Beloved Family"". A possible collaboration with Meteora in the future.-Meteora: As a setback from her Return to Gate Spell, she can\'t return to her own world. She decided to become a newcomer Writer, utilizing the experiences she gained and write the events of this FREAKIN\' AWESOME ANIME....Re: CREATORS. O_OI\'m not kidding I called this shit a mile away the moment she mentioned she\'s going to write a story but damn they really went with it anyway.A really great original anime series. Never felt so emotionally attached to another story like this, another being Danganropa. Re:Creators had it\'s ups and downs, but the storytelling is just so good that I stayed till the end. Great Music Composition, the Animation Quality remained consistent, a LOT, I MEAN A LOT of likable characters that they actually grow on you as the episodes went on.I just hope that one day one the stories presented in this series becomes an actual thing. Wanna see Code: Babylon, MagicalSlayer Mamika and Alicetaria of the Scarlet Crossover, Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, Monomagia, Exclusive Underground, The Milky Way of the Starry Sky, and whatever Magane\'s Story was called become actual stories on our side of the screen. TROYCA, you made a masterpiece and you should be proud of that!TL;DR Meteora became a real person and created this wonderful anime.

TROYCA, you made a masterpiece and you should be proud of that!TL;DR Meteora became a real person and created this wonderful anime. WHO WOULD HAVE EFFING THOUGHT!', 'This anime should have a ""Slice of life"" tag.Because it is so slow, with so much talking that some episodes don\'t even need visuals, but even with that, there is close to no character development. On top of that, there are too much illogical and too easy-to-predict things.When I finished all 22 eps, I didn\'t even care anything for the characters or the story. How badly can the story progress if I feel like that after watching the last episode... It is such a waste because the idea itself is very interesting and the animations are pretty good too. ', 'Don\'t let the synopsis of the anime fool you; Re:Creators is not just some simple reverse isekai anime. If anything, I daresay it\'s almost like the Fate series, except that instead of historical/mythological figures we\'ve got the fictional characters we so admire being the ones summoned into our world, and a storyline that has the potential to be just as awesome as the Holy Grail Wars of Fate if the second cour is executed well. The parallels to Fate aside, Re:Creators also serves as an interesting commentary on the state of fictional media industry and fanbases, too. I\'ve thoroughly enjoyed the first cour of the...anime so far, and I hope my review clears some misconceptions about this series and encourages you to pick this anime up too!(And fun fact: the director of Re:Creators is none other than Ei Aoki, who worked on Fate/Zero too!)~~~Story & Characters: 7/10 & 6/10 respectivelyRe:Creators has a pretty interesting premise: what if the fictional characters we\'ve grown to love were to enter our world, the world of the people who made them? This serves as the crux for the story, which explores the dynamics between the Creations and their Creators. Ironically enough, the Creations are the ones who hold divine powers, not the Creators, who are only normal humans like all of us. There\'s this one memorable episode where a Creation gets pretty shaken up over the carnage her powers cause, because in her own bright and beautiful fictional world, the carnage is nonexistent. Re:Creators is full of intriguing moments like these that make you realize that there\'s more to this Creator/Creation dynamic than you may have imagined when first thinking about such a plot. I believe that the first cour has done a good job so far in delivering this premise, with lots of interesting twists that got me wanting to wait for the next episode to provide an explanation. Unlike several other anime, Re:Creators has no source material, so there was no way to satiate my curiosity on why certain stuff in the story happens until the following week.Probably one of the best parts about Re:Creators to me is how meta it can get sometimes due to the very nature of the show, which is founded upon fictional media itself! Without spoiling, I\'ll just say that certain key stuff from the story can be viewed IRL too on a ""official"" NicoNico page, and help add to the immersion of this series.With that being said, a common reason why people have dropped this series is because of the first few episodes: after an action-packed Ep.1, us viewers are greeted with exposition after exposition behind the technicalities of Creations and Creators. Kinda like the first 40 minute-long episode of Fate/Zero where all the pronouns were being thrown around. Admittedly, this point is the reason why I give the story a 7 and not any higher. However, just like the above anime I\'ve been constantly drawing parallels to, the story picks up significantly once the world-building is more or less settled, and you\'ll be glad that you endured the dry bit of the anime. That much I can guarantee you.And now, the characters. Given the plethora of genres in actual fiction, there\'s bound to be lots of potential Creations, right? Well, Re:Creators does a commendable job in ensuring that each one of them has their own distinct personality and quirks. From a mad, talkative girl with the power of reversing cause-and-effect to a loudmouth guy with a something like a Stand and even a princess who fires out weapons like Gate of Babylon, Re:Creators has a nice diversity of Creations. The Creators too, are just as well fleshed-out. The best part of the characters would be the chemistry between Creator and Creation, as well as between Creations, which often manifests in very unexpected (and endearing) ways! And with more Creations pretty much confirmed for the second cour, this anime has almost nailed it in the character department... almost.If there\'s one thing more contentious than the dry exposition, though, it\'s the protagonist of this story: Sota, who was the reason why I hesitate to give more than 7 points with regards to characters. Unlike the typical shounen protagonist, Sota is overwhelmingly ANNOYING and PATHETIC. If Emiya Shirou\'s ""Hero of Justice"" made you facepalm in Fate, Sota\'s unusually excessive hesitation and beating-around-the-bush will make you plant more than just a hand on your face. Heck, hindsight would reveal that a lot of the problems could have been solved if he wasn\'t a bumbling fool when it counted. Sota has arguably legitimate reasons for being this way, though, as the anime reveals later on, but I feel that in trying to portray a ""realistic"" person caught up in distress, the writers of Re:Creators forgot to give him some distinctly redeeming points in between to balance his feebleness out. (Apart from a speech he delivers in a later episode, but his presence still leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth.) I do hope that the writers give him more moments to showcase some positive development surpassing of these weaknesses of him and redeems himself, because I feel that anime viewers who aren\'t very patient and tolerant will drop the anime due to his flaws sticking out like a sore thumb.~~~Music/Sound: 9/10Sawano Hiroyuki did a superb job in the music department. The instrumental and vocal tracks fitted in seamlessly with the ongoing scenes. I was literally staying up late just to wait for the OST Vol.1 to come out. I like how certain tracks would play during specific types of scenes as a type of leitmotif, which definitely contributed to the ambiance of whatever was happening.~~Art & Animation: 8/10I like to judge the true worth of an anime with fight scenes based on... its fight scenes. TROYCA did pretty well, with the Creations and their magic powers being illustrated very beautifully and the flow of combat scenes being smooth for the most part. Character designs are well-done too, with some of the Creations having their own casual, outside-of-combat outfits too.That being said, design plays an integral part in the plot, as the later episodes will reveal *winky face*~~~Overall... 7.5-8/10Re:Creators is a really solid show, it definitely deserves more traction and hype than it has now, which is why I\'ve written such a long write-up for this review. As it is still an ongoing series ATM, my thoughts may not necessarily reflect things as you are reading it now. However, having finished the first cour, I can say with utmost certainty that Re:Creators is worth watching with lots of positive points that compensate from its flaws and make the show stand out from the rest, and make it a worthwhile watch even if it\'s still ongoing.

First of all i'm not one of those.There aren't many series that have characters written brilliantly as in this anime. I do understand why people see them being uninteresting. At the first glance they do seem like it. Anime character robbed from their stories with mediocre plots at the best, generic artists and writers who live as you would expect.The thing is that unlike majority anime's where you can figure out character's personality, goals and ambitions just by paying some attention to the character...itself in this case you need to try to understand how the world looks like in their eyes. For an example 5 minutes ago you were fighting hopeless battle that has destroyed all you cared for one by one no matter how hard you tried and suddenly you get moves in to seemingly peaceful world which you knew nothing about only to find out that anything you have ever done or suffered did not mean anything and that you were just a puppet doing what someones twisted mind came up with.You can not understand characters without putting some thinking in to the mix and if you can't see past characters skin you definitely wont be able get in to the story.And that's it for the rant. About my views of this anime.It is not often i get magnetized to the screen as strongly as i did after starting to watch this. It is a fresh breeze on the sky full of generic action series. Main storyline starts quite simply. Few popular anime and manga characters got suddenly moved from their own realities to the world where people who created their stories live.Confused fantasy characters are now forced to figure out where they are, why and how did they get there and who is this warrior girl who seems to know what's going on and what does the world of gods mean.So far this anime has been filled with great fighting scenes, characters that are more complex and unique that you would expect and a plot that bit by bit starts to appear.There are also quite a lot of scenes that some viewers might find slow or boring, but they are important for the story. This is not series you can watch only for it's action scenes as the major part of the series and plot is presented in a away that requires viewer to connect the dots and understand the mindsets of the characters.Characters do have their own personality and progression and you can understand why they do things.Animation quality is good and effects are like in any other well funded anime, but they are nothing special.This is great series for someone who wants something a bit different, but still likes those superpower fueled fights.This was my first review and i apologize if it's not formatted as well as some more experienced reviewer's review. Typos are to be blamed to this on screen keyboard. itself in this case you need to try to understand how the world looks like in their eyes.

The heroes are funny and strong. The villain is OP so they must work together to stop her and added to my favorite anime villain. The side characters (manga atists) are also given a proper screentime for the anime.  The show is action packed and great to rewatch it again for a few months. It must be scored higher like 8. This is similar to Fate/Stay Night anime but BETTER.Give this anime a try. You won't regret it.

Com certeza Re: Creators fica como umas das melhores OSTs da temporada.', ""Story:This is the main problem of this animation. In some parts, Meteora explains so much about the principles, settings and her own opinions. I guess the animation producers intend to make everything happens in this animate reasonable so they add a lot of detailed explanation. However, the point is that the more settings you add, the higher possibility that a logical fallacy will occur. Just like a debate, it's not the case that the more examples or opinions you give, you are more persuasive. This is only something like a fiction, not science, a blurred background let the audience to think more and form their...own logic. Giving some main points is enough and it also won't make the audience get bored. Also, the pace of the story is not quite good. In addition to the explanation issues that I have mentioned above, in the latter parts of this animation, it stresses a lot on how they prepared for the battle. However, when the battle really begins, I find little relationship between the creations' behavior and creators' preparation. Many things happen unexpectedly and you cannot find any implication of such thing will happen from the previous preparation (except the way of the ending). So, in my own opinion, there are many problems in the structure and the pace of this story.Songs:Hiroyuki Sawano's OPs and BGMs are of a high standard. It's really amazing and helps you enjoy the battle scenes.Characters:Even though you can see little character development, the core part of this animation is about the conflict so I don't mind there isn't any character development. And I like characters like Meteora and Magane. For Meteora, she really talks a lot. But this is also her characteristic, think more to make everything perfectly prepared before taking actions. As for Magane, she has her own philosophy and the scene that a metro station suddenly appears because of her ability, bending the reality, is the only part that moves me throughout this animation.So, all in all, this is an animation that gives me a high expectation before airing but eventually, I'm not quite satisfied with its performance. own logic.

Story is weak but could work if the storytelling and characters weren't horrendous. SKIIIIIP THIS ONE!Talk about a modern classic that isn't.I am too tired to make a full on review with sections so I will just make a series of good and bad points:GOOD:-As anyone says in the reviews, the idea is quite good. Having characters come to the real world instead of the isekai beaten horse.-The main character is a shy aspiring artist that doesn't want to show his drawings which hold a dark secret that makes the plot unfold. That could make for an interesting character.-The Joker...anime version. Her power is interesting but every scene she is in becomes long and chaotic.BAD:-SO MUCH BAD EXPOSITION. Don't get me wrong I love when something is explained but when the exposition is soooo blatant, like in this show, it just becomes unbearable. It doesn't help the fact that the exposition is done by a girl which speaks in a monotone voice for the length of a paragraph. oh, wait -says the person defending this trainwreck- THATS HER CHARACTER. Really? So her character is being boring and talking endlessly about things she herself says she has not yet grasped. I call that a a plot device to expose and direct the story.- The creations and creators are quite boring and as much that they say they evolve, they really don't. And whenever the plot requires it they become stupid. I was willing to give a pass to the magical girl because she comes from a simplified anime for kids, so she acts accordingly. The rest really don't deserve it.-The music might have been good if the didn't use the same time the same track for everything.-Every conflict in the narrative could be solved by a 3 second sentence but... hey where would the plot go?-Altair... such an OP and at the same time useless character. She is supposed to be a terrifying villain but she is not. If she wants to destroy the world she can but she won't foooor... reasons.- The anime sets up like its broody and dark but it's really just an excuse to see creations duke it out (until the plot says to stop) mindlessly.My recommendation: watch any Fate series. anime version.

It was an amazing amount of potential, but after a while, flaws started to appear as the show progressed, and more and more people went from praising it to scratching their heads as they try and figure out what the fuck just happened. After the show ended, there were still quite a lot of people divided by the way this anime portrayed its themes, and now we\'re all here reading one of the many MAL reviews to see what others thought of this experience.So what exactly is Re:Creators? Well, I\'m sure the term Isekai...or ""Trapped in Another World"" is a well-known trope for anime fans. Take one or more pretty ordinary characters from the ""real"" world, and throw them into a fantasy world and see what happens. It\'s a trope that has been done over and over, with many people that love it or hate it. But what if that role was reversed? Take a fantasy character and throw him into the ""real"" world. But wait! We can add more to this! Why not make it so that the worlds our fantasy characters came from are stories created by authors in the ""real"" world, where everyone knows them from an anime, manga or video game? That\'s the story Re:Creators tries to serve to us on its shiny platter, but sadly the content tasted a little off.What the show really wanted to do was ask what would happen if the characters we saw on screen or paper somehow came to realise that they were from a fictional story created for our entertainment. The drama that comes from this idea is where the show shines. A lot of the people that were dragged out of their worlds are heroes, fighting villains or wars and having known what it\'s like to feel like everything is hopeless or knowing the loss of something precious to them. You can imagine if they found out that all the bad things that have happened to them are due to some ""God"" writing out their paths, it might not be very pretty. From a magical girl realising the impact of her abilities on the ""real"" world to a reality-altering villain going with the flow and doing whatever the hell they please, the way the anime showcases the reactions of our cast feels genuine and realistic, creating a variety of different views on this revelation that they all go through. When the show gives us these scenes, it is where it is truly able to express itself the best.The story overall sounds pretty good in the drawing room, but it suffers from slow pacing and exposition. Everything is to build up the last arc, the final battle over the ideals of every character, so a lot of the scenes before it can be quite boring. We have the occasional action and drama that make us go wow and shower applause onto the show, but the rest is just a little bland. There is quite a lot of talking, especially from Meteora Österreich, our friendly neighbourhood narrator, going on and on about the current condition of the ""real"" world that is under a bit of strain accommodating the guests from another world, but it\'s just not entertaining to watch. There needs to be something there to keep our attention on the screen, as we have been given many glimpses into what the show can offer. Sadly, it just spends way too much time on dialogue dumps then exploring the opportunities that are opened with the show\'s premise. It takes forever for anything to happen, and by the time it does, a lot of people like myself have gotten sick of waiting and just spend our time more agitated than excited over the next scene.Looking at the action, at first, it was quite entertaining. It looked really good and was fun to see the characters battle it out a little as they try to figure out where they fuck they were and what the fuck is happening. However, as we reach the later parts of the show, two major issues appear.The first is the abilities. At first, you can get the basic gist of the powers our characters wield. Oh yeah, this girl flies and shoots explosive love hearts while this other guy creates strong gusts of wind with his sword and can summon a spirit to fight alongside him, but soon it gets a little bit harder to follow. We get this new guy that can also summon a spirit and it can travel through reflections to attack, but certain colours applied to the reflection are suppose to change the type of attack? And we have this dating sim heroine that suddenly becomes a super-powered martial artist who can pretty much do whatever the plot wants her to do like create bursts of energy or punch the ground hard enough that she sends out rocks in the direction she chooses? They really need to explain the exact capabilities of each character or we\'re left trying to figure out what the hell a lot of them can actually do.Our second issue is the antagonist, the Military Uniform Princess. She has access to a set of abilities called the Holopsicon, which pretty much allows her to change the plot in her favour and do whatever the hell she wants. You know what this means? She\'s OP. You know what that means? Every battle with her in the second half is predictable as fuck. She\'s basically untouchable until our heroes figure out exactly how to defeat her. Of course, they explain her character in a way that it makes sense for her to be OP, but the fact still stands that it\'s just not entertaining for us to watch her fight anyone, as we all know that none of the cast will be able to damage her at all until the climax, which again took forever due to the tedious pacing of the show.Talking about a member of the cast, we have a pretty good round up characters. Some mech pilots, a magic casting knight, a tutorial NPC and quite a few others that add a lot of variety to the show. Add in their Creators, the authors behind their stories, and you can do a lot with this selection. Most of them get enough screen time so that we can see into who they really are and how they feel about their worlds, although there are a few that are introduced later on that could do with a bit more focus to really bring them up into the spotlight as well.However, with every cast comes an MC, someone who we can place our attention on and guide us through the story. So should it be one of the Creations? Too easy. The Creators? Nah maybe not. How about this random kid that can\'t really do anything for most of the series? Perfect? Souta Mizushino is our useless main character, someone we absolutely have no need for but is somehow our main focus. Of course, the anime does eventually provide us with the reason why he\'s important to the story, but honestly, you could have given that same reason to one of the Creators and just scrapped the kid. He\'s only there to provide some feels when they tell us his relationship to everything. He does become the last trump card at the end to prove he\'s not actually useless, we just had to wait for the perfect moment to make you care about him. Which only made him even more annoying and unneeded.For all the flaws Re:Creators had, I still was able to enjoy what it had to offer. However, all the other factors brought the show down to the point where you need to sit down and contemplate why exactly they messed up this great premise. It had its moments but man was it frustrating at times.P.S. One of the characters that should have but didn\'t have an appearance in the ending... What the fuck now we\'ll never know what happened to them.

In...all it had potential to be a much better show but got wasted in the end. all it had potential to be a much better show but got wasted in the end."", 'I’ve no idea how I didn’t notice this title earlier. It probably got swarmed by a number of other titles, but honestly it’s become a favorite of mine and would definitely recommend watching it. I’ll note out a number of things beforehand, though. This anime’s mere existence breaks the fourth wall and it’s probably the first title to take it even a step further and break the fifth wall (you’ll get what I mean as soon as you see it). One more thing is that people who’re easily offended probably aren’t going to enjoy this. It talks a lot about god, creation and existence and...the story revolves a lot around these.Story: Amazing in every way! Truly an enjoyable one and unique at that as well. The story is basically Hutton’s paradox as an anime. Where stories turn into worlds and merge with the real world which in turn is an anime you’re watching which makes you think you’re part of the anime all the time. Although the story seems to be really crazy, it’s actually very carefully made and presented and it didn’t even use the regular “Anime Logic” we see in most other titles. It explained every abnormality and made reason out of it which is something I find admirable.Art: Two words, BUDGET OVERLOAD! Seriously, throughout the entire thing the animation has amazed me. The fight scenes are so fluid and smooth, each character is well-drawn and despite the fact that I never enjoyed those exaggerated superpowers in any other series, I have to admit that they were an essential part to this anime. One more thing I liked is that despite many types of characters from different genres were brought in together in one the art style felt so natural for them and none felt out of place.Sound: A great OST here. I, myself, prefer it when they use classical music or something smooth, which they did at times, but they used a larger variety of music in order to befit the general atmosphere of the anime. As long as nothing seemed out of place, which is the most important thing an anime like this needs to be wary of, then it gets a thumbs up from me.Character development: Here’s where this anime was about to make me hate it. We have different characters who don’t even come close to each other and are polar opposite natures, yet the story manages to bring them all together in a way that they actually feel related to each other and the story which is good. My favorite character here was Magane who was, indeed, exceptionally developed and you could see the many contradictive aspects of her personality and her true nature gradually growing.Then what disturbed me here? It’s the MC, he’s supposed to be a shy and timid person with a gentle demeanor. However, from the events I’ve seen he’s practically a wuss. Moreover, the entire cast are continuously comforting him through the show with no effect whatsoever. He’s definitely in my top 5 MCs I hate. In either case, he’s not given much screen time compared to every other character in the show that he barely even feels like a MC so I won’t hold that against the anime as a whole.Thus comes the conclusion of this review, this anime is definitely amazing and a must-watch if you’re looking for something with:-Great action scenes-Psychological plot that’s consistent-Plenty of drama and feeling eruptions-OP antagonist loliThis anime is probably not for you if you are:-Looking for something with romance-Not a fan of psychology-Easily offended the story revolves a lot around these.Story: Amazing in every way!

there have been many an anime that has been set in another world, some have been good, while others have been bad, but Re:Creators decides to do the opposite and bring the fantasy beings to our world and the result was quite surprising.Story (9/10)The story begins with Sota Mizushino, who suddenly ends up in an anime, then after encountering a girl in a military uniform, the anime\'s main heroine ends up in the real world with Sota, however more creations are ending up in the real world and Sota must find out why.The first half is very simple and straightforward...as it introduces us the characters and the main villain, but the way these characters are introduced and how they initially react was done very well, I also like how they are able to keep their powers too, because in most anime\'s where a fantasy being comes to our world, they end up having their power reduced a lot and luckily here that doesn\'t happen, so we get some kickass battles along the way.Another thing is the amount of exposition used, some people might think a lot of exposition can be quite a drag and that can be the case for me too, but it was very interesting seeing the characters trying to figure out how to make themselves stronger by interacting with their creators and I also like how making the creations stronger wasn\'t just a simple doddle, there had to be pride and love put into it to make them stronger, so at least it wasn\'t the usual bullsh*t cliched way most anime\'s do it.Even though the first half introduces the characters, there are some surprises in store, like the reasons for each side fighting each other, it gave me a Akame Ga Kill vibe although not as well done, it was still a good attempt and there are even some deaths in the first half, which really surprised me or maybe it was that I haven\'t seen an anime character die in some time, it was still shocking however.The second half of the show mostly concentrates on the build-up to the final battle and the final battle itself, which was absolutely fantastic to watch and yet more characters died during it, even some I wasn\'t expecting to see die, so I\'ll give extra points the show for taking some risks.The only problem I have with the story is the final episodes, because it gets a little confusing with how they defeat the main villain, but it was different than usual so I\'ll give it that and the ending was satisfying too, however if anyone noticed there was one loose end left behind and could bring about an OVA or even a movie.Characters (9/10)The characters were really entertaining, likeable and mostly badass, but there was 1 or 2 characters that did get on my nerves which stopped this show from getting a 10 for me.Sota is the male MC and despite looking like Shinichi from Parasyte, he was a very awkward and shy guy, usually I can stand this, but Sota ended up being my most unlikable character from the show, mainly because he kept holding secrets from his friends that could\'ve helped them figure out who Altair was quicker, luckily this was only in the first half of the show, in the second half he\'s more in the background making you forget he exists until they show him on screen again.Selesia and Meteora are the female MC\'s and are the first creations Sota encounters, both of these two are great and badass characters, although Selesia does feel like a normal main heroine, but that is how she was created and she does have some good moments, mainly because she\'s willing to put everything she has on the line to make sure her friends win the day and to stop the world from being destroyed, sadly though this came at a cost for her.Meteora is a mage, she\'s smart, powerful, but is a gluten and quite mundane, however she ends up being one of the best characters of the show, mainly because she unexpectedly makes random jokes and her monologue for the recap episode solidified her position as the best character, although her screentime in the second half wasn\'t as much compared to the first half, so I kinda missed her during the final fight.Yuuya and Rui are the next two characters that show up, Yuuya for a guy who likes a good fight and shouting, is a very likeable guy usually guys like him are a mixed reception for me, but he was pretty damn cool and does have a serious side of sorts.Rui on the other hand started off pretty annoying for me, because he stomped around and keep whining like a kid, but once the situation started heating up he became more likeable and pretty kickass when he was fighting in his giant mecha.Mamika and Alicetaria are the two female creations who went to the evil side, but despite being on the evil side they had their reasons, Alice was from a world where death was a 100% possibility so her trying to change the world made sense, but Mamika joined only because she attacked the others, but after she confronts them you can see the conflict within about whats right and wrong and which side is the correct one, sadly though her realisation ended up with her getting killed, this made Alice\'s character a little more blind to the situation as grief overcame her actions, until later on where she eventually swapped sides, however her alliance swap was quite short lived.Blitz is another creation who sided with Altair, much like Alice he has lost a lot that he cares about in his story, he likes to work alone and doesn\'t give much of a damn about the others since he is working towards his own goal, which he eventually gets allowing him to go to the other side, but other than looking like a complete badass, there\'s not much else about him.Magane is definitely tied first place with Meteora for best character of the show, because she was neutral in all of this and just went around causing her own mischief, despite looking like an evil girl (which she is) Magane was terrifyingly cunning with her words and no matter what she did, I couldn\'t hate her, she would send chills down my spine, but would also do something cool or funny at the same time.Altair is the main villain of the show and for a main villain, she was actually pretty good, true she didn\'t have that much screentime until the final battle, but she put up a good impression and her reasons for doing what she did, didn\'t seem unreasonable, although the way she was defeated is a little confusing.Art (9/10)This show looked pretty damn good, right down from the creations designs especially Altair who looked menacing as hell, to the battles which were just a joy to watch, although there was a little bit of CGI in there that was good, but bad at the same time, like for example Rui\'s mech looked kickass, but seeing Alice moving around on her flying horse just didn\'t look right.Sound (9/10)The two op\'s were really good, hell I actually can\'t make up my mind which one was better right now, hopefully I will be able to when it comes to my top 10 op\'s, the ed\'s were ok, although they weren\'t that memorable.Something that did throw me off though was, why did Alice\'s horse sound like a motorcycle when it was flying, it just didn\'t make any sense to me.Extra\'s:The action was very well done, whenever a load of exposition had been dumped on you a good fight scene always came afterwards and the final battle was just awesome to watch, the deaths that happen in this show are pretty gruesome as well I mean there\'s a good amount of blood shown.Surprisingly there is some comedy too, although it\'s mainly through either Meteora or Magane, I have to mention how funny the recap episode is, because I see these as a waste of time, but Meteora\'s monologue was just pure genius.Enjoyment (9/10)Overall (9/10)Overall this was a very good show, definitely on my top 10 from this year so far, so if you\'re someone who\'s a little tired of the ""another world"" type anime\'s then you might find this one quite refreshing. as it introduces us the characters and the main villain, but the way

Wondering what would occur when the creators of stories and their creations ended up in the same environment is what caused me to have some high expectations of the anime. If I would describe how I eventually felt about the anime upon its completion, I would say that there was a lot of wasted potential. The story took some time to progress, spending most of time earlier on with character development and setting up the plot of the show. I saw complaints about the pacing but it didn't bother me because I thought...what the show was setting up everything towards would be worth it. Unfortunately the conclusion that the anime received didn't match the build up that had occurred which left me feeling slightly disappointed.I thought the way the characters were handled was okay. Although for as much exposition that took place in Re:Creators, by the end there were quite a few characters I thought that were lacking in development especially those introduced in the second half of the show.The art and animation were great and I didn't have any problems with it. The soundtrack used throughout the show was superb and it was definitely one of the strong points I could note.Overall Re:Creators is an anime that could've been much better but it was good enough that I could recommend to someone to try watching. what the show was setting up everything towards would be worth it.

Like my own, reviews are always biased and based on one's opinion and shouldn't be used as the reason why anyone would hop over something they might've enjoyed if they looked into it. After some episodes you can always drop it, it's not like you have to pay to watch or you have anything better to do with your time.Re:Creators is one of those animes that a lot of the hate comes from the MC...as the MC himself is relatively useless and only causes problems, but this factor is always blown out of proportion. I do admit the MC in this anime is more or less useless and if you have a problem with useless MCs then this show will urk you a few times while watching but bear with it because useful MCs are overrated.Story: The story in itself was enjoyable with nice plot twists and a few teary eyed scenes.  Sometimes it just felt like some things were forced to happen though, so that the story could move on. The villain had a good drive to do the things she did and by the end of the show you could really sympathize with her. The anime being only 22 episodes is actually relatively short. Because it was so short things got resolved pretty quickly. 7/10Art: The art was good but nothing fancy. I like fight scenes where they don't swing once, dodge, then start talking again. This show doesn't do that. Fight scenes are smooth and detailed with swords swinging everywhere, exuploshuns, and blood splashing onto faces. The designs of characters themselves weren't too fancy, pretty much your average good looking animes. 8/10Sound: Sound was pretty hard for me to judge. The openings and endings didn't really stick out to me. I watched them a few times but i never looked forward to them and paid attention to them like i find myself doing for some but i did like them. There were also some scenes that the music played just right and fits perfectly for the scene. Those scenes like attack on titan or boku no hero academia where the hero gives a heroic speech as he's climbing back to his feet while the heroic theme is playing in the background and just as the hero stands up the music hits that button... nothing memorable though. Voice acting by the way was great. Lots of screams. No embarrassed girl studdering moments though. 8/10Characters: Like i said before, many... many people will hate the MC. The MC's biggest role, though, is the end and being a narrator as he basically starts out the story by saying he will tell the story so his like-ability doesn't mean much to the show. The other characters though. The characters had definition, but no background. Each character had a personality you'd find in any other anime, but they don't have the story to make you attached to them. Unfortunately the anime is only 22 episodes and i don't feel there's much more simple details if i read the manga, if there is a manga, because you get the whole story from the anime already so there's not really much space to develop the characters. A character is introduced, you learn a little about them (name, anime, powers, relationships, miniscule information about their past) and they join a team and it moves on. There isn't much building to a character either as they are already predefined by the anime they lived in before they warped to reality. The only change they have is when they tell themselves they've changed a little because of their time they spent away from their stories.  I personally like the characters though even though there was no time to bond with any of them 8/10.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it. 8/10Overall: 8/10.Don't hesitate to watch an anime or let someone decide for you, just Do it. as the MC himself is relatively useless and only causes problems, but this factor is always blown out of proportion.

The exposition was excessively monotone. Everything was mundanely explained by the various colorful characters even when you can logically infer what they meant, and what the stakes likely are (if there really were any). This show just feels like a very convoluted fate series.Story: So we have a mix up of characters all hailing from different sources of media and genres. We have the typical fighting female red-head, stoic and nerdy female mage (who was also the narrator for the most part) , a typical bad-ass sword user, irritable...Mecha pilot, righteous lady knight, a magical human weapon, and two psychopathic reality benders. The first psychopathic reality bender is the main antagonist known as the ""Military Uniform Princess"". She is the one who summons the characters in to our world to somehow attempt to destroy it by dimensional collapse. Our protagonists will attempt to literally re-write history to save the world. This is the basic outline of the story. It sounds kind of amazing, but it isn\'t.You\'ll question the plot and the logical motivations of the characters. At least I did. Here are some questions I had when watching this show.Why won\'t ""Military Uniform Princess"" just initiate all the nukes or directly attack the world if she wants to destroy it? (This was later explained a bit, but still puzzled me.)Why would ""Military Uniform Princess"" summon heroes who would attempt to stop her?What is the purpose of the main male lead character?What is at stake?Why do I care?_________________________The story was pretty forgettable and you\'ll forget that there was anything at stake at all.--------------------------------------Art: Was great for the most part. Everything was looking smooth and good. Action was nice and impactful.Sound: The sound and music was really good as well. The hype was going when the music was, just the talent was wasted on this show.Characters: The characters were somewhat intriguing, but their relationships were ultimately hollow. Most interactions just felt so artificial and forced - from creator to creation, the plot didn\'t do much with the characters other then forcefully move them on with the plot in grinding lock-step. There wasn\'t an urgency to any planning. It seemed as if everyone was playing pretend.Enjoyment: I really wanted to enjoy it, it just was too bad.Overall: I don\'t believe this show is worth wasting time on. Go watch something better.

Go watch something better.', 'I am going to leave my review up to episode 5 below this, more actual version. Some of the complaints are still the same and you are going to see which ones when you actually watch the show. The reason why I\'m gonna leave the older part up, is because I think a lot of people felt similar and dropped the show for those reasons. And I totally understand why someone would drop something over one of those episodes, but if this keeps up, it\'s worth fighting through those. However, even if later episodes are legitimately good, they can\'t undo the damage the first episodes...have dealt to the show.Up until episode 5, the show was somewhat interesting, but boring as dirt in execution. Now I got to episode 9 (since there honestly was nothing else to watch this season) and I must say, a lot of my problems were at least partially fixed.They started to bring in more diversity through Magane (the lying creation) who might just be the biggest plot device ever, but is nonetheless interesting as a character.There area more ""tell"" as opposed to ""show"" scenes now and even when the episode is mostly ""tell"" it\'s at least split into easily enjoyable chunks that develop characters individually or the plot as a whole, which simply wasn\'t the case with previous scenes.What really sold me on the latest 4 episodes, though, was how the characters played off of each other. With the introduction of two more characters who don\'t join one of the two teams it became much more interesting, since it was no longer just a fight between Team good and Team evil, but more of a battle where some aren\'t really sure on which side they belong and some who just like messing with others.Therefore, because I really enjoyed the latest 4 episodes, I will raise the score up to a 6. Consider it more like a 6.5 though.START OF THE OLDER, MORE DETAILED REVIEWRe:Creators reverses the standard trope of a guy being sent into a fantasy world / Video game, by making the characters from different (made-up) pieces of fiction come to life in Japan. This might sound like an iteresting premise, and it is, but the execution is where the whole thing falls flat.What interests me the most about a story like this is the question ""How do those characters react to the new world that they\'re put in"". The show never really focusses on that. Instead, they focus on the conflict between a pseudo-god, in this case the writer, and the creation, being the fictional character, which would be fine, if it wouldn\'t encourage the writer(s) to be lazy in one specific way:The basic principle that is ignored here is ""Show, not tell"" - and boy, do they ignore that principle. Episode 1 and 3 are fine in that regard, but 2, 4 and 5 are basically just exposition. They go into Monogatari-esque dialogue and monologue scenes about some philosophical question, which wouldn\'t be all bad. Monogatari IS one of my all-time favourites. But what this show lacks in contrast to Monogatari is 1.) The interesting character designs 2.) A fitting voice cast (You can\'t torture your audience by making them listen to a monologue by a character that speaks in a monotonous voice) and 3.) Everything else going on on the screen. Monogatari worked, because it was interesting to look at and to follow the conversation. This show doesn\'t work in both regards.Since we\'re already comparing: Let\'s throw in another recent story that is very much comparable to this: Drifters. Both of these shows revolve around characters from different worlds/times (which is basically like being from different worlds) being thrown into a kind of Team Deathmatch and both of them have two opposing camps of characters.Now, why did Drifters work?It had interesting characters which ACTUALLY EXISTED in history, making dynamic Duos like Scipio and Hannibal a pleasure to follow.It had visual identity. A special kind of artstyle that is basically only comparable to hellsing Ultimate.And, to connect this to our last point: It SHOWS more thant it tells.Okay, this has been long enough.

The problem isn\'t the soundtrack itself. It\'s more how they use it. Hiroyuki sawano always does at least a decent job whenever he\'s involved. But this show uses the ""Sawano song"" (The one with the drop - see: AOT, Kabaneri, ...) in very weird scenes. It\'s just as if they were like ""How can we make this scene decent?"" - ""Just throw in some epic music and we\'re done"".

I tortured myself with episode 4 and 5, because I thought ""They can\'t just make 4 exposition scenes and call it an episode, right"" - but they did. twice in a row.Overall: 4.

You know there’s an issue with a story when you ask yourself “Why is he (MC) relevant?” or “Why is he (MC) here?” The only time he becomes somewhat useful when he provides information he was withholding. Also when it comes to his backstory I can’t understand his motivations. Teenage boys are animals so if a cute, talented girl thought highly of him the main character would most likely be...all over it rather than remaining a jealous cunt.The second was that it never really took advantage of the show’s premise. The conversations between the creators and the created were supposed to be the show’s highlight but most of the time it either felt like the bare minimum to justify the character fighting for the creator’s side. The only decent conversation was between Blitz and his creator which broke down to “Why did you do those bad things to me?” “I like making you suffer because it makes me feel good” with no satisfying conclusion. The conversation that we never got to see was the true loss as Magane and her creator would have had an interesting bit of banter. I can’t wrap my head around why they would let Magane kill the creator without talking to them as her character seems to like to have fun taunting the person before killing them.The third was the character motivations. I mentioned my problem with the main character’s motives in his backstory but what about Magane, Blitz, and Aliceteria? What made Magane decide to help out in the end? How could she love humans but kill a random for no reason earlier in the show? Maybe she wanted to keep having fun in the real world (but she lost her powers by the end anyway)? Why did Blitz fight to save the real world for the sake of his daughter then leave the real world where he could be with his daughter for the world where she’s dead? Aliceteria seems like a knight with a strong sense of justice, so why didn't she sense something was fishy when she was recruited by a shady character (even Mamika could tell something was up albeit the real world resembled her own so she had more context). Why would Aliceteria trust Magane (regarding the death of Mamika) when she’s the literal most shady character in the show?I guess a fourth and final issue while not huge is the way Altair got the creations on her side. She told them basically that the creators wrote their lives into stories. Do the creations not have stories in their worlds? Do the creations not understand the seeming harmlessness that goes into making stories? Why would they blame the creators for writing them at all if they had this kind of context?So basically Re: Creators fails in my book because the characters being caricatures aren’t too interesting, the characters don’t feel realistic although it’s really ironic that the characters are doubly not real I would have preferred if I could imagine that they could be people, the character’s motivations aren’t always justified (in their perspective not morally) and it did nothing with its somewhat interesting premise.To get an idea of what would make this show good in my eyes look no further than Fate/Zero. It had more interesting characters and conversations between the characters about ideals and philosophies not to mention the fights were better (if you’re into that sorta thing).I called Re:Creators a failure but it's better than the mediocre high school romance light novel adaptation which inherently is a 5 unless it does something interesting. So a mid-high tier 6/10 because I liked the sunglasses dude a bit not to mention it explores some ideas regarding why people enjoy media. Can't be a 7 because 7 is where I start thinking things are good. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ all over it rather than remaining a jealous cunt.The second was that it never really took advantage of the show’s premise.

Unfortunately, after you get up and walk it off, the train moves on slowly and maintains an agonizingly-slow forward momentum until the very end. What should be a solid second cour now that the show has established its characters and the rules of its world, ends up stumbling and never truly righting itself.The problem with Re:Creators isn\'t a lack of originality (Reverse Isekai is a neat concept seldom employed) or characters, but maintaining...its momentum from the first cour. What was essentially a strong start ended up as a slow finish, what with the sudden drop in animation with fight scenes and basic movement (watch episode 20 in its entirety and you\'ll understand). However, for reasons that are rather mind-boggling, the series invoked Talk No Jutsu too often in the second cour, as if attempting to make up for a perceived absense in the first.While the show isn\'t ""bad"" by any stretch, it seems to forget what it wants to be in the second cour and stumbles to regain its identity before the series ends.

Character dynamics are where this show covers all of it's ground. How do you handle a creator not really caring for there creation and just seeing them as a means to an end? How does a creation deal with their creator being dead? These are a few of the questions they set up and rightfully so. This concept is so foreign that the way it moves through the question kept me on the edge of my seat to see what happens. Sawano killing...it on the music is par for the course and it elevates the crazy setting and narrative with a sheer bombastic quality which will always be great in my book. it on the music is par for the course and it elevates the crazy setting and narrative with a sheer bombastic quality which will always be great in my book."", 'Ok, after seeing so many mixed reviews and landing where I am now, I feel like I need to make a review on THIS MASTERPIECE.This is a spoiler-free review, btw.But I\'ll put a disclaimer out there: If you are not a creative or if you don\'t enjoy stories that are more than just action, you will not enjoy this story. You will not.Going by the pattern of ratings, either you get REALLY LOW or REALLY HIGH, and that says something. This show is not for everyone, and if you don\'t enjoy the creative side, the thinking, writing, explanations, world-building side of a story, then you...will not enjoy this story.Re:Creators, like the premise says, is a story in which the creations of various popular media find their way into their creator\'s world, and after landing here, they end up with one of two motives: 1.) To go back to their world as it was or 2.) to force their stories to change.Re:Creators is just what the title creates, it\'s a story to creators, something that all of us creative types one day dream of: meeting our creations in person. This story is not exactly emotional but merely seeing these creations come to life in this anime, seeing their creators react, et cetera, is enough to make me emotional and even go so far as to tear up. It\'s exciting, it\'s exhilarating!This story is more than just the action, it\'s more than just seeing these OP creations come into the real world. It\'s about the complications of them being here, what it means for them to be here, and even more: the realization of knowing that you had been created by somebody for ""entertainment.""And that is why this story will resound with creators more than the normal viewer, and that is where I presume the low ratings/bad reviews come from. So I will say it again. If you are not a creator or a creative type, or if you are expecting a crazy shounen with tons of action and epic fight scenes (it does have epic fight scenes, though, I\'ll tell you that), then you will not enjoy this anime.And now breakdown, which, now that I\'ve finished the anime, will have my full review!Story: 8/10Brought down from 10/10.Masterful. Absolutely amazing, brilliantly written, and obviously a story written with love and care. The premise is far from original; every creator dreams about being able to meet their creations in real life. It\'s something that we can only dream of. And this story does exactly that, only it thinks about the consequences of something like that happening.It does more than just give us creations coming into their creator\'s worlds. It\'s fleshed out and thought out. It explains things that need to be explained. Now, mind you, there is a LOT of dialogue in the story, which is definitely where many people think it falls flat, but this is where I disagree. The dialogue makes sense for the characters and the story, as they are trying to make sense of what is happening within the story. I cannot think of any other way to make this story work without having the dialogue that it has.It is a story by creators, for creators. Those who build worlds within their minds, who create fictional living beings, fictional interactions... This is a story any creative will love.However, there are some parts that seem either a bit rushed or just sort of quickly brushed aside, which leaves the watcher wanting more. The story is obviously flawed, and things could have been addressed differently... The idea is also far from original, as most every creator has once thought about meeting their creations in-person, but it still doesn\'t change my opinion of it being amazing.Art: 7/10This anime is playing on clichés, so some of the designs are obviously clichés and even callbacks and very wonderful nods to some of the more popular characters in OUR world. One look at the names, at the designs, and you can definitely tell what they\'re referencing. Heck, there are even a bunch of references to other studios, etc in there! But I\'m getting distracted.The art and animation are absolutely gorgeous. There\'s also the fact that the 3D animation in here is actually really well done. I\'m incredibly happy that they\'re finally catching up to the western animation side of things. Nothing looks out of place, nothing looks weird.Perhaps my favorite thing is that there is a slight stylistic change between all the Creations, and that is absolutely masterful from the art director\'s side. It only makes sense, given that most popular stories have very distinct styles (more or less.)As of the end of the anime, I\'m lowering the score of 9/10 to 8/10. Unfortunately it does suffer from some fanservice (for both genders, though mostly for the male gaze), but my biggest critique is perhaps the switch of one character who used to be primarily hand-animated became animated in CG for these last few episodes. I can understand why they\'d do it, considering the scenarios in which the character is in, and the 3D allows for more dynamic shots, but having seen the character primarily in 2D and then suddenly in 3D makes it a bit jarring.The action scenes also retain their intensity, but some of the animation seems a little lazier or rather, rushed.Despite that, it is all definitely still great.Sound: 8/10The sound is amazing. The soundtrack is even moreso. It really reminds you of the other series that TROYCA has worked on, particularly Aldnoah.Zero. It really works in fueling the mood of the story, and setting it, as well.Then, we won\'t even get into the voice acting 8V9 It\'s so incredibly well-done, it has so much emotion in its characters voices that they feel REAL. So an absolute kudos to the voice actors!My only real beef with the sound is that some sound effects are a bit loud or odd, but it doesn\'t distract from the story.Character: 9/10By now you\'re probably thinking that I\'m just being super biased towards the story and only giving it praise... But I am and am not at the same time.I\'m giving it a 9/10 because it\'s definitely working with clichés, but it\'s doing it in such a way that it\'s believable. It\'s referencing to many currently popular stories in our world whose characters are also cliché. Not only that, but to be able to keep the characters in-character? Lordy, that\'s just... Amazing.That being said, there\'s also a LOT of character growth. I\'m sure that anybody who finds out that they were a creation of somebody would never react very positively... in most cases. And then meeting your creator would either change you completely or... who knows.The point here is that these characters stay true to their tropes. The 9 comes from the sometimes-frustrations to them not doing something or doing something that just seems dumb, but it balances out considering the fact of who they are and where they come from. It Makes Sense.These characters Make. Sense.Also a note. The supposed ""plot device"" that some people say that the main character (Sota) has, ie, the ""hidden secret,"" isn\'t exactly a bad plot device. It makes sense. But unfortunately it\'s not something I can delve into due to spoilers. I\'ll just say this: it\'s something that any creative can relate to, because we\'ve all felt it before.Enjoyment: 10/10If I could give it a higher score, I would. I said it in the intro and I\'ll say it again. This story isn\'t exactly an emotional one, but it is definitely something that hits home. Something that most of us creators all dream of happening, and it puts it in an animated format. With characters who have voices, move, live, breath, eat, sleep... It\'s something that can move you simply by Existing.The action scenes are amazing, the dialogue scenes are engaging (given you are the type to enjoy world-building). The characters are enthralling, and the scenes make you feel a wide array of emotions, from anger to fear to sadness to joy. Nothing seems out of place, and the story works well in its own world. Everything Makes Sense.Aside from those in my top 10 (which is actually only like, 7 anime), I don\'t think there has ever been a story that\'s engaged me so far within only two episodes. And I can tell you this now: this is definitely on my top ten.It\'s a show that I will remember for ever and always, and a story I am getting an incredible amount of enjoyment out of.Overall: 9/10So overall, I was trying to give this story a fair and non-biased review, but as a creator, there is just so much that I admire about this story. There is so much that I love. The only semi-frustration I have with it are that the characters do dumb-character things sometimes (like in every other world) but I excuse it because it Makes Sense within the world and for the character. I can\'t see it happening any other way while staying true to the characters.The story has its flaws, though, I\'ll say that. It did some things that I would have liked to see different, things that my Top Two (Gintama and Natsume\'s Book of Friends) were never afraid of doing, but despite that, I still enjoyed the story. I would have enjoyed it MORE if it had done those things, but it doesn\'t stop it from being a great anime.So I\'ll say what I did in the beginning once again: do not let these reviews throw you off. If anything, bare in mind the extreme differences between the bad vs good reviews. They are at the opposite end of the spectrum and for Good Reason. This show isn\'t for everyone, but if you are a creative, if you create stories, create characters, draw them, ANYTHING, if you enjoy looking at the process of creating a story and making it believable, making it Make Sense, I can ensure that you\'ll love this story.A 9/10 overall, but going down as 10/10 on my list because Bias x\'D will not enjoy this story.Re:Creators, like the premise says, is a story in which the creations of various popular media find their way into their creator\'s world, and after landing here, they end up with one of two motives: 1.)

It\'s referencing to many currently popular stories in our world whose characters are also cliché. Not only that, but to be able to keep the characters in-character? Lordy, that\'s just... Amazing.That being said, there\'s also a LOT of character growth. I\'m sure that anybody who finds out that they were a creation of somebody would never react very positively... in most cases. And then meeting your creator would either change you completely or... who knows.The point here is that these characters stay true to their tropes. The 9 comes from the sometimes-frustrations to them not doing something or doing something that just seems dumb, but it balances out considering the fact of who they are and where they come from. It Makes Sense.These characters Make. Sense.Also a note. The supposed ""plot device"" that some people say that the main character (Sota) has, ie, the ""hidden secret,"" isn\'t exactly a bad plot device. It makes sense. But unfortunately it\'s not something I can delve into due to spoilers. I\'ll just say this: it\'s something that any creative can relate to, because we\'ve all felt it before.Enjoyment: 10/10If I could give it a higher score, I would. I said it in the intro and I\'ll say it again. This story isn\'t exactly an emotional one, but it is definitely something that hits home. Something that most of us creators all dream of happening, and it puts it in an animated format. With characters who have voices, move, live, breath, eat, sleep... It\'s something that can move you simply by Existing.The action scenes are amazing, the dialogue scenes are engaging (given you are the type to enjoy world-building). The characters are enthralling, and the scenes make you feel a wide array of emotions, from anger to fear to sadness to joy. Nothing seems out of place, and the story works well in its own world. Everything Makes Sense.Aside from those in my top 10 (which is actually only like, 7 anime), I don\'t think there has ever been a story that\'s engaged me so far within only two episodes. And I can tell you this now: this is definitely on my top ten.It\'s a show that I will remember for ever and always, and a story I am getting an incredible amount of enjoyment out of.Overall: 9/10So overall, I was trying to give this story a fair and non-biased review, but as a creator, there is just so much that I admire about this story. There is so much that I love. The only semi-frustration I have with it are that the characters do dumb-character things sometimes (like in every other world) but I excuse it because it Makes Sense within the world and for the character. I can\'t see it happening any other way while staying true to the characters.The story has its flaws, though, I\'ll say that. It did some things that I would have liked to see different, things that my Top Two (Gintama and Natsume\'s Book of Friends) were never afraid of doing, but despite that, I still enjoyed the story. I would have enjoyed it MORE if it had done those things, but it doesn\'t stop it from being a great anime.So I\'ll say what I did in the beginning once again: do not let these reviews throw you off. If anything, bare in mind the extreme differences between the bad vs good reviews. They are at the opposite end of the spectrum and for Good Reason. This show isn\'t for everyone, but if you are a creative, if you create stories, create characters, draw them, ANYTHING, if you enjoy looking at the process of creating a story and making it believable, making it Make Sense, I can ensure that you\'ll love this story.A 9/10 overall, but going down as 10/10 on my list because Bias x\'D', ""Srly, this is the best anime this year, the character development is almost beautiful in every single way, the gods ones and the bad guys especially Altair, the music and the background ost... Hiroyuki Sawano, what  do you want? its already a masterpiece.The whole story is a new, and a very different concept, this may the misleading reviews, there is no reference, an that's the mistake, don't compare re creators with a classic cross universe, because is NOT THE SAME.This story tells you the perspective from creators, the daily struggle, just to take the attention, the feelings and the  acceptance, on the storyline...taking a side the concept of good or evil. taking a side the concept of good or evil."", ""We cannot talk about the story of an anime that will have more than 20 episodes after just watching the fifth one, they have a lot to explain and maybe for that reason most of the people can say is bored.The art and sound I can say for sure that are pretty good, they are not the best, but they are perfect for acclimating the scenes.This is an anime where you can enjoy a different story and not the typical one, where the main character is video game player and is transported to an RPG world to be a savior.The characters are really...good, there are characters from each famous anime genre. each one has their own feeling and their own way to assimilate the situations. Each one has a similar story but at the same time a pretty different one.It's very interesting for me to imagine the creator and the created living in the same city, the same world. Imagine you are sitting in front of the God you believe in... What would be your questions?

They introduce many characters from a variety of different genres. Ignoring the visuals and voice acting, which are both high quality, the story itself is a complete disaster. Far too many convenient plot devices and asspulls that are only used to sway the audience.They tried too many things and made the antagonist so strong that the story could only be finished a certain way, which lead to a...predictable story. Because they used so many plot devices, none of the conclusion really feels complete and there's no satisfaction at the end. The concept itself was neat, but all in all, the story fails to really reach the audience in an effective way. The best way to explain the series is that it is a self masturbating anime that tries to bridge the gap between a creator(author, artist) and the creation by breaking the fourth wall, but fails to grow past that.The series felt good up until the halfway point. You feel emotions as the events occur and the story keeps going down hill. Then a series of events that can only be described as a mash up just avalanches down your throat to the point you are completely thrown out of the series.

The catch... the writers have to find a way to do this and still make the story interesting to their fans. Ironic that this anime couldn’t make itself...interesting to its own viewers. You have a world where anime creations suddenly come to life along with their overpowered supernatural powers and instead of focusing on that, the show focuses of the writers and artists who drew them... Unfortunately, time which could have been used to build up to the fights and give characters a good backstory, was wasted on pointless dialogue and boring conversations.It wasn’t too bad at the start, especially the first episode which had a lot of good scenes and action with good OST to boot. Characters looked genuinely interesting when they were introduced as well as their powers which made them unique. By the end of the series, none of this mattered however, every character was just an “anime creation that must defeat Altair” clone. With not enough backstory or personality to standout, the show managed to make these originally interesting characters uninteresting.The problem with the show is that they focused too much on the main villain, Altair. Too much of the series was used up in trying to give Altair a good backstory and trying to get viewers to empathize with her, and they didn’t even do a good job with that.There’s only one character who managed to escape being generic in the series, Magane-chan. While every other character basically became a “must defeat Altair” clone, this is the only character who managed to be different, to stay unique. She didn’t have as much scenes as other characters but the scenes she was in had the most impact on the story and made it much more interesting. The only character in my opinion who managed to stay interesting till the end.This show does have some decently animated fights, nothing amazing but decent enough to be entertaining.

It had the makings of a decent anime with an interesting premise, but my god is everything so damn awful about it. The characters are cheesy and over-accessorized anime tropes, which makes sense since they are supposed to be popular anime or manga characters brought to life. The problem is this anime tries to don it\'s professor hat on and wax philosophical for 90% of the dialogue. They can barely exchange names or greetings when first meeting, but have no problem driveling on and on and on about saving, following, or doing...what and whom and when and why in the vaguest most meaningless speeches while attacking one another when there is barely even a plot to work with. You have no fucking idea why there are two opposing sides and why they are fighting each other. One side is following the villain because they heard something about breaking the yoke of the world would give creators more power and allow them to change the tragic worlds their creations came from. The reasoning is ridiculously far-fetched and unproven, a handful of empty words and nothing more, but of course there are idiots who will blindly follow regardless, and worst of all this reason isn\'t even made fully clear until several fights in because their dialogue is so damn vague and worthless. If the other characters were vague, then the rambling drone character known as Meteora is the polar opposite. She explains every situation like an omniscient robot and fully commits to assumptions that the world will be destroyed by the logical conflicts of having anime/manga creations existing in the real world, preaching doomsday and saying something she literally pulled out of her ass with complete conviction and seriousness. And of course everyone including the government and elected officials blindly believe her unconditionally. It\'s like making the character read an outline of the script because the writers knew they couldn\'t actually fill in the plot developments logically or organically. There is even a scene where the JSDF storm a house, guns blazing, because they saw a video of a dorky female knight with a horse and lance abducting a man, and used such dubious evidence to deploy lethal force on purely fantastical assumptions.Then there appears a main character so abhorrent I want to reach out and strangle him each time he appears on screen. He is the much hated stereotypical meek male protagonist, but even more exaggerated and useless. He can\'t speak two syllables without stuttering or pausing, breathing heavy, gasping, or looking completely mortified. His dialogue consists of nothing but ano....eto....sono....desu ga...kamo...chigau...chotto...sumimasen........for an eternity, unable to fully articulate a single thought. This is a communication dysfunction that seems perfectly ""normal"" in Japanese media considering how many damn anime instill their male protagonists with it, an indication of a much bigger societal issue there that needs to be addressed.

Great art, above average animation quality, and an excellent premise. It's very similar in ways to the Directors previous work in Aldnoah:Zero in that Re:Creators does a fantastic job setting itself up and hooking the audience in. The plot seems interesting, the characters are well designed, the budget is ambitiously high, and everything about the show just breathes high...quality.So...how on earth did Re:Creators end up as such a basically average anime, just barely any more enjoyable to watch than your standard seasonal ecchi romcom trash? Well, the first big problem Re:Creators faces is a very weak main character. He seems like a bizarre self insert for a member of the doujin community, except the story never really does a good job of giving him a reason to be there. Most of the time, especially towards the end, he's just a whining crybaby bringing emo nonsense into the plot. There are hints of characterization, and things come very close at times to making him seem almost likeable and with true purpose, but Re:Creators just somehow manages to skim the mark. He's just not a very good centerpiece at all. Main characters are supposed to provide a point of view for the audience to connect with the story, not be a character that cries about his mistakes in life for almost 50% of his screen time.Another big problem with Re:Creators is the terrible pacing. In a well written classic, points of the story are unveiled as the action goes on. But in Re:Creators, they will have extreme action scenes followed then by an entire episode of WORDS WORDS WORDS where the characters all sit around and talk about what is happening. This wouldn't be so bad if the dialogue was intriguing, but a lot of times it is not. Instead, it seems that Re:Creators wants to almost completely spoil itself by going too far and explaining too much instead of saving the information for when it is actually relevant to the story. There are hints in the dialogue of good ideas for a good anime, but that's all they are: hints. A huge portion of my gripe here boils down to the fact that much of what they are babbling on about is essentially babies first existential philosophy lesson. The idea that our perceptions breeds reality through our creativity, and the collective consciousness. Maybe if you are young and haven't heard these concepts a hundred times already, this dialogue might seem deep and intriguing. But if you have been down this road before, you will quickly recognize what Re:Creators has to offer in this respect as a watered down version of more inspired ideas.In the end, Re:Creators results in a sub-par story that seems like an excuse to have a well animated battle-royale style fight scene break out from multiple characters of very different backgrounds. You got your magical girl, your ecchi battle girl, your Tohou girl, your dude with his giant mecha, your persona character clone, etc. It would not be inaccurate to compare Re:Creators to Dragon ball Z in this regard.Verdict: Re:Creators can be an enjoyable anime.

Either your like me and you loved it to death, or you think its boring and doesn't offer much in the way of substance.But that is kind of understandable. Due to this show's nature, the deeper meaning behind why it is written the way it was is likely to be lost on a lot of people that are not themselves a Creator.I am a writer, and have been writing for practically a decade, so watching a show about the nuance of what it means to create a world and have writers literally meeting...and talking with the characters of their own works is something that not only intrigues me on a conceptual level, but causes me to deeply identify with the people and narrative of the show as I begin to put myself in their shoes and picture myself meeting my own creations if they were brought into the real world.But like I said, if you are not a Creator - or at least an analytical thinker - then this nuance is more than likely going to fly right over your head. It won't intrigue you the same way it intrigues people like me because you can't relate to the ideas and situations being presented in the show.Re:Creators is a brilliant but niche series, made by Creators - FOR Creators, and I completely understand why people outside that audience wouldn't be able to get into this show in the same way I do. and talking with the characters of their own works is something that not only intrigues me on a conceptual level, but causes me to deeply identify with the people and narrative of the show as I begin to put myself in their shoes and picture myself meeting my own creations if they were brought into the real world.But like I said, if you are not a Creator - or at least an analytical thinker - then this nuance is more than likely going to fly right over your head.

The trailer in one part shows a mix of characters interacting with one another backed by soft music that seems to indicate friendships being formed by these other-dimensional characters, and then advertises giant mechas, some pegagus knight, and katana-wielding warriors all battling one another backed by the music of Sawano Hiroyuki. You never get to see any of...the exhilarating fights you wanted.There are a few things that Re:Creators does well. In particular it shows a reasonable way how anime/game/LN characters would react if they came to the real world. The idea that your existence was but an entertainment piece for a bunch of humans who really don't have any amazing powers, nor do they have anything resembling gods as one would think of their creators. There is a well-rounded cast of characters that deal with the situation by trying to get back to their own world, some that try to fix their own story for the better, others who don't give a shit and are in for the ride. Something I thoroughly enjoyed was the idea of a magical girl from a kid's anime coming to the real world, then having to deal with the fact that all the tropes and cliches associated with her world doesn't apply to the real world. Her powers hurt people, her enemies don't simply get defeated and turn to her friends, and there are lots and lots of bad people. You're in reality now kid.But beyond that Re:Creators falls short. At some point in the anime it turns in to some meta-story about how the humans of the world have to accept and love the stories of the Creations for the heroes of the show to win and gain new powers. By that it is of course trying to be cute by saying the anime itself needs YOUR approval to succeed and it eggs on about that for way too long. All of the fights you were hoping to get are all droned out by characters talking way too much and explaining the current events of the story. At some point it even makes fun of the character that was supposedly the main heroine from the first episode and trailers, Selesia, as having been useless throughout show. Frankly none of it is clever or funny as the writers of the show like to think. It's the poorest form of lampshading trying to cover up bad writing.By far the worst thing about the show is the main character Souta, a spineless, useless, and utterly boring character with the personality of a cardboard box. Every time he is on screen he either the background explainer of new Creations showing up or whining about he is a failure of a person. He is the type of character that makes you beg for him to shut up so you can actually see the viewpoints of the other far more interesting characters. I would say Souta killed half my enjoyment every time the anime tried to pretend he was important and integral to the story.In the end Re:Creators is a very mediocre show. It should have stuck to what it was advertising rather than trying so hard to be clever with meta.

There are many and many dialogues in every episode but I reinforce that this is an extremely positive point since 100% of the dialogs are interesting. They are characters developing theories and hypotheses, speculating and trying to understand how everything works and what is the limit of it all.The characters had an excellent introduction. By the time I do not see any cliché happening which is a plus point, they are breaking several cliches.The characters have strong and...unique personalities and it is very easy to like each one, at first that seems to be the antagonist of this anime, it is very mysterious (not a typical villain who explains his goals or anything), so I say better not only This character but the whole story has many and many mysteries and questions that make you very anxious and curious.

Pretty interesting, right?Wrong.The reason why these story\'s are made is because our world is boring. Inverting the traditional roles completely defeats the point of these narratives....Ex: Dragon maid.This anime has the same premise so therefore suffers from the same problems of REC.

It never tries to be anything more.And that\'s where Rec falls flat on it\'s face.It tries so hard to invert the formula that it forgets why the formula worked in the fist place.It\'s basically amateur hour, where the writers forget the most basic story telling principles for the sake of being ""different"".Here you have (inexplicably) one the most abhorrent anime tropes of all time, in the form of a protagonist that is nothing but a beta, useless, wuss of a straight male.

It wouldn\'t be weird if not for the fact that many other worse anime had similar or higher scores.My first impression for this anime was a bit sceptical. I\'ve heard so much good opinions yet the first episode seemed like a generic mash of typical very different characters and personas that you may see in any other medicore anime.I didn\'t quit watching obviously. I hoped that I will survive those 22 eps and give it a score but the second and so on episode/s...completely changed this anime. Story got better, characters started to be integral and natural. The music was really amazing. I was really amazed by the anime. It may have been too short (I\'ve seen some people saying that the studio was struggling with integrating many parts of the original series into the anime), last few episodes had some dialogue mistakes (maybe not mistakes but it felt somewhat bizarre and hilarious when it supposed to be dramatic. You\'ll see for yourselves).So this is more or less my opinion and side notes for this series now to the particular aspects!Story-As you get from the synopsis, the story revolves about a teen boy and characters that came alive from manga, novels and anime.At first it may seem kind of generic and with many plot holes, but as the story gets further, most things get unique and really immersive. It was dramatic, had good plot twists. I really really enjoyed it.Art-It was great, I loved the way those characters were were made and the whole backgrounds, it was really pretty and comfortable to look at.Sound-I\'m kinda music whore. If the anime has good music then I\'m in. The muisic here was somewhat similar to the kill la kill series (main theme atleast, it was different in many ways but the particular fighting theme that was always in the background was marvelous. So was the opening and ending music. Obviously voice actros did there job perfectly. I loved Chikujoins voice especially.Character-Well, as much as every character was kinda generic (they had those generic aspects of themselves because of the fact that the whole anime kinda shows how hard it is to stay in the business and how hard it is to be unique as a creator), they still were very enjoyable with quite a particular backstory (kinda sad that we didnt see too much of Mirokujis and Chikujoin\'s backstory, we just got some verbal exposition).  It was really easy to get immered by them. Though I really had a feeling that many characters were basically ripping off other known characters from different anime\'s and just mashing them together (neon genesis evangelion, monogatari, cowboy bebop, any shounen fantasy ""in game"" anime, shaman king, k project, etc. especially with Kanoya and Chikujoin)Overall:I really loved this anime, it was entertaining, had a message to it, had magnificent music and good characters with reallly good narration and action. completely changed this anime.

Has anyone ever considered them as creators of many different worlds just by turning their imagination into words of works of art? They create stories, create characters, their looks and personalities, so can we still say that they don't exists? Sounds more like philosophy to me than an anime setting, but that's exactly what made Re: Creators one of my favorites this year.There are many things that turned Re: Creators into a masterpiece, but the most important one is undoubtedly the uniqueness of the story. Just as I thought that anime stories are...slowly all becoming one and the same, Re: Creators showed that the industry has yet another ace up its sleeve. The setting and the whole 'Can creators be considered gods?' theme is so intriguing that it made me watch the first 20 episodes all in one go. I don't usually watch more than 15, but I guess I broke my personal record. The anime delivers a highly interesting and exciting story that keeps you on tenterhooks from the first to the last episode. Did I mention the roller coaster of emotions you feel while watching this show? No?Re: Creators is a story where every single creation (the fiction character that came to the real world) has its own emotional side story. They carry the hardship and the scars of their world to the real one in hope to convince their creators to help them. Most of the side stories are heartbreaking and emotional tales, especially the one that follows our protagonist\xa0Souta Mizushino.But enough with emotions, let's talk about the action. An anime that literary combined magic, fantasy, mecha, demons, knights etc cannot be bad when it comes to the action. As expected, the anime is full of exciting battles and amazing fight scenes, particularly in the last third of the show. Everyone is fighting in their own way, whether he or she is a knight, a magical girl or just an ordinary detective with a gun. I enjoyed the action to the fullest and I am sure that you will too.In short, Re: Creators has a unique and extremely exciting story that has a deep, nearly philosophical core in the middle. Wrapped up with moving and intriguing side stories, as well as with amazing action, Re: Creators clearly shows that the anime industry still has some bright days ahead.CHARACTERS 👩👦Re: Creators is an anime that has many different characters where each and every one of them has a unique and distinct personality. As I mentioned before, one thing that makes all the characters come to life are their intriguing background stories. But what's more important and entertaining are the relationships between the 'creators' and their 'creations'. It was also really moving to see how the creators actually care for their creations, rooting and trying to protect them during fights, crying for them after they die etc. It is just interesting to see how their relationships grow and affect their personalities. We have definitely seen characters like these in other anime before, but it is the relationships between the characters that are really important here.ANIMATION AND STYLE 💻I'll just mention one thing-Episode 21. Just this Summer I've done a blog post,\xa0My Top 5 Most Beautiful Anime Moments and I actually considered editing the post and put the whole 21st episode somewhere in the top 3. It was breathtakingly beautiful, just as the rest of the anime. Candy for the eyes. Everything about the animation and the style is perfect, from the backgrounds to the character designs. I've loved it all.CONCLUSION 📌Not that I just enjoyed watching this anime, but it actually got me thinking about some trivial things like whether we can call some things non-existent just because they are a product of our imagination. They exist in our thought, doesn't it mean that they are real? But enough of that, the anime has other qualities that made it a true masterpiece.

As excited as I would be of this premise, the version of this premise in my head was also filled with cliches... cliches are hard to avoid.

You\'re only going to get that in Re:Creators.Complaint:There are long monologues in this show; I hate it.Plot Twist/Not-A-Plot Twist:I can understand that some people watched this expecting action, explosions, etc. and were put off by some of the monologues. However, as an older and long-time fan of anime. I personally like the seinen, reflective  touches. The show will seem silly at times, but other times, its deeper that what you would initially expect, and during those deep moments the show taught me things that changed my perception, as anime fan/critic.

If you like them, its a bonus.Complaint:The long monologues, etc made the first half feel like a cash grab.Plot Twist/Not-A-Plot Twist:Yea, it kind of felt like that, but then I look at my job, and then realize we all need to make some money.

The show takes itself seriously when teaching seinen lessons on life, but otherwise during action scenes, etc the show doesn\'t take itself seriously to the point of becoming campy; its a \'fun\' show3.

Really, a tragical one. I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i\'m kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn\'t so original, and that\'s valid both for personality and appearance, but they\'ve managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that\'s enough.Re:Creators isn\'t a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, even...too smooth; in what sense? It\'s predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can\'t stand that a series with a nice potential isn\'t supported by a strong and ""aggressive"" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i\'m so far from being an expert in the field, so i\'m going to stop the moaning now.Overall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it\'s pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice.

The literal idea of creation, making a character, a story, a world from merely your imagination is very intriguing. “It is the viewers of a story that gives the story meaning.” While this anime is certainly not the first to bring in this concept, it is one of the few that focus in on this. In an attempt to blend well animated action with interesting philosophical topics, the show draws in numerous different character all without quite enough screen time for me to consider as well developed as I would like. It’s pacing can be strange at times...and due to the nature of the story being told, convenient plot developments are something of a given. However, despite its failing, Re:Creators is a very entertaining and enjoyable anime and is definitely worth more than the sum of its parts.This review is meant to be spoiler free. However, it is my first review, so I apologize in advance if anything slips through. However, for those who wish for my quick thoughts, they are as follows. You should watch this show, it’s quite entertaining. Know that as a personal preference, I’m a sucker for melodrama, which this show does have quite a bit of. There are a whole slew of characters, each of which are looking for their own character development afterall. But if you can make your way through any other action anime with their weapon names and illogical actions, you should have no problems with this either.Story: 7/10Honestly, I want to give this story a higher rating, I really do. I enjoyed it very much. But I can’t in good faith put it any higher than it already is. And that’s for a few reasons. First is the pacing. The show is rather inconsistent in it’s pacing. It will throw you into emotional development scenes with multiple characters being effected, before suddenly throwing you into a timeskip of mystery length. There were portions of the show where people who say something along the lines of, “Hey it’s been a while...” only to have me think back, “Hasn’t it only been a day or two?” Now, I’ve definitely seen shows with worse pacing problems, but seeing characters set in a ruin building for six months just doesn’t really sit well with me. But I’d like to end this section on a positive note, so know that I really enjoyed the beats of the show. When I watch most shonen, I want to slam my head into the wall when I feel the plot armor building, but the show does a good job making plot armor feel like a character quality. Despite what you might imagine, very few problems are solved because someone screamed their name loudly and decimated the enemy, which is a great plus!Art: 7.5/10Again, I would love to give this a higher score! But I guess my bar is rather high when it comes to animation and art. All the character designs were good, they all looked different enough to get the point across, and Altair constantly had too many moving parts, what more could you ask for? Since many of the characters were troupes from their respective genres, their appearances matched as well. But while by the end I had grown to like the look of the characters, as they were being introduced, they did not inspire anything other than an understanding of the troupe of the character. Now the animation is a mixed bag. For the most part, it is smooth and consistent. However, whenever a CG machine is trying to fight a 2D character.... Well, it reminds me how weird it would actually look to see character from different mediums fighting on a screen. I don’t know if I was the only one irked by this, but it really brought down the general animation quality for me. But overall, pretty good animation.Sound: 8/10Now out of all the categories, this is probably the most subjective in a review, since taste in music changes from person to person. So all I can say here is that the music throughout the series is consistent. There are a reasonable amount of musical scores, and while none have made it on my favorite OST’s list, I can find nothing to complain about either. All in all, it does a good job of creating it’s intended mood.Character: 7.5/10Let me preface this, I love... well most of the characters in this show. Despite their troupis nature, I found them all to be very endearing, from the stereotypical heroine, to the magical girl, to bishonen who swings around a wooden kendo stick.... However, I can’t give this category a higher rating in good faith. Despite how often the people in the show keep telling you they’ve changed, in reality most of them have not. There were just so many character. I really think if this was a 25 episode series instead of 22, perhaps they could have fleshed out just a few more of the secondary characters, since in my opinion, the best portions of the show were the episodes focuses on any individual character. So while the score is low, my personal liking to these characters is much higher.Enjoyment: 10/10This section is simple, the show is enjoyable. Honestly, I almost can’t say why this show is so entertaining. In a time where so many isekai shows exist, the concept itself was probably enough to get me hooked. All I can say is, this show was definitely made for anime fans, as it isn’t scared to face many of troupes that exist head on.Overall: 8/10When I think about this show, I cannot say that this show will go down in the annals of history as a must watch. In fact, much of its appeal comes from the time of its release. However, this is definitely one of those shows that is better than the sum of its parts. It is overall well put together, and even the recap episode was amusing to watch! If you find the time to watch a generally light hearted show that jumps around genres and can sometimes be oddly paced, I recommend you give Re:Creators a shot. and due to the nature of the story being told, convenient plot developments are something of a given. However, despite its failing, Re:Creators is a very entertaining and enjoyable anime and is definitely worth more than the sum of its parts.This review is meant to be spoiler free. However, it is my first review, so I apologize in advance if anything slips through. However, for those who wish for my quick thoughts, they are as follows. You should watch this show, it’s quite entertaining. Know that as a personal preference, I’m a sucker for melodrama, which this show does have quite a bit of. There are a whole slew of characters, each of which are looking for their own character development afterall. But if you can make your way through any other action anime with their weapon names and illogical actions, you should have no problems with this either.Story: 7/10Honestly, I want to give this story a higher rating, I really do. I enjoyed it very much. But I can’t in good faith put it any higher than it already is. And that’s for a few reasons. First is the pacing. The show is rather inconsistent in it’s pacing. It will throw you into emotional development scenes with multiple characters being effected, before suddenly throwing you into a timeskip of mystery length. There were portions of the show where people who say something along the lines of, “Hey it’s been a while...” only to have me think back, “Hasn’t it only been a day or two?” Now, I’ve definitely seen shows with worse pacing problems, but seeing characters set in a ruin building for six months just doesn’t really sit well with me. But I’d like to end this section on a positive note, so know that I really enjoyed the beats of the show. When I watch most shonen, I want to slam my head into the wall when I feel the plot armor building, but the show does a good job making plot armor feel like a character quality. Despite what you might imagine, very few problems are solved because someone screamed their name loudly and decimated the enemy, which is a great plus!Art: 7.5/10Again, I would love to give this a higher score! But I guess my bar is rather high when it comes to animation and art. All the character designs were good, they all looked different enough to get the point across, and Altair constantly had too many moving parts, what more could you ask for? Since many of the characters were troupes from their respective genres, their appearances matched as well. But while by the end I had grown to like the look of the characters, as they were being introduced, they did not inspire anything other than an understanding of the troupe of the character. Now the animation is a mixed bag. For the most part, it is smooth and consistent. However, whenever a CG machine is trying to fight a 2D character.... Well, it reminds me how weird it would actually look to see character from different mediums fighting on a screen. I don’t know if I was the only one irked by this, but it really brought down the general animation quality for me. But overall, pretty good animation.Sound: 8/10Now out of all the categories, this is probably the most subjective in a review, since taste in music changes from person to person. So all I can say here is that the music throughout the series is consistent. There are a reasonable amount of musical scores, and while none have made it on my favorite OST’s list, I can find nothing to complain about either. All in all, it does a good job of creating it’s intended mood.Character: 7.5/10Let me preface this, I love... well most of the characters in this show. Despite their troupis nature, I found them all to be very endearing, from the stereotypical heroine, to the magical girl, to bishonen who swings around a wooden kendo stick.... However, I can’t give this category a higher rating in good faith. Despite how often the people in the show keep telling you they’ve changed, in reality most of them have not. There were just so many character. I really think if this was a 25 episode series instead of 22, perhaps they could have fleshed out just a few more of the secondary characters, since in my opinion, the best portions of the show were the episodes focuses on any individual character. So while the score is low, my personal liking to these characters is much higher.Enjoyment: 10/10This section is simple, the show is enjoyable.

It is overall well put together, and even the recap episode was amusing to watch! If you find the time to watch a generally light hearted show that jumps around genres and can sometimes be oddly paced, I recommend you give Re:Creators a shot.', 'Creation is a unique process of the ability of us humans to be able to make something out of nothing, from huge fictional worlds and even more human-like characters if need be. Re:Creators sees what happens if creations created for various sorts of media interacted with our real world.To be completely honest here, LA was hooked onto Re:Creators from the very first episode, from the mere concept of having anime or game characters interact with the real world was fascinating and as a sorta reverse ""transported into fantasy world"" concept that was refreshing to say the very least, what\'s more is that LA loves meta-narratives...and this anime is all about it!But before you take this review like LA is an outright fanboy of this anime, LA does see what some detractors see from this anime though not completely.For one, LA gets that Re:Creators can be an extremely dialogue exposition heavy story for people to get behind, with episodes DEDICATED to explaining the concept of a certain rules by our exposition fairy Meteora Österreich voiced by Inori Minase (who is actually the tutorial guide character so that makes sense, it\'s in her nature to explain) for the new anime/game characters living in the real world and this can easily detract people wanting more action instead. To this flaw\'s defence and LA agrees with this to a certain degree but LA thinks this had to be done intentionally as to place rules for this anime (and not but that a bit later...) so that this anime itself wouldn\'t lose it\'s plot and go into chaotic writing it would have gotten into.Next are certain characters flaws that would have irritated some people. The biggest one being Sota, our main narrative focus protagonist. Sota voiced by Saiki Yamashita is your ordinary high school student however he subtly has links to our main villain of this anime Gunpuku no Himegami. The problem with Sota is that although he has baggage and guilt that doesn\'t allow him to act through the majority of this anime, he comes off as a coward running away from his problems (and nearly getting people killed in the process) however LA does sees that his guilt and baggage to be interesting for a main character and how he interlaces into the plot (albeit rather late in the game). Next is Gunpuku no Himegami voiced by Aki Toyosaki, who is an almost GOD TIER villain considering her powers and her goal is a rather typical one (one of world destruction through elaborate means). However be it LA\'s bias that LA LOVED this mysterious main villain of the series not only for her badassness and overpowered nature but her mysteriousness is what kept LA\'s interest, HOWEVER with the finale did downplay her though LA would talk about that later.Now for probably one of the most important flaw LA would need to talk about and that is the notion of characters being stereotypical characters from certain animes, such as Selesia Upitiria voiced by Mikako Komatsu as the tsundere-ish character you see in light novels to Yuuya Mirokuji voiced by Kenichi Suzumura as the typical rival character with a loose temper, Mamika Kirameki voiced by Rie Murakawa as the typical magical girl and Alicetaria February voiced by Yoko Hisaka as the tragic hero you see in dark fantasy manga\'s. However with the ""rules"" of this anime, the ""stereotypical"" notion of most of these characters are largely changed by the end of it and they become their own person outside of their anime/game origin.So about placing rules into this anime then not, that comes in the form of Magane Chikujouin voiced by Maaya Sakamoto who utilizes lies as her powers thus able to ""contradict"" certain rules of this anime at times, she being unpredictable and wanting to cause chaos in the world ""because she wants to"" makes her also interesting though by the second half of the anime, it\'s entirely focused on taking down Gunpuku no Himegami makes her limelight dim significantly (though the times she did appear, she DID cause a HEAP of chaos, internally to the majority of the characters and to Sota even), in essence, she\'s Meteora\'s order to her chaos. Now does LA think that just having a character that is able to contradict certain rules of this anime make it a pass?...well no, she\'s not a god....Gunpuku no Himegami is, LA can see her get away with some situations especially when it concerned the chaos of internal relations of certain characters (Alicetaria to Meteora especially) but also the final climax but she too is restricted by some rules in comparison to Gunpuku no Himegami...she\'s a secondary villain and she KNOWS it.The animation by TROYCA was done great, sure sometimes the animation dipped at times but when they needed to bring their all (as in fight scenes) it was greatly done. However the more dialogue heavy scenes had sometimes dip in quality...still consistent for the majority of the time. LA loved the exotic character designs and yes for the many fight scenes they did great in animating it (LA just wished some of the fights lasted longer which could be a flaw in itself but LA thinks the anime intentionally went with the Fate/Zero plot formatting for cool down periods for the animation).Voice acting was actually decent, from Inori Minase\'s deadpanned yet slightly inflected tone (which gets snarkier down the line) to Yoko Hikasa voicing a badass character with a tragic backstory (she Hitome Nabatame now?) but what caught LA offguard was Sora Amamiya voicing Rui Kanoya the MALE mecha guy of the series. As for LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime, it would go quite easily to Aki Toyosaki as Gunpuku no Himegami, sure it\'s her playing against the type character let alone voicing an outright villainous character but this role clearly showed that Aki can go crazy with villain roles and DO THEM GREAT (albeit the tactical badass villain more or less). Overall, this voice cast is great with what LA presumes that the voice cast was intentional in both stereotyping and playing against the type for a reason.So on speaking of Gunpuku no Himegami, the finale. ALOT of people would be saying it\'s an anticlimax and yes LA agrees with this, however considering the MANY implications with anime has with the rules of this anime AS well as Gunpuku no Himegami having reality warping god like powers and FATE going against her, LA presents the question of ""what other way was there?"", yes the finale downplays Gunpuku no Himegami though develops her in the process of what she TRULY was suppose to be but at the cost of a good climax to this anime finale, but again ""what other path could she have done to save the situation?"". This finale may be anticlimactic, however considering that before that we had a HUGE fight and the ""fighting"" wasn\'t the point but Gunpuku no Himegami herself (and by extension Sota)...LA can let this anticlimax go and accept it as in.Due to how seeped in nature Re:Creators is in it\'s meta-narrative and LA just loving this concept, Re:Creators likes to play with this concept from the aforementioned notion of stereotypical characters changing while they are in the real world, genre savviness from certain characters to how audience acceptance is not just feedback for the in-universe creators but works into the anime in differing ways to shape the final arc of Re:Creators and even a recap episode where Meteora is VERY tongue and cheek, snarky as hell and uhhh ""reimagining"" recapping the events halfway through the anime. The meta-narrative does go deeper when it comes to Gunpuku no Himegami where her mere existence is due to this and the preparations towards beating her is essentially a crossover in-universe fight against her within the narrative to the in-universe audience that their watching a Special Anime Crossover.Re:Creators\' theming of creation does come up alot (it\'s in the name of course it would), complimenting the fact of the process of creation no matter what it is, meaning that having the passion and the drive to create stories, characters and heck LA might lump reviews in there can be for the better not just for yourself, but to other people who see your creations and them in turn get inspired to do the same.Re:Creators isn\'t a perfect show, far from it, it has it\'s multitude of problems from plot progression and character flaws, but concept-wise was an interesting look and a refreshing take as to what happens when anime and game characters interact with the real world and the implications it has. This even being an original anime directed by Ei Aoki (of Fate/Zero and Aldnoah.Zero fame) and Rei Hirose (of Black Lagoon fame) being the original creator and character designer of Re:Creators and even Hiroyuki Sawano doing the music composition for this anime tells alot of what they wanted to do with this anime...Make Last Action Hero: The Anime.Joking aside, Re:Creators was a blast to watch even in it\'s slowest and low moments and with it\'s concept of anime characters living in the real world was a refreshing take on the ""transported to another world"" setting that\'s over-saturating the genre. Re:Creators may have it\'s flaws but what anime doesn\'t have flaws? Having a Creation being perfect defeats the point, the creation having flaws gives room for them to grow to be an even better Creations as such in the case of Re:Creators. and this anime is all about it!But before you take this review like LA is an outright fanboy of this anime, LA does see what some detractors see from this anime though not completely.For one, LA gets that Re:Creators can be an extremely dialogue exposition heavy story for people to get behind, with episodes DEDICATED to explaining the concept of a certain rules by our exposition fairy Meteora Österreich voiced by Inori Minase (who is actually the tutorial guide character so that makes sense, it\'s in her nature to explain) for the new anime/game characters living in the real world and this can easily detract people wanting more action instead.

Re: Creators tenta trazer de forma convincente o embate entre criadores e personagens. As implicações de uma criação em saber que o seu mundo de sofrimento é parte do espetáculo de alguém bem como  a crueza do criador em retratar o seu sofrimento. O mérito dessa obra que é bem escrita, é claro, recai sobre o roteirista e também diretor, que conseguiu criar uma lógica nos diálogos de modo convincente. Embora algumas pessoas reclamem de “excesso de diálogo”,...eu não levo isso em consideração para dizer se foi um ponto baixo na obra. O único ponto baixo, eu diria, foi a falta de um melhor aproveitamento da ação, algo que para mim foi superado pela boa escrita e o bom desenvolvimento. E, embora o protagonista tenha tido um desenvolvimento demorado, ele [o desenvolvimento] no fim foi convincente.Nenhum personagem deixou de ter importância, todos tiveram importância singular. Algumas obras tentam trabalhar as bases lógicas de uma teoria dentro do seu universo, e ao invés de realmente ser algo instrutivo acabam sendo maçantes. E, para torná-las ainda pior, até mesmo suas propostas não são boas o suficiente, além de terem personagens subdesenvolvidos e um desenvolvimento [no enredo] que pode matar alguém de tédio, um bom exemplo, obras como Mahouka: Mahouka cujo diálogo é chato e os personagens não têm carisma algum, faz uma mistura de desenvolvimento de sua lógica por trás do uso da magia no âmbito militar com personagens realmente descartáveis e desinteressantes. Re: Creators, por outro lado é diferente, tem um diálogo lógico, bem centrado e bem desenvolvido que, embora possa parecer maçante para alguns, sempre empurra o espectador adiante sem cair no despropósito. Um único episódio de diálogo de Re: Creators valem os 17 que eu assisti de Mahouka, os quais eu odeio de todo o meu coração. Enfim... estes foram somente exemplos lol. Re: Creators pode não ser chamado de uma obra prima, mas com certeza é uma obra excelente e interessante trazendo um tema que [pelo menos para mim] é realmente original. E se saiu bem nisso.[Please use the translator to understand my language] eu não levo isso em consideração para dizer se foi um ponto baixo na obra.

RE:Creators can simply be described in one word and that word is fun. Everything from the plot, the soundtrack and the characters are what made this show an absolute pleasure to watch. (Another great thing is the minimal amount of fan service and oversexualization of characters/scenes which would have completely ruined the show.)Story - 8/10RE:Creators might not have the best plot ever written but it is without a doubt a original one. The plot is...essentially a reverse Isekai with just a boatload of personality. One of the most intriguing parts of the plot was the relationships portrayed between the Creators and the Creations. It made for really interesting dialogue and scenarios between the Creations as they questioned their creators motives in creating worlds which in many cases were horrible for the majority of characters as they were the MC\'s in their respective worlds. Another part of the plot which I absolutely adored was the massive blend of various genres. You have Mecha, Shounen, Romance, Mahou Shoujo, Seinen, Mystery and Horror. This made for a truly entertaining watch as it hardly ever happens where you have such a wide variety of genre\'s, without the show becoming edgy or lazy. The only thing which I have to complain about was the pacing of the show. As nice as it was to watch the world out of the perspective of the Creators/Creations, sometimes the transition between action and dialogue wasn\'t as smooth as it could be.Art - 8/10I don\'t have much to say about the art of RE:Creators. The action scenes were really well made and got the adrenaline pumping. CGI used for the Mechs were really nice because didn\'t have a constant transition between 2D and 3D which made the scenes feel more realistic. The character design for the Creations were the embodiment of the genre\'s which they belong to and it was really nice to see how the designs were kept as close to their genre\'s roots as possible.Sound - 9/10What a great OST! One of the best parts of the series is how the music is used to further enhance the atmosphere of the current scene, especially the fight scenes in the show. Everything from the sounds of the mechs to the explossions from our Magical Girl, to the clashing sounds of the knights were all designed well and felt authentic and original. The OP and ED were fun to listen to and had some fantastic vocals. The seiyuu all performed their roles admirably as the choice of cast perfectly complemented the characters personalities.Character - 9/10The aspect of the show which RE:Creators excelled at - at least in my opinion - was the diversity of characters. The dialogue by the Creations were thought provoking as they question the meaning of their suffering and the horror they felt when learning that their twisted worlds were created for so called ""gods"" amusement was really sad to behold. Something which I found to be very satisfying was when Creations came to the world of their Creators, they weren\'t bound by a fate written by some higher power and were able to make choices which they normally wouldn\'t be able to describe. The central antagonist ended up being a character who I can truly feel for as the reasons behind her motivations were for the sake of someone broken by the envy of human beings. One of the coolest aspects of the show was how the show explored the creation of media from the eyes of authors and artists, and allowed me to learn more about the writing process.Enjoyment - 10/10Where else do you find an anime about magical girls, mechs, sharpshooters, knights, psychopaths and writers, all rolled into one without the need to satisfy the populace? The combination of the various tropes and genre\'s were an absolute joy to behold and I wouldn\'t mind to see similar series to appear in the near future.Overall - 9/10If you are looking for a show which simply relies on its enjoyment factor to be successful this show is for you. Their is something for everyone to see in RE:Creators and I would highly recommend the series to anybody. When you grow tired of all the edgy bullsh*t and fan service, come watch a show purely fueled from nostalgia and fun!RE:Creators might not be the best written or most beautifully drawn anime but it provided me with a show which I can simply enjoy for what it is, a fun, heartwarming action series.Thanks for taking the time to read my review! essentially a reverse Isekai with just a boatload of personality. One of the most intriguing parts of the plot was the relationships portrayed between the Creators and the Creations. It made for really interesting dialogue and scenarios between the Creations as they questioned their creators motives in creating worlds which in many cases were horrible for the majority of characters as they were the MC\'s in their respective worlds. Another part of the plot which I absolutely adored was the massive blend of various genres. You have Mecha, Shounen, Romance, Mahou Shoujo, Seinen, Mystery and Horror. This made for a truly entertaining watch as it hardly ever happens where you have such a wide variety of genre\'s, without the show becoming edgy or lazy. The only thing which I have to complain about was the pacing of the show. As nice as it was to watch the world out of the perspective of the Creators/Creations, sometimes the transition between action and dialogue wasn\'t as smooth as it could be.Art - 8/10I don\'t have much to say about the art of RE:Creators. The action scenes were really well made and got the adrenaline pumping. CGI used for the Mechs were really nice because didn\'t have a constant transition between 2D and 3D which made the scenes feel more realistic. The character design for the Creations were the embodiment of the genre\'s which they belong to and it was really nice to see how the designs were kept as close to their genre\'s roots as possible.Sound - 9/10What a great OST! One of the best parts of the series is how the music is used to further enhance the atmosphere of the current scene, especially the fight scenes in the show. Everything from the sounds of the mechs to the explossions from our Magical Girl, to the clashing sounds of the knights were all designed well and felt authentic and original. The OP and ED were fun to listen to and had some fantastic vocals. The seiyuu all performed their roles admirably as the choice of cast perfectly complemented the characters personalities.Character - 9/10The aspect of the show which RE:Creators excelled at - at least in my opinion - was the diversity of characters. The dialogue by the Creations were thought provoking as they question the meaning of their suffering and the horror they felt when learning that their twisted worlds were created for so called ""gods"" amusement was really sad to behold. Something which I found to be very satisfying was when Creations came to the world of their Creators, they weren\'t bound by a fate written by some higher power and were able to make choices which they normally wouldn\'t be able to describe. The central antagonist ended up being a character who I can truly feel for as the reasons behind her motivations were for the sake of someone broken by the envy of human beings. One of the coolest aspects of the show was how the show explored the creation of media from the eyes of authors and artists, and allowed me to learn more about the writing process.Enjoyment - 10/10Where else do you find an anime about magical girls, mechs, sharpshooters, knights, psychopaths and writers, all rolled into one without the need to satisfy the populace? The combination of the various tropes and genre\'s were an absolute joy to behold and I wouldn\'t mind to see similar series to appear in the near future.Overall - 9/10If you are looking for a show which simply relies on its enjoyment factor to be successful this show is for you.

So much so, that by reading them one feels like they\'re about two completely different series.For me, this series was great but flawed. I really enjoyed the original concept and loved the characters, though I can see why some people might feel like they were stolen from other works.Re:Creators is a show about fictional characters coming to our world and finding out that their misery, their adventures and their entire life had been created for the amusement of the audience. As there are lots of different characters, they all come to terms with this...fact in different ways.This setting provides a lot of room for character growth and interaction and it deliveres on that. While the characters may be somewhat stereotypic, I believe that this was the right thing to do for a show with this large of a cast. You immediately feel like you know the characters, because you do! These are the characters that you see everyday in all your favourite shows, but they are just far enough from that that they also come of as their own person. You might say that they were copied from other works, but for this kind of story, they had to be in order for us to feel like we could be living in the world that the series portrays. Characters: 10/10The action was rather engaging and the music was straight out epic. Both 10/10.The artwork was somewhat average. I\'d didn\'t show of but didn\'t deter either. 7/10 for me.My biggest criticism is for the story, which I really liked, but I it did have some serious pacing problems. While I love the concept and overarching story as well as the plot-twists and the ending, I felt that huge parts of the ""How"" were entirely glossed over. In the story there is a timeskip of about half a year during which the Protagonists side prepares for the final battle, but it is not shown HOW they make things work, they just kinda get everything prepared offscreen. This is the reason for quite a few jarring plot-holes like ""Why does this work?"" or ""How did they get everyone to agree on this surprise they were planning"".The anime uses a lot of it\'s runtime on character-developement. It\'s not wrong with that approach, as the show is about the characters in the first place and it gains a lot of soul through this, but I believe that a lot of the plot-holes could have been adressed in at least a sentence or two, while the main drama with the MC Souta could have been distributed better throughout the series to make it seem less out of place.Story 8/10Pacing 4/10The ending was really good and fitting though, at least to me. I do wish though, that they\'d explained the set-up better. 9/10While the pacing has a lot of problems, the characters and overarching plot really make it seem, that the Creators of this series poured their souls into this. This show managed to make me care about all the characters, even the ones with little screentime.Because of this I decided to give the anime a score of 8/10. Yes, it does have problems, but it does a lot of things right, too. Also I hope, that more stories like this will be made in the futere, just maybe with better pacing :D fact in different ways.This setting provides a lot of room for character growth and interaction and it deliveres on that.

It was a simple photo just a girl with long white hair in a really cool military coat. After seeing the photo I felt the overwhelming urge to know more about this character. After some more research I found the show Re:Creators. Naturally I grabbed some popcorn and binged watched all 22 episodes in a night and was not disappointed!Story:I know this anime has been receiving a fair amount of negative reviews...and I will freely admit it has it issues like any other anime. In my opinion the story is actually really creative and fresh! The idea that characters from video games, manga, anime and other forms of entertainment can be pulled from their worlds to fight or help their own creators is a really neat concept. It is certainly one I have not seen used before and because of this the story felt very fresh. One of the things Re:Creators does right is introduce new characters with new abilities through out the show to keep an exciting pace and help the story flow. Just as things begin to hit status quo and you think the battle lines have been drawn a new character enters the mix and everything has to be reset. The massive amount of main and supporting characters does not take away from the story in my opinion and they help push everything along nicely.  The only real complaint I have with the story was the way it ended. I will not spoil anything here but the ending left me wanting more resolution. I know why they went the way they did but it left me wanting more interaction with Altair and the rest of the characters.  This in my opinion was a very minor issues and it does not ruin the series as a whole.STORY RATING: 8Art:I have never been a person who focuses on the art or presentation in anime or entertainment in general.  That being said I really enjoyed the way this anime was presented. As I stated above I literally found this show solely based on a random photo I found of Altair. I can honestly say I have never seen a photo of a character and felt so strongly about needing to know more about her. One of the highlights of this show is the fact that they can blend so many different types of anime styles together and still make it believable. The fact that a sailor moon style hero can fight along side a strong heroic evil killing knight and it works/doesn\'t seem silly speaks to the unique art in this series.  The other thing I will highlight is the gruesomeness of the deaths in this series. There were more than one death scene that made me feel a strong hint of sorrow for the loss of the character. The art and presentation (Blood ,colors, look on their faces as they passed on) really helped to sell those moments and really help me feel the gravity of the loss at that time.Art Rating: 9 (Those death scenes we really good)Sound:Not going to dive much into the sound in this review. I really enjoyed voice acting in this series and I feel like the voices fit the characters very well. For example there is a character named Magane who you just love to hate! Her voice just screams lies and deception and just hearing her talk makes you disregard anything she is about to say. The other highlight for me was the battle sounds throughout the series. You really feel each sword blow or power up! I also loved the Intro Song for episodes 1-12!Sound Rating: 8Characters:As you can imagine by this point I am a HUGE fan of the characters in this series and more specifically Altair. The series does a really nice job of introducing characters from multiple genres. There is basically a character type from every major anime in this series and they do a nice job of highlighting the flaws and strengths of those character types. The other thing this series does really well is blur the lines of hero and villain. As Altair pulls characters from their individual worlds she chooses both villains and heroes alike.  Normally this would mean all the bad guys help her with her goals and all the good guys help to stop her. That is not what happens in this series!! Once in ""our"" world some of the villains join the fight against Altair and some of the clearly good characters join her in her quest to destroy the earth. This leads to a number of cool confrontations and ""moments of decision "" for the characters. There are also a few times when multiple characters from one show are pulled into our world and in some cases the rolls of good and bad are flipped when they enter our world which makes for a really cool dynamic.There are simply to many characters to spend the time talking about each of them so I will simply talk about my favorite. In my opinion Altair is the main protagonist of this series which is odd because she is also the main antagonist. The whole story revolves around her and how she responds to what she is feeling. During the entire series I found my self feeling sorry or sad for her. I wanted her to succeed and find the peace she was looking for. On another level I felt she provided multiple moments where you wanted to just hate her for her actions!! (There are two moments in particular that I won\'t mention due to spoilers) Her interactions with Meteora throughout the series are really fun. These are two highly intelligent characters that spend most of the series playing a huge game of mental chess. Watching all the pieces move and their reactions to each move was great!! I could keep going for days about each character but no one wants to read all that. So I will say go watch the series for your self and see what you think!  Again I am a huge fan of the characters in this series.(Afterthought) Before I hit submit I wanted to add that while I really liked the hero/villain characters in this series I did not really feel the same about some of the human characters. Most of the human characters or creators were fine and did not bother me. Sota on the other hand did bother me. I really never felt a connection with Sota and his constant crying and lack of guts to share information with anyone really annoyed me. I do not like overly uncomfortable characters and this guy is the definition of OVERLY UNCOMFORTABLE! He was really the only character I did not like in this series.Characters Rating: 9Enjoyment and Overall:Overall this is not going to be a life changing anime. This will probably never be on the list of greatest anime shows of all time. But lets be honest it doesn\'t need to be!  I still think it is a great anime! I had a lot of fun watching this series and will be purchasing it on dvd to add to my collection. (Keep in mind that collection only consists of 3 titles so its a short list. I only buy series that really connect with me) As I said above the characters and design is what really won me over here! I really bought into multiple characters and seeing them fight until their final breath or succeed really moved me and helped me enjoy the series. I recommend this series to anyone who wants a quick, solid, and fun series to watch over a long weekend. It is well worth checking out in my opinion!!!On a side note: I actually enjoyed this series and specifically Altair enough to change my profile picture to her! It has been the palm top tiger for years and I didn\'t really think any character would knock her off the profile photo but here we are! She is a fun villain!Overall Rating: 8 and I will freely admit it has it issues like any other anime. In my opinion the story is actually really creative and fresh!

She is a fun villain!Overall Rating: 8', 'There are a few things that you need to understand when going into this anime. First and foremost, it is a love letter to the entire anime industry and the hardcore fans that support them. From a story perspective the actual premise is genius, and the interactions between the various ""fictional"" characters and the ""real world"" characters are really interesting and bring up a ton of philosophical and psychological questions. That being said, there are other anime out there that do this better. The show can be better thought of as an ensemble anime rather then the traditional MCs + SCs, though there are points...in the story where it definitely devolves to this. When it does, one of these is Sota, who is basically your standard every man. He\'s utterly pathetic and (as we learn later) downright despicable - perhaps for this reason the writers decided to throw him into the background during the second half of the show and replace him with Meteora, though to my utter shock they did manage to redeem him in the last couple episodes. Ultimately, I\'m giving this anime a much higher rating than I otherwise would due to it having an incredibly unique premise, and actually resolving things in a satisfying way at the end. The thing that really holds this anime back for me is its primary antagonist Altair - who really only becomes interesting in the last three or four episodes of the series. Until then she\'s basically just an annoying af Mary-Sue that never gets the curbstomp the viewers desperately want (except for like 5mins in ep19). All the negatives aside, I will say that I do think the writers did an outstanding job on the ending. If you\'re willing to forgive all that, and slug it out to the end, I think it\'s worth the watch. in the story where it definitely devolves to this.

It then promptly follows this great start with an exposition heavy second episode, and that sets the stage for what you'll be getting for the remaining 20 episodes.This show is very uneven, jolting between fast-paced battle sequences and long stretches of dialogue (often expository). The pacing feels like sitting...in a car with a driver who alternatively accelerates so quickly you are pinned to your seat, then slams on the breaks nearly throwing you through the windshield. For all its interesting world-building concepts and thoughts on the nature of storytelling, Re:Creators is in some ways too clever for its own good. It feels like the writers wree so intent on making their big ideas known that plot and characters became subservient to those ideas and suffered as a result.The low point of the pacing runs from episodes 11-16, where the show suffers from a badly 'sagging middle'. The middle act feels very much like TROYCA had a great ideas for a premise and a great finale, but little clue on how to link them. The most memorable episode of this bunch is actually the recap episode, where Meteora unexpectedly breaks the fourth wall to roast the other characters, blatantly twists the story to make herself look better, and even goes so far as to take verbal shots at TROYCA staff members. All this to say that while Re:Creators has a lot of cool and interesting ideas, the execution is very rough around the edges.ANIMATION & SOUNDI have less to say here. I love the character designs, particularly Alicetaria February, and battle sequences are well animated with interesting fight choreography (Altair's dozens of flying cavalry sabers are particularly good). In quieter moments the visuals look nice but a lot more industry standard, this show is best in motion, not with still images.Sound is excellent, with Hiroyuki Sawano showing why he is the master of hype. The OST shines in action scenes (although if you pay attention to some of the English lyrics you won't be able to find much logical structure). Both OPs are particularly great, highly loopable and never failing to get me excited for the upcoming episode. Voice acting is also quite good.CHARACTERSA mixed bag of great designs and cool ideas whose development is often undermined by the needs of the plot. A recurring theme is how the various 'Creations' (characters summoned to the real world from various manga, anime, books, and video games) interact with their Creators and these interactions range from great (Suruga throws some serious shade on Blitz by being able to predict his lines verbatim, while Yuya causes his Creator to freak out by publicly revealing a massive plot spoiler from his manga) to the merely serviceable (Selesia and Meteora make peace with their own Creators fairly quickly and easily). Alicetaria and Mamika have two of the best character arcs as they struggle to make sense of the real world for vastly different reasons (Mamika coming from a vapid and fluffy kids show designed for mass marketability, Alicetaria coming from a brutal fantasy manga world that looks like Game of Thrones crossed with Berserk). Side note, if you think any attack named 'Magical Splash Flare' is a childish joke, Mamika will prove you wrong. I just wish time had been taken from the long expository dialogues and theoretical discussions to help this cast truly go beyond their archetypes.OVERALL ENJOYMENTI've pointed out a lot of flaws in Re:Creators, but for all that I've still watched the show in its entirety twice. For me at least, the cool and fun parts are good enough to deal with the rough, unpolished parts. I can see how this show wouldn't be for everyone, however. It has great high points that will win it a fair share of fans, but some bad low points -particularly in the pacing- that will invite detractors. This one's a toss-up folks. in a car with a driver who alternatively accelerates so quickly you are pinned to your seat, then slams on the breaks nearly throwing you through the windshield.

Both OPs are particularly great, highly loopable and never failing to get me excited for the upcoming episode. Voice acting is also quite good.CHARACTERSA mixed bag of great designs and cool ideas whose development is often undermined by the needs of the plot. A recurring theme is how the various 'Creations' (characters summoned to the real world from various manga, anime, books, and video games) interact with their Creators and these interactions range from great (Suruga throws some serious shade on Blitz by being able to predict his lines verbatim, while Yuya causes his Creator to freak out by publicly revealing a massive plot spoiler from his manga) to the merely serviceable (Selesia and Meteora make peace with their own Creators fairly quickly and easily). Alicetaria and Mamika have two of the best character arcs as they struggle to make sense of the real world for vastly different reasons (Mamika coming from a vapid and fluffy kids show designed for mass marketability, Alicetaria coming from a brutal fantasy manga world that looks like Game of Thrones crossed with Berserk). Side note, if you think any attack named 'Magical Splash Flare' is a childish joke, Mamika will prove you wrong. I just wish time had been taken from the long expository dialogues and theoretical discussions to help this cast truly go beyond their archetypes.OVERALL ENJOYMENTI've pointed out a lot of flaws in Re:Creators, but for all that I've still watched the show in its entirety twice. For me at least, the cool and fun parts are good enough to deal with the rough, unpolished parts. I can see how this show wouldn't be for everyone, however. It has great high points that will win it a fair share of fans, but some bad low points -particularly in the pacing- that will invite detractors. This one's a toss-up folks."", 'this could have been great, it has some good characters and premise but it was all ruined as the story had no pull or emotion, the fight scenes are also good and watching characters of various genres and abilities(like magical girls, fantasy and sci-fi) blend into one cocktail is pretty awesome but it just couldn\'t deliver as all there is to it is talking and talking and talking....with nothing to pull you inif they were gonna make it so lukewarm they should have just cut the nonsensical talking and taken the standard ""so bad but so good"" isekai route and added some more awesome action,...that way at least it would\'ve been more enjoyable...but all you get is an ruined original blend of setting and characters...truly a waste(ps i know there\'s no point in writing about an old anime for which so many reviews are already present, but seeing my hope of the show evolving into something good at beginning turn to ash and disappointment made mye write this for anyone who would bother to scroll to the bottom of the reviews section) that way at least it would\'ve been more enjoyable...but all you get is an ruined original blend of setting and characters...truly a waste(ps i know there\'s no point in writing about an old anime for which so many reviews are already present, but seeing my hope of the show evolving into something good at beginning turn to ash and disappointment made mye write this for anyone who would bother to scroll to the bottom of the reviews section)', ""It's so good, for me it's one of the best anime in my list that I've completed.This anime have left me with a hole in my chest after I've done watching it.

I mean, it\'s not bad. I haven\'t finished the entire thing yet, but so far, I actually like it somewhat. The characters are generic, yes, but that doesn\'t really mean they\'re bad in my opinion.

The art is normal and the sound is not really something I pay attention to.The part I really hated though was the main character, Souta.

I thought it did give further insight into how our anime cultures come to be within our media in the real world. However, this is what I believe to also be Re:Creators biggest downside as a good half of the episodes were painful to watch through with nothing exciting going on. Those parts definitely could\'ve been condensed into 1-3 episodes as opposed to what felt like 11-13 episodes. Not to mention one was an entire recap...albeit done in a interesting way (I still skipped it nonetheless).The art (10/10) and sound (10/10) of Re:Creators was uh-may-zing! The character models were all well done and looked cool with a good blend of different genre characters. Perhaps my favorite part of the anime was the sound/sound effects because they had a reverberating noise to them. It gave the attacks and skills impact like they were actually doing heavy damage.Moving on to the characters (4/10) themselves is where the anime takes another step back. Sure the characters looked interesting and for the most part had a purpose; I couldn\'t decide if I liked them or not. Most anime you can choose a favorite rather quickly but with this it was more like ""yeah you\'re kind of cool, but I don\'t really care"" if that makes sense. Telling more backstory for each of the characters in their own worlds replacing the boring creator debacle I mentioned before would\'ve done this anime a lot more justice.Enjoyment (4/10): I powered through only because I don\'t like dropping shows or leaving things unfinished.Overall (5/10) Re:Creators started off really fast and enjoyable but turned down just as fast and twice as boring. Ultimately the final three or four episodes salvaged what was left with some flashy fight scenes and a decent enough ending that resolved the conflict. Re:Creators would now serve a much better purpose if the created characters were to splinter off and become their own adaptations with their own anime. albeit done in a interesting way (I still skipped it nonetheless).The art (10/10) and sound (10/10) of Re:Creators was uh-may-zing!

It seemed that this was just going to be Holy Grail War 2.0 with some paint slapped on it. I\'d now like to say I was completely wrong.Re:Creators is kind of a reverse issekai that has characters from fictional world coming into the real world. It takes influences across the medium, with magical girls, the cool gunslingers, and female knights all summoned for a very...generalized purpose. This is probably the most important part to understand about the story. The first half is placing set pieces and unravelling the mystery of why these characters are being summoned, while the second half is preparing a reaction based on the rules the world has set down. As much as I love the Fate series, this show did a much better job at setting down what its rules were and trying to follow them to the best of its ability. Sure there were ""twists"" around some smaller rules, yet these were also prescribed within the confines of previously established abilities.Past that, I felt like most characters were able to break free from their caricatures that they were confined in. Some had trouble when they found themselves transported from a pain-free world into a our modern world of pain and despair. Some characters thrived and recognized how similar their world was to ours. No one character had the same reaction to the same stimuli. Some characters were on board with the first person they met, while others were instantly suspicious. How characters were reacting felt very organic.

But I decided to stick it out and I was very rewarded!This anime has its very slow moments, let\'s just get that out of the bag. Episodes where nothing but talking occurs is commonplace. But it\'s necessary.The second half of this anime is where it really shines. You learn so much about the characters and their struggles. What started off as a slow, pretty mediocre story, became multifaceted and complex (Though confusing at times).The sounds, including the voice acting, music and battle effects, were all OUTSTANDING.

The thing I loved about the character development is at times I wasn\'t even sure who the main character or hero was.

But, this is one of my favorite anime I\'ve seen in a while. It redeems its sloppy makeup with a few distinct factors.1.

An original anime with a lot of promise, boasting of a fairly unique setting and an excellent first episode, it looked like a potential dark-horse of a season of action-packed anime adaptations. The spectacle of its initial episodes however would not last long and soon Re:Creators would display its true colors, to much disappointment of this reviewer.Pretentious opening aside, Re:Creators is best defined as a show with a lot of wasted potential. It could have been an amazing show, but a lack of focus resulting in mostly shallow character development, as well as...ludicrous exposition and pacing end up bogging the show down into mediocrity.< Story: 4 >Let\'s get it out of the way, shall we? The story of Re:creators is no good. Not because of lack of effort, but because it self-indulges on the philosophy of its setting and it does so at the cost of much of the show\'s runtime. Often breaking the rule of storytelling that goes ""Show, don\'t tell"", the audience is given long exposition talk attempting to explain the mechanics behind how all the story characters that suddenly arrived in our world got there, why they specifically are there, and so on and so forth. Not only that, many of these long-winded explanations often are not very interesting to listen to or don\'t make much sense due to the lack of context that we the viewers can use to more easily understand the universe of the show as a whole.But the copious amounts of talking in this show are not just from exposition, as the show often tries and fails to move forward the story by using deductions of what the plan of the villain may be and while this wouldn\'t normally be a problem, the reason why it doesn\'t work is because it\'s often working based on a series of hypothetical ideas and not facts showcased in-universe. So, this results in the author often pushing the narrative the way it is intended, not so much because it makes logical sense but rather because he/she uses the characters the ""deduce"" these things as mouthpieces to force the story in a certain direction.And really, the problem of the characters as mouthpieces is the biggest problem of Re:Creators\' story as whole really. The author seemed intent of explaining the logic behind his story rather than telling the story itself.There are some moments of greatness under all the chaff, however. When the characters muse about the philosophical ramifications of the clash of worlds where creative people encounter the stories they\'ve created the show can give interesting dialogue. What little discussion is given to the pressures of the creative process is something that, to other people that have at least dabbled into writing, drawing or other artistic endeavors can probably relate to (admittedly this is a bit niche). It\'s just that the show doesn\'t put these ideas front and center for much of the show, instead we get boring sessions of worldbuilding that at times devour entire episodes\' worth of runtime.< Art: 7>After all of that, there is not much be said of the artstyle of the show. It does not ooze a unique style beyond some parts of the OP and ED animations, but it is serviceable and never dips much in quality.The animation of the show is either very minimal (mostly as a result of the mostly slow pacing) or amazing when things eventually heat up. The first episode has a showcase of one of the best moments animation-wise, but there are quite a few other standout moments speckled throughout the show. What little CG  the anime uses is done cleverly enough for you to not notice it too much, but it still sticks out when on-screen.The background are nothing to write home about, as the story takes place in the Tokyo metropolitan area and therefore it\'s just your average urban environment. They are well done but again, nothing special.< Music: 8>Easily the best part of the show. The soundtrack, courtesy of the master of hype anime soundtracks Hiroyuki Sawano, delivers a good mix of themes for the show, though both openings and song Layers (which plays during many of the action scenes of the show) are of particular note.It must be said that the only reason why this category doesn\'t score higher however, is because for a Sawano soundtrack, Re:Creators is pretty standard fare and nothing to far from what he had produced in the past. It is a great soundtrack but it\'s probably not the standout of the composer behind the OST of Guilty Crown, Kill la Kill and much of Attack on Titan.< Character: 5>The characters of the show vary wildly in quality. The villain, the Military Uniform Princess has a very good character design in particular, though most of the story characters have some good elements to themselves too. However, it is the integration of these characters into the story that hurts them the most.While some characters in the show ensemble cast boast of great character arcs, other languished on the side with off-screen development or shallow arcs that never fully explore their own interests and conflicts. This is particularly noticeable on protagonist Souta, who\'s entire arc is marred by making him an introvert that is unable to properly communicate his internal struggles. This mental obstacle makes him very painful to watch at times and not in a good way as he seems aware of certain aspects of the main villain\'s backstory yet he is incapable of acting upon them and this is not handled very well, as it is not established why until there are consequences for said inaction. Meanwhile a lot of the ""creators"", the real-world humans that created the story characters are often little more than moral support if anything as they themselves have relatively mundane arcs that are only tangentially related to the main story.

Some of the fight scenes of this show were among the top of the year. The character arc of magical girl Mamika was definitely the best one as it managed to reconcile the pure and naive universe she comes from with the harshness of reality, where things are not black and white and baddies don\'t just get defeated with crossed-out eyes after the ultimate beam of friendship or whatever, she grows a lot from this initial shock and, without spoiling, has a very big impact down the line.

While the story has some great moments among the boring talk, the former don\'t counter the latter.People with experience in artistic fields might resonate with the ideas of this show, though they are not explored a great extent.<<Overall Score: 5.8/10 = 6 >> ludicrous exposition and pacing end up bogging the show down into mediocrity.< Story: 4 >Let\'s get it out of the way, shall we? The story of Re:creators is no good. Not because of lack of effort, but because it self-indulges on the philosophy of its setting and it does so at the cost of much of the show\'s runtime. Often breaking the rule of storytelling that goes ""Show, don\'t tell"", the audience is given long exposition talk attempting to explain the mechanics behind how all the story characters that suddenly arrived in our world got there, why they specifically are there, and so on and so forth. Not only that, many of these long-winded explanations often are not very interesting to listen to or don\'t make much sense due to the lack of context that we the viewers can use to more easily understand the universe of the show as a whole.But the copious amounts of talking in this show are not just from exposition, as the show often tries and fails to move forward the story by using deductions of what the plan of the villain may be and while this wouldn\'t normally be a problem, the reason why it doesn\'t work is because it\'s often working based on a series of hypothetical ideas and not facts showcased in-universe. So, this results in the author often pushing the narrative the way it is intended, not so much because it makes logical sense but rather because he/she uses the characters the ""deduce"" these things as mouthpieces to force the story in a certain direction.And really, the problem of the characters as mouthpieces is the biggest problem of Re:Creators\' story as whole really. The author seemed intent of explaining the logic behind his story rather than telling the story itself.There are some moments of greatness under all the chaff, however. When the characters muse about the philosophical ramifications of the clash of worlds where creative people encounter the stories they\'ve created the show can give interesting dialogue. What little discussion is given to the pressures of the creative process is something that, to other people that have at least dabbled into writing, drawing or other artistic endeavors can probably relate to (admittedly this is a bit niche). It\'s just that the show doesn\'t put these ideas front and center for much of the show, instead we get boring sessions of worldbuilding that at times devour entire episodes\' worth of runtime.< Art: 7>After all of that, there is not much be said of the artstyle of the show. It does not ooze a unique style beyond some parts of the OP and ED animations, but it is serviceable and never dips much in quality.The animation of the show is either very minimal (mostly as a result of the mostly slow pacing) or amazing when things eventually heat up. The first episode has a showcase of one of the best moments animation-wise, but there are quite a few other standout moments speckled throughout the show. What little CG  the anime uses is done cleverly enough for you to not notice it too much, but it still sticks out when on-screen.The background are nothing to write home about, as the story takes place in the Tokyo metropolitan area and therefore it\'s just your average urban environment. They are well done but again, nothing special.< Music: 8>Easily the best part of the show. The soundtrack, courtesy of the master of hype anime soundtracks Hiroyuki Sawano, delivers a good mix of themes for the show, though both openings and song Layers (which plays during many of the action scenes of the show) are of particular note.It must be said that the only reason why this category doesn\'t score higher however, is because for a Sawano soundtrack, Re:Creators is pretty standard fare and nothing to far from what he had produced in the past. It is a great soundtrack but it\'s probably not the standout of the composer behind the OST of Guilty Crown, Kill la Kill and much of Attack on Titan.< Character: 5>The characters of the show vary wildly in quality. The villain, the Military Uniform Princess has a very good character design in particular, though most of the story characters have some good elements to themselves too. However, it is the integration of these characters into the story that hurts them the most.While some characters in the show ensemble cast boast of great character arcs, other languished on the side with off-screen development or shallow arcs that never fully explore their own interests and conflicts. This is particularly noticeable on protagonist Souta, who\'s entire arc is marred by making him an introvert that is unable to properly communicate his internal struggles. This mental obstacle makes him very painful to watch at times and not in a good way as he seems aware of certain aspects of the main villain\'s backstory yet he is incapable of acting upon them and this is not handled very well, as it is not established why until there are consequences for said inaction. Meanwhile a lot of the ""creators"", the real-world humans that created the story characters are often little more than moral support if anything as they themselves have relatively mundane arcs that are only tangentially related to the main story. In the end the creators are little more than observers and they don\'t add much to the story beyond the rare moment where their human side bubbles up on one of those musings already mentioned in the story section.< Enjoyment: 5>When it comes to personal enjoyment, Re:Creators was a pretty big letdown.

Souta the main...human lead as such is the weakness in the story since he is a big part of the show but also an annoying character. That said he does grow and you can respect him by the end. He is part of a very complex situation but not getting with Setsuna Shimazaki in the way we all wanted is the greatest shame. Let us just hope he does what is right in their world going forward with who is left. Perhaps one day he will catch up to her for real.One weakness of the story is the aftereffect of the main story in episode 22 (Last episode so not a spoiler) to what happens to the liar girl? How does she live on? She was pretty pivotal in the storyline to be fair. Much more a beloved character than I expected.The art of the show is superb again and it is going to age amazingly. If you aired this in 2020 you would be gobsmacked to find out it is 3 years old. I hope this will maintain in the future going forwards.The sound is deep and complex with great SFX. The fight scenes are amazing to hear and the soundtrack is beautifully selected. OP 1 and 2 and ED 1 and 2 are amazing songs that are superb.Characters could be something I can talk about for hours but that would ruin the review. I will say that Souta is difficult to like to start and as the story goes on you can earn some respect for him. Other characters all have their own pivotal roles to play which is amazing to see it not all pinned on one person. Altair and Setsuna are joint best girls and if you ever meet a girl that is like Setsuna for real do not let her go ever.The show as you can tell was really enjoyable. I would like to have seen an OVA of maybe a time skip to their futures but at the same time, it ended really well and was wrapped up nicely. I would say it is definitely a 10/10, the only reason it is not for some people I suspect is Souta cannot always be redeemed.

Like you think it’s actually real. You can’t stop yourselves from feeling happy.”At first glance, RE:CREATORS’ main appeal is its sheer insanity – an anime combining gundams, magical girls, knights, magicians, gunslingers, and other well-known and well-loved archetypes in one. What I initially thought was just going to be an entertaining but incohesive action anime turned out to be so much more than that. Its unique, exciting, emotional, intelligent, self-aware…. but at its core, RE:CREATORS is a love letter to anime and storytelling itself. In a world invaded by powerful fictional heroes and villains, it manages to...explore the limitless capability of human imagination and creativity to its fullest potential (a contradiction but a fitting one). I think for many of us, anime has long evolved past something to simply pass the time with, it has come to mean something to us. RE:CREATORS shows what it means to write a story…to draw a story…to publish a story…to sustain a story…and most importantly, what it means to love a story – whether that be through the lens of the viewer, the creator, or the creation.Whilst the elaborate meta plot could easily have tipped the show into feeling too bizarre, its masterful execution keeps it feeling playful and relatable. The diverse cast of fictional and ‘real’ characters are wonderfully fleshed out with their own individual motives and quirks. Though the show incorporates many stereotypical anime archetypes, it doesn’t hesitate to blur the boundaries between good and evil – which in my mind is essential to a compelling story. The animation and sound complement the amazing screenwriting and made it a pleasure to watch.Some viewers may find the exposition to be too much which is a fair critique. I thought it helped to establish a clear outline of what could have been a very convoluted and nonsensical storyline but sometimes the pacing felt a little slow with the narrator’s traditional way of speaking and the large chunks of information. Another critique I have is that the ‘main character’ was quite infuriating during the first half of the show but this got better later on. An annoying protagonist is just bad writing in my opinion but luckily the show did not really focus that much on him anyway.RE:CREATORS is a lot of things. Primarily it’s an action show with explosive energy and gripping moments, but you don’t have to dig that deep to realise it’s also a poignant piece of storytelling that reflects us. It depicts our very real insecurities, our struggles of not being good enough, our senseless cruelty towards others. But it also reveals our infinite potential for creativity, our ability to work together to achieve a whole greater than the sum of its parts, and our will to persevere – even if it is just inspired by a bunch of fictional characters.A masterpiece doesn’t have to be perfect. Perhaps it can’t be perfect because it’s made by us.

That’s why I’d call it a masterpiece.', ""I felt like this show deserved a proper review after the halfway point because there are a lot of characters which need time to be introduced, and in a sense the show takes time to develop. What I mean is the main plot point of having everyone get into a specific side takes about 6-10 episodes to fully form. That said there are a couple new characters introduced after episode 12; however, it seems like are introduced and are quickly placed into a side. I digress, but the biggest flaw of the show for some is it takes a little time to get the ball...moving with the overall plot.For me, I don't mind things taking time to develop if it pays off, and overall Re:Creators does that well in my view. To start off the overall plot is characters from fictional worlds are magically placed into our modern world. This concept isn't the first time it has been done, but it has aspects which makes Re:Creators feel fresh and unique. To start off what makes Re:Creators unique is these characters come from a variety of genres.The genres represented through the characters come from the fantasy/medieval genre, the horror genre, the kid/princess genre, the mystery/detective genre, video games, and even the dating sim genre. I'm dead serious about the dating sim genre since a character introduced in the last couple of weeks comes from a dating sim game.Now what brings these characters together is the main antagonist Altair who has very unique/god like powers. Now the reason for her powers would be a spoiler, and honestly the reason for her creation and powers is very clever and unique. Meanwhile the other characters back story are developed from video games, light novels, manga, and anime create all these other key characters. Thanks to Altair, she has brought them into the real world for her own reasons. Again, I don't want to spoil the reasons why Altair brought them there, but her reasons are slowly developed throughout the story. Furthermore Altair eventually is able to recruit characters to her side, and most of the characters are either darker in tone, or seem to be personally conflicted and confused on where to go. In fact the conflict a couple characters have with their views and choices makes them very intriguing, and overall makes these characters interesting and feel fresh.Having discussed the main antagonist, but the main protagonists are Sota, Selesia, and Meteora in my view. There are others who join them, but Sota is the kid who got transported to Selesia's world and then ended up back in modern day Tokyo with her in episode 1. Shortly after Selesia coming to our world, then others begin to show up like Meteroa and end up joining Sota's side. Now how they pick sides varies a lot depending on the actual characters themselves since their thoughts and views are mostly based on their source material, and how they perceive what is happening around them. This continues to happen throughout the story since they introduced a new character in episode 13.From there is where the story starts building steam since the characters introduced get thrown into the mix, and they have to quickly figure out what is happening and where to go. Then the other aspect that makes this show feel very unique is these fictional characters meet their creators, aka who wrote their story. This is the most interesting aspect to me since the creators of these fictional characters end up playing a pivotal role in the story in many ways. Again, I don't want to go into too many details since it would spoil some major aspects of the plot, but I will say the creators end up playing a vital role to stop Altair.Furthermore, the creators themselves all feel unique, and believable. The creators are portrayed as someone who is proud of their work, but at the same time realize it's a business that has deadlines and stresses. Personally I'm really glad they give this realistic approach since many artists and creators love what they do, but it's no picnic. In fact the job itself can be hard and grueling, and they portrayed that aspect well.Finally the last group of characters is the government itself. Overall the government is mostly portrayed by a key character, but so far she is written well with her own personality. She is no yes-man, and overall she seems to have some fondness for the creators and fictional characters.The reason I went into details about the character is the main plot is tied to all these characters coming together to form the story. Surprisingly despite a very complex staff of various genres and unique people, but it works. In fact it has worked really well 13 episodes in. That said, there are a few flaws I can't omit. The first one is there are a few, by few I say a couple characters, are just there as filler. The worst case is the mecha character. He was brought in episode 6, and the only thing from his story is he is a teenager from the distant future. He has a giant mech, and that is about it. The other major characters show their own feelings and views, but the mecha character seems to be there for some comedic effect and to help out briefly in battles.Then a couple creators introduced later on in the show are meh so far as well, and they seem to be there to help out with other creators who were there since the first couple of episodes. That said, there are roughly 20 main characters, and most of them have been developed really well. Now we'll see how everything plays out when it finishes, but overall the character and plot has been very good. I might upgrade it to a 9/10 when it ends since the show is still going, but at this point it's easily a solid 8.Finally we come down to art and sound, and it's outstanding. The animation from battle scenes to scenery is top notch. The art direction feels realistic, yet beautiful and colorful. Overall the action scenes are fluid, and characters move and interact in a very believable setting. Meanwhile the sound design is incredible, especially in battles when there is a lot going on. Yet you can distinctly hear when a sword clashes with each other, when an explosion happens, and so forth.My final though are it is a very good show. The fact they were able to juggle various genres of video games, manga, and anime into one coherent story is astonishing if you think about it. On top of that, but overall make the characters feel unique and believable despite having to create unique backgrounds for each one. I highly recommend everyone to check it out since I would consider it at this time a contender for anime of the year. moving with the overall plot.For me, I don't mind things taking time to develop if it pays off, and overall Re:Creators does that well in my view. To start off the overall plot is characters from fictional worlds are magically placed into our modern world. This concept isn't the first time it has been done, but it has aspects which makes Re:Creators feel fresh and unique. To start off what makes Re:Creators unique is these characters come from a variety of genres.The genres represented through the characters come from the fantasy/medieval genre, the horror genre, the kid/princess genre, the mystery/detective genre, video games, and even the dating sim genre. I'm dead serious about the dating sim genre since a character introduced in the last couple of weeks comes from a dating sim game.Now what brings these characters together is the main antagonist Altair who has very unique/god like powers. Now the reason for her powers would be a spoiler, and honestly the reason for her creation and powers is very clever and unique. Meanwhile the other characters back story are developed from video games, light novels, manga, and anime create all these other key characters. Thanks to Altair, she has brought them into the real world for her own reasons. Again, I don't want to spoil the reasons why Altair brought them there, but her reasons are slowly developed throughout the story. Furthermore Altair eventually is able to recruit characters to her side, and most of the characters are either darker in tone, or seem to be personally conflicted and confused on where to go. In fact the conflict a couple characters have with their views and choices makes them very intriguing, and overall makes these characters interesting and feel fresh.Having discussed the main antagonist, but the main protagonists are Sota, Selesia, and Meteora in my view. There are others who join them, but Sota is the kid who got transported to Selesia's world and then ended up back in modern day Tokyo with her in episode 1. Shortly after Selesia coming to our world, then others begin to show up like Meteroa and end up joining Sota's side. Now how they pick sides varies a lot depending on the actual characters themselves since their thoughts and views are mostly based on their source material, and how they perceive what is happening around them. This continues to happen throughout the story since they introduced a new character in episode 13.From there is where the story starts building steam since the characters introduced get thrown into the mix, and they have to quickly figure out what is happening and where to go. Then the other aspect that makes this show feel very unique is these fictional characters meet their creators, aka who wrote their story. This is the most interesting aspect to me since the creators of these fictional characters end up playing a pivotal role in the story in many ways. Again, I don't want to go into too many details since it would spoil some major aspects of the plot, but I will say the creators end up playing a vital role to stop Altair.Furthermore, the creators themselves all feel unique, and believable. The creators are portrayed as someone who is proud of their work, but at the same time realize it's a business that has deadlines and stresses. Personally I'm really glad they give this realistic approach since many artists and creators love what they do, but it's no picnic. In fact the job itself can be hard and grueling, and they portrayed that aspect well.Finally the last group of characters is the government itself. Overall the government is mostly portrayed by a key character, but so far she is written well with her own personality. She is no yes-man, and overall she seems to have some fondness for the creators and fictional characters.The reason I went into details about the character is the main plot is tied to all these characters coming together to form the story. Surprisingly despite a very complex staff of various genres and unique people, but it works. In fact it has worked really well 13 episodes in. That said, there are a few flaws I can't omit. The first one is there are a few, by few I say a couple characters, are just there as filler. The worst case is the mecha character. He was brought in episode 6, and the only thing from his story is he is a teenager from the distant future. He has a giant mech, and that is about it. The other major characters show their own feelings and views, but the mecha character seems to be there for some comedic effect and to help out briefly in battles.Then a couple creators introduced later on in the show are meh so far as well, and they seem to be there to help out with other creators who were there since the first couple of episodes. That said, there are roughly 20 main characters, and most of them have been developed really well. Now we'll see how everything plays out when it finishes, but overall the character and plot has been very good. I might upgrade it to a 9/10 when it ends since the show is still going, but at this point it's easily a solid 8.Finally we come down to art and sound, and it's outstanding. The animation from battle scenes to scenery is top notch. The art direction feels realistic, yet beautiful and colorful. Overall the action scenes are fluid, and characters move and interact in a very believable setting. Meanwhile the sound design is incredible, especially in battles when there is a lot going on. Yet you can distinctly hear when a sword clashes with each other, when an explosion happens, and so forth.My final though are it is a very good show. The fact they were able to juggle various genres of video games, manga, and anime into one coherent story is astonishing if you think about it. On top of that, but overall make the characters feel unique and believable despite having to create unique backgrounds for each one.

Although it might not be equally popular, Re:Creators is an anime that got detected on numerous viewer’s radars after the season began.Dissection starts:I still recall clearly how the show was showered with criticism, when it only had one episode out. The reason was transparently obvious: People were confused and discontent.“There’s no character development!”...“What did I just watch?”“How did no ordinary citizen get hurt during the fight?”“Uh…are we just going to ignore that so much of the city’s public infrastructure was damaged severely?”I was the same. Although the show’s premise had sounded promising, my gut was warning me that this could end up as a mess. As anticipated, Hiroyuki’s music was great. Nevertheless, other viewers and I could not take the show as seriously as we initially wished to.However, after having watched the show until the episode 11, I can clearly claim that the show gradually gets better. Well, to a certain extent.Let’s dissect some of the show’s characters:Souta, our protagonist, is a “young high school student, who is timid but good-natured.” Until the later parts of the show, other viewers and I genuinely wondered what was the point of this guy, who seemed powerfully generic. Especially when almost the entire casts are basically fictional characters with their unique abilities from different worlds. Thankfully, we were wrong.Initially, he might come across as an irrelevant otaku observer, who was simply included in the anime simply for the sake of his reactions and awe towards the characters and their fights. However, as the story proceeds, we begin to see more of his story and understand how he is related to the overall story. More importantly, we begin to feel something for him. It’s the sense of familiarity. We begin to learn about his love towards creating arts and the subsequent suffering that results from his limited talent, his inferiority complex, and his self-contempt. And these are the frail characteristics that many of us have, hide and feel insecure about. As we see this embodiment of the unpleasant aspects attempting to grow and mature for the sake of his friends, Souta ceases being a simple, two-dimensional glasses-kun.On the other hand, I feel like the character developments for Selesia was not as strong in comparison. Regarding Selesia, since the episode one, she did not change much as a character. Certainly, we could argue that this was intentional, as she is a being whose life is predetermined by her character description. Nevertheless, the growth she has shown throughout the first half comes across as weak. When discussing her as a character, the only highlight is her relationship with her creator glasses-kun, It is heartwarming to see these two, who initially held each other in disrespect/contempt/irritation, gradually form a sense of connection and mutual respect as they overcome several predicaments.Meteora’s character development was, unexpectedly, fine or even good. With Meteora, I guess her charm is the contrast between her outer appearance and her inner appearance. What I mean by this is while she continues to have same serious poker-face expression on her, Meteora is actually a cute and thoughtful individual. At first, Meteora gives off the serious vibe that makes her appear not easily approachable. However, we see that this is not necessarily the case and fall for her gap-moe, when we see her stuffing herself with fast-food, trying to make a joke in the serious situation and this scene. Moreover, her perceptive and considerate sides are shown when she unexpectedly serves as an emotional support for Souta, as he tries to reveal his past—something that he has been running away from. Cheers for MeteoraAlthough I am going to save up for the knight and Kanoya the gundam pilot (MVP of ep11) for the review of the 2nd half in the future, I will review Mamika since she won’t be returning anytime soon. A moment of (optional) silence for her. Although she begins off as an innocuous magic girl with naive ideals and understanding of the world, Mamika gradually realizes that this is not the case after her first battle with Selesia and conversations with other characters, especially Souta. While some vieweres found her naivetey slightly irritating (and I confess that I also felt the same sometimes), I still felt some respect for her as she relentlessly pursued what she believed to be right. Just like every other character in the show, Mamika fought for her notion of justice, and I suppose that deserves some acknowledgement. Nevertheless, you could say that she was naive even to her death, as she believed in Magane—the liar.*Check blog for the gif.After all the thing she’d done, I still found her cute doing this. HnnghI have mixed feelings regarding Magane that I am planning to express later on in another writing that will be coming up in several days. I feel like her character suits the content’s topic well: the construction of an odd character/sociopath in animes and mangas. Stay in tune. For now, let me just clarify that I quite like her character. Unlike the rest, Magane utilizes her wit and mastery of manipulation to activate her abilities and fight. Not only is the deviation from the brute force battles a nice break of fresh air in the show, but it is also rather interesting to see and predict how Magane will find a way to trigger her opponents in order to activate her skill.Altair and Blitz: To be frank, I am unable to form any consolidated opinion regarding these two characters. Hopefully, in the second half, I can get enough insight into these characters so that I can see them as ‘valuable’ characters and not just empty shells.Now, let’s dissect the show’s fights and music:In spite of how purely eargasmic Hiroyuki’s music consistently is throughout the show, the fights feel slightly lackluster for now. While every fight carries a reason for happening and subsequently a weight of importance, the battles simply do not manage to successfully convey the intensity. The only fights where I felt tingling badassness were those, in which Mirokuji had participated in.I believe that there are two underlying causes for the insufficient intensity that is conveyed through the battles.1.Fighting with no/weak intention to kill.So far, we’ve seen almost all of the casts participate in fights. However, from what I’ve seen, I don’t see any intent of killing from the characters on the good side. At most, they are simply resorting to violence in order to stop their enemies. Fighting others to kill them and fighting others to stop them from doing something; there is a rather large difference between the two. On the other hand, the characters of the evil side do not feel any hesitation in killing others; the knight is still on the fence, or so it seems from the latest battle and her reaction to the blood that spurred from Selesia’s stomach. Consequently, the discrepancy of the intention to kill between the two sides strongly contributes to the show’s inability to convey the intensity that it could have achieved.2. Facial expressions during fightsYou might have noticed this or not. There is not a wide spectrum of facial expressions for many of the characters during battle scenes. Mirokuji laughs, stays quiet with a poker face or gets pissed; Selesia continues to have a consistent fiery gaze; Meteora appears pretty calm, most of the time; the knight usually appears determined, hesitant and then determined again, except that she is pissed. Well, considering how their characters are predetermined by their character descriptions, I can understand. Nevertheless, seeing no strong visual of despair, psychological distress, or fear makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with the characters. It is difficult for us to engage ourselves into the show and comprehend their physical and emotional struggles, when they don’t look really desperate or distressed. Certainly, several attempts are made during battles. Although they do work to a certain extent, the efforts do not manage to make the most out of the opportunities. *Spoiler* So far, Mamika’s fight with Altair was able to do this the best.Conclusion:Well, throughout the show, there are occasional quotes and scenes that I think would resonate with many artists (or ‘creators’. As Utaha from Saekano would like to say) in our international community. So you should give the show a try if you haven’t tried it yet or dropped in the first three episodes. If you are still watching it, what do you think about the show so far? “What did I just watch?”“How did no ordinary citizen get hurt during the fight?”“Uh…are we just going to ignore that so much of the city’s public infrastructure was damaged severely?”I was the same.

Cheers for MeteoraAlthough I am going to save up for the knight and Kanoya the gundam pilot (MVP of ep11) for the review of the 2nd half in the future, I will review Mamika since she won’t be returning anytime soon. A moment of (optional) silence for her. Although she begins off as an innocuous magic girl with naive ideals and understanding of the world, Mamika gradually realizes that this is not the case after her first battle with Selesia and conversations with other characters, especially Souta. While some vieweres found her naivetey slightly irritating (and I confess that I also felt the same sometimes), I still felt some respect for her as she relentlessly pursued what she believed to be right. Just like every other character in the show, Mamika fought for her notion of justice, and I suppose that deserves some acknowledgement. Nevertheless, you could say that she was naive even to her death, as she believed in Magane—the liar.*Check blog for the gif.After all the thing she’d done, I still found her cute doing this. HnnghI have mixed feelings regarding Magane that I am planning to express later on in another writing that will be coming up in several days. I feel like her character suits the content’s topic well: the construction of an odd character/sociopath in animes and mangas. Stay in tune. For now, let me just clarify that I quite like her character. Unlike the rest, Magane utilizes her wit and mastery of manipulation to activate her abilities and fight. Not only is the deviation from the brute force battles a nice break of fresh air in the show, but it is also rather interesting to see and predict how Magane will find a way to trigger her opponents in order to activate her skill.Altair and Blitz: To be frank, I am unable to form any consolidated opinion regarding these two characters. Hopefully, in the second half, I can get enough insight into these characters so that I can see them as ‘valuable’ characters and not just empty shells.Now, let’s dissect the show’s fights and music:In spite of how purely eargasmic Hiroyuki’s music consistently is throughout the show, the fights feel slightly lackluster for now. While every fight carries a reason for happening and subsequently a weight of importance, the battles simply do not manage to successfully convey the intensity. The only fights where I felt tingling badassness were those, in which Mirokuji had participated in.I believe that there are two underlying causes for the insufficient intensity that is conveyed through the battles.1.Fighting with no/weak intention to kill.So far, we’ve seen almost all of the casts participate in fights. However, from what I’ve seen, I don’t see any intent of killing from the characters on the good side. At most, they are simply resorting to violence in order to stop their enemies. Fighting others to kill them and fighting others to stop them from doing something; there is a rather large difference between the two. On the other hand, the characters of the evil side do not feel any hesitation in killing others; the knight is still on the fence, or so it seems from the latest battle and her reaction to the blood that spurred from Selesia’s stomach. Consequently, the discrepancy of the intention to kill between the two sides strongly contributes to the show’s inability to convey the intensity that it could have achieved.2. Facial expressions during fightsYou might have noticed this or not. There is not a wide spectrum of facial expressions for many of the characters during battle scenes. Mirokuji laughs, stays quiet with a poker face or gets pissed; Selesia continues to have a consistent fiery gaze; Meteora appears pretty calm, most of the time; the knight usually appears determined, hesitant and then determined again, except that she is pissed. Well, considering how their characters are predetermined by their character descriptions, I can understand. Nevertheless, seeing no strong visual of despair, psychological distress, or fear makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with the characters. It is difficult for us to engage ourselves into the show and comprehend their physical and emotional struggles, when they don’t look really desperate or distressed. Certainly, several attempts are made during battles. Although they do work to a certain extent, the efforts do not manage to make the most out of the opportunities. *Spoiler* So far, Mamika’s fight with Altair was able to do this the best.Conclusion:Well, throughout the show, there are occasional quotes and scenes that I think would resonate with many artists (or ‘creators’. As Utaha from Saekano would like to say) in our international community. So you should give the show a try if you haven’t tried it yet or dropped in the first three episodes. If you are still watching it, what do you think about the show so far?', ""This review contains minor spoilers.This anime is extremely hard to critic, it has a lot of flaws, but still surprisingly good. The show suffers from bad character development with a bad MC, plot holes, unexplained questions. Such as, if it's possible to bring Blitz's daughter back alive, then why not bring Mamika back alive as well. What happened to Magane after last episode? Is she going to get punished at some point for murder?However, even it's not a comedy focused anime, i genuinely found it funnier than some other comedy anime I've watched. The first and last few episodes were extremely interesting, but...the middle half of the show suffers from a lot of problems.I honestly don't know how to rate this series. it constantly disappoint you and surprising you. So i'm just gonna leave it as 5/10. the middle half of the show suffers from a lot of problems.I honestly don't know how to rate this series. it constantly disappoint you and surprising you.

I may add a bit of info on what happens in the anime EDs/OPs.First review I've ever done, and I gotta say, if you're merely just a tiny bit interested, watch it.Re:Creators is an anime that's really meta, some may compare it to Shirobako. It shows the struggles of creating and breaks the fourth wall countless times, I have to say. It's Isekai, as many others have said--but reversed.Story:The basic plot is, for the anime provides a not as great plot (in my opinion);Sota, a teen who somewhat enjoys creating but is often discouraged. He is a normal teen...that also watches anime, reads manga, reads novels, draws. He lives a normal life until Selesia, a character from Vogelchevalier, an anime he watches, gets transported into his own world. And from there, a story begins.The story seems a bit odd in the beginning, and many dropped after the first couple of episodes because of the inexplicable length of dialogue. The dialogue length was to structure the world and plot, so I don't mind, but others may have an attention span that simply isn't enough for this. Personally, I sometimes got kind of bored in the dialogue. But the pace picks up, so it gets much better. The ending wasn't as grand as I expected, and predicted by many, and I was kind of disappointed, but it was still, regardless, a satisfying ending. The aftermath, halfway watching through, I predicted the ending of the entire series correctly and I still feel the backlash of it.Also, they have a recap episode in the best possible way ever since Kill la Kill's 2 min recap. Gotta dig that.Art:Troyca's first original, if I remember correctly. Their website for Re:Creators shows all character ref sheets, so that's a plus. The art drops sometimes but the animation is still really nice, especially with the action.Character designs--they're rememberable. Definitely. Based upon stereotypes, but the personality that goes into it is amazing.The 2nd ED also is very meta, shows all ref sheets of characters.The OPs are phenomenal, music-wise and art-wise, but it gives me chills every time.Sound:Sawano Hiroyuki. Sawano Hiroyuki, bless him. Created a soundtrack that matches, and matches for everything. He also composed the OPs with classic Sawano drums and guitar riffs, and I still get chills, especially after the last episode.The sound effects are clean and used properly, especially to enunciate certain ideals given to the watcher.And the voice actors, well...nothing to complain about there. The casting was well done. Minase Inori's there, so have your Rem too.Character:In Re:Creators, there is no specific protagonist. Sota seems to be it, but he seems to be more of a side character as the show goes on, and I'm okay with that. He gets a lot of development in a strange way, I guess.Each Creation that was transported into the world had a personality that was pretty basic, but as the show progressed, the development was extremely subtle, which built up into the end. The characters are done well. The visual designs of them are not too eye blaring, and recognizable enough. Especially Altair, her design and the backstory behind her design (in the story) is actually very interesting. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but my hands really want to convey that Altair's design is just...wow.Enjoyment:Re:Creators I never knew until I stumbled across clips, and I'm surprised it wasn't hyped up more than it was credited for. The meta in it is literally the strongest I've ever seen, considering besides Shirobako, and the inside jokes are amazing. The humor is there, there is humor. There's also shocking times, plot twists, and a melancholy ending. Sometimes, there's just not a way to describe how you feel about something into words.Please give it a chance, even if it's slow in the beginning.Re:Create your own story. that also watches anime, reads manga, reads novels, draws.

It's what hooked me on to the anime. The fact that anime characters could come to life was a very interesting concept. However, where the anime lacks is actual implementation of this concept. For example, how did Altair get the power to enter this world in the first place? And if Altair has the power of making others appear, then how did they get other characters to enter the world without her say-so?Being adapted from a light novel, you'd expect it to have a lot of dialogue. But this anime takes dialogue to the next level. There is...nothing but dialogue happening in eighty to ninety percent of the show. And it's not like the dialogue itself is very interesting. They're so obsessed with dialogue that the characters can not stop themselves from taking to each other even during fights. That allows characters like Magane to take advantage of it. Seriously, if no one talked to her while fighting she'd be the most useless character in the show. Also, I still don't get how her power works.Animation: 8 / 10Story: 5 / 10Sound: 8 / 10Characters: 5 / 10Some of the characters were not so one-dimentional, like the author Takasugi Matsubara.Enjoyment: 2 / 10I think this is what people care about the most yet this is where the anime lacks the most.

I will admit, I was initially quite interested in it\'s premise.

What do they say? What do they mean? In bringing the created works to life, the created naturally ask \'Why do I suffer in my story? What is the point of the ordeal I\'ve endured?\'What a given work is saying, what philosophical work it\'s doing, is, as always, my primary focus. What does it say about human beings, about the human condition? Given this show\'s metanarrative focus, it is, despite its flaws, a very interesting candidate for dissection.My own starting perspective layers on a double meaning to...the questions I laid out at the beginning. As a Catholic, I\'ve given considerable thought to the \'problem of evil\' -- which is a perfect mirror to the questions that the \'created\' ask of their \'creators\', their authors. The human being asks God, \'Why do I suffer? What could possibly justify the pain I and others endure? Why would a just God ever allow such suffering? A just God wouldn\'t -- there is no God. So the problem goes, and attempts to answer it have been formulated for millennia. The same question hangs over Re: Creators, albeit in parallel form.(At the outset, I\'ll mention that due to my Catholicism, my engagement with the problem of evil will essentially assume that the problem can be resolved, and I will resolve it as a Catholic would. I do think that the problem of evil is the strongest argument for atheism, so I\'m definitely not grappling with other arguments against God\'s existence or taking them seriously. If you bring the attitude \'The burden of proof is on the religious person to prove God exists, there\'s no scientific evidence for God\' -- attitudes that fundamentally mistake the purpose of science and misunderstand that science cannot touch philosophical questions -- you might find my perspective irritating, so fair warning. Additionally, do not presume that my references to fallen human nature or original sin mean that I believe the Earth to be 6000 years old, or that I disbelieve in evolution or any such nonsense.)I think, essentially though, to answer the question of narratives, of why our fictional heroes suffer is to answer the question for us -- we are the \'gods\' to our fictional heroes, and as they demand an answer from us as to the justice behind their suffering, so we demand an answer from God.Of course, we aren\'t really gods, and fiction doesn\'t really come to life, there are no real ethical quandaries to grapple with when writing fiction, no one is really asking about the moral implications of our fiction coming to life, because it doesn\'t and never will -- and neither is Re: Creators.Instead, Re: Creators is really pushing at the question of what narrative is, and asking us to consider that question in light of the problem of evil. It doesn\'t always do this perfectly, nor know how to answer the questions it asks very well, but I commend it for making the effort.On the periphery, sometimes its authors answer their creations in ways that we would find unacceptable were God or anyone else to answer us in such a way. In one instance, an author tells her creation that it is just what she must do as an author -- create and create and tell stories. She is a mad god, there is no justice, no sense in the tragedy of her stories -- as she would tell it, at least.I don\'t think this is an honest answer, nor do I think that the show means for us to take away that it is, but I do think that this example pokes at why we can\'t take the actual literal presentation of the facts as the show presents them very seriously, we\'re not really meant to look at the worldbuilding here as a serious contributing facet of what the work is doing. This world would break down and pull apart at its seams were such things to happen.In a fascinating way, Re: Creators seems to know this, as our antagonist, Altair, says that bringing more creations into the world will lead to the world\'s destruction.Why does Altair desire the world\'s end? This is the real question, and answering it reveals something about the purpose of human narrative.All the other narratives, their stories, their characters have been made subordinate to the real-world one. All of them must work in service, in some manner or other, to resolving the story that Altair has to tell.What is her story? What evil does she cry out to God about? In as short as detail as possible, it is heartache, anger and fury at an unjust world, at evil done to her creator, Setsuna. She is a character created in response to her creator\'s felt sorrow, anger and grief at her own treatment. Altair carries Setsuna\'s grief, anger and sadness, she is a narrative remedy to it. A story Setsuna told herself to cope, for if only this created character in her mind could confront the injustices she faced on her behalf, maybe her heart could find a little peace.Setsuna\'s could not though, as the show begins with her suicide.The story of Altair is the story of Setsuna, for Altair\'s story is one created in service of Setsuna\'s. Human narratives, our participation in the grand act of God\'s narrative act of creation, are remedies of our own, albeit imperfect ones. We create narrative arcs in which our protagonists suffer, but they suffer for good reason -- so that they might come to realize greater truths and seek a greater good, their suffering becomes a necessary element that our protagonists might grow.So it must be with us, and even more than this, we must see how our narratives all exist in service of the same goal, how our stories are ultimately a form of participation in THE story, the story of humanity.Re: Creators, intentionally or not, captures this. For, in the end, all the summoned creations from their respective stories come to play a part, a role in the story of Setsuna and Altair. They all participate in the real, human story, in healing the hurt done to Setsuna\'s heart and thus Altair\'s.What wonderfully imagined and beautifully realized characters too! They invented rough sketches of various characters from a variety of stories, trying to cover as wide a breadth of archetypes and tropes as possible. A grizzled, hard-boiled investigator, a medieval knight from a harsh world, a young man piloting a mech, a magical girl, a sage-like librarian, and so on. They all have imagined arcs to their character stories, they were not made to be cheap parodies of what they imitate.She doesn\'t ask Altair to forgive the world what it\'s done to Setsuna, but what she does say of narrative, of the act of creation:""But to hug the whole world once more..including everything in it..I think that..that\'s what it means to create the world""Setsuna had not the strength to step forward and perform that act of heroic acceptance, of self-creation in spite of despair and difficulty. She was weak and fragile, unable to bear it, and took her own life. Altair was created, like I said, as a narrative remedy -- Altair is strong and champions the cause of those who have no voice.Strength to project itself, to right the wrongs done to Setsuna in her weakness.Stories, narratives tell us about the justice, the good that we seek, often a fantastical justice, a utopian good. Often, a justice to right wrongs now irreversible. In many ways, a final justice, a divine justice. They tell us about the good, the end to which all human beings are directed.Our stories aspire to become the divine story, to touch the act of God\'s creation and the long arc of justice that the human story represents, they help us realize the gap between things as they are and things as they should be.This fact, too, Re: Creators manages to touch upon in the very fact of its metanarrative structure, of stories layered upon and inside one another. In its finale, the protagonists aim to defeat Altair by presenting it to the world as a crossover-character elimination event, by presenting it as fiction, as narrative.With every swell and change in the crowds\' sentiments, her powers grow or lessen in proportion. In the very end, as Setsuna is finally allowed to meet Altair, and the crowd hears her story, feels the pain Setsuna endured, feels Altair\'s anger at the world, the world is forgiven, redeemed. By the very fact that it is a narrative, a story that others share in. The fact of our sharing, our participating in others\' narratives is key -- what redemption would there be if no one heard Setsuna and Altair\'s story?Sota serves as a helpful example, he is haunted by what he failed to do for Setsuna, for his role in driving her to suicide, and his narrative cannot find completion until her\'s does. Our stories are intertwined, bound up in one another\'s fates. A beautiful reflection of the fact that our good is sought with others, not alone.For the sorrow and pain in Setsuna\'s story, caused by those others in her life, by Sota, can only be healed by a recognition of the wrongs and sins done against her, by so many recognizing the injustice of it and wanting her story to be given a happy end. With all of those united desires for the other\'s good, with love for the other, such a happy end becomes possible.The specifics of it, of Altair creating worlds and melodramatically grabbing Setsuna as she falls in front of the train, don\'t really matter.What does matter is the thematic takeaway, which is essentially that if we all want the best for one another, if we have love in our hearts for one another, then we can heal wrongs and make things right, we can create the justice we so desire for one another. That\'s really beautiful.Further, narrative has the power to illustrate the good which we seek but haven\'t yet reached.How does that all relate back to our original question, to the problem of evil?So much evil, so much pain and suffering has its roots in human sin and wrongdoing, in the ways we treat one another. An incredible deal of suffering on the natural level can even be attributed to human failure, as were we not the fallen beings we are, science and technology could save so many more lives. If no one ever felt uncared for, if none were neglected, if all were loved and respected, then we might yet see a world without evil.In my saying so, I am thus painting a picture which assumes that present human suffering is allowed by God because we fell from grace, because we are sinful and fallen. I am not here to write a theological treatise, but it\'s necessary to distinguish between understanding evil that results from human sin as something God \'allows\' versus something God \'punishes\' us with.Why would God allow it? Wouldn\'t it be more just if Setsuna was never abused and pushed into committing suicide? Wouldn\'t it be better if humans weren\'t fallen? Here again we must remember the way that narrative helped redeem the world in the eyes of Setsuna and Altair. Just as with the hero in a narrative, we must fall first and suffer before we can reach a final, resolved end.So it must be with us, albeit on a longer timescale. The suffering of others\', like with Sota to Setsuna, has the potential to move us to act in a way to make sure others do not suffer similarly. We rise or fall together. Setsuna\'s story, her pain and suffering, made into a story can teach others, whether those others are the people in the show\'s fictional world or real people, to treat people with kindness.Our narratives are thus, again, our participation in a variety of forms, tiny chapters in that grand human narrative, in the story of humanity slowly coming to realize its true good and creating a world where all are loved and evil has no place.At least, that\'s my answer to the problem of evil and pertaining to what I think human stories are.I don\'t think the show would ever put forward those answers explicitly, nor would I expect it too. I do think, though, that the truth reveals itself through all things.Now, it does do some things definitely wrong though, not to do with its philosophical content, really. After some early confrontations and stage setting for the finale, the show settles into a lull where basically nothing happens, and the conflicts in some of these episodes are, like, writers literally arguing about the creative process. These are near-pointless filler, and I regret that they weren\'t used for other character and narrative development, or just tossed aside to make for a more tight show.The music is absolutely incredible, really brings the show to life. I\'ve heard differing opinions on the quality of the animation, but it felt pretty lively and engaging to me. I\'m no expert on that topic, though.That all being said, for a show that grapples with questions like the problem of evil and the purpose of narrative, it reflects back the wonderful light of reality quite well. the questions I laid out at the beginning. As a Catholic, I\'ve given considerable thought to the \'problem of evil\' -- which is a perfect mirror to the questions that the \'created\' ask of their \'creators\', their authors. The human being asks God, \'Why do I suffer? What could possibly justify the pain I and others endure? Why would a just God ever allow such suffering? A just God wouldn\'t -- there is no God. So the problem goes, and attempts to answer it have been formulated for millennia. The same question hangs over Re: Creators, albeit in parallel form.(At the outset, I\'ll mention that due to my Catholicism, my engagement with the problem of evil will essentially assume that the problem can be resolved, and I will resolve it as a Catholic would. I do think that the problem of evil is the strongest argument for atheism, so I\'m definitely not grappling with other arguments against God\'s existence or taking them seriously. If you bring the attitude \'The burden of proof is on the religious person to prove God exists, there\'s no scientific evidence for God\' -- attitudes that fundamentally mistake the purpose of science and misunderstand that science cannot touch philosophical questions -- you might find my perspective irritating, so fair warning. Additionally, do not presume that my references to fallen human nature or original sin mean that I believe the Earth to be 6000 years old, or that I disbelieve in evolution or any such nonsense.)I think, essentially though, to answer the question of narratives, of why our fictional heroes suffer is to answer the question for us -- we are the \'gods\' to our fictional heroes, and as they demand an answer from us as to the justice behind their suffering, so we demand an answer from God.Of course, we aren\'t really gods, and fiction doesn\'t really come to life, there are no real ethical quandaries to grapple with when writing fiction, no one is really asking about the moral implications of our fiction coming to life, because it doesn\'t and never will -- and neither is Re: Creators.Instead, Re: Creators is really pushing at the question of what narrative is, and asking us to consider that question in light of the problem of evil. It doesn\'t always do this perfectly, nor know how to answer the questions it asks very well, but I commend it for making the effort.On the periphery, sometimes its authors answer their creations in ways that we would find unacceptable were God or anyone else to answer us in such a way. In one instance, an author tells her creation that it is just what she must do as an author -- create and create and tell stories. She is a mad god, there is no justice, no sense in the tragedy of her stories -- as she would tell it, at least.I don\'t think this is an honest answer, nor do I think that the show means for us to take away that it is, but I do think that this example pokes at why we can\'t take the actual literal presentation of the facts as the show presents them very seriously, we\'re not really meant to look at the worldbuilding here as a serious contributing facet of what the work is doing. This world would break down and pull apart at its seams were such things to happen.In a fascinating way, Re: Creators seems to know this, as our antagonist, Altair, says that bringing more creations into the world will lead to the world\'s destruction.Why does Altair desire the world\'s end? This is the real question, and answering it reveals something about the purpose of human narrative.All the other narratives, their stories, their characters have been made subordinate to the real-world one. All of them must work in service, in some manner or other, to resolving the story that Altair has to tell.What is her story? What evil does she cry out to God about? In as short as detail as possible, it is heartache, anger and fury at an unjust world, at evil done to her creator, Setsuna. She is a character created in response to her creator\'s felt sorrow, anger and grief at her own treatment. Altair carries Setsuna\'s grief, anger and sadness, she is a narrative remedy to it. A story Setsuna told herself to cope, for if only this created character in her mind could confront the injustices she faced on her behalf, maybe her heart could find a little peace.Setsuna\'s could not though, as the show begins with her suicide.The story of Altair is the story of Setsuna, for Altair\'s story is one created in service of Setsuna\'s. Human narratives, our participation in the grand act of God\'s narrative act of creation, are remedies of our own, albeit imperfect ones. We create narrative arcs in which our protagonists suffer, but they suffer for good reason -- so that they might come to realize greater truths and seek a greater good, their suffering becomes a necessary element that our protagonists might grow.So it must be with us, and even more than this, we must see how our narratives all exist in service of the same goal, how our stories are ultimately a form of participation in THE story, the story of humanity.Re: Creators, intentionally or not, captures this. For, in the end, all the summoned creations from their respective stories come to play a part, a role in the story of Setsuna and Altair. They all participate in the real, human story, in healing the hurt done to Setsuna\'s heart and thus Altair\'s.What wonderfully imagined and beautifully realized characters too! They invented rough sketches of various characters from a variety of stories, trying to cover as wide a breadth of archetypes and tropes as possible. A grizzled, hard-boiled investigator, a medieval knight from a harsh world, a young man piloting a mech, a magical girl, a sage-like librarian, and so on. They all have imagined arcs to their character stories, they were not made to be cheap parodies of what they imitate.She doesn\'t ask Altair to forgive the world what it\'s done to Setsuna, but what she does say of narrative, of the act of creation:""But to hug the whole world once more..including everything in it..I think that..that\'s what it means to create the world""Setsuna had not the strength to step forward and perform that act of heroic acceptance, of self-creation in spite of despair and difficulty. She was weak and fragile, unable to bear it, and took her own life. Altair was created, like I said, as a narrative remedy -- Altair is strong and champions the cause of those who have no voice.Strength to project itself, to right the wrongs done to Setsuna in her weakness.Stories, narratives tell us about the justice, the good that we seek, often a fantastical justice, a utopian good. Often, a justice to right wrongs now irreversible. In many ways, a final justice, a divine justice. They tell us about the good, the end to which all human beings are directed.Our stories aspire to become the divine story, to touch the act of God\'s creation and the long arc of justice that the human story represents, they help us realize the gap between things as they are and things as they should be.This fact, too, Re: Creators manages to touch upon in the very fact of its metanarrative structure, of stories layered upon and inside one another. In its finale, the protagonists aim to defeat Altair by presenting it to the world as a crossover-character elimination event, by presenting it as fiction, as narrative.With every swell and change in the crowds\' sentiments, her powers grow or lessen in proportion. In the very end, as Setsuna is finally allowed to meet Altair, and the crowd hears her story, feels the pain Setsuna endured, feels Altair\'s anger at the world, the world is forgiven, redeemed. By the very fact that it is a narrative, a story that others share in. The fact of our sharing, our participating in others\' narratives is key -- what redemption would there be if no one heard Setsuna and Altair\'s story?Sota serves as a helpful example, he is haunted by what he failed to do for Setsuna, for his role in driving her to suicide, and his narrative cannot find completion until her\'s does. Our stories are intertwined, bound up in one another\'s fates. A beautiful reflection of the fact that our good is sought with others, not alone.For the sorrow and pain in Setsuna\'s story, caused by those others in her life, by Sota, can only be healed by a recognition of the wrongs and sins done against her, by so many recognizing the injustice of it and wanting her story to be given a happy end. With all of those united desires for the other\'s good, with love for the other, such a happy end becomes possible.The specifics of it, of Altair creating worlds and melodramatically grabbing Setsuna as she falls in front of the train, don\'t really matter.What does matter is the thematic takeaway, which is essentially that if we all want the best for one another, if we have love in our hearts for one another, then we can heal wrongs and make things right, we can create the justice we so desire for one another.

The characters spend 80% of their time talking non-stop about boring stuff like ""the rules"" of the world that don\'t make any sense at all for several chapters at a time. The worst offenders of this are chapters 11-16 where there is not a single fight to be seen because the protagonists are to busy ""planning"" how to beat Altair. Of course, an anime doesn\'t need many (or any) fights to be good, but for that they must be talking about something interesting and needless to say, this is not the...case.The other 20% of the time they are fighting AND talking halfway through the fight. After all that talking I was hoping the battles were worth all the wait, but they also screwed that up, somehow. See, for a fight to be good your viewers must understand and care about what is happening. This anime fails in both. You don\'t understand what Altair can and cannot do until she does it, and you couldn\'t care less about what happens to the characters because you don\'t know anything about them apart from the role they had in the world they came from, and even that is poorly explained.I\'ll stop my rant here.

Re: Creators story is a great meta deconstruction and reconstruction story that mashes different characters from different media into the real world setting.While watching it, I felt the strong potential that it has and the possibilities within its world. I strongly believe that 22 episodes would not be enough if they did not contained the story about Kota, Setsuna and Altair, the main characters of the story.I could summarize the anime points:1. The first half of the anime being drawn into the world of possibilities and surprises.2. The second half being the introduction...to the characters and world building.3. The and the final half being the start and the end of the story.This is the reason why Up to the 12th episode, it felt slow and they had to add a great filler/breather 4th wall breaking episode to reset any lag that you might feel during the first 12 episodes of the story. You can literally watch Re: Creators in this way: Watch Episode 1 then jump to 13 and continue from 14 to 22.Setting those imperfection aside, what I really love about this anime are the creators of the story; their motivations, struggles, failures and success. I can strongly imagine Re: Creators without the over the top battles and just watch the slice of life part of it. That is why I have mixed feelings about the story.However, concept and theme wise, the story has a great potential to be a total masterpiece, but it was far from it.Art is Great (9). I love the 3D CG in this anime, the 3D CG perfectly melds the worlds together like the digitalization of the characters and world, the skills and abilities of the characters and Gigas Machina.The direction that they have chosen to approach the art is great, but it could have been perfect if they had decided to use different art styles for each of the characters. I understand that it would be difficult to unify different art styles in the story although it would be really cool to imagine how it would look.Sound is Good (7). ""gravityWall"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie opening theme for the first half of the story doesn\'t feel right. I could not feel that I am being set up for the world of Re: Creators.The second opening theme ""sh0ut"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie for the final half of the story is a little better, yet it still make me connect as much to the story with something like the opening for One Piece which clearly makes you feel that you will be on a grand adventure with its protagonists.Although what I appreciate more on the theme department is the ending song for the final half of the anime ""Rubikon (ルビコン)"" by Sangatsu no Phantasia. I could feel the Re: Creators feel which was paired with a beautiful animation. This could simply be the opening of the whole Re: Creators anime and ""world Étude"" by Aki Toyosaki for episode 13 should be the ending theme of the story.Characters are Very Good (8). I also have mixed feelings about the characters in the story since the main characters for me is Kota, Setsuna and Altair. The majority of the anime should be building these characters more in the story and not just 1 or 2 episodes for the back story. They are simply the heart, mind and soul of the anime if you break it down to its core, and this could also be one reason why the story felt the same: mixed feelings.I would like to give a special mention to Meteora in this anime, as of all the characters, she was the best written character for me and she accomplishes her role flawlessly as a support that does not eat the story with her presence, but enhances and drives the story forward. I could simply see her having her own spin-off story Kingdom Hearts style. *Make it HAPPEN!!!*All in all, I love Re: Creators for what it made me think, feel and understand.

So let\'s begin this Re:Creators reviews.Story:What if anime, light novel, manga, and even eroge characters can come to our world? The story of Re:Creators was begin when Mizushino Souta our ""main protagonist"" watch weekly anime entitled Eternal Symphony of Vogelchevalier. At the middle of that episode, there\'s a ""mysterious girl with military uniform"" fighting with Selesia Upitiria the main heroine of Vogelchevalier. When he thought it was a ""Special"" episode of Vogelchevalier, Souta suddenly enter the world of Vogelchevalier, right in the middle of the fight between Selesia and girl with military uniform"". After a few minutes inside the world of Vogelchevalier, Souta back into real world, and this time with Selesia and the girl with military uniform. Why Selesia can go to the real world? Who\'s the girl with military uniform? and What is the relationship between Souta and the girl with military uniform?The main concept of the Re:Creators is Reverse Isekai. As we know Isekai is a hit in this few years, and Re:Creators bring a fresh breeze for us who bored with ordinary Isekai anime and the idea to make the main antagonist is too overpowered make it even better and make us full of question and excitement about how to defeat her. But, nothing is perfect, right? There\'s several plot hole in this series, lack of characterization in this series and lack of consistency in storyline pace at the appropriate time. The main reason is too much ""main protagonists"" and that\'s make the main antagonist more likeable than our ""main protagonists"". So, I give 7/10 for the story.Art:Comparing to Ufotable, Troyca still below the level of them especially for the action sequence and to be honest I still prefer the Aldnoah/Zero artwork than Re:Creators. Aldnoah/Zero artwork look more dynamic and detailed than Re:Creators. But, it doesn\'t mean Troyca reduce their standard. They still one of the anime studios that got a high standard for their weekly anime release. You can see their hardwork when seeing the 2nd ending of this series. I give them 7/10 for this series art, this score is not fixed. I must watch Re:Creators in blu-ray edition to fixed this score.Sound:I like the timing and the way they used sound effect in Re:Creators, when the fight scene happen. The backsound, explosions, missile, magic casting and the other sound effect was perfectly fit and audible. More importantly it doesn\'t disturb the dialogue when those sequence happen. The voice acting is perfectly well, and with those kind of voice acting you can get to know the characters trait only from it, more than they can show to us in visual way.For the opening and ending Re:Creators has 2 opening and 2 main ending. Composed by Sawano Hiroyuki, gravityWALL the 1st opening of this series was a big hit when this series airing for the first time, just like the 2nd opening entitled shOut that also composed by him. I prefer the 2nd opening especially the opening sequence and the lyrics. Because, it make us know better our main antagonist, and maybe sympathize for her.For the ending we have NEWLOOK by Ayano Mashiro as the 1st ending and Rubicon by Sangatsu no Phantasia. I prefer the 2nd ending as well, because, this time the ending sequence teach us to respect the hardwork of the people who give us this anime and all anime in this world. For those who often harassing an anime series just because they can\'t meet your expectation just go watch this ending and see how hard they are trying to keep the anime industry running. With that I give 9/10.Character:What if Hatsune Miku using a military uniform with the trait like BlackRock Shooter? Well, you got our main antagonist Altair. What if Asuna coloring her hair red, and ride a giant robot with the trait like onee-san? Well, we got Selesia. When you watch Re:Creators, you will see the customization of all your favorite anime chara in this series and clash with each other. But because of that, the lack of characterization can be happen, especially when several new character emerge later. We must thanks to the voice acting of the seiyuu, at least know the traits of those characters because their performance. But, it doesn\'t enough for us to know better all of our favorite chara traits customization in Re:Creators except Altair. Because, when we summarize Re:Creators, we got ""Altair\'s Revenge"" and that\'s make this version of Miku become fans favorite and icon of this series and to see our favorite characters from other anime meet and fight each other its an own pleasure. That\'s why I gave it 7/10.Enjoyment:Did I enjoy this series? Yes. Did I recommend it? Why not. If you can\'t stand anime with the slow paced storyline, I didn\'t recommend this series. But, if you have patient and enjoying anime as it should be, Re:Creators would be a great series to test your patience, maturity, and teach you to respect the hardwork. Because it wasn\'t that bad like they say and it was a rare occasion to see our favorite chara from other anime (with a little modification of course) clash in 22 episode anime.AND, for those people who judging and harassing an anime that didn\'t meet your expectation at the some early episode. Please respect their hardwork. Even if you don\'t like it, doesn\'t mean you must hate it. Give them a chance. Because on this day anime is more than 3 or 5 episode (except hentai). How you know a whole content of book that consist of 500 pages if you just read the 3 first page of it? series.

How you know a whole content of book that consist of 500 pages if you just read the 3 first page of it?', 'Re:CREATORS is a show with a great concept executed in a way that doesn’t live up to its potential.The only reason I began watching this anime was the idea of characters from a large variety of genres all coming together in one series. Even upon realizing this show is not as good as I had hoped it would be, this idea was still intriguing enough to keep me going until the last episode.From a technical point, there is nothing wrong with Re:CREATORS at all. I had no issues with the sound design, the animation and overall design was fine and the fight scenes were...pretty decent.One thing that stood out to me was that beautiful second ending. That was nice. I like nice things.Another high point was that recap episode. It was pretty good. But even that one falls a bit flat as there was no real point to having a recap in the middle of a 22-episode anime.I mentioned the designs being fine. And they were. Kind of. The creators (ha) of this anime tried to have a diverse cast of characters with many different styles from a whole variety of media. But my one complaint here is that they all still looked kinda same-ish. Sure, their clothing and stuff like that was very unique. But not one of these people looked really out of place or as if they were drawn by another person. Now that would make sense – I guess – if they just looked like that within the creators’ realm. But in their own shows and in flashbacks etc they still look the same. So there’s that.But now to the things that truly tore this anime down to the terrible depths of MEDIOCRITY.One of the first things I noticed… Well no. The first thing everyone notices when watching this show is this weak-ass bland main character guy. Sure, when there’s a bunch of super-powered anime heroes and villains around fighting with guns n magic n shit, having someone weak and relatable in the mix could help grounding this whole thing. But if that was his goal, he overshot that goalpost by a mile and just kept going – he’s probably still going to this day and probably still whining about it.The other major issue was the writing. This show should have been shorter. Some episodes seemed to drag on for hours upon hours because the anime characters kept talking and talking… And I wouldn’t even mind that if what they were saying was any good. Instead, the dialogue felt needlessly complicated and stilted while still barely saying anything at all. Sometimes this show kept dragging on far too long. Kinda like this review does.There were so many themes and ideas this show could have explored, so many questions it could have asked. It quickly glossed over some of them but for the most part the surface remained unscratched.Are the stories the creations were taken from actually real or is there something else going on? How are the authors coming to terms with their creations being real? Do the creators want to change their worlds based on the fact that they are real now? What happens to a story when their main character just gets ported somewhere else?If a character dies in the real world do they die in their fictional world (which is also real)? If the creations’ abilites are based on public acceptance and can revert after some time, how did that one guy lose his one power permanently (for some time)? And what the fuck is up with that liar girl, like, just in general?Okay I wrote that last paragraph before watching the final episode. Now that I did watch it, I must admit that they do go into some (few) of these questions a bit more. But it’s still too little, too late.I would have loved this anime if it dealt with any of that in a way that was interesting. But no. The majority of the show was spent fighting and talking about why they’re fighting. Yet they never managed to get a good reason across. Character motivations were extremely weak throughout the entire series. Most deaths felt completely pointless. And pretty much everything that happened lacked any emotional impact whatsoever.tl;dr my viewer acceptance of this show was pretty low. pretty decent.One thing that stood out to me was that beautiful second ending.

I love the art, the concept, the structure of the story, the soundtrack is far and above all the other elements.I guess this is why I have this sensation that this show takes more from me than I\'m willing to give. Hiroyuki Sawano is a god of a composer, but this show does NOT deserve it. It feels almost as that meme from Tarzan: ""Phil Collins didn\'t have to go so hard for the Tarzan soundtrack, but he did that, he did that for us"". I could forget this anime completely but...the soundtrack will forever remain with me.This is not a review so much as it is a vent of how much more I wished this could\'ve been. So much potential. So much it had going for it. I wished to enjoy it for what it did not for how much I wanted it to be.If you want a recommendation, I will absolutely do. You cannot live through anime and not experience this mess of a brilliant idea at least once. Chances are you ALREADY know about it, you already heard this BANGGER of a soundtrack, but never knew where this came from. The story has its ups and downs, but overall it is extremely creative. The ONLY weak point is the main plot and the main character. The animation is outstanding and they so many risks that pay off.My only complain is that... it could\'ve been so much better. So much more. I wish... the soundtrack will forever remain with me.This is not a review so much as it is a vent of how much more I wished this could\'ve been. So much potential.

What would your character do if he or she came to life?Meeting face to face, what would your character say? What would you talk about? Would he or she be happy? Sad? Angry? Indifferent?Would the two of you get along? Or will the character hate you for the predisposed plot you created?What happens next? Would you be scared because your life is now at risk? Or are you glad that something you constructed turns out to be a unique individual, animated with life and personality in which you can call it your proudest...work yet?This anime is definitely a special treat to all the creators in the world. Whether it may a short story or an epic saga, the concept itself deeply resonate within the creative side of us.To top it off, it\'s an original anime with unique concepts that most likely paved a novel road for other companies suit to follow, inspiring artists alike to truly reflect on what is called their own masterpiece.※ STRENGTH ※► Fight scenes. Mesmerizing, puts your at the edge of the seat as you wonder what will happen. How each character from different manga and anime will ultimately fight for whatever it is that they believe in.► Music. If an 11/10 is possible, I would, without a hesitation, rate it as an epitome of its kind. Soundtrack, opening and ending. Sound effects, mid-way inspiring tone, sweet and relxing melody. Tunes that ultimately touch your heart, are the ones that leave the most impact.► Recap. This is EXACTLY how a recap episode should be produced.► Character design. With a wide array of characters, one can tell an immense amount of effort and work have been devoted to this project. Props to artwork, transitioning and character composition.► Anticipation. The sense of uneasiness. The feeling of unpredictability. An anime that aims to be a masterpiece should at least have knowledge of this and this has been repeatedly demonstrated.► Subtle beauty. There is something exquisite yet indirect about this. Perhaps it may be the vibe or the concept, but I can\'t help myself appreciating the parent-childlike relationship of creators and created.► Virtues. Whether it may be courage. Persistence. Hope. Or simply doing it because you feel like its the ""right"" thing to do. All these presented humanistic values just makes the show more human and relatable.► Feels. There were touching moments from Mamika\'s departing to Blitz finally meeting his daughter again paired with melodic tunes. My hearts were definitely touched.► Lessons. You\'ll take away something from this. Maybe it\'s how no one is successful in the beginning or the existential crisis of you should be constructing your personal character as of now. Whatever it may be, you\'ll learn and remember that mini tutoring Re:Creators gave you.► Death. It\'s part of life and should be applicable to all characters. I am glad to see that this anime isn\'t afraid to offer death to even the beloved characters that we slowly fell in love with.※ WEAKNESS ※► Too much dialogue. I think one of the biggest downfalls is the insane amount of explanation. The act of just talking was overboard as few episodes only consist speech rather than action. I found my hype for the anime to slowly dwindle away due to this primary reason.► Cliche MC problem. Sota is the epitome paragon of a shy and introverted man that we hate to be. Now. Just imagine if the MC had the knowledge, tenacity and determination of Lelouch from Code Geass, this would have been a much enjoyable show, wouldn\'t it?► Lack of follow-up. Some questions still remain unanswered. What ultimately happened with Altair? How did she appear in our world in the first place? If only these important inquiries were resolved at the end, it would have been more satisfying.► Magane. To those that wonder, Magane never went back to her own world. So what is going to happen with her? Why was there no depiction or a simple comedic relief at the end? All we can do is pray for an OVA.Was this a masterpiece? It definitely had potential but fell right off the tracks midway.Would you recommend? If you do not mind too much talking, you should give it a shot as there are lots of strengths to this anime.Overall, the first episode had an initial punch that motivated me to continue. Although the episodes halfway were lackluster, insipid and ultimately boring, the show made up for the loss with a satisfying ending.Though it had its own downfalls, this anime will leave you to ponder, whether you want to cease and abandon the route of creativity or build something potentially beautiful from scratch that will someday touch people\'s heart. work yet?This anime is definitely a special treat to all the creators in the world.

It certainly stands out from a lot of titles I\'ve seen and is one of the rare cases when I stumble upon a fairly original concept. The idea of manga and video game characters springing into existence is something that crosses the mind of every fan. The writers of Re:Creators aim to provide subtext and gravity to this idea, but given how ambiguously this title questions the rules in its own complex reality as a sign that the author Daiki Kase either bit off more...than he/she can chew, relied on the audience not asking crucial questions, or seeks to answer questions with questions. Its ambitiousness is both its greatest strength and weakness.STORY: I have to admit, before curiosity kicked in, I was set to really not like the first 10 minutes of this show. It began almost as I would expect *bonk on the head stories to play out in their initial minutes (*bonk on the head stories is how me and my close friends refer to anime or manga that involves characters being warped to another world, like Escaflowne, El Hazard, or Harukanaru Toki no Naka de). Intrigue intensifies as other characters from other forms of media begin to appear, as Meteroa, a tutorial guide sage from a video game, shows up an assists Sota and Selesia.It has to be pointed out that WHERE these characters are from isn\'t as important as WHY these characters were selected, and this is what makes aspects of Re:Creators very compelling. The authors of these stories are viewed as gods by their creations. It delves into the meta of not only certain genres, and the method and madness of writing stories as a whole. I\'ve written stories for years since Jr. High, and while I may have day dreamed about meeting my creations, it never dawned on me how exactly they\'d respond to my answer if asked by one of them why I put them through so much hardship. One of the ""creators"", Sugura, bluntly answers ""for entertainment"" when asked why he was forced to kill his own daughter in his story. It almost dabbles into questioning the metaphysical purpose of existence in a very pragmatic manner, but with fictional characters in a fictional setting. Two dimensional beings that can suddenly grasp reality, learn, and experience emotions outside the confines of their pre-written bios and tendencies makes for a fascinating watch.What some of the drawbacks regarding the execution of Re:Creators\' universe includes the pacing. This is a very dialog driven show, there\'s so many rules and variables that it introduces, at many points it repeats itself to ensure that the audience doesn\'t get too lost within the confines of its own lore when it introduces a new law, like changing canon of a character\'s story based on the acceptance of the fans.There\'s a point where Selesia is on the verge of defeat, her author, Matsuraba quickly sends out a tweet accompanied by concept art of her new powers that helps her turn the tide in a battle, based on retweets and fan anticipation. It makes sense when reaching the finale of the series why things happen at the pace and why writing a character that\'s stronger than Altair is out of the question, but it really takes the scenic route towards a conclusion that becomes very predictable midway through and renders a final battle that seemed only to serve as smoke and mirrors to shroud the obvious outcome. And you know your anime is a little too protracted when it calls for a mid-series recap in a 22 episode show. It\'s like checking in on your audience, ""You\'re getting all this, right?"" SCORE: 7.2/10ART: The animation doesn\'t cut corners, Re:Creators boasts very fluid production and quality along with an overall cool cast of characters. The blend of CGI has come a long way in anime and studio Troyca does a splendid job of integrating the mostly computer animated mecha piloted by Selesia and Kanoya very well.With the cast varying from magical shoujo, fantasy/adventure, modern day seinen and such, each creation has a very unique design and gives the illusion that they are indeed from various worlds, preferably Altair, Magane and Blitz Talker, the latter two being my two favorite designs, who stand out the most. Something is a bit lost when they\'re wearing street clothes and casual wear, but that\'s fine, they couldn\'t walk around in their game garb all the time. Action scenes are devoid of clutter and directed very well. Another great attention to detail is how the characters emote. I don\'t know if it\'s possible to call a cartoon good or bad actors, but the body language of a good portion of the cast is nicely done. SCORE: 8/10VOICE ACTING & MUSIC: This soundtrack is pretty amazing. Produced by Hiroyuki Sawano, the main themes used for poignant action sequences incorporate a lot of electronic rock. It\'s incredibly catchy. Thus far, it doesn\'t have a localized track, so there may not be an English dub. Each Creation predictably sounds about as archetypical as their outward personas would dictate, be it Alice\'s bold valor, Meteora\'s flat monotone cadence, or Yuya\'s cocky aloofness. These may be flavors and tropes that have been seen numerous times, but I actually don\'t mind it: 8/10CHARACTERS: What\'s kind of neat about how characters progress as compelling figures throughout Re:Creators is this a relatively intelligent cast and most of them come off as genuinely likeable people. One of the things I was dreading was the tired fish-out-of-water jokes from the Creations I grew bored with. They grab the concept of modern society fairly quickly and for the most part, are fighting to achieve their goals reasonably.The Military Uniform Princess, named Altair, wants to destroy the current plane of existence she refers to as the World of the Gods, by introducing so many fictional characters from many different works that the fundamental laws of physics begin to break down in the real world by causing discord. Magical girls or street punks that summon Personas (that\'s all I could think when Yuya conjured a samurai behind him) don\'t just exist. I can\'t explain in great detail what she is, but her ability to acquire new powers is due to her existence not being bound by a set story. She\'s an original character whose powers are only limited to the many doujin and fan pieces that exist of her. This makes for a very unpredictable antagonist.Magane Chikujoin is the smartest and most fascinating character to me, her actions, intelligence and skill set is probably why she\'s kept aside throughout and serves as a wildcard for either side. Near the end, they introduce some others, like the very useless Hikayu, who adds virtually nothing because she comes in so late. The dialog shared between Creations and their ""gods"", along with the tumultuous relationship makes for interesting exchanges. Sota himself is essentially human writer\'s block, and spends a lot of the series questioning himself and his ability to create. Despite being the lead and a bit of the catalyst, I was never interested in him because once you learn what hasn\'t been said about his history or Altair\'s existence, there\'s nothing for him to do until the plot calls for it, because it makes the climax way too obvious if it receives more focus. SCORE: 7/10OVERALL: If you\'re looking for a title that feels very different from most anime that\'s around, Re:Creators is a very unique endeavor. It\'s not quite great at challenging its ideas, barring if you\'re willing to hang up logic and enjoy it. The constant talking and explaining can make it feel like a total slog at times, and the red herrings thrown at me didn\'t really work. But at the same time, it doesn\'t try to insult your intelligence. And that soundtrack is amazing. If you have an Amazon Prime membership, I\'d say it\'s worth a try. 7.5/10PROS:- Great animation- Excellent music- Unique story, driven by fascinating secondary charactersCONS:- A little too wordy- Fairly predictable- There\'s a good chance you may be more interested in the series each Creation comes from than Re:Creators itself than he/she can chew, relied on the audience not asking crucial questions, or seeks to answer questions with questions. Its ambitiousness is both its greatest strength and weakness.STORY: I have to admit, before curiosity kicked in, I was set to really not like the first 10 minutes of this show. It began almost as I would expect *bonk on the head stories to play out in their initial minutes (*bonk on the head stories is how me and my close friends refer to anime or manga that involves characters being warped to another world, like Escaflowne, El Hazard, or Harukanaru Toki no Naka de). Intrigue intensifies as other characters from other forms of media begin to appear, as Meteroa, a tutorial guide sage from a video game, shows up an assists Sota and Selesia.It has to be pointed out that WHERE these characters are from isn\'t as important as WHY these characters were selected, and this is what makes aspects of Re:Creators very compelling. The authors of these stories are viewed as gods by their creations. It delves into the meta of not only certain genres, and the method and madness of writing stories as a whole. I\'ve written stories for years since Jr. High, and while I may have day dreamed about meeting my creations, it never dawned on me how exactly they\'d respond to my answer if asked by one of them why I put them through so much hardship. One of the ""creators"", Sugura, bluntly answers ""for entertainment"" when asked why he was forced to kill his own daughter in his story. It almost dabbles into questioning the metaphysical purpose of existence in a very pragmatic manner, but with fictional characters in a fictional setting. Two dimensional beings that can suddenly grasp reality, learn, and experience emotions outside the confines of their pre-written bios and tendencies makes for a fascinating watch.What some of the drawbacks regarding the execution of Re:Creators\' universe includes the pacing. This is a very dialog driven show, there\'s so many rules and variables that it introduces, at many points it repeats itself to ensure that the audience doesn\'t get too lost within the confines of its own lore when it introduces a new law, like changing canon of a character\'s story based on the acceptance of the fans.There\'s a point where Selesia is on the verge of defeat, her author, Matsuraba quickly sends out a tweet accompanied by concept art of her new powers that helps her turn the tide in a battle, based on retweets and fan anticipation. It makes sense when reaching the finale of the series why things happen at the pace and why writing a character that\'s stronger than Altair is out of the question, but it really takes the scenic route towards a conclusion that becomes very predictable midway through and renders a final battle that seemed only to serve as smoke and mirrors to shroud the obvious outcome. And you know your anime is a little too protracted when it calls for a mid-series recap in a 22 episode show. It\'s like checking in on your audience, ""You\'re getting all this, right?"" SCORE: 7.2/10ART: The animation doesn\'t cut corners, Re:Creators boasts very fluid production and quality along with an overall cool cast of characters. The blend of CGI has come a long way in anime and studio Troyca does a splendid job of integrating the mostly computer animated mecha piloted by Selesia and Kanoya very well.With the cast varying from magical shoujo, fantasy/adventure, modern day seinen and such, each creation has a very unique design and gives the illusion that they are indeed from various worlds, preferably Altair, Magane and Blitz Talker, the latter two being my two favorite designs, who stand out the most. Something is a bit lost when they\'re wearing street clothes and casual wear, but that\'s fine, they couldn\'t walk around in their game garb all the time. Action scenes are devoid of clutter and directed very well. Another great attention to detail is how the characters emote. I don\'t know if it\'s possible to call a cartoon good or bad actors, but the body language of a good portion of the cast is nicely done. SCORE: 8/10VOICE ACTING & MUSIC: This soundtrack is pretty amazing. Produced by Hiroyuki Sawano, the main themes used for poignant action sequences incorporate a lot of electronic rock. It\'s incredibly catchy. Thus far, it doesn\'t have a localized track, so there may not be an English dub. Each Creation predictably sounds about as archetypical as their outward personas would dictate, be it Alice\'s bold valor, Meteora\'s flat monotone cadence, or Yuya\'s cocky aloofness. These may be flavors and tropes that have been seen numerous times, but I actually don\'t mind it: 8/10CHARACTERS: What\'s kind of neat about how characters progress as compelling figures throughout Re:Creators is this a relatively intelligent cast and most of them come off as genuinely likeable people.

That's the most gentle review I can give this anime.It's a lot of good premises executed poorly. When the script can solve a problem or create a climax they used Deus ex machina. And that happens all the way to the end.Good actions scenes tho.If you really look into it, the MC doesn't have a reason to stay on the team. And the ending, which is a HUGE Deus ex Machina again, based in a inexplicable power. The power of just do what the plot needs.Watch if you don't have anything better to do. Go watch something better.

The interactions between the characters is also something great the best personally being the magane stuff between any character honestly shes evil in the sense of the acts yet she kind of does anything she wants nobody keeps her in a box and she does whatever the fuck she wants any interaction with her was Gold.The fighting in the series was great for what it was but for the most part the anime is just a lot of talking...which doesn't bother me at all but for this particular series it does.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Imagine having characters you created for a anime ppl watch that anime and you are able to edit certain characters to your liking but in order for things to change the audience needs to accept it and then imagine that for multiple characters add in one Overpowered character who has a dead creator and wants to destroy everything and nobody can do any damage to her whatsoever then add another character who is created for the sole purpose to defeat the Op character but because the audience doesnt accept the random change that doesnt work then add in a creator whos dead and is brought back to life as a creation from another creator who has a connection to said person to defeat the creation they made while they were alive....

By bringing characters from existing works (or inspired by them) into the ""real world"", he does an excellent job of demonstrating the feeling that a work would probably have about his actor, with some exaggerations at times, but ignorable giving the quality of most dialogues.To summarize, the work has good dialogues and charismatic characters, but at one time or another it presents running details that affect it slightly.Unlike the characters we have the soundtrack, perfect at ALL times, giving the...right feeling at the right time, joining the excellent animation creating the feeling of fluidity that the work deserves.It is important to say that the work is not a case of ""anime carried by Ost"", as it oozes creativity and charisma.

Score: 7.8', '[This review is spoiler free!] TL;DR: Re: Creators\' bland characters and horrible pacing make this anime a good show to play when you are in need of some sleep. If you like the reverse isekai genre and/or enjoy a variety of genres, Re:Creators\' unique concept might interest you. However I cannot full-heartily recommend it.On premise alone, Re: Creators is a breath of fresh air in the isekai community. Without giving any spoilers, the first episode was very promising. The animation is amazing, however the fast pacing makes the anime hard to keep up with times.Re: Creators wastes no time to introduce it\'s characters. In...the first 3 episodes, you are completely bombarded with different characters, each with differing styles and character types. Initially, this was very overwhelming.It clearly felt like the authors were being overly ambitious by cramming in a wide variety of character\'s into a 23 minute episode. Do you like a strong female lead? Here you go! Interested in soft-spoken, Kuudere looking girls? We got some of that too! How about a magical school girl? Yep, you got it.Re: Creators has a very interesting synopsis, however the writing is nothing special.All the characters feel extremely one dimensional and stereotypical for their original stories. Rather than fleshed out character that I am supposed to fall in love with, they felt like generic concepts. There is simply no depth to them. Characters based in reality are so unrealistic that almost instantly I disliked them. For instance, ""My fictional character\'s are coming to life? Lemme just call up my other author friends and see if it\'s happening to them too!"". If I was an author and my creations suddenly came to life, I would properly give more of an initial reaction than calling some friends up. Regardless, the fantasy characters aren\'t much better. They are so predictable it\'s nothing more than disappointing. Imagine the ""I\'m a knight! I would do anything to save my people, even if it meant completely destroying this world"" type, and ""I\'m the bad guy, lemme flirt with some girls because... I\'m the bad type.""The characters are boring, mild and completely uninspiring. That is saying something considering how heavily this anime relies on character dialogue.Rather than interesting fight scenes, or gradually revealing the plot as the show processes, we are spoon fed information. The characters will sit around a big table and spit information for minutes on end, while giving you nothing more than a boring conference room to look at. This moves onto my biggest problem with Re;Creators, pacing. Either some episodes are terribly slow and boring, or they are too fast paced and confusing. Mix that in with cliche/predictable writing, and you have yourself a bit of a snooze fest.Instead of watching it all from the beginning, you could save yourself the time and begin from episode 13, the recap episode. Honestly, it tells you everything you need to know about the characters, catches you up to date on everything, and you won\'t really be missing out on much.Although unpredictable characters like Magane Chikujouin definitely added some variety and spice to the series, her introduction was too late for the show to be saved in my opinion.If you are interested in reverse isekais and have an interest in a variety of genres, you may like this one. The beautiful and unique character design definitely kept me going at parts. However, I have decided this one isn\'t for me. You can expect a slow burn and plenty of character chatter.

That\'s exactly what Re:Creators is about.The story follows Sota Mizushino, a young high school student and anime fanatic who dreams of writing his own light novel. When he watched the animation from the mecha light novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier for inspiration, the tablet he was watching the anime on went haywire, leading him into the world of animation where he witnessed firsthand the battle between anime characters Selesia and a mysterious girl in a military uniform. After returning with Selesia, Sota realized that other characters from different stories and media formats were also brought into the real world. Some of them formed alliances with the princess in the military uniform named Altair, who promised to end the conflicts in their respective worlds and show them the way home, but without them knowing her true intentions. In order to stop her, Sota and Selesia decide to find the other characters and bring them home before Altair plunges every world that exists into disaster.One thing to say up front is that Re:Creators is a very dialogue-heavy show, so it\'s already rejected by a lot of people. The story of Re:Creators had an amazing premise, but it was a bit difficult to follow at times. Still, the dialogue was always interesting enough to follow closely and I didn\'t feel like I was bored by it. The ending, however, was, to put it as vaguely as possible, rather a bit of a disappointment. While I understand why they went that route, because Altair was just way too powerful and honestly couldn\'t be defeated, it still felt wrong somehow.The nice thing about how the characters develop into compelling characters over the course of Re:Creators is that it\'s a relatively intelligent cast and most of them come across as genuinely likeable people. They grasp the concept of modern society pretty quickly and, for the most part, struggle to achieve their goals in a reasonable manner. The dialogue between the creations and their ""gods"", along with their parent-child relationships, makes for interesting and amusing conversations.Now we come to the only exception: Meteora. Meteora, on the other hand, is not so much a character as a plot element. At the beginning I liked her and her personality, but she gives tons of explanations about things she absolutely cannot possibly know, and is always right. The only time she was wrong, she wasn\'t even completely wrong, and she immediately knew what the missing element was shortly after.As for the sound, I\'ll just say 2 words: Sawano, Hiroyuki.The soundtrack is just amazing. The OP\'s are very catchy and fit the anime incredibly well. The various insert songs also add to the atmosphere very well. When an insert song isn\'t leading you through a beautifully animated battle, the background music enhances many of the emotions you feel from episode to episode. This soundtrack is definitely a must-have.Speaking of the battles, I also want to rave about the animation again. The animation doesn\'t leave much to be desired either. The art is of high quality, especially the design of the characters. Each one has a stereotypical, yet unique look and clothing to match. Additionally, they look nothing alike and a different color palette was used for each character. There was a lot of CGI used in the show, yet none of it felt out of place. The special effects were superb and contributed very well to the fights. The fights were fast and fluid. The fights alone are worth watching Re:Creators.Re:Creators is a damn good anime, but it also comes with some problems. If you\'re looking for a title that stands out from most other anime, Re:Creators is the first thing that would come to mind by now.

Here are my thoughts:The premise of this 22-episode anime is quite cool and exceptionally unique. Superficially, Re:Creators is a so-called 'reverse-isekai' show, but in reality it is much more than this. All I can say without going into spoilers is that characters from a diverse variety of fantasy/sci-fi stories appear in real-life Japan, where they interact with one another and meet the creators of their respective stories (side note: I think this would be a great premise for a comedy anime too).This is a very dialogue-heavy show. There are few actual action scenes, which is more than fine with me but...did (pleasantly) defy my initial expectations. If you go into this anime wanting action scenes, you will be disappointed. This anime is far more a fantasy drama than it is an action show.Sometimes this anime can be very exposition-heavy. In particular, the early episodes of both cours contain heavy exposition dumps. Very little effort is made to make these exposition dumps more palatable for the viewer. As I recall, there are multiple >10-minute exposition speeches that take place in a dull conference room with zero visual flair or anything to add entertainment value. My geeky sperg self was completely fine with this (and I was extremely interested in this anime's writing), but a different viewer might find it hard to swallow. The exposition is fascinating (in my view) and all necessary for the later story developments to make sense, but the delivery could have been handled better. Despite this, the conversational nature of this show is a major strong point, in my opinion. The dialogue is often very thoughtful and contains many memorable lines. During some scenes the script is absolutely phenomenal. I really do mean that; at its best, this anime contains some of the finest scriptwriting I have ever witnessed.All of the fantasy characters in this ooze personality, and their interaction both among themselves and with their creators is one of the best features of this anime. However, the MC is kind of bland and lacking personality, aside from being your typical useless cowardly teenage-male anime protagonist. Thankfully the cast is quite large and he doesn't speak that often. In fact, even referring to him as the MC is exaggerating the significance of his character (arguably the real MC is Meteora). Even so, he was definitely a weak aspect of this anime. I would even say he is the weakest link in the show; in general, this anime is at its worst when the focus is on the MC. However, his presence is necessary for the plot to work, so perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh. Also, although this is fairly minor, I found the involvement of the government-official woman to be annoying. The involvement of the military/government in general made it feel like a generic anime action show, and sucked away screentime from the show's true strengths. I get that it was necessary to include the government to have the plot make sense, but I found their on-screen presence to be excessive.Overall the plot is great, and often creative and inventive, although some of the details can be a little wonky or confusing. Re:Creators is very ambitious in what it seeks to accomplish with its story, so I'm willing to be lenient about some hand waviness. If you put every little plot mechanic under a microscope, you'll definitely find things to nitpick. From a broad view it's excellent though, and I was always interested in the story and eager to see what would happen next. In fact, I burned through episodes of this anime and struggled to turn it off, and couldn't stop thinking about it. Literally, this anime kept me awake at night staring at the ceiling. I was totally hooked, which surely is evidence of a great story. On the surface, the plot resembles a typical 'battle royale' story in some ways, but there is deeper meaning lurking beneath this.Beyond the mundane plot details, Re:Creators explores unique thought-provoking themes in creative ways. The writing incorporates themes such as the relationships between a story and both its creator and its reader, comparisons between fictional worlds and real life, the emotions of a fiction creator and the creative process, the experiences and feelings of a self-aware fictional character, and the nature of how a character develops within a story. These writing themes connected with me on a deep personal level and touched me emotionally. I felt very strong emotions while watching this anime.It was so enjoyable to watch all these characters from different fictional worlds interact with their creators and one another. There are elements in the writing and script that are clearly meant to appeal to storywriters and other content creators. In some ways, Re:Creators feels like a celebration of fiction itself.In terms of visuals, this show is nothing special. The character designs are good, and there are some occasional nice moments during action scenes. Otherwise, the animation quality is adequate at best, and there are tons of sloppy frames. Conversely, audio is a stronger component of the show. The sound effects are quite well done; even mundane stuff like the sound of background noise in rooms is implemented with detail and care. The soundtrack is good, and both the OP songs are absolutely terrific (I replayed the OP sequence at least 100 times, not exaggerating). The voice acting is alright; nobody's voicework really stood out to me besides Meteora and Magane (she has great facial expressions too). Meteora provides a lot of the exposition, so it's good that her voice is nice.My overall rating: 9/10Re:Creators has a fantastic premise that is executed well, albeit with some minor plot wonkiness. The story is exceptionally creative and engaging, while also exploring fascinating abstract themes about fiction itself. It truly is a unique artistic creation. The fantasy characters and their interactions are very enjoyable, and the dialogue is often thoughtful and memorable. This anime is exceptional in many ways. I eagerly burned through the episodes like they were popcorn; seriously, this is the most binge-watch-inducing show I've seen in years. For me, Re:Creators was such a joyful thrill. During its best episodes this anime is mind blowing.The emotional side of me wants so badly to rate this 10/10, but I can't ignore the fact that there are some weaker episodes and that the show does objectively have some minor flaws. Regardless, I really do believe that Re:Creators is a very special one-of-a-kind work of art that deserves far more appreciation.The premise of this show is potent imagination fuel. Can you imagine meeting the characters from your favourite stories IRL? We can only dream.

Conversely, audio is a stronger component of the show. The sound effects are quite well done; even mundane stuff like the sound of background noise in rooms is implemented with detail and care. The soundtrack is good, and both the OP songs are absolutely terrific (I replayed the OP sequence at least 100 times, not exaggerating). The voice acting is alright; nobody's voicework really stood out to me besides Meteora and Magane (she has great facial expressions too). Meteora provides a lot of the exposition, so it's good that her voice is nice.My overall rating: 9/10Re:Creators has a fantastic premise that is executed well, albeit with some minor plot wonkiness. The story is exceptionally creative and engaging, while also exploring fascinating abstract themes about fiction itself. It truly is a unique artistic creation. The fantasy characters and their interactions are very enjoyable, and the dialogue is often thoughtful and memorable. This anime is exceptional in many ways. I eagerly burned through the episodes like they were popcorn; seriously, this is the most binge-watch-inducing show I've seen in years. For me, Re:Creators was such a joyful thrill. During its best episodes this anime is mind blowing.The emotional side of me wants so badly to rate this 10/10, but I can't ignore the fact that there are some weaker episodes and that the show does objectively have some minor flaws. Regardless, I really do believe that Re:Creators is a very special one-of-a-kind work of art that deserves far more appreciation.The premise of this show is potent imagination fuel. Can you imagine meeting the characters from your favourite stories IRL? We can only dream. If fiction is something that's personally important to you, then you should watch this anime."", ""I was quite into what I saw at the start of the series, the art style is great, the effects were well done apart from some awkward little cgi scenes, the fight scenes were amazing and the sound to go with it was top tier. If you're looking for a story that you haven't really seen before this is what you might be craving and it will hold your interest throughout every episode.I had a few issues with relationship development and Souta though. First half of the series I had this at a solid 8/10 but by the end of it I had to drop...it to a 7/10. Throughout the second half of the series Souta became so incredibly painful to watch in some scenes and his total lack of spine or backbone was off putting. He redeemed himself a bit at the end of the show, but there was also a bunch of missed opportunities with character and relationship development between Souta and specific female characters.The end of the show is very predictable and it just ended very blandly after taking you for a wild great ride for most of it. These negatives however are only personal taste I was just expecting more from Souta and the end of the show and was let down.Altair and Meteora's characters make up for those pet peeves though and Magane kept things very interesting her character was just great fun to watch. So if you are like me I definitely recommend you watch this anime purely to see these 3 characters in action, it's quite exciting.At the end of the day I enjoyed myself with this series and Altair is one of the most amazing antagonists that I have seen in anime. She's definitely going at the top of my list it to a 7/10.

Cuz the anime itself was doo dooThe concept itself isn\'t too bad, game and anime characters coming to life and battling an op villain, is fucking awesome. But over the course of the show it tries to be something it\'s not and the dynamic is ruined from the vibe we\'ve been given since episode 1. I gave it...a bit more before dropping it to see if things got better in the later half of the show, but nope. Things just got more complicated and the direction of the show just gets hazier and hazier. The plot progression of this anime is SLOW, and the fights are pretty much just ""bunch of strong dudes beating strong dudes while talking"". I think if Re:CREATORS just became a fighting action series instead of friendship saves the day, my reception of the show would have changed, but as it stands this shit was wack as fuck.The only character I liked was magane (that sharped toothed girl) , she got me feeling different lmao, I don\'t even know what to say about the rest of the cast... one dimensional? lazy writing? or just cliche? or all? Yeah its all of them4/10Overall I don\'t like the show, and I don\'t think anyone over the age of 12 would enjoy it. However they did get extra points for that last episode, I think it was pretty solid.

Unfortunately, I found that this show took a SUPER super long time to get good, I\'d say it finally started to get somewhat interesting around the 17th episode, but I stuck it out because I reasoned that it wasn\'t too long. To be fair, the ending of the show was really redeeming and pretty good. I will give a small breakdown on how I thought the show performed in each category:Story (6)- It was a unique story for sure, and I was impressed...on how well thought out the plot was for an anime original show. However, there were far too many ""convenient"" plot devices that allowed to move the story forward, in a way that did not seem well planned. For example, ""Secret Weapons"" become incredibly easy to predict in this show.Art (7)- Pretty decent art, I was quite the fan of it even though it wasn\'t anything special like on the levels of WIT or Ufotable.Sound (6)- Usually I give sound a high score for most animes due to their unique sfx and osts that were used, but this one is quite lower. If it wasn\'t for the Sawano tracks such as Gravity Wall, I probably would\'ve labeled this category as a 3. This is because most of the tracks are continuously repeated along with the sfx, and I\'ve heard the sfx tracks from other media, so they weren\'t anything new.Character (3)- Oh boy, this one is a yikes. To be fair, it had to be extremely hard to make a good amount of nice, well-rounded characters in the show with such little time for the plot to develop. I am a huge fan of Altair\'s character design though, it is very nice.Enjoyment (6)- As a said in the first paragraph, it was an alright show. I was bored for most of it, but it redeemed itself quite a bit at the end.Overall- 7 on how well thought out the plot was for an anime original show.

The fight scene's are done pretty decently all the way through, and theres actually an interesting take on a recap episode. But overall the characters, and their relationships were about as interesting as watching paint dry. I think reading the entirety of rent a girlfriend is a better use of your time (i wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy). It took me maybe 6 months to get through this 22 episode show due to the absolute dullness. The first 1/3 is entertaining, but after the exposure...to this interesting idea wears off you're left with an incredibly mundane experience. Some people might enjoy it as a whole, I definitely did not and don't recommend it. to this interesting idea wears off you're left with an incredibly mundane experience.

Re:Creators is the dream of many writers to combine a cornucopia of genres, characters, and stories into one action pack extravaganza. A love letter to the anime medium as a whole. It has a message about the reality of art and the struggling artist it is very well crafted. As an anime it falls slightly short of greatness.To best describe this show, I would best describe it as a saltine cracker. It is inoffensive, good-natured,...and will satisfy your hunger. But that is all it will do. It lacks the flavor and hype of other anime. A pop tart it is not. It is a good anime but lacks the necessary components to become great.If someone read a book on how to create an anime then this would be the product. It feels like someone followed a step by step recipe for creating a show using every piece of advice and tool written in the guide.

It does start bumpy and gets tedious in the middle, but at the end provides a payoff that I felt was worth it. (I’ve now watched the series twice and enjoyed it more the second time.)The reverse-isekai premise is intriguing and quite more complicated than the traditional one where the transported person frequently understands the new world better than those who live there. It’s one thing to be the only real person in a fictional world, especially since you’re already familiar with the existence of fictional...worlds. It’s another to suddenly discover you’re a fictional character now living in the real world inhabited by people who have god-like power over you and your world. And then to interact with your creator and discover they’re weaker, both in strength and character, than you. Pretty soul-shaking and devastating, actually. Now watch several fictional characters deal with that and interact with each other at the same time.Re:C doesn’t explain “how” this situation came to be but it does explain “why”, because that’s important to character motivation and how things then play out. (And that isn’t fully fleshed out until the very end.)Characters:Of course fictional characters brought into the real world would seem comparatively 2D, without any depth. (It’s necessarily accentuated since the “real” world here is actually fictional, so nested fictional worlds begin to look toy-like.) That’s the point. But then they develop depth and evolve away from their story versions as they wake-up and adjust to the real world.There are a lot of “creation” characters here. It would take a long time in this series to develop complete depth for all of them. So they do this for a few (hence the tedious middle), they delay it for some until the very end, and they avoid it for many. Some might find fault with this but I don’t see a way around it.

The hype didn't give it the momentum to be an instant classic, and indeed some things are missing in this show, but that doesn't mean it's any less good. It remains as a bold, complicated story with some real knockout visuals which definitely hold up today and will continue to do so for a long time indeed....Beginning with the story, we are presented with this unique reverse isekai concept, which gets going from square one and really doesn't stop delivering on action until the very end. The pacing feels comfortable, beginning and resolving in ways which make sense in the story, while not letting up on the constant threat which hangs over the cast. Furthermore, the writing is simultaneously dramatic, endearing, and believable. The 'creations', as they're called, speak and act in ways which are in line with their reality as anime and video game characters which have been brought to our world. Though, there are the occasional slip-ups where suspension of disbelief is challenged, even given the already ambitious concept. It also gets confused near the end, suffering from a failure to strictly define what certain powers can and cannot do. I feel like these mistakes are enough to keep this intriguing story from earning more praise. The art is broadly very impressive, with engaging action scenes, detailed backgrounds, and smooth animation. Though, it really exceeds in character design. The designs are unique, characteristic, and memorable from start to finish, which can be difficult to pull off when they're meant to be referencing so many different existing properties, yet they successfully do so while maintaining each individual character's unique traits. The only thing which I don't like about the art is how the eyes occasionally look cheaply done, but that's not the case most of the time. However, it is the sound which manages to rise above as this anime's strongest aspect. It is extremely impressive at every turn, from the voice work to the ost, but the sounds of battle are far and away the most impactful. The action scenes have this arresting bass which blasts through the air and catches the viewer off guard time and time again. It accents the inherent adrenaline of the show, and makes for a uniquely immersive experience. The characters are all fairly strong, especially when it comes to their most potent motivations. Of the characters, my favorites have to be Meteora and Marine, each for the way they engage in their passions and evaluate problems as they arise. Distinct from each other, but also distinct from the rest of the cast. In a way, they feel the most real, which is ironic considering Meteora's situation. Overall, Re:Creators is a solid anime that was perhaps subject to unfair expectations due to the hype of its day. Give it a watch, especially if you're a fan of reverse isekai, or referential anime.

and that\'s exactly what it happens,most of the characters ended up feel generic and dull,even the main female character(Selesia),feels like she have...a personality made in an assembly line - the only two characters that have an almost decent err ""Character build"" are the magical girl one and the chaotic neutral one whose power is in her talking,apparently,both have relatively short screentime,one of them even leaves the show before the first half,leaving me with no interesting character for the whole second half.Another thing that it\'s plain bad about this anime is just how much it fails to live to it\'s own hype,it\'s own lore;Most of the characters are quite annoyed that their battles and suffering was all for entertainment\'s sake,yet the anime itself have no problem glorifying battles and stuff them even when there could be easy way around.Then there are all the plot holes that the anime fills in the most lazy and blatant way by literally making stuff at the moment,making things happen out of thin hair - and even tries to make it sound less bad by stating that you can\'t make things up without an audience that accepts it yet every single time the audience accepts it like a bunch of NPCs...right.There\'s an incredible lack of self-awareness generally,at one point one of the secondary characters dies and the villain says pretty much""Too bad you\'re not a main character you never stand a chance"",and I was like""Yeah thank you for telling me you didn\'t even try to subvert my expectations""......the main antagonist is the embodiment of making stuff up,she has virtually unlimited powers and comes up with stuff on the stop,making her getting out of any predicament just like that - it\'s just lazy writing at its finest.The only one time I was mildly surprised was when one of the main characters died...but I was kinda glad it happened since it made the story more bearable,not because I had something against that character in particular,but only because it made the story less bloated than it already was.The dialogues are atrocious,they\'re just exposition monologues and they\'re endless,during the fights,there\'s the ""Fight and talk"" cliché happening all the time (e.g. 1 attack then talk,1 another attack then more talking,etc.) - there\'s even an episode that feels like a company meeting to plan next year strategy it\'s laid down in the most un-compelling way possible it made the show so hard to watch.The finale is just as bad as the rest of the anime,again using the ""Making stuff up"" card by literally bringing back from the dead a real life human as a creation...rightttt,and despite the antagonist going full well that she is just an imitation,not the real person,she...goes along with it and all ends well!...lol,really,sure,whatever,make stuff up,terrible plot. a personality made in an assembly line - the only two characters that have an almost decent err ""Character build"" are the magical girl one and the chaotic neutral one whose power is in her talking,apparently,both have relatively short screentime,one of them even leaves the show before the first half,leaving me with no interesting character for the whole second half.Another thing that it\'s plain bad about this anime is just how much it fails to live to it\'s own hype,it\'s own lore;Most of the characters are quite annoyed that their battles and suffering was all for entertainment\'s sake,yet the anime itself have no problem glorifying battles and stuff them even when there could be easy way around.Then there are all the plot holes that the anime fills in the most lazy and blatant way by literally making stuff at the moment,making things happen out of thin hair - and even tries to make it sound less bad by stating that you can\'t make things up without an audience that accepts it yet every single time the audience accepts it like a bunch of NPCs...right.There\'s an incredible lack of self-awareness generally,at one point one of the secondary characters dies and the villain says pretty much""Too bad you\'re not a main character you never stand a chance"",and I was like""Yeah thank you for telling me you didn\'t even try to subvert my expectations""......the main antagonist is the embodiment of making stuff up,she has virtually unlimited powers and comes up with stuff on the stop,making her getting out of any predicament just like that - it\'s just lazy writing at its finest.The only one time I was mildly surprised was when one of the main characters died...but I was kinda glad it happened since it made the story more bearable,not because I had something against that character in particular,but only because it made the story less bloated than it already was.The dialogues are atrocious,they\'re just exposition monologues and they\'re endless,during the fights,there\'s the ""Fight and talk"" cliché happening all the time (e.g. 1 attack then talk,1 another attack then more talking,etc.) - there\'s even an episode that feels like a company meeting to plan next year strategy it\'s laid down in the most un-compelling way possible it made the show so hard to watch.The finale is just as bad as the rest of the anime,again using the ""Making stuff up"" card by literally bringing back from the dead a real life human as a creation...rightttt,and despite the antagonist going full well that she is just an imitation,not the real person,she...goes along with it and all ends well!...lol,really,sure,whatever,make stuff up,terrible plot.', 'Re: Creators is a series that I have a lot of affection for, and that is precisely why it costs me more than I thought to talk about it, because the word ""potential"" always comes to my head, however, and unfortunately, it does so because of the lack of it.I have already spoken on occasion about some of the details of the series, but I never began to write in a moderately serious way my thoughts, which are not few, and I thought it was a good time to, at least, try to put a little order in my head.On paper, Re: Creators sounds very...good, too good; a series that tells you how in the world, different fictional characters leave their respective worlds to come to ours, with the infinity of possibilities that this entails, in addition to the problems caused by all the clashes between their reality and ours.Said in this way it could not look better, and to that, we must add all those people who are behind the project, which is not unambitious, however, this is where the problems begin, or rather, where the conception problems that had from the beginning come to light.Let\'s start with the most important factor in the play: the characters. A series based entirely on its cast of protagonists, on how they relate to others, with the world around them, and with their own internal conflicts about what they are, who they are, and why they are in the world, it tends to have certain problems about how they pose their universe and, above all, how they tell their story.In fact, one of the main problems of the series is its focus, since the action is an element that predominates above all things, which is not a bad thing, but it becomes a real problem when battles, fights, and all that act of confrontation become the axis of the story, the motivation of the characters, and the reason for all the actions of the characters.A series that is pure action is not equivalent to a bad series, far from it, but it is when you notice that you have something else to tell and even more when you notice that you want to tell that something, but you are too focused on explosions and to see who has the biggest giant robot.The intentions of Re: Creators are there, from minute 1, if not before, because at the beginning we are introduced to what we could consider the protagonist or, at least, that character that the series uses to show us everything from within ourselves as spectators.This is not a problem per se, but it becomes one when the focus is lost, again.It is obvious that they try to tell us a story about inspiration, about how we can all create something, no matter how small it may be, and that something can influence others, even if we do not realize it, and all that does not take two chapters to come. down because the play seems to have no other interest than showing bigger and bigger explosions with each passing chapter as it introduces more and more characters.At least that is the impression it gives until a certain episode arrives, one in which your perception of everything seen can change, and it surprises you because at this point you wonder if the intentions of the team behind the series really wanted you to tell that something or just wanted an excuse to design potential waifus with robots, weapons, and armor.As I said, the core of this series are the characters, there are better ones and there are worse ones, but it is not until we are introduced to one of them that the series takes more than an uncertain course, which makes everything else .. . interesting.Magane Chikujoin, an agent of chaos, a character that with her simple presence makes you doubt about what is going to happen now, leaves you expectant and leaves you wanting to know more about her and her world. Maybe too much.Once she appears on the scene, she steals all the spotlight. It is that it enters the scene and that you stop caring about all the other characters because you simply want to know more about that mysterious, sadistic, cruel, charismatic, and chaotic girl.Is this that Magane is the best character in the series? No. But it is a before and after for this one, because the direction that Re: Creators takes from its inclusion is one that you don\'t know where attention is going to be directed now. She is not bad, but she is not good either, she just is and that\'s it, she doesn\'t have to have a background beyond that, which she shows in each of her appearances, doing what she wants when she wants without regard, in a series where literally everything is so scripted and so stark, it couldn\'t be a more perfect contrast.Although Magane is the one who gets all the attention when she appears, there is another character that many leave aside, but who, in the end, is the one who carries the weight of everyone else around her on her shoulders, the one who shows us that she is not. They need to be the strongest, the prettiest, or the one with the most dialogue to be a cornerstone in the series you belong to, and it could not be anyone but ...

And I am no less than you.""At this point you might think it is nonsense to say something like that, however, let\'s put ourselves in context.Re: Creators has a great flaw, which is its lack of climax. Not only at the plot level, but with each episode that passes there is a void that extends during the viewing of the entire series, and it is nothing more and nothing less than the lack of climactic moments where the viewer is stunned by the magnificence of a scene. But don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not talking about some super epic battle scene or some shocking and dramatic death, but those kinds of scenes where you feel everything that is happening, where you can\'t say more than ""This was worth it. "".The first time this happened to me it wasn\'t in a battle, it wasn\'t even with a leading character; The first time I thought that Re: Creators had something to prove, it was in that boardroom where Kikuchihara is explaining the Creations plan in the face of Altair\'s threat. There are no shots, no great dialogue, no spectacular backdrop. Everything happens in a room while a character exposes his ideas to others, that\'s all.This shows that this story has ways to blow you away when it wants, the fact is, when does it really want to?That said, let\'s move on to another scene of this style, not because of what happens, but because of how you feel like a spectator, and here I do allow myself to be much more obvious, denoting a death scene, but not just any death, but one that leaves teaching both to another of the main characters and to us as an audience.

To talk about a philosophical aspect and wonder what the ""I"" really is? To make a bunch of characters each one more different than the last one start fighting? To show what the medium of an animation series is like, the process of creation, and the reception of the public? About personal acceptance?There are many topics that this work deals with or rather, that it tries to do, exactly like this kind of review, so I can\'t find a better way to talk about it than using its own methods.To be closing, it is enjoyable, it is entertaining, but it does not go beyond that, no matter how hard I try, and it is difficult to accept that something with so much potential has been left in no man\'s land because it shows that there is a lot of love behind each and every one of the details of the series.As a writer, I respect who created this universe, but I could not say that he gave everything of himself so that his feelings when creating would reach us.I leave many things in the pipeline, but at least I was able to put a little order to the ideas that had been around in my head for weeks that I finished the series because even with all the negative that I could get, I have affection for him, world, its intentions and above all, its characters, maybe not for the right reasons, but reasons after all. good, too good; a series that tells you how in the world, different fictional characters leave their respective worlds to come to ours, with the infinity of possibilities that this entails, in addition to the problems caused by all the clashes between their reality and ours.Said in this way it could not look better, and to that, we must add all those people who are behind the project, which is not unambitious, however, this is where the problems begin, or rather, where the conception problems that had from the beginning come to light.Let\'s start with the most important factor in the play: the characters.

From the main character to the others. They're so infuriating. It's like the writer intentionally made them as stupid as humanly possible. And not just one or two. Nearly every single one of them. Half way through at around episode 12 they improve to not be complete morons. But episode 13 is some weird recap episode that completely breaks the fourth wall. 16 is even a token hot spring episode. And more stupid as hell characters are introduced later. Just illogical irredeemably stupid.All things considered I wanted to hate the series. But even despite the...things that made me angry about it I couldn't.It's pretty emotional though so if you're going through a hard time I'd give this one a pass until you're in a better state of mind. things that made me angry about it I couldn't.It's pretty emotional though so if you're going through a hard time I'd give this one a pass until you're in a better state of mind."", ""If you're on the edge of watching this anime, if you're reading the reviews and being intimidated by the 5's, 4's, 3's etc, if you're wondering what's the point because of how bad some people are saying it is, I would recommend giving it a chance before moving on. Here's why.A majority of the people on MAL that give anime extremely low ratings have extreme expectations because like myself they have watched hundreds if not thousands of hours of anime. After watching so much anime it gets to the point you can look at the cover art, title, anime description, and guess the entire plot...and character actions for the anime. You can watch the first 2-5 minutes of the first episode and guess the rest of the show. You can pick out the characters that will be good, bad, betray their friends, live, and die. Of course viewers like this are going to be upset with this anime which strives to out due all the rest by converging all the worlds into one. I also see a lot of reviews based on emotion and opinion rather then intellectual thought. I do agree to a degree though.STORY:The story for the anime itself is somewhat basic. From the beginning you can tell what's going to happen and guess each characters back story but it's interesting nonetheless.

Shounen Onmyouji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1557/Shounen_Onmyouji,"['-INTRODUCTION-My love for ancient Japan and Japanese mythology got me into yet another great anime. Onmyouji is even in the title; obviously, I couldn\'t go past it.-STORY- 10/10""If that is your wish, then I will break my heart for the sake of that wish, and I will lend you my strength. This is why I am by your side.""The story is set in Heian period of ancient Japan. It follows Abe no Masahiro (Abe no Seimei\'s grandson), a young onmyouji in training. Accompanied by his guardian and partner Guren, a powerful shikigami, Masahiro faces off against different mononoke that disturb the peace of the city....The anime is divided into two main stories, which are the adaptation of the first two arcs of the original light novel. The transition between the arcs, however, is done very smoothly, and there is no obvious \'break\' point -- the story flows naturally throughout the entire twenty six episodes.Though some may see it as a comedy at first glance, Shounen Onmyouji gradually develops into a serious drama with gentle romantic subplot that touches upon some of the very important points -- like understanding and acceptance of others, forgiveness, and the search for one\'s true place in the world. There is also enough comic relief, provided very cleverly and only at appropriate times, to give the partially light-hearted atmosphere and to help the story stay serious without crossing the line and becoming depressing.While the anime only covers the first two arcs of the novel and obviously doesn\'t show the entire story, it definitely does not look cut off or unfinished. There is room for discussion after the final episode, but an overall feeling of completeness is present.-CHARACTERS- 9/10Shounen Onmyouji has a very diverse line-up of unique characters. Each of them has individuality and different ideals, and neither of them are stereotypical or boring. Their interactions with each other, as well as their inner struggles, are interesting to observe. They are all portrayed very realistically in their behavior; it\'s easy to relate to them and to see that all beings feel sorrow and happiness equally, be they human, youkai, or shikigami.Most of the story is focused around Masahiro and Guren, as well as their bond with each other. Masahiro is constantly troubled with being compared to his grandfather, and strives to work his hardest to become a better or at least an equal onmyouji, so that people would see him as an individual named Masahiro and not just ""Seimei\'s grandson"". I was very impressed with Masahiro and his determination, and how far he was willing to push himself in order to achieve that place where he can belong while being himself.The second main character is Guren, Masahiro\'s guardian who accompanies him everywhere. Although he will not easily admit it, Guren is very attached to Masahiro and is grateful for the \'light\' that he brought to his heart. While appearing to be carefree in nature and acting rather silly most of the time (even taking on a form of a small white mononoke when his true powers are not needed), Guren is in a constant battle with himself and his tragic past. He is very strict with himself and takes a lot of responsibility for his actions, which makes it difficult for him to forgive himself and move on.The two of them depend greatly on each other\'s support and their bond gets deeper as the series progresses. Masahiro helps to set Guren free from the burden of his past, while Guren always supports Masahiro on his way to becoming a successful onmyouji. Their story, their friendship is very heartwarming and touching.The reason I had to take a point off is that even though there are many interesting characters, some of them remain in the shadows or only show up for a couple minutes in the entire series. I am talking specifically about the twelve shikigami. Some of them were explored in greater detail, but most of them were just \'there\' and left me wondering about many things, especially their reasons for serving Seimei and staying loyal to him for so long. I understand that the anime only shows the first bit of the full story, but as a full-fledged complete TV series with no sequel in sight, they should have either given brief background information on each of the shikigami, or not have shown some of them at all. I was especially upset about the two shikigami (I can only logically guess that they were shikigami) appearing in the final episode, whose names were not even mentioned.-ART/ANIMATION- 10/10The art style is very different from the original novel illustrations, but that does not make it any less beautiful. I loved all the character designs, of both human and non-human characters. The contrast between Guren\'s mononoke and shikigami form was very distinct: Mokkun is small, cute, and childish, while Touda looks strong and mature, with a god-like aura around him; this portrayed his personality well. I especially liked the clothes designs for the twelve shikigami; it made them stand out among all the other characters. The little youkai that Masahiro kept interacting with were adorable and very expressive.The opening animation was exceptionally well done, especially the scenes of shikigami introductions, as well as the scene where Masahiro and Guren reach out to take each other\'s hand during the line ""I will not let go of that hand again"" -- it was coordinated perfectly with the song. I also liked the idea of using colored illustrations from the novels as the insert images during the half-episode break points. Overall, the art and animation section gets full marks from me, for memorable designs and originality.-SOUND- 10/10The music accompaniment was perfect for this anime. The sad scenes, the happy scenes, the scenes of relief, the feeling and the overall effect were enhanced with background sound. I especially loved the opening song; it went very well with the animation, and the lyrics were suitable for the story. Using Masahiro\'s character song as the final ending was a nice choice as well.---Shounen Onmyouji is apparently one of those stories that somehow adapt from a shoujo novel/manga into a shounen anime, at least according to some informational sites. I am not familiar with the light novel, but this anime is very difficult to categorize because it has a lot of elements from both shoujo and shounen. The anime is divided into two main stories, which are the adaptation of the first two arcs of the original light novel. The transition between the arcs, however, is done very smoothly, and there is no obvious \'break\' point -- the story flows naturally throughout the entire twenty six episodes.Though some may see it as a comedy at first glance, Shounen Onmyouji gradually develops into a serious drama with gentle romantic subplot that touches upon some of the very important points -- like understanding and acceptance of others, forgiveness, and the search for one\'s true place in the world. There is also enough comic relief, provided very cleverly and only at appropriate times, to give the partially light-hearted atmosphere and to help the story stay serious without crossing the line and becoming depressing.While the anime only covers the first two arcs of the novel and obviously doesn\'t show the entire story, it definitely does not look cut off or unfinished. There is room for discussion after the final episode, but an overall feeling of completeness is present.-CHARACTERS- 9/10Shounen Onmyouji has a very diverse line-up of unique characters. Each of them has individuality and different ideals, and neither of them are stereotypical or boring. Their interactions with each other, as well as their inner struggles, are interesting to observe. They are all portrayed very realistically in their behavior; it\'s easy to relate to them and to see that all beings feel sorrow and happiness equally, be they human, youkai, or shikigami.Most of the story is focused around Masahiro and Guren, as well as their bond with each other. Masahiro is constantly troubled with being compared to his grandfather, and strives to work his hardest to become a better or at least an equal onmyouji, so that people would see him as an individual named Masahiro and not just ""Seimei\'s grandson"". I was very impressed with Masahiro and his determination, and how far he was willing to push himself in order to achieve that place where he can belong while being himself.The second main character is Guren, Masahiro\'s guardian who accompanies him everywhere. Although he will not easily admit it, Guren is very attached to Masahiro and is grateful for the \'light\' that he brought to his heart. While appearing to be carefree in nature and acting rather silly most of the time (even taking on a form of a small white mononoke when his true powers are not needed), Guren is in a constant battle with himself and his tragic past. He is very strict with himself and takes a lot of responsibility for his actions, which makes it difficult for him to forgive himself and move on.The two of them depend greatly on each other\'s support and their bond gets deeper as the series progresses. Masahiro helps to set Guren free from the burden of his past, while Guren always supports Masahiro on his way to becoming a successful onmyouji. Their story, their friendship is very heartwarming and touching.The reason I had to take a point off is that even though there are many interesting characters, some of them remain in the shadows or only show up for a couple minutes in the entire series. I am talking specifically about the twelve shikigami. Some of them were explored in greater detail, but most of them were just \'there\' and left me wondering about many things, especially their reasons for serving Seimei and staying loyal to him for so long. I understand that the anime only shows the first bit of the full story, but as a full-fledged complete TV series with no sequel in sight, they should have either given brief background information on each of the shikigami, or not have shown some of them at all.

However, Shounen Onmyouji proves to be the exception to the norm, and if you read this review, you'll know why.First off, the story. The anime is set in the Heian period (794-1185) of ancient Japan. The Abe clan, long known as the most powerful spirit masters in the land, now have a new successor: Abe no Masahiro, a young boy who's destined to follow in the footsteps of his legendary grandfather, Abe no Seimei. But Masahiro wants to be more than just Seimei's grandson; he wants to make...a name for himself. Aided by the ayakashi (meaning 'beast' or 'creature') Mokkun, who is in actuality the Summoned Spirit Toda/Guren, Masahiro fights monsters and demons by night, gaining experience and saving people.The character design of the anime is very good. Obviously, the character designers have done extensive research. The costumes worn by the characters are true to the spirit of the Heian, a period second only to the modern in terms of experimentation in fashion. The male characters'layered outfits, the female characters' lined layers of robes-all of these have clearly been painstakingly reproduced. Even the hair of the women has been created true to reality: in ancient times, long tresses were considered a sign of beauty. Fans of blue or pink hair will be disappointed completely.That said, the rest of the anime fails miserably in its task. The conceptualisation is weak, the storyline is flaccid and hasty, and the whole series smacks of inattention.The first few episodes excite. One expects great things from the young Masahiro as he shows obvious traits common to all great anime heroes. Like Ichigo, he has a moralistic streak that leaves him incapable of ruthlessness. Like Naruto, he has an irrepressible urge to prove himself. But as the series progresses, one finds his character softening, dissolving into something like a shoujo idol. The reasons for this softening are principally the addition of another (and completely useless) character, that of Princess Akiko.Akiko's fault doesn't just lie there; she comes across as a complete damsel in distress-that, too, in the Western style. She doesn't contribute a single thing to the whole story (except perhaps as the hero's girl), yet the directors have given their love relationship a prime place. Six episodes are spent just preparing for this relationship. The whole scene then smacks of a bad B-grade romance, and whatever interest remains in the series slowly drains away.The only thing one finds passably watchable in this series are the various gods or Summoned Spirits who are also main characters. They have blue and green hair in multitudes and wear clothes that would've been banned in Heian Japan, but that's what we like about them. Their interaction with the members of the Abe household, whom they are indentured to, as well as their all-too-human concern about the succession, make them likable characters. Even Toda, though some may find him mushy, comes across as a fine character, a model even for future characters.The music is good, nicely enough crafted to hold attention and maybe-just maybe-to hit that download button under the link on that music download site. The opening track, Kaori Hikita's 'Egao no Wake' comes across as a nice song with nice, energetic beats and fluid vocals. Of the ending tracks, one likes Saori Kiuji's 'Yakusoku'. Though sung in a highly nasal tone of voice, the song's arrangement fits perfectly with an old tale or an ancient hero-chronicle.Thus, overall, Shounen Onmyouji is not something I'd recommend everyone to watch. If you're starved for anime, or haven't seen it in a long while, then you can try it out. If you're a history buff, or need an idea of how people lived in the past, then this series is a definite must-watch. But to the general anime fan, I'd recommend something other than this. a name for himself.

There's the typical ayakashi hunting episodes, and cute relationships that develop between the characters. The series has the potential to be better, but in the end tends to disappoint on that end, and just screams for a second season.The character developments are alright, but I'd say the most developed was Mokkun (my fave) which was the principal point of interest to the whole series.The songs weren't all that great, but somewhat tolerable in...my opinion.Overall, it's a fairly good episode to enjoy on a rainy day, so to speak. my opinion.Overall, it's a fairly good episode to enjoy on a rainy day, so to speak."", 'There\'s a pretty simple formula for knowing whether you will like this show or not. If you like shows like Inuyahsa or Tactics, then you will like Shounen Onmyouji. If you don\'t, well.....follow the train of though, here. So for me this show was 50/50 because I loved Tactics but I wasn\'t that crazy about Inuyasha. This show may not have Shikon Shards or a magical well to jump through but it basically takes place in the same era as Inuyahsa and there is a lot of talk about demons and demonic auras, miasma and also all the other aspects of  Japanese mysticism and...there are a lot of great characters, all of which I loved! However, the downside [at least for me] is that it possesses the same kind of story flow like Inuyahsa which is too slow and too broad to fully capture without dedicating a lot of time and a lot of episodes to a near-infinite, ongoing manga.~ArtI love the art style of this show. It may look standard but that\'s what I like about it. The characters and objects have a simple yet handsome look to them and are well-balanced and proportionate [you know what I mean, some anime makes their characters and objects too long or too thick?] The lines aren\'t too bold or heavy and the shading is regular if not, understated. It the whole aesthetic is neither too childish nor overly sophisticated but rather just clean look which is pleasing to the eye. sometimes the color range seems pretty limited and you can notice their repetition throughout several scenes...but I\'m willing to overlook that.CGI is used very well in this series for all the right scenes and special f/x making all the fight scenes very exciting and the use of their super-powers seem vivid and brilliant.~AudioOK this time the English voice actors did not impress me. First off, Masahiro [the main guy, shounen onmyouji] is voiced by a woman [I\'m pretty sure, they probably just tweaked it a little bit with some special sound F/X] she does an OK job as a teen-aged boy but no offense to her, but I would have preferred for it to have been a real boy, maybe like the guy who did DNAngel [Kevin Corn, who can do no wrong in my eyes]. Sometimes when Masahiro gets awkward the voice is too tough to listen to. It sounds like Pat, that character from SNL back in the day.The person who plays Masahiro\'s love interest, Princess Akiko, her voice kinda grates on my nerves too, she kind of sounds like a total airhead from the valley sometimes [think: Hilary Banks from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air] and it just lacks that level of delicacy and refinement to play a Japanese princess.And I totally dislike the fact that Mokkun\'s voice is female! The fact that Gurren is very much male and has such a masculine voice makes me irritated even more when he transforms in to that ferret/rabbit demon Mokkun with a female\'s voice. To me, it\'s like they are two very separate characters. They should have left Gurren\'s voice intact so that at least there exists a unifying element to remind us that they the same character. And since these 3 characters are main characters, they get a lot of airtime....and that\'s annoying!As far as the music is concerned, both the OP and ED are forgettable. I mean they were nice to listen to for a while, like the first 3 episodes, but then I just skipped past that. It\'s nothing you would find yourself singing along with or wanting to buy the soundtrack.~StoryThe story...well, I wouldn\'t call it weak, but the plot momentum is pretty slow and it\'s very straightforward. The story is about a young exorcist monk named Masahiro who has an above average knack for seeing  paranormal entities and therefore is able to combat and expel demons. He wants to be better than his grandfather who is supposedly ""all that and a bag of chips"" at least according to all the townspeople. Why I find the show similar to Tactics is probably because a large portion of the series is delivered in episodic fashion. Masahiro [Like Kentarou from Tactics] is an onmyouji and along with his little ferret-mononoke sidekick, Mokkun, they basically goes around town vanquishing demons and such for the better part of 15 or so episodes all the while. Also like in Tactics, the protagonist\'s companion in this case, Mokkun/Gurren is harboring some burdensome and tragic secret from his past.However this anime\'s biggest flaw is the same flaw that hit Inuyasha. The manga is bigger and much more developed than the anime could ever hope to accomplish. The characters took too long to develop within the limited 26 episodes, I don\'t even think all 12 Shikigami even made an appearance and of those that did, a lot of them had ill-defined personalities. Oh, and the budding romance between the two principal characters? Forgeddaboutit! The same thing happened with Inuyahsa and Kagome, it fizzled.This is one of those shows where you do not even have to read the manga, much less know of it\'s existence, to see that the pace isn\'t right for a 26 episode series. Well I guess for the two arcs that they were able to show the story was alright. It\'s pretty cut and dry though and they do try to add a little spice by throwing in a couple of “plot twists” and “tragic revelations” but for the most part, even those were pretty predictable and added little depth to the story. That said, it\'s still a pretty good story and a fun anime to watch, there are bits of comedy throughout and since it does not run on pointlessly forever like Inuyahsa did, this show is a lot more tolerable.~CharactersI\'m not going to even lie about the fact that it\'s the “bishounen factor” that led me to select this title....same reason I watched Tactics, I mean who doesn\'t like demon-hunting, spirit-vanquishing bishounen! And there are loads of them, large enough for any number of fun, slashable pairing configurations! Most of them are Spirit Warriors – Shikigami – that assist Masahiro, eventho technically their allegiance is to his grandfather.My favorite by far is Gurren, who is  the alter-ego to that mongoose-looking mononoke, Mokkun. Gurren is a rather tall and striking looking character with a very deep tan, fire-red shaggy hair and goldish colored eyes. Most of the bishounen have the same kind of facial shape and structure and so they are all very good-looking but Gurren stands out to be probably due to his coloring. Many people may also like him because he is the Shikigami that controls fire which has a lot of cool F/X!Another character I really liked was Rikugou because he is one of those characters that say very little and is not very emotional [I love those types of characters]. He is very trusting and very faithful he just silently follows Masahiro or his grandfather [Seimei] around with little questioning or complaints. He also has a very nice design, he is very tall and narrow-waisted with long brown hair going to the backs of his knees. He frequently wears a cloak and carries a lance or trident which I think is cool.But like I said there are a lot of characters and each one of them have a unique look to them and is very attractive...even the Seimei in his young form and mountain goddess [Takao] are pretty hot looking.~VerdictIt\'s an OK anime to watch for what it is, the characters are gorgeous but the story [at least as far as the anime is concerned] is a bit anti-climactic.

Comprised lot of flashy effects, spirits, demons, the underworld, and gods. Lots of plot twists as well.The story centers around Masahiro no Abe, a young boy of only 13 years old. Yet everyone expects great things of him due to being the grandson and pronounced heir to Seimei no Abe, an extremely powerful Onmyouji (priest) of ancient Japan. Masahiro quickly runs into a number of other characters including his new partner Mokkun. Together they begin to work out problems with marauding demons and other spiritual creatures.The plot eventually unfolds around them but by that time if you...are not enjoying the series it can be somewhat painful to keep watching. This is my first gripe.The art is pretty standard fare nothing too special. Some of the effects off of the spells are pretty cool.The sound is nothing too memorable. The OP is pretty catchy, and even good, whereas the ED is completely forgettable and somewhat annoying. In scene BG music didn't interfere but It really didn't catch my attention either, mostly forgettable.The characters are what kept the show afloat for me. Masahiro starts out as a boy that really is not sure of himself and it shows on the people around him. Masahiro is not lacking in power, just confidence and to a lesser degree understanding of those around him, which gets him into a bit of a predicament as the story unfolds. The supporting characters that are explained are given a fair amount of depth, especially Seimei who is a lighthearted somewhat melodramatic grandfather in times of peace, but becomes deathly serious when he needs to be. Other supporting characters dismiss Masahiro as a lost cause, but gradually begin to believe in him as things unfold.Overall I started to get bored with the first definable arc about half way through and almost lost interest. Luckily I kept going and the second arc picked up the pace quite a bit, and the enjoyment factor went up.This is an interesting anime for fans of magic or spirits and demons. If you really enjoy stories of feudal japan than this would be something special for you.I score this as a rough 8.5Love stories of feudal Japan + demons?

I finally finish watching it after several years of on-hold since I last watched Animax and I'm really satisfied. This anime was quite old, released 8-9 years ago. It's so good, however I'm kinda upset not many people know this show!!Set in Heian period, Shounen Onmyouji is about Abe no Masahiro, the third grandson of the notable onmyouji Abe no Seimei. So, the title is very straightforward and self-explanatory. The anime is adapted from the light novels, but only covers 2 arcs. This decision is good, we have enough time for character introduction, development, and...also for the story to flow in a comfortable pace. (I wish they will continue this series though... )Introduction and first episodes are done very well, pulling me in straight away. The arcs may be quite simple and plain for some, but because of its straightforwardness and flow I like it. I watch anime for fun and refreshing purpose, so this is what I'm looking for. It has slight romance, but considering the main character is only 13 years old and it's more of shounen show, hints of romance is good enough ^^.Masahiro has earned his spot as one of my favorite anime main characters. He is strong, but not overpowered like crazy. He is pretty good looking also. He is witty, willing to learn and hardworking, also have ambition to surpass his grandfather as onmyouji. Despite this, he still acts like his age, and that's what makes me love this boy. His interaction with Mokkun / Guren / Touda is very lovable. How he approaches problems and interacts with his grandfather, family, other ayakashi.. it's innocent and pure, yet it charms my heart.There are range of different characters too. I wish there will be more episodes to get to know the 12 Shinsou too.. They are interesting but some of them just appear for a few seconds :(For anime released in 2006, I can consider it a gorgeous anime. Animation is quite smooth, action scenes and effects are done well. Don't let the opening video hinder you from watching though.. (even though that's what prevents me from giving it 10/10). I like the character design, it is memorable and the 12 Shinsou (shikigami) look cool. The original artwork (shown in the middle of every episode, usually before / after commercial break) is very beautiful and artsy. Well there is simplification for anime version but the characters still has the same, recognizable features with the original design.Sound wise... Egao no Wake is very catchy and memorable, I find myself hum to it every now and then. The OST are good and suits the theme of the show. I even hunted for the main theme of Shonen Onmyouji because it's so epic sounding. The ending is not really what I like but it's ok.Seiyuus are wow. I really love Masahiro's voice, even though the seiyuu is a female, she voiced him as a young boy very well. His expressions, feelings and everything. Mokkun, Seimei, the 12 Shinsou and other characters I also have no problems with their voices, they fit the characters.I really enjoy watching this show. It tugs my heart, makes me laugh even though I had a bad day, also cry during the sad scenes. The medium pace and the storytelling, interactions makes you feel for the characters. I'm glad the English subtitled version I watch are very tidy and informative as well, so it increases my enjoyment.If you are looking for something exciting, funny and not so complicated show about yokai and Japanese Heian era, you can watch this.Story 7/10Character 9/10Art 9/10Sound 8/10Enjoyment 9/10Overall 8/10 also for the story to flow in a comfortable pace.

If paper talismans, a broad representation of traditional youkai and ayakashi, and buddhist mantra with hand signs get your blood pumping though, I think you\'ll definitely agree with me on a solid 8 for this one.Honestly? If you liked Kekkaishi, you\'ll like this.If you liked Kekkaishi but thought you\'d have liked it better...if it was set in a historically accurate Heian-jidai japan instead of the modern day, then... well, hello Studio Deen, thank you for reading this review....and if you happen to be one of the five or so OTHER people who might have thought of and enjoyed that concept, then enjoy your instant 10/10 because this show is slavishly devoted to the mannerisms, clothing, and political structure of the Heian period of japan without letting that distract from the plot. It actually reminds me strongly of how Rurouni Kenshin handled the Meiji reconstruction era, putting in the care and detail that made the setting come alive, but always keeping focus on the story at hand.The action is handled about as well as other shounen anime from the early and mid 2000\'s - dynamic, but predominantly power beam spam consisting of colored photoshop filters following a hand-drawn mask - Inuyasha comes to mind (for more reasons than that, but still). I will say it\'s a bit more competently directed than its brethren though, as many of the actual full-phrase spells actually have relevant-seeming effects (""Hidden warriors, formidable soldiers, assemble and take formation against the enemy"" always creates a barrage of orderly spirit projectiles, for instance).The character writing is a bit tropey, but it\'s in that kindof adorable way that old anime could get away with because it wasn\'t as worn thin back then. The MC is a sweet self-sacrificing Neutral Good type, his grandpa is the wise old Crouching Moron not-so-Hidden Badass, and we\'re in yet another universe where any capacity for competence or basic self-preservation is apparently carried on the Y chromosome for some reason *coughlazywritingcough*. All that said though, like I mentioned before, the flaws are just so much more forgivable in that unique early-2000s aesthetic where we can all remember back to things like Escaflowne and go \'yeah, not everything has to be Ulysses - this is fine\'.An enjoyable ride overall, catering to a highly specific audience that will absolutely ADORE it when they find it.

You\'ll see.', ""the thing i liked most about this show was that the main protagonist, mashahiro, did not act like your typical shounen character. he was more mature (at least he tried to be), did not go screaming head first in battle, and tried his best to keep his composure, and was very obedienthowever I feel as if the story could have been grander, and the ending was rather bittersweet almost as if it wasn't an ending. "", ""It's a cool supernatural-historical anime...plus there are some major twists in cliffhangers in the story. The protagonist portrays what typical real life boys are, so I sort of liked his arrogant yet kind attitude.But over all, it's an enjoyable anime, a little short though for my tastes but ground breaking and pule racing in some episodes.I only hoped it could have been scarier, but at least the handsome spirits and the long haired hot guys (I have a fetish for long haired anime guys, haha) makes up for it.

First review, so please be kind.Overall I loved this anime! It was amazing and I wish there were more than 26 episodes.I first started watching the dubbed version because I generally prefer them over subs (please no haters, everyone has the right to voice their own oppinion). But after around 4 episodes I couldnt take it anymore!!! The dub version is horrible, so I switched to subs and it was much better.Anyway...Story: The story was good, I enjoyed it a lot. There were some things I didnt care for but overall I enjoyed it. It made me laugh, cry and everything in between.Art:...The art was amazing! I will not watch an anime unless the art is good ( yeah Im picky). Thanks to the wonderful artists that created this anime!Sound: I enjoyed the music for the most part. It wasnt anything special, but I liked listening to it.Characters: I loved the characters!!!! Especially the relationship between Mokkun (Guren) and Masahiro. It was their relationship and how they interacted is why I gave this anime a 10. Of course all the other characters were nice, and I liked how towards the end you got to see some emotion out of Rikugou.I finished this anime in two days, I just wish they hadnt ended it after the second arc. It would have been nice to see how things unfolded after the ending of the second arc. But I will for sure read the manga!I highly reccomend this anime to anybody! The art was amazing!

There are still lots of things to be developed. This is also one of the reason why though I give the plot of story 10/10, the character development is only 7/10. Pretty straight forward, but I wish more could be elaborated like...why masahiro aint scared of gurren. Though I may understand that this is the reason to encourage viewers to become reader of the anime....Anyway, the art and sound is really good. So yeap, hopefully I see more of such good animes :D why masahiro aint scared of gurren.

To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31711/To_LOVE-Ru_Darkness_2nd_Specials,"[""After watching the first 12 episodes, I knew there had to be more; these two special episodes conclude this season's plot.In lieu of an in-depth review, I'll try to be brief as it's only two episodes.Story: 8It continues where it left off and finishes strong. My only issue with the plot is Nemesis; she's a likable character, but the writer gave her such an uninspired goal. And even if she succeeds, I'm not sure what that exactly does for her. But maybe it isn't fair to criticize her intentions because we still don't seem to know much about her.Art: 10Yami's transformed appearance, in my...opinion, is quite beautiful. Her face and expressions, in the final minutes of the last episode, are drawn really well. Furthermore, the action sequences are animated exceptionally well.Sound: 9The opening is great, and the ending is even better, but unfortunately, the BGM wasn't very memorable. Voice acting was amazing as always, especially Yami's voice actor this season; she does three different character voices (Yami, Yami Transformed, and Tear).Character: 7As one would expect after watching episode 12, these final two episodes focus on Yami's character. Moreover, Rito's actions, at this season's climax, are something to look forward to as well. Lala changes too, but I can't say anything more without spoiling it.Enjoyment: 10What can I say? I'm a huge fan of the show. Ultimately, if you're looking for closure, you'll find it in these last two episodes.Overall: 10 opinion, is quite beautiful.

Uchuu Senkan Yamato,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1650/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato,"['Well, this is my first review, so please go easy on me.I came to be interested in the anime, since I like naval-related stuff, therefore, the name Space Battleship Yamato made me think about the very well known Battleship Yamato, the Imperial Navy\'s pride during WW2. I did not know ANYTHING about the anime before deciding to watch it. Now I know about it\'s well renowned reputation as a pioneer in the science fiction genre. It was also one of the first (if not first!) anime being broadcasted in the US (with a LOT of modifications). Luckily, I watched the original Japanese version. So...here is what I think of it:Story:The Journey to Iscandar? I really asked myself what that could mean before I watched the anime. Well, I am not going to ruin the story, so all I am going to say is that the plot is pretty convincing (although there were some mistakes and WTF moments that were mentioned at the credits after each episode, provided by the subtitle company). Earth in danger of extinction and the revival of a WW2 battleship to help her survive? I wanted to see that! The bla bla part and the good action scenes are very well balanced and the actual bla bla parts are actually pretty interesting and (sometimes!) heart moving. The ending, although a little bit too fast I would say, makes you want to watch more of the anime and (thank God) many movies and 2 other seasons were made for it. I give the story a well deserved 9.Art:I had (still have) watched few animes before this one, but the first thing that shocked me when I started to watch is the artwork. It is so different from what anime is today! I could not stop laughing about the funky-retro-70s pants that the crew used and the relative simplicity of the artwork in general. But oh well, this was just in the first episode. I got used to that. In fact, the way Queen Starsha was first presented, for example, gave her an aura of mystery, which really suits her. The most amazing thing though is the design of the Yamato and the battle effects. Although pretty simple at first sight, they are good enough to give you a feeling of YAY VIOLENCE, EXPLOSIONS PEW PEW, which (despite the fact that I wasn\'t even born in those days) could have been very difficult and innovative in those years (it was 1974 after all, no Star Wars, no Gundam Wing, no nothing!). The exterior and interior design of the Yamato is also very very interesting and creative. I give art also a 9.Sound:The sound... just one word: WOW. The opening already pumps you up and is already a good intro to the anime\'s epicness. The lyrics are perfectly suitable for the anime and we can\'t just forget the amazing voice of Isao Sasaki, an artist totally unknown to me before this anime. I watched many videos of him performing the Yamato theme (still today! he is almost 70 years old!) with the same enthusiasm everytime. I read that the opening theme became so popular, that it was informally taken as an anthem for the real Japanese Yamato. Anyways, back to the anime. The ending song (Makka na scarf) is as good as it\'s opening. Again, performed by Sasaki. Regarding the ambience music in the anime, it could not be better. They did a great job creating a space atmosphere around the Yamato. Battle themes, drama, happiness,... I really recommend to look for the whole Soundtrack CD. It is simply amazing! Sound deserves a perfect 10Characters:The ship cannot navigate itself, obviously. The Yamato\'s crew is as epic as it\'s ship. The swiss-clock-precise Shima, the rebellious Kodai, the intelligent Sanada... Every crew member shows a complete different personality and talents, which leads to a very rich environment in the bridge of the Yamato and also in the rest of the ship. Yuki is not the common tv show girl. She is the only one aboard the Yamato, but she is responsible for Life Support and also the Medical Bay (together with the funny doctor Sado). She is not the regular woman that falls in love instantaneously with the main character, but she evolves together with him to actually reach that point. Queen Starsha\'s mysterious personality and history is something that makes her very intersting, even atractive to some point (her beauty is very different to how anime women are presented today). She is obviously very important, since the Yamato actually travels to hear her advice. Lord Desler is also very different from today\'s villian. Although cruel, he is extremely intelligent. He also sees the Yamato with respect and holds to a certain point a clean fight with the ship. A very interesting character indeed. Last but not least, Captain Okita. Without a doubt, the most misterious character. Always calm and even more intelligent than Lord Desler, he is in charge of leading the Yamato and it\'s crew. His unorthodox methods scare sometimes scare Kodai or Shima, but his authority is never questionated. Will he succeed? Ok, character gets a 9 from me.EnjoymentFrom start to end, the anime made me laugh, be anxious, angry (Captain Okita\'s decisions and other stuff). I enjoyed every second of it. Whether Desler planned his strategy, the Yamato just blew everything up with the Wave Motion Gun or Analyzer teased Yuki, everything made the anime be watchable and worthy of my time. I did not toally like the ending though. Although it was good, it had a very WTF moment (which I shall not spoil) and I think the final parts were also a bit short. Anyways, enjoyment also gets a 9.OverallRetro anime, funky clothes, aliens attacking humanity, space battleships, guns and explosions? Hell yes! The anime, although it may look boring for today\'s anime fans, is still enjoyable and worth of watching. The depth of the story is also pretty astonishing, in my case at least. I recommend any sci fi or navy fan to watch this great time joy. I do strongly say you should watch the Japanese version, since the US one (known as Star Blazers) cut a lot of ""inapropiate"" scenes in that time (today, Space BB Yamato could be a good PG-13 as hardest measure, PG-7 I would say). The thing that makes me mad though is, that they renamed the Yamato as ""Argo"" which drops the epicness of the ship. Anyways, a must see!(Note: English is not my native language. I\'m sorry for any grammar / spelling errors). here is what I think of it:Story:The Journey to Iscandar? I really asked myself what that could mean before I watched the anime.

Yuki is not the common tv show girl. She is the only one aboard the Yamato, but she is responsible for Life Support and also the Medical Bay (together with the funny doctor Sado). She is not the regular woman that falls in love instantaneously with the main character, but she evolves together with him to actually reach that point. Queen Starsha\'s mysterious personality and history is something that makes her very intersting, even atractive to some point (her beauty is very different to how anime women are presented today). She is obviously very important, since the Yamato actually travels to hear her advice. Lord Desler is also very different from today\'s villian. Although cruel, he is extremely intelligent. He also sees the Yamato with respect and holds to a certain point a clean fight with the ship. A very interesting character indeed. Last but not least, Captain Okita. Without a doubt, the most misterious character. Always calm and even more intelligent than Lord Desler, he is in charge of leading the Yamato and it\'s crew. His unorthodox methods scare sometimes scare Kodai or Shima, but his authority is never questionated. Will he succeed? Ok, character gets a 9 from me.EnjoymentFrom start to end, the anime made me laugh, be anxious, angry (Captain Okita\'s decisions and other stuff). I enjoyed every second of it. Whether Desler planned his strategy, the Yamato just blew everything up with the Wave Motion Gun or Analyzer teased Yuki, everything made the anime be watchable and worthy of my time. I did not toally like the ending though. Although it was good, it had a very WTF moment (which I shall not spoil) and I think the final parts were also a bit short. Anyways, enjoyment also gets a 9.OverallRetro anime, funky clothes, aliens attacking humanity, space battleships, guns and explosions? Hell yes! The anime, although it may look boring for today\'s anime fans, is still enjoyable and worth of watching. The depth of the story is also pretty astonishing, in my case at least. I recommend any sci fi or navy fan to watch this great time joy. I do strongly say you should watch the Japanese version, since the US one (known as Star Blazers) cut a lot of ""inapropiate"" scenes in that time (today, Space BB Yamato could be a good PG-13 as hardest measure, PG-7 I would say). The thing that makes me mad though is, that they renamed the Yamato as ""Argo"" which drops the epicness of the ship. Anyways, a must see!(Note: English is not my native language. I\'m sorry for any grammar / spelling errors).', 'I first saw this series as a kid in the early 80s. It was branded in the U.S. as ""Star Blazers"" and I would wake up extra early on Saturday mornings to watch it. Along with (but vastly superior to) Battle of the Planets and Speed Racer it was my intro to anime and it sparked several lines of interest in my life that have continued to the present.It basically brings the outline from the Jason and the Argonauts myth and updates it into a very entertaining space drama.This is a classic series and as such the artwork, music, and characters are not nearly...as well polished as something more modern. But taken for what it is it was an astonishingly good work for the time period. The recent ""Space Battleship Yamato 2199"" is a completely updated re-make for those of you who can\'t get past the dated nature of the original. There was also a recent live action film that was so-so. The original series spawned many sequels which range from excellent to terrible.If you like space opera and military anime you can\'t really go wrong with this series. as well polished as something more modern.

I won’t go into detail as I don’t want to spoil and you can read the synopsis anyway, but basically the Yamato must travel across space to reach the planet Iskandar and bring back a machine that can purify the irradiated surface of the Earth. So in short, the battleship Yamato is renovated into a space battleship and has to save the earth from an alien civilization that seeks to exterminate...humanity. This is quite problematic since as told in the beginning of the series, the Yamato, largest battleship of its time, was the symbol of japanese pride and japanese military supremacy. The episode that shows how the battleship was sunk at the end of WW2 stinks of japanese nationalism. The Yamato and the fleet escorting it are shown as heroic and brave. When the ship sinks, you see japanese soldiers doing a military salute. Fortunately, this overly nationalistic atmosphere is only present in one episode, but I find it curious that the series doesn’t say anything bad about japanese imperialism, about the horrors and war crimes it committed all across East Asia.In the beginning, the Gamilas are shown as an evil alien race, but as you progress throughout the series you learn that the situation is a bit more complicated than that : the Gamilas are pretty much the same as humans, and they are not trying to destroy humanity just because they are bad.In each episode, the Yamato and its crew must overcome an obstacle, most of which are laid by the Gamilas empire, so a lot of episodes are space battles against the Gamilas space fleet or its military bases. I thought these episodes to be the most enjoyable to watch, as the space battle scenes are very well done.In some episodes however, part of the crew must go to a planet (to fix a certain problem or just to investigate). Most of these episodes looked like filler episodes and were bad and boring to watch. Luckily, there are only a few of these, and most episodes are very good, if not excellent.Art : 10/10One of this series' strong point. Although the animation and art style may have aged quite a bit, it's pretty easy to get used to it. The scenes where you see the Yamato move around in space, along with the music, are wonderful. The design of the enemy spaceships and buildings are very cool, too. The character design are well done and the characters are easy to identify without them wearing extravagant clothes or having weird hairstyles.Sound : 9/10I don’t know anything about music so I can’t really describe it accurately but the soundtrack is one of my favorites and it goes very well with the battle scenes. The opening is unforgettable, one of the best I have ever seen. However some of the sound effects (mostly the laser fires) have not aged well.Character : 9/10Apart from Analyzer (who is also known as the sexual assaulter robot), the crew members are very human and likeable and you get to see their backstories in certain episodes. Most of the characters aren't too complex. You know what their motivations are and they are easy to understand, without being one-dimensional. The leader of the Gamilas empire, however, is too predictable. He’s just your typical cartoonish bad guy that wants the whole universe under his boot, always has an evil plan (that fails, of course), makes bad decisions, kills his own subordinates for fun and does an evil laugh for no reason. Luckily, the Gamilas empire does have at least one good character, Domel, a true man of honor that respects his enemy.Enjoyment : 10/10This series is very old and has many flaws, but it is a must watch for every anime fan. The wonderful animation and music give it a really high re-watch value. Definitely a show I will re-watch in the future.Overall : 9/10 humanity.

Though there are times when it rises above that. You might think the Yamato\'s plot amour (which was done to conserve the anime\'s budget) would sink the show however for the most part it uses interesting tactics to get out of the sticky situations the Yamato is put in. The aliens also have a concrete reason as to why they are attacking Earth.  Yamato has influenced countless si-fi titles...as shown by some interesting points occasionally like for example "" Is it fair how the losers are treated ?"", ""Are the Gamilluans really that different form humans ?"".Characters  (7.25)- Most of them are one note, however for the most part they are well written though.  Kodai is a well developed character.  Okita is the captain that supplies the interesting tactics that keep the Yamato\'s plot amour in check, and becomes a mentor for Kodai. Descular is the leader of Gamilon it\'s interesting to see his very authoritative aggressive personality sometimes create a paradox with his respect for the Yamato. Starsha could have been very interesting, however her character is not explored much. Mori was the worst character very little depth, and development, plus the bits of fan service.Sound (7)-  voice acting acting is good. The music is your standard 70\'s anime soundtrack.Art (7) and Animation (8.5)-  Animation is pretty impressive for the most part considering how old it is, though there are some odd facial expressions sometimes. The art looks fine.Enjoyment  (6.5)- The story occasionally is able to rise above, the characters are solid, good voice acting, and impressive animation and art for the time: made Yamato worth my time. Though it certainly has problems.Overall (6.4)- The story is most of the time average, has a lot of bland characters, sometimes the Yamato plot armor is not kept in check, occasional animation mistakes, and the generic music hold it down. But the well written characters, and some standout characters, a story that occasionally becomes something more than usual, and impressive animation for its time: make it worth watching. as shown by some interesting points occasionally like for example "" Is it fair how the losers are treated ?"", ""Are the Gamilluans really that different form humans ?"".Characters  (7.25)- Most of them are one note, however for the most part they are well written though.

Known as Star Blazers in America, its debut was in 1979 and the broadcast consisted of Yamato with its\' two sequels. It wasn\'t until I re-watched the original Mobile Suit Gundam for the x-th time and wanted more space opera-type shows that I discovered Matsumoto\'s work. However, until now I had only watched his shows in scattered episodes never fully completing any of his shows.Coming out in 1974, the art is very impressive compared to previous anime with minor hiccups occasionally cropping up. The music is pretty epic like that of old Soviet hymns,...and consistent throughout the show from point A-B. And, who can say that bellbottom space pants are a bad thing?Story wise, many have probably already seen the ""Humanoid alien race attack Earth"" plot line. However, there is for once,  a clear-cut reason behind the alien attack, why there are mostly ""kids"" doing the fighting, and why the aliens (Gamilons) do what they do throughout the anime.When it came to characters, no, they aren\'t too impressive, and are fairly one dimensional with little to no character development. That being said, it really doesn\'t matter. The main character doesn\'t really feel like the main focus. It\'s the journey and trials the Yamato must make to save Earth. ""You"" do see Kodai (MC) evolve as a human, the evil alien Desler be James Bond villian 101, Captain Okita be calm cool courageous savior of everything, and the best robot (Analyzer) I have ever seen in an anime in a long time.As much as I enjoyed this, during the end of development, the staff had two projects going on at time. This made the animation staff crunch for the deadline, and made the ending extremely rushed. Very sad for almost a perfect space opera anime.As a biased fan of mecha and space operas, this was an almost perfect show. I am definitely going to watch more Yamato anime. and consistent throughout the show from point A-B.

I am definitely going to watch more Yamato anime.', ""Uchuu Senkan Yamato is awesome!In the beggining, I thought that the story was slow, but after some time, I started to love it!It's an anime made in 1974, and the story, characters, plot, villain, soundtrack and the animation is amazing!I started an love relation with this anime.I also loved the Planets that they created for the story, its not just a Planet, they have species living on it, ecosystems, and relationships with other planets ( For the year it was done, I think that this is revolutionary! )I don't know what to say more, just that I'm anxious to watch the Season 2!! "", 'The story and impact of Space Battleship Yamato is one of the most inspiring and important events in the history of anime. When it first appeared in 1974, it shook the foundation of what TV manga could do. It would be the strong, innovative, and emotional writing of Yamato that would partly aid the medium towards gaining the name anime. It\'s cited as an inspiration for many valuable works such as Evangelion, Super Dimension Fortress Macross, and Mobile Suit gundam. Now that I think about it, Hideako Anno did quite a harvest on his influences. If you look at early mecha, there is a series...with a character named Rei Asuka, for example. Another example: the song ""Original Yamato Theme"" was slightly recycled and used in Evangelion as the song ""Background Music II.""There were already several science fiction works before Yamato, Still, the fleet battles, dramatic narration, and the strong structure of its story was bold and fresh at the time. Perhaps the viewers were not ready for an anime like this as it did not do so well at the start. Once the movies released, series creator Leiji Matsumoto, who would go on to do many famous works such as Galaxy Express 999 and Space Pirate Captain Harlock, noticed a large amount of fan mail coming from fans. This was especially among the women to his surprise. Director Noboru Ishiguro, who would go on to direct works such as Macross and Legend of the Galactic Heroes, explained that the sudden influx of fans resulted in many travelling, some by plane, to their studio during production. As a result, the staff would hang out animation cells and background pictures as a thank you.The impact of Space Battle Yamato was so great that it inspired the creation of the game Space Invaders. The Yamato\'s Wave Motion Gun was also the inspiration for the Hadouken in Street Fighter. Not only that, it us rumored that it had an influence in the first Star Wars film that came out a few years later. George Lucas won\'t admit it despite that the similarities are there. Just one example is The Analyzer. It\'s the comedic robot that is rumored to have possibly been the inspiration for R2D2. This has been a topic of debate for decades that was reached no conclusion as many viewers are constantly agreeing and disagreeing.Truly, if Yamamoto never existed, the many great works I mentioned earlier may never have existed, or been very different without it perhaps.Being a work of Matsumoto, the master of melancholy, you can expect an emotional and dramatic space voyage as the Yamato ventures through space. The Gamilas led by Aberdt Desler is facing a dilemma. The life of their planet is running out. As a result, they decide to go out on a mission to take over the planet Earth. To destroy the humans, they sent out a barrage of meteor strikes that destroyed so much of human civilization that humanity had to go underground. Schools were being used as hospitals previously, and many of the women had to become nurses out of necessity. In addition to that, the Gamilas flooded the earth with radiation that threatens to seep into the earth to wipe out the last of humanity. In an attempt to save the human race, humanity has deployed an old World War II ship, the Space Battleship Yamato, to travel out towards Iscanda to acquire a machine that is capable of destroying the radiation poisoning that is slowly killing the planet and themselves. The crew only has a year to make the roundtrip, and faces many obstacles along the way through space anomalies and Galimus fleet battles.The voice acting is immaculate. Among the main characters, Kodai is voiced by Kei Tomoyama, who would go on to voice Yang Wen-li 14 years later in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Shima is voiced by Shuusei Nakamura, most famous for being the voice of Toru Rikiishi in Ashita no Joe.The music I would say is iconic. There are lots of dramatic and amazing songs that help uplift the fleet battles and tragic moments. The funky drum work in some of the songs is impressive and amusing to see mixed with the scenes.The art, for being a work from 1974, is impressive, even by today\'s standards. The beautiful hand drawn animation can fluidly and naturally present the brutality of the fleet battles. There is one episode that took the staff nearly 2 months to animate because of that. The character designs are solid, and there were many times interesting effects used to portray the murkiness of space and the emergence of the yamato from smoke.As the crew continues their voyage, the stakes run high as their schedule starts falling behind. They have estimated one year\'s time before the radiation destroys the humans. At the end of an episode you may hear the narrator sounding desperate as he counts down the days until humanity\'s doom.At this point I will start using spoilers for the analysis. I would highly recommend watching this historical document of an anime before continuing unless you don\'t mind spoilers.In my opinion, though Kodai is the main character, my favorite is captain Juuzou Okita. He is the first captain of this new version of Yamato. His leadership is bold and provocative. His years of experience leads to unorthodox tactics to fight against the Gamilus or to get out of deadly situations. He knows full and well how to lead his team in a serious manner. He may sound cold, but he loves his crew, the earth, and the rest of humanity. The tragedy of Okita is that he is suffering from radiation poisoning. As the Yamato went on, he\'d often collapse from it. The doctor, who is usually seen drunk drinking sake, tells him that he needs to get an operation to stay alive. In Okita\'s point of view, he is determined to follow along with his duty to lead the crew. However, even I would say that if he doesn\'t get the operation, it will get in the way of his focus during crucial moments. And this would be the case as he was constantly passing out while on duty. Eventually, he decides to get the operation, and is left mostly bedridden. A wise man, he spoke some words that really inspired me. There was a time where the crew of the Yamato had doubts about their journey. Hope felt as it was lost. And yet, Okita would confront them and state, ""Why don\'t we believe in ourselves? Nothing is sure in life. One step ahead is darkness in our lives, but if you\'re overly afraid, you won\'t accomplish anything. Overcoming our fears, and believing in our future is an important battle in our minds."" Always calm cool and collected, he always kept his composure even during the most dire situations. Even after being defeated at some point by the Galimus, he respected their strategy in defeating him. Oftentimes, his reactions would be quiet as he\'d sometimes look down with his hat, covering his eyes, or look straight ahead with an unshakable determination. Despite there being no dialogue, his reactions feel like they speak louder than words at times.Since the beginning, he felt for the loss of Kodai\'s brother who supposedly died in the beginning of the series fighting the Galimus. Shima would express regret towards Kodai as an engineer that Kodai\'s brother had entered this mission on a ship that Shima knew was too damaged for the mission. Considering all this, Okita developed a bit of a soft spot for Kodai. As his time grew near, Okita would summon Kodai and make him the new captain of the Yamato. Determined with the will to live, as the Yamato makes its trip back to earth, Okita kept himself alive with solid resolve that he must see the earth again before perishing from the radiation. It would be around this time that he began thinking about the concept of death. He was under the assumption that the soul leaves the body when someone dies, and looked on out into space while bedridden wondering where his soul will go after he dies.The most crushing moment in Space Battleship Yamato is his death in the last episode. I was in tears constantly as the writing pushed the blade deeper and deeper into my heart. There were more tragic events that were already giving me heavy emotions in that episode already. As obvious as the obvious demands for the sake of the plot, the Yamato does make the roundtrip which I\'ll look into later in this video. Okita thanks the doctor for his treatment and asks to be left alone. As the emotionally tragic music plays in the background, Okita takes out a picture of his family and caresses it with his hands. His hand then begins to shake as he tears up. He looks up at the Earth and speaks weakly with his dying breath, ""Earth. Everything about it is precious."" He passes on, leaving behind part of the environmental message that the series tries to make about the planet we live in. As he met his end, there is a miracle that happens here that I will explain concerning him and Yuki when I get to her. It\'s only a theory but fairly interesting.Kodai, is another protagonist and the successor as captain of the Yamato after Okita personally handpicks him. He suffers from the trauma he faced as a child from the attacks of the Galimus. His parents were obliterated in a meteor attack. Kodai finds only scraps of their clothes. Later on, he had to go through the supposed death of his brother at the hands of the enemy. Though he grew up as a pacifist, he decided to volunteer for the army partly due to his brother\'s wishes for him to do so. It is this trauma that leads to that intense moment where the Yamato crew managed to capture a low ranking soldier from the Galimus. At that point, humans did not know what they looked like. Once the doctor reveals the blue man\'s face, Kodai became infuriated. How could a race of aliens so cruel and brutal look like a human? He cannot accept this and tried to stab the alien with a tool. The crew members stop him, and as Kodai begins to gather his cool. The captured enemy soldier then decides to try and take his own life at the point, and gets immediately and ironically saved by Kodai right after. To show that the Yamato crew are not the type to torture, they feed the soldier and eventually let him fly back to Galimus after failing to get intel out of him.Throughout the series, there is the obvious romance that builds up between Kodai and Yuki. Yuki already had a crush on Kodai and would tease the oblivious soldier about it constantly. She is a chief member of the crew, and is often seen handing drinks out to them, performing her tasks during missions, or finding herself victimized the Analyzer. She is main woman protagonist, and for an anime as far back as 1974, has a beautiful character design. Her personality can be very playful, yet behind the scenes she is depressed about being separated from her family. There are a few points where the crew are allowed to communicate with earth during their trip. The entire crew are allowed 5 minutes to talk to family, and you can see the desperation of the people on Earth during this time as well as the emotional breakdowns of the crew who miss family and home. When Yuki calls her parents, she sees that her mother has become obsessed with her getting married with having lots of kids for the sake of the continuation of humanity. This leads to poor communication as their time ran out talking about trivial things.She gets involved in an odd triangle eventually between her, Kodai, and the Analyzer. The Analyzer is a hilarious robot aboard the Yamato that performs date collecting among other tasks. He believes he is a human despite being man made and not God made, and is completely in love with Yuki. Outrageously, he often flirts with Yuki, or tries to undress her during inappropriate times. Yuki eventually goes to complain about the Analyzer\'s predatory ways to captain Okita, though nothing could be done to reprogram him.episode 16 would be the episode where she and The analyzer would come to a resolve. Of course, Yuki tells the robot that she could never be with him because of what he is. The Analyzer disagrees and says that he feels he is human enough to love her. They would eventually get captured while scouting in an unknown land by an alien race because Yuki for whatever reason want to climb into a strange hole that led to their nest. As Yuki talked about the fear of her own death, she accidentally insulted the Analyzer by saying that is he died he\'d just become a pile of scrap metal. The Analyzer argues frustratingly  so that his life is not worth any less to that of a human just because he is a robot. After making up, he decides to do all he can here to protect her, and even Yuki at some point acknowledges that he has a human heart despite being nuts and bolts, and hugs him.One part of the emotional side of Space Battleship Yamato is that when the characters hug or caress each other, there is a lot of emphasis on this that shows how precious they all mean to each other.Eventually, they are taken out for execution by the insect race. The Galimus, which were controlling these huge insects appear, send in a ship but their crew get killed. A part of the insects were rebelling and stated that the queen is using them for their blood to give to the Galimus. This is true. If any were to rebel, they\'d get crushed and processed into goo. As the civil war goes on, the Yamato crew would come to save her. Though the Analyzer felt closer to Yuki then ever before as they were embraced during the war and rescue mission, she would run from him and go to Kodai, hugging him instead. The Analyzer felt depressed, and decided in that moment that maybe he really is just a robot after all. At the end, Yuki confronts him, and reminds the robot that they could never work. The Analyzer responds that he\'ll always love her. As be rolls away, he asks her, ""There\'s nothing wrong with loving someone, right?"" Creepy behavior aside, The Analyst is the funniest character in the series and best source of comedy in general with how outrageous he is. He can be often found getting drunk with the doctor by pouring sake over his metallic head.Something I started thinking about half way into this series is the mental effect of being stuck out in space for hundreds of days. The series does address this later as some of the crew begin to lose their minds from being out in space away from their families for too long. One crew member named Aihara would take this to an extreme. Though a Galimus plot, Aihara was manipulated into missing his family so much that he loses his composure in front of the crew and jumps out of the ship in a suit into space. Eventually, he realizes the wrong in his ways and luckily gets rescued as he would have died out in space. What is also interesting about this is that the Yamato has an image therapy room. Those who get anxiety are placed there and are given illusions to make them feel as if they are at home or somewhere out in the wild. In Aihara\'s case, he recognized this as fake. As a result, it didn\'t help him and eventually led to where I said he desperately tried to swim back home from space which was impossible.It is around this time that Kodai himself starts to lose it somewhat. He and Shima, who helps with navigation, often get into arguments and fights here. During one emergency situation, Kodai demands that he follow him. Kodai then expresses his desire to beat him while Shima expresses his desire to toss Kodai out into space. It\'s amusing to watch Until Yuki stops them. Still, they become comrades until the end of the series. Shima himself lost his sister in an accident from a ride at an amusement park and he himself ends up with four cybernetic limbs as a result. He nearly dies during the end but shows the necessity of sacrifice after he blows up a Gamilus ship by detaching his limbs that had bombs installed in them.Next, I want to talk about the Galimus. They are the main antagonists of the series and are led by Desler. Desler is a smug and ruthless ruler that doesn\'t hesitate in killing his own men, even high ranking ones, for slightly annoying him or to just make a point. His goal is to take over planet earth seeing as though their own homeland is collapsing and dying. He becomes interested in the Yamato and decides to destroy it. Time and time again, the Yamato manages to overcome his admirals and dirty tactics. Still, for Desler, he finds amusement and excitement over this. Often times he\'ll laugh with fascination at how strong the Yamato and how intelligent it\'s crew is. It almost feels as if the Yamato itself is what gives him a reason to live or feel excitement in life. Regardless, he tries relentlessly to try and destroy it.Desler ends up ordering Admiral Domel to the task. Domel ends up replacing Gale, which outrageous him. Gale was proud of his position, and could not stand Domel to the point that he would start sabotaging Domel when trying to destroy the Yamato. There was a point where Domel had assured victory. On the other hand, Gale went to Desler and told him that Domel was trying to sacrifice one of their bases to destroy the Yamato. Domel was, however, and had to let the Yamato survive the one time he could have destroyed it since Gale was jealous and spiteful of him. At the same time, Domel often had fun teasing and making fun of Gale, such as when he went into Gale\'s residence and tossed around his fine china telling Gale he has bad taste. Even when Gale tried to light Domel\'s cigarettes with a faulty lighter, Domel used the opportunity to compare Gale\'s lighter to how incompetent Gale is. As a result, Gale would often show frustration and throw drunk temper tantrums at his residence.Near the end of the series, Domel loses his fleet and decides to self destruct their ship on the Yamato as a last ditch effort. As much as they were enemies, Both Admiral Domer and Captain Okita recognized and respected the great level of skill they both have for combat. Domel would perish in the self detonation along with a panicked Gale. Regardless, the Yamato survived. Truly, they are both fighting for the same reasons. Galimus is just trying to survive by fighting for a new home planet for their people, while the Yamato crew are fighting them to save their own kind and planet. At one point, the vice president of the Galimus pleads with Desler to try to co-exist with the humans, but Desler disagrees and shoots him to death.An interesting small detail about Admiral Domel is that he decides to keep a rare bird he found at some point. It reminds me of the bird Captain Harlock has which ends up being paid homage to in Cowboy Bebop with Vicious\'s bird.In approaching the end of the series, it is revealed that Kudai\'s brother was still alive the entire time. He had been saved by Starsha, the queen of Iscandor that the Yamato were travelling to to meet for the purification device. Kudai and the crew felt relieved to see him still alive, but Starsha had fallen in love with him. She tells the brother this and runs away right before the Yamato took off. Kudai\'s brother, though finally reunited with his brother, apologizes to him and runs back to stay with Starsha in Iscandor. Kudai was fortunately accepting of this, and told Yuki that they have become the Adam and Eve of Iscandor. He is right in that the two would go on to rebuilt civilization as it seemed.Before going back home, some of the crew lost faith in the last part of the mission to make the delayed trip back to earth with the purifier. It was led by a crew member named Yabu, who had kidnapped Yuki during that episode. They went to go take over an ice castle, but fell to an environmental disaster. Their goal was to repopulate humanity there and take over the planet as they saw the earth as a lost cause. Yuki was saved, at least.In the finale episode, the Yamato makes it back, but not before Desler reveals that he survived their last battle, and makes a last ditch effort to destroy them with a large drill. At first, the Galimus board on to the Yamato, and inject radioactive gas into it to kill many of the members. Yuki would activate the purification device to counter, but seemingly perish from the gas during her attempt. The device activates, and the Galimus flee. Desler then has the Yamato impaled by a giant drill. The Yamato is able to hijack the drill bomb with the help of The Analyzer and sent it back to him, blowing him up. Still, you can see Desler vanish before the explosion revealing that he is still probably alive. Kodai, in complete disbelief that Yuki has died, goes to see her body and decides to carry her to the control room so that she may see their arrival to earth. He makes a love confession that he loved her since the beginning. He was waiting until the mission was over to confess, but cries with her in her arms seeing as though it\'s impossile now. As the Yamato sees Earth in its vision, this is where the miracle theory comes into play. Immediately after Okita dies, Yuki comes back to life. Perhaps it\'s about when they were talking about where souls go after they die. Maybe Okita\'s soul revived Yuki. Still, that\'s just a guess. The Yamato makes it back home within the long time limit, and the earth appears to be saved. The story concludes leaving the viewers with heavy hearts for the price it took for victory.If I was to point out the flaws in this, there are a few. Sometimes the filter used to portray the murkiness of space stays in place inside the Yamato. Yuki reviving may not make much sense to some viewers because it isn\'t outright explained. Something that kind of bothered me is that the Yamato takes much more punishment than it should. It gets constantly blown up, rammed into, melted, and severely damaged. Regardless, the crew always seem to have the resources to repair whatever happens to it. It felt a bit too convenient at times.Despite this, Space Battleship Yamato has secured itself in my favorites list as an important part of anime history and as an essential viewing. The spirit of Yamato would live on through macross, Orguss, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and in all the other space operas that carry the torch. with a character named Rei Asuka, for example. Another example: the song ""Original Yamato Theme"" was slightly recycled and used in Evangelion as the song ""Background Music II.""There were already several science fiction works before Yamato, Still, the fleet battles, dramatic narration, and the strong structure of its story was bold and fresh at the time. Perhaps the viewers were not ready for an anime like this as it did not do so well at the start. Once the movies released, series creator Leiji Matsumoto, who would go on to do many famous works such as Galaxy Express 999 and Space Pirate Captain Harlock, noticed a large amount of fan mail coming from fans. This was especially among the women to his surprise. Director Noboru Ishiguro, who would go on to direct works such as Macross and Legend of the Galactic Heroes, explained that the sudden influx of fans resulted in many travelling, some by plane, to their studio during production. As a result, the staff would hang out animation cells and background pictures as a thank you.The impact of Space Battle Yamato was so great that it inspired the creation of the game Space Invaders. The Yamato\'s Wave Motion Gun was also the inspiration for the Hadouken in Street Fighter. Not only that, it us rumored that it had an influence in the first Star Wars film that came out a few years later. George Lucas won\'t admit it despite that the similarities are there. Just one example is The Analyzer. It\'s the comedic robot that is rumored to have possibly been the inspiration for R2D2. This has been a topic of debate for decades that was reached no conclusion as many viewers are constantly agreeing and disagreeing.Truly, if Yamamoto never existed, the many great works I mentioned earlier may never have existed, or been very different without it perhaps.Being a work of Matsumoto, the master of melancholy, you can expect an emotional and dramatic space voyage as the Yamato ventures through space. The Gamilas led by Aberdt Desler is facing a dilemma. The life of their planet is running out. As a result, they decide to go out on a mission to take over the planet Earth. To destroy the humans, they sent out a barrage of meteor strikes that destroyed so much of human civilization that humanity had to go underground. Schools were being used as hospitals previously, and many of the women had to become nurses out of necessity. In addition to that, the Gamilas flooded the earth with radiation that threatens to seep into the earth to wipe out the last of humanity. In an attempt to save the human race, humanity has deployed an old World War II ship, the Space Battleship Yamato, to travel out towards Iscanda to acquire a machine that is capable of destroying the radiation poisoning that is slowly killing the planet and themselves. The crew only has a year to make the roundtrip, and faces many obstacles along the way through space anomalies and Galimus fleet battles.The voice acting is immaculate. Among the main characters, Kodai is voiced by Kei Tomoyama, who would go on to voice Yang Wen-li 14 years later in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Shima is voiced by Shuusei Nakamura, most famous for being the voice of Toru Rikiishi in Ashita no Joe.The music I would say is iconic. There are lots of dramatic and amazing songs that help uplift the fleet battles and tragic moments. The funky drum work in some of the songs is impressive and amusing to see mixed with the scenes.The art, for being a work from 1974, is impressive, even by today\'s standards. The beautiful hand drawn animation can fluidly and naturally present the brutality of the fleet battles. There is one episode that took the staff nearly 2 months to animate because of that. The character designs are solid, and there were many times interesting effects used to portray the murkiness of space and the emergence of the yamato from smoke.As the crew continues their voyage, the stakes run high as their schedule starts falling behind. They have estimated one year\'s time before the radiation destroys the humans. At the end of an episode you may hear the narrator sounding desperate as he counts down the days until humanity\'s doom.At this point I will start using spoilers for the analysis. I would highly recommend watching this historical document of an anime before continuing unless you don\'t mind spoilers.In my opinion, though Kodai is the main character, my favorite is captain Juuzou Okita. He is the first captain of this new version of Yamato. His leadership is bold and provocative. His years of experience leads to unorthodox tactics to fight against the Gamilus or to get out of deadly situations. He knows full and well how to lead his team in a serious manner. He may sound cold, but he loves his crew, the earth, and the rest of humanity. The tragedy of Okita is that he is suffering from radiation poisoning. As the Yamato went on, he\'d often collapse from it. The doctor, who is usually seen drunk drinking sake, tells him that he needs to get an operation to stay alive. In Okita\'s point of view, he is determined to follow along with his duty to lead the crew. However, even I would say that if he doesn\'t get the operation, it will get in the way of his focus during crucial moments. And this would be the case as he was constantly passing out while on duty. Eventually, he decides to get the operation, and is left mostly bedridden. A wise man, he spoke some words that really inspired me. There was a time where the crew of the Yamato had doubts about their journey. Hope felt as it was lost. And yet, Okita would confront them and state, ""Why don\'t we believe in ourselves? Nothing is sure in life. One step ahead is darkness in our lives, but if you\'re overly afraid, you won\'t accomplish anything. Overcoming our fears, and believing in our future is an important battle in our minds."" Always calm cool and collected, he always kept his composure even during the most dire situations. Even after being defeated at some point by the Galimus, he respected their strategy in defeating him. Oftentimes, his reactions would be quiet as he\'d sometimes look down with his hat, covering his eyes, or look straight ahead with an unshakable determination. Despite there being no dialogue, his reactions feel like they speak louder than words at times.Since the beginning, he felt for the loss of Kodai\'s brother who supposedly died in the beginning of the series fighting the Galimus. Shima would express regret towards Kodai as an engineer that Kodai\'s brother had entered this mission on a ship that Shima knew was too damaged for the mission. Considering all this, Okita developed a bit of a soft spot for Kodai. As his time grew near, Okita would summon Kodai and make him the new captain of the Yamato. Determined with the will to live, as the Yamato makes its trip back to earth, Okita kept himself alive with solid resolve that he must see the earth again before perishing from the radiation. It would be around this time that he began thinking about the concept of death. He was under the assumption that the soul leaves the body when someone dies, and looked on out into space while bedridden wondering where his soul will go after he dies.The most crushing moment in Space Battleship Yamato is his death in the last episode. I was in tears constantly as the writing pushed the blade deeper and deeper into my heart. There were more tragic events that were already giving me heavy emotions in that episode already. As obvious as the obvious demands for the sake of the plot, the Yamato does make the roundtrip which I\'ll look into later in this video. Okita thanks the doctor for his treatment and asks to be left alone. As the emotionally tragic music plays in the background, Okita takes out a picture of his family and caresses it with his hands. His hand then begins to shake as he tears up. He looks up at the Earth and speaks weakly with his dying breath, ""Earth. Everything about it is precious."" He passes on, leaving behind part of the environmental message that the series tries to make about the planet we live in. As he met his end, there is a miracle that happens here that I will explain concerning him and Yuki when I get to her. It\'s only a theory but fairly interesting.Kodai, is another protagonist and the successor as captain of the Yamato after Okita personally handpicks him. He suffers from the trauma he faced as a child from the attacks of the Galimus. His parents were obliterated in a meteor attack. Kodai finds only scraps of their clothes. Later on, he had to go through the supposed death of his brother at the hands of the enemy. Though he grew up as a pacifist, he decided to volunteer for the army partly due to his brother\'s wishes for him to do so. It is this trauma that leads to that intense moment where the Yamato crew managed to capture a low ranking soldier from the Galimus. At that point, humans did not know what they looked like. Once the doctor reveals the blue man\'s face, Kodai became infuriated. How could a race of aliens so cruel and brutal look like a human? He cannot accept this and tried to stab the alien with a tool. The crew members stop him, and as Kodai begins to gather his cool. The captured enemy soldier then decides to try and take his own life at the point, and gets immediately and ironically saved by Kodai right after. To show that the Yamato crew are not the type to torture, they feed the soldier and eventually let him fly back to Galimus after failing to get intel out of him.Throughout the series, there is the obvious romance that builds up between Kodai and Yuki. Yuki already had a crush on Kodai and would tease the oblivious soldier about it constantly. She is a chief member of the crew, and is often seen handing drinks out to them, performing her tasks during missions, or finding herself victimized the Analyzer. She is main woman protagonist, and for an anime as far back as 1974, has a beautiful character design. Her personality can be very playful, yet behind the scenes she is depressed about being separated from her family. There are a few points where the crew are allowed to communicate with earth during their trip. The entire crew are allowed 5 minutes to talk to family, and you can see the desperation of the people on Earth during this time as well as the emotional breakdowns of the crew who miss family and home. When Yuki calls her parents, she sees that her mother has become obsessed with her getting married with having lots of kids for the sake of the continuation of humanity. This leads to poor communication as their time ran out talking about trivial things.She gets involved in an odd triangle eventually between her, Kodai, and the Analyzer. The Analyzer is a hilarious robot aboard the Yamato that performs date collecting among other tasks. He believes he is a human despite being man made and not God made, and is completely in love with Yuki. Outrageously, he often flirts with Yuki, or tries to undress her during inappropriate times. Yuki eventually goes to complain about the Analyzer\'s predatory ways to captain Okita, though nothing could be done to reprogram him.episode 16 would be the episode where she and The analyzer would come to a resolve. Of course, Yuki tells the robot that she could never be with him because of what he is. The Analyzer disagrees and says that he feels he is human enough to love her. They would eventually get captured while scouting in an unknown land by an alien race because Yuki for whatever reason want to climb into a strange hole that led to their nest. As Yuki talked about the fear of her own death, she accidentally insulted the Analyzer by saying that is he died he\'d just become a pile of scrap metal. The Analyzer argues frustratingly  so that his life is not worth any less to that of a human just because he is a robot. After making up, he decides to do all he can here to protect her, and even Yuki at some point acknowledges that he has a human heart despite being nuts and bolts, and hugs him.One part of the emotional side of Space Battleship Yamato is that when the characters hug or caress each other, there is a lot of emphasis on this that shows how precious they all mean to each other.Eventually, they are taken out for execution by the insect race. The Galimus, which were controlling these huge insects appear, send in a ship but their crew get killed. A part of the insects were rebelling and stated that the queen is using them for their blood to give to the Galimus. This is true. If any were to rebel, they\'d get crushed and processed into goo. As the civil war goes on, the Yamato crew would come to save her. Though the Analyzer felt closer to Yuki then ever before as they were embraced during the war and rescue mission, she would run from him and go to Kodai, hugging him instead. The Analyzer felt depressed, and decided in that moment that maybe he really is just a robot after all. At the end, Yuki confronts him, and reminds the robot that they could never work. The Analyzer responds that he\'ll always love her. As be rolls away, he asks her, ""There\'s nothing wrong with loving someone, right?"" Creepy behavior aside, The Analyst is the funniest character in the series and best source of comedy in general with how outrageous he is. He can be often found getting drunk with the doctor by pouring sake over his metallic head.Something I started thinking about half way into this series is the mental effect of being stuck out in space for hundreds of days. The series does address this later as some of the crew begin to lose their minds from being out in space away from their families for too long. One crew member named Aihara would take this to an extreme. Though a Galimus plot, Aihara was manipulated into missing his family so much that he loses his composure in front of the crew and jumps out of the ship in a suit into space. Eventually, he realizes the wrong in his ways and luckily gets rescued as he would have died out in space. What is also interesting about this is that the Yamato has an image therapy room. Those who get anxiety are placed there and are given illusions to make them feel as if they are at home or somewhere out in the wild. In Aihara\'s case, he recognized this as fake. As a result, it didn\'t help him and eventually led to where I said he desperately tried to swim back home from space which was impossible.It is around this time that Kodai himself starts to lose it somewhat. He and Shima, who helps with navigation, often get into arguments and fights here. During one emergency situation, Kodai demands that he follow him. Kodai then expresses his desire to beat him while Shima expresses his desire to toss Kodai out into space. It\'s amusing to watch Until Yuki stops them. Still, they become comrades until the end of the series. Shima himself lost his sister in an accident from a ride at an amusement park and he himself ends up with four cybernetic limbs as a result. He nearly dies during the end but shows the necessity of sacrifice after he blows up a Gamilus ship by detaching his limbs that had bombs installed in them.Next, I want to talk about the Galimus. They are the main antagonists of the series and are led by Desler. Desler is a smug and ruthless ruler that doesn\'t hesitate in killing his own men, even high ranking ones, for slightly annoying him or to just make a point. His goal is to take over planet earth seeing as though their own homeland is collapsing and dying. He becomes interested in the Yamato and decides to destroy it. Time and time again, the Yamato manages to overcome his admirals and dirty tactics. Still, for Desler, he finds amusement and excitement over this. Often times he\'ll laugh with fascination at how strong the Yamato and how intelligent it\'s crew is. It almost feels as if the Yamato itself is what gives him a reason to live or feel excitement in life. Regardless, he tries relentlessly to try and destroy it.Desler ends up ordering Admiral Domel to the task. Domel ends up replacing Gale, which outrageous him. Gale was proud of his position, and could not stand Domel to the point that he would start sabotaging Domel when trying to destroy the Yamato. There was a point where Domel had assured victory. On the other hand, Gale went to Desler and told him that Domel was trying to sacrifice one of their bases to destroy the Yamato. Domel was, however, and had to let the Yamato survive the one time he could have destroyed it since Gale was jealous and spiteful of him. At the same time, Domel often had fun teasing and making fun of Gale, such as when he went into Gale\'s residence and tossed around his fine china telling Gale he has bad taste. Even when Gale tried to light Domel\'s cigarettes with a faulty lighter, Domel used the opportunity to compare Gale\'s lighter to how incompetent Gale is. As a result, Gale would often show frustration and throw drunk temper tantrums at his residence.Near the end of the series, Domel loses his fleet and decides to self destruct their ship on the Yamato as a last ditch effort. As much as they were enemies, Both Admiral Domer and Captain Okita recognized and respected the great level of skill they both have for combat. Domel would perish in the self detonation along with a panicked Gale. Regardless, the Yamato survived. Truly, they are both fighting for the same reasons. Galimus is just trying to survive by fighting for a new home planet for their people, while the Yamato crew are fighting them to save their own kind and planet. At one point, the vice president of the Galimus pleads with Desler to try to co-exist with the humans, but Desler disagrees and shoots him to death.An interesting small detail about Admiral Domel is that he decides to keep a rare bird he found at some point. It reminds me of the bird Captain Harlock has which ends up being paid homage to in Cowboy Bebop with Vicious\'s bird.In approaching the end of the series, it is revealed that Kudai\'s brother was still alive the entire time. He had been saved by Starsha, the queen of Iscandor that the Yamato were travelling to to meet for the purification device. Kudai and the crew felt relieved to see him still alive, but Starsha had fallen in love with him. She tells the brother this and runs away right before the Yamato took off. Kudai\'s brother, though finally reunited with his brother, apologizes to him and runs back to stay with Starsha in Iscandor. Kudai was fortunately accepting of this, and told Yuki that they have become the Adam and Eve of Iscandor. He is right in that the two would go on to rebuilt civilization as it seemed.Before going back home, some of the crew lost faith in the last part of the mission to make the delayed trip back to earth with the purifier. It was led by a crew member named Yabu, who had kidnapped Yuki during that episode. They went to go take over an ice castle, but fell to an environmental disaster.

The spirit of Yamato would live on through macross, Orguss, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and in all the other space operas that carry the torch.', ""Notice: This review covers all seasons and movies of the franchise. Reading it is like reading about all of them.Battleship Yamato (known as Star Blazers in the American dub) is an early work of Leiji Matsumoto and the first example of what a good animated series can be all about. As basic and silly as it may seem today, this series happened to be amongst the most mature titles of its era and opened the way for others to pick up the style and work on it. Anime back then were really childish and crude but this one tried its best to be serious with...scientific explanations trying to reason all the weird technology in the series; even the means the animators used were top notch at that time. Thus you need to have an open mind if you want to properly enjoy it for what it is or you may find yourselves asking stupid questions such as how can you enjoy the first Star Trek series when the later ones have better visuals.ART SECTION: 7/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2The setting is a space adventure regarding journeys to alien planets, plus lots of repetitive mass destruction scenes of fleets and Earth. The animation begins very poorly to today’s standards; inconsistent proportions, plain colors, crude movements and a dozen follow-up scene mistakes per episode will make most young viewers to laugh at it. Still, reading the story behind the scenes I can simply salute them for coming up with such nice tricks to create new ways of expression while experimenting with special effects. They were practically given a tight budget and just a week to create an episode to be aimed at a few hundred children and perhaps their parents. For such crummy rewards, they did wonders. The production values are also slowly improving with each new installation; giving more details to ships and less body deformities. Just like the Star Trek franchise, they build on the main idea along the way and further flavor the presentation.SOUND SECTION: 7/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 3/4, Sound Effects 2/3The voices have a spark in them half the time but are usually too heavy on idealism and they may sound ridiculous to the more modern audience who didn’t grow up in warring times. The dialogues can be extremely irritating since the good guys keep shoveling us with awfully idealistic monologues about hope, justice, humanity and a load of other crap no sane viewer can stand for long. The bad guys keep talking about how reassured of their great forces they are when in practice, they never win a battle. Give us a break you guys! I guess it felt cooler than corny back then, just like Star Wars felt more serious and awesome a few decades ago. Times do change…In a similar way, the music themes are laughable for their over the top melodramatic feeling. The main song is remade a bit better in the next seasons, but the lyrics don't match with the goal of the story. They are no longer going to Iscandar! They are otherwise nice sounding ballads that fit the whole feeling of the show.STORY SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 1/2, Conclusion 1/2The first season was made in 1974, and the story was about aliens who attack the Earth with radioactive comets during 2199. The Earth fleet goes to the offence by recreating its ancient flagship, this time as a super powerful spaceship. Its mission is to stop the bombardment and find a radiation cleaner device within one year, offered by a mysterious woman in a far away planet.It is a very clichéd story and you most likely have already seen a billion series with a similar premise. It even ends in a predictably melo way; which is what the people back then expected instead of surprises. Each episode is a scene about what the good guys do in the ship, a scene about what the bad guys scheme, and then we get a battle between them. Which is not that different than what is going on in a typical mecha show.The story is also nothing more than a fairy tale version of the Second World War. The alien invaders are the Americans, the radioactive comets are the atomic bombs, the Humans are the (kind?) Japanese people and the Yamato is their famous battleship (and symbolically their pride) that rose to take revenge and save their lands from foreign oppression. And what a surprise! The humans/Japanese people always seem to be right and win in all the battles! As for that alien woman with the radioactive cleaner device, she is an excuse to have a happy ending in our story. If only reality was that kind …But as I said, back then it felt far more realistic and serious that the stuff that preceded it and it was technically made to cheer up the post-war Japanese people. Heck, some can argue that most stories of modern anime are still not as serious as Yamato’s space opera genre, where you get a lot of character interaction and world building. There are even some interesting revelations towards the last episodes that make the otherwise generic story a bit interesting and unpredictable. For the first time the villains show a few emotions and they don’t plan to just take over the universe but simply to immigrate to Earth because their planet is dying. Makes it good next to, let’s say, the dinosaurs in Getter Robo who despite being in a similar situation they were never allowed to be anything other than cardboards without the slightest colorization or drama.In terms of realism, the series tries to be intelligent since the Yamato is made after a real battleship and every planet it goes to is followed by a simple narration of how the climate is all about there (based on what they knew about the universe, back in the 70’s). Also, every special weapon both sides use has a simple explanation of how it works. In terms of plausibility though, the series sucks since there is no way a single spaceship can survive a hundred thousand bombardments and still win in every battle against millions of advanced spaceships without having a reassured way of repairing damages and reloading weapons after each battle. The good guys never seem to die or lose, no matter the odds. And damn, humanity appears to be getting almost wiped out every year yet miraculously manages to rebuild and flourish with the speed of light.So far I mentioned only stuff that happen in the first season. What about the rest of the installments?The second season (aka The Comet Empire) was made in 1978, and the story is about aliens attacking the Earth with a huge comet fortress. The Yamato takes a mission to find a mysterious woman in a far away planet that possesses the power to stop them. If you paid attention before, you will realize that IT IS THE SAME STORY ALL OVER AGAIN! Yeah, originality went for a walk but nobody minded back then. Still, the story is better than in the first season since humans and aliens have now internal conflicts around authority and honor, making the plot a bit more perplexing and unpredictable. Also, the battles are far more grand-scaled and less straight-forward. The same year they also made “In the name of Love”, a movie-retelling of this season, made up of the best scenes of the series, boosted with a lot more drama and death. The story is altered in a way to be a lot more straight-forward but also a lot more dramatic. All characters talk with a lot more passion (which is a plus) and almost all of them die (they survived in the canon story).The third installment is actually two movies, “The New Voyage” in 1979 and it sequel “Be Forever Yamato” in 1980. The evil Desler starts feeling remorse for all he has done and even asks of the Yamato to help, after he finds out that his twin planets are being mined to death by the Black Nebula empire. Kodai, now captain of the Yamato, doesn’t think twice to return to planet Iscandar, as Mamoru, his brother, chose to stay there with Starsha on season one. Things start to get very grey and violent from here on as the dreaded high death count is back. Later on the Black Nebula invades Earth and conquers it rather easy, thanks to the Hyperion bomb than kills brain cells on a planetary scale. Kodai gathers the Yamato crew for yet another rescue-the-Earth mission. This is by far the best part of the whole Yamato franchise ever made; it has so many scenario developments and emotional moments than all of the previous movies and seasons put together. A few of them are the following: (do not read if you don’t want spoilers) Yuki is taken hostage and seduced by the enemy, Mamoru sacrifices, his daughter Sasha becomes an adult in only a year and digs her uncle Kodai, the Yamato is seemingly sent to the future and witnesses its death, and more and more… Man, it was a blast! A thing I didn’t like here that is kept as an annoyance even in later instalments is how every new opponent seems to appear out of thin air. There is no foreshadowing to excuse them being there before their introduction. Where was Black Nebula hiding all this time? What was it doing during the previous seasons? … Ok I am overthinking this.The fourth installment is the third season (aka The Bolar Wars), made in 1980. Yet another empire that came out of nowhere is in the middle of a civil interstellar war. One of its planet-destroying missiles hits by accident the sun in our solar system, which will cause the sun to turn super nova in a year. The Yamato takes another mission to find a second Earth so that humanity can survive by migrating there, learn of what is going on with the war, and find a mysterious woman in a far away planet that possesses godly powers. Once again, you will realize that IT IS THE SAME STORY FOR THE THIRD TIME! Didn’t the scriptwriters get paid to write them? But yet again, the plot is even better; the aliens have their reasons for being good or bad and not all of them are thinking the same way. Also, the battles are even more grand-scaled and less linear.The fifth instalment is another movie, “Final Yamato” made in 1983. Our galaxy collides with another galaxy and causes intergalactic havoc. Planet Aquarius, which gave life on Earth countless years ago, is causing floods and a dying civilization intends to warp the planet to Earth and inhabit it after all its people have drowned. On the good side, the scenario is based on the Panspermia theory and on ancient Babylonian myths about the arrival of aliens and the creation of life in ancient times. For once, all those weird cosmic phenomena and humanoid aliens throughout the universe have a reasonable explanation. On the bad side, the scenario is a chaotic pile of incoherent ideas and forced events. Nothing makes sense, given the length of the movie. What’s with the galactic collision? Why do the aliens need to warp an entire planet when they could easily conquer Earth with conventional ways? The only survivor of a dying planet was conveniently the prince of the aliens? Desler only appears in the nick of time? A goddess that causes us harm out of love? OKITA IS STILL ALIVE ???!!! People come and go, appear and disappear, live and die so fast that you don’t feel a thing about them.The sixth installment was made many years ago, part of preparing the rebooting the franchise. Resurrection (made in 2009) finds our galaxy being slowly eaten away by a sentient black hole. Humanity tries to immigrate to another far away planet before it is too late but encounters the hostility of an alliance of alien cultures, who are made to believe humans are invaders. The Yamato is remade as part of yet another rescue mission, to stop the attacks on the transport ships and to find out why they are all so hostile towards them. There was enough mean to create a nice full season out of this but unfortunately they just rushed through everything and thus the overall feeling feels lazy and undeveloped. There is a sort of revelation towards the end regarding the mystery of the black hole but it just came out of nowhere and there wasn’t proper build up to care about anything.In all, the story began in a very simple and corny way, gradually improved through the three seasons, reached a great height in Be Forever Yamato, and simply lost its passion to keep trying to be good. So I am kinda worried if they will even care to make a worthy reboot in 2012.CHARACTER SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 1/2, Catharsis 1/2Well, compared to today… they plain suck! They are all character archetypes, without personality coloring by today’s standards. The description below can pretty much count in all the seasons and movies of the series.- Human males are the epitome of yasashi (kind hearted) Japanese people. You know, always kind, gentle, strong-willed… and with a permanent dorky expression on their face.- Human women are… just there. Frail, kind, beautiful, always in love with the main characters. Generally, they are very few in numbers, have very undermined posts and have very minor roles. They hardly count as fan service or emotional support. Heck, at some point they even disappear from the ship’s crew entirely.- Alien males are just… blue-skinned humans. Seriously, they even share the same DNA as humans. Couldn’t the animators make them more exotic or something? And as far as personality goes, they behave just like megalomaniac, imperialistic, military people. They have German names and salute like Nazis. You can imagine on which people they were based upon.- Alien women are the Deus ex Machina solution in the story. There is always a beautiful alien babe in some far away planet that is bent on aiding Earth with an ultra powerful way.As far as interesting characters go:- The good guys are completely boring. Weak presence, no personality, no development, not much background story and no catharsis since they were already perfect people without any worries other than saving Earth.- The alien leader Desler is interesting for being a paranoid megalomaniac. He even matures a lot in the following seasons. Hooray for the villains!- And there is also Analyzer, a comic relief robot that seems to do all the work that the dorky heroes are too stupid to do themselves. Plus, it makes a lot of sexual teasing. How I wish there were more characters like Analyzer; it is a robot and yet acts more like a human than the stale and picture-perfect “robotic” humans he aids.Again, I am sure the cast felt far more creditable back then exactly because it felt so ideal. Those times were far more black and white than they are today. But surely, for a genre that allows the director to colorize and develop its cast along the way, they don’t feel like much. They do become more colorful in later installments but never enough to be deemed very interesting.VALUE SECTION: 5/10Historical Value 3/3: A cult title for all the above reasons I mention.Rewatchability 1/3: Maybe just for the battles. There is no much of a story or characters to bother with.Memorability 1/4: A very generic series you need to remember for historical reasons and not for the cast or the story.ENJOYMENT SECTION: 5/10A very generic story, with a very generic plot and a very generic cast makes most of the series a very boring watch.On the good side, the series is full of good sci-fi ideas that prevent the story from becoming a typical “brainless invaders vs idealistic humans.” For instance, the aliens use radioactive meteors from a base on Pluto, instead of sending their army there. It makes it far more original and realistic this way. They possess reflective satellites than make their laser beams to bounce around planets. They even possess tractor beams and teleportation waves that sent enemy ships on corroding seas of acid. The Yamato has light-speed technology, wave particle engines and cannons, magnetic shield ring and laser reflection coating, all provided with a simple explanation. This parade of basic strategies and special powers makes every battle far more interesting than, lets say, most mecha series where all they do is throw energy beams at each other. And yes, I do know it caused millions of people to shed tears but I still find it very weak if I compare it by today’s standards. It may still beat most modern anime in tragedy but it simply presents things very superficially and melodramatic to the point you prefer the formula as it was in less serious mecha shows because the lack of realism was excusing stuff better.The second season has better animation, more perplexing story, and a bit more colorful characters making it a bit more enjoyable. And not to forget to mention the new weaponry. The aliens have more terrifying weapons than the previous ones, making them far more sinister. They possess a planet-destroyer comet, moon-destroyer missiles, teleportation beams, laser reflection barriers and can even resurrect the dead! You don’t find such variety in most series.I personally consider the retelling of “In the name of Love” to be sappy. It was made just to give a quick and dramatic ending to an otherwise ongoing series. There are many interesting events in the series that you will miss if you don’t watch it. So, I recommend to watch this movie if you found the second season to be terribly old and uninteresting. It is a fine conclusion for all of you who don’t intend to watch the third season.The New Voyage and Be Forever Yamato are full of space battles, and dramatic dialogues. They have a very fast pace and are quite enjoyable if you are a retro freak.The third season has even better animation, even more perplexing story, and far more colorful characters. And guess what; we get even more terrifying new weaponry. The aliens are even more sinister than the ones in the second season. They possess planet-destroyer missiles, subspace submarines and black hole bombs! You don’t find such variety in most series.“Final Yamato” and “Resurrection” are by far the most childish parts of the Yamato franchise. They have many good scenario ideas and yet they are all wasted by terrible presentation and Deus ex Machina situations. Enough with the corny “I love you” routine between Kodai and Yuki. It got boring after the 1.000th time! And enough about the destruction of the Earth every 6 months! And of the Yamato mysteriously surviving a hundred hits when all other ships blow up with a single strike. And the ending! How terribly melo it was! At least there were several well-made space battles that war-otakus will love.VERDICT: 5.5The forefather of anime space operas. He is really old and senile but it is he that all the rest look upon for ideas. If only the tv series was as fast paced and action based as the movies, it would still be a title most otakus would keep around. But seriously, for those of you who were waiting for a good conclusion to a cult title in Kanketsu hen, this is far from satisfying.SUGGESTION LISTUchuu Kuubo Blue Noah.

Famous series, made by the same cartoonist, Leiji Matsumoto. You will notice that his characters are identical in all his works.The first Star Trek & Dr. Who seasons. Cult sci-fi series. They pretty much have the same retro appeal.Macross. A semi-serious mecha series and semi-space opera with a similar story.Banner of the Stars. An intergalactic romance / war that transcends species.The Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The epitome of space operas. scientific explanations trying to reason all the weird technology in the series; even the means the animators used were top notch at that time. Thus you need to have an open mind if you want to properly enjoy it for what it is or you may find yourselves asking stupid questions such as how can you enjoy the first Star Trek series when the later ones have better visuals.ART SECTION: 7/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2The setting is a space adventure regarding journeys to alien planets, plus lots of repetitive mass destruction scenes of fleets and Earth. The animation begins very poorly to today’s standards; inconsistent proportions, plain colors, crude movements and a dozen follow-up scene mistakes per episode will make most young viewers to laugh at it. Still, reading the story behind the scenes I can simply salute them for coming up with such nice tricks to create new ways of expression while experimenting with special effects. They were practically given a tight budget and just a week to create an episode to be aimed at a few hundred children and perhaps their parents. For such crummy rewards, they did wonders. The production values are also slowly improving with each new installation; giving more details to ships and less body deformities. Just like the Star Trek franchise, they build on the main idea along the way and further flavor the presentation.SOUND SECTION: 7/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 3/4, Sound Effects 2/3The voices have a spark in them half the time but are usually too heavy on idealism and they may sound ridiculous to the more modern audience who didn’t grow up in warring times. The dialogues can be extremely irritating since the good guys keep shoveling us with awfully idealistic monologues about hope, justice, humanity and a load of other crap no sane viewer can stand for long. The bad guys keep talking about how reassured of their great forces they are when in practice, they never win a battle. Give us a break you guys! I guess it felt cooler than corny back then, just like Star Wars felt more serious and awesome a few decades ago. Times do change…In a similar way, the music themes are laughable for their over the top melodramatic feeling. The main song is remade a bit better in the next seasons, but the lyrics don't match with the goal of the story. They are no longer going to Iscandar! They are otherwise nice sounding ballads that fit the whole feeling of the show.STORY SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 1/2, Conclusion 1/2The first season was made in 1974, and the story was about aliens who attack the Earth with radioactive comets during 2199. The Earth fleet goes to the offence by recreating its ancient flagship, this time as a super powerful spaceship. Its mission is to stop the bombardment and find a radiation cleaner device within one year, offered by a mysterious woman in a far away planet.It is a very clichéd story and you most likely have already seen a billion series with a similar premise. It even ends in a predictably melo way; which is what the people back then expected instead of surprises. Each episode is a scene about what the good guys do in the ship, a scene about what the bad guys scheme, and then we get a battle between them. Which is not that different than what is going on in a typical mecha show.The story is also nothing more than a fairy tale version of the Second World War. The alien invaders are the Americans, the radioactive comets are the atomic bombs, the Humans are the (kind?) Japanese people and the Yamato is their famous battleship (and symbolically their pride) that rose to take revenge and save their lands from foreign oppression. And what a surprise! The humans/Japanese people always seem to be right and win in all the battles! As for that alien woman with the radioactive cleaner device, she is an excuse to have a happy ending in our story. If only reality was that kind …But as I said, back then it felt far more realistic and serious that the stuff that preceded it and it was technically made to cheer up the post-war Japanese people. Heck, some can argue that most stories of modern anime are still not as serious as Yamato’s space opera genre, where you get a lot of character interaction and world building. There are even some interesting revelations towards the last episodes that make the otherwise generic story a bit interesting and unpredictable. For the first time the villains show a few emotions and they don’t plan to just take over the universe but simply to immigrate to Earth because their planet is dying. Makes it good next to, let’s say, the dinosaurs in Getter Robo who despite being in a similar situation they were never allowed to be anything other than cardboards without the slightest colorization or drama.In terms of realism, the series tries to be intelligent since the Yamato is made after a real battleship and every planet it goes to is followed by a simple narration of how the climate is all about there (based on what they knew about the universe, back in the 70’s). Also, every special weapon both sides use has a simple explanation of how it works. In terms of plausibility though, the series sucks since there is no way a single spaceship can survive a hundred thousand bombardments and still win in every battle against millions of advanced spaceships without having a reassured way of repairing damages and reloading weapons after each battle. The good guys never seem to die or lose, no matter the odds. And damn, humanity appears to be getting almost wiped out every year yet miraculously manages to rebuild and flourish with the speed of light.So far I mentioned only stuff that happen in the first season. What about the rest of the installments?The second season (aka The Comet Empire) was made in 1978, and the story is about aliens attacking the Earth with a huge comet fortress. The Yamato takes a mission to find a mysterious woman in a far away planet that possesses the power to stop them. If you paid attention before, you will realize that IT IS THE SAME STORY ALL OVER AGAIN! Yeah, originality went for a walk but nobody minded back then. Still, the story is better than in the first season since humans and aliens have now internal conflicts around authority and honor, making the plot a bit more perplexing and unpredictable. Also, the battles are far more grand-scaled and less straight-forward. The same year they also made “In the name of Love”, a movie-retelling of this season, made up of the best scenes of the series, boosted with a lot more drama and death. The story is altered in a way to be a lot more straight-forward but also a lot more dramatic. All characters talk with a lot more passion (which is a plus) and almost all of them die (they survived in the canon story).The third installment is actually two movies, “The New Voyage” in 1979 and it sequel “Be Forever Yamato” in 1980. The evil Desler starts feeling remorse for all he has done and even asks of the Yamato to help, after he finds out that his twin planets are being mined to death by the Black Nebula empire. Kodai, now captain of the Yamato, doesn’t think twice to return to planet Iscandar, as Mamoru, his brother, chose to stay there with Starsha on season one. Things start to get very grey and violent from here on as the dreaded high death count is back. Later on the Black Nebula invades Earth and conquers it rather easy, thanks to the Hyperion bomb than kills brain cells on a planetary scale. Kodai gathers the Yamato crew for yet another rescue-the-Earth mission. This is by far the best part of the whole Yamato franchise ever made; it has so many scenario developments and emotional moments than all of the previous movies and seasons put together. A few of them are the following: (do not read if you don’t want spoilers) Yuki is taken hostage and seduced by the enemy, Mamoru sacrifices, his daughter Sasha becomes an adult in only a year and digs her uncle Kodai, the Yamato is seemingly sent to the future and witnesses its death, and more and more… Man, it was a blast! A thing I didn’t like here that is kept as an annoyance even in later instalments is how every new opponent seems to appear out of thin air. There is no foreshadowing to excuse them being there before their introduction. Where was Black Nebula hiding all this time? What was it doing during the previous seasons? … Ok I am overthinking this.The fourth installment is the third season (aka The Bolar Wars), made in 1980. Yet another empire that came out of nowhere is in the middle of a civil interstellar war. One of its planet-destroying missiles hits by accident the sun in our solar system, which will cause the sun to turn super nova in a year. The Yamato takes another mission to find a second Earth so that humanity can survive by migrating there, learn of what is going on with the war, and find a mysterious woman in a far away planet that possesses godly powers. Once again, you will realize that IT IS THE SAME STORY FOR THE THIRD TIME! Didn’t the scriptwriters get paid to write them? But yet again, the plot is even better; the aliens have their reasons for being good or bad and not all of them are thinking the same way. Also, the battles are even more grand-scaled and less linear.The fifth instalment is another movie, “Final Yamato” made in 1983. Our galaxy collides with another galaxy and causes intergalactic havoc. Planet Aquarius, which gave life on Earth countless years ago, is causing floods and a dying civilization intends to warp the planet to Earth and inhabit it after all its people have drowned. On the good side, the scenario is based on the Panspermia theory and on ancient Babylonian myths about the arrival of aliens and the creation of life in ancient times. For once, all those weird cosmic phenomena and humanoid aliens throughout the universe have a reasonable explanation. On the bad side, the scenario is a chaotic pile of incoherent ideas and forced events. Nothing makes sense, given the length of the movie. What’s with the galactic collision? Why do the aliens need to warp an entire planet when they could easily conquer Earth with conventional ways? The only survivor of a dying planet was conveniently the prince of the aliens? Desler only appears in the nick of time? A goddess that causes us harm out of love? OKITA IS STILL ALIVE ???!!!

As a Gundam fan, I can clearly see the inspiration Gundam received from this series. I was quite hooked from the beginning, and the show does a good job of showing you the stakes by repeatedly looming the countdown to Earth's total destruction at the end of each episode. I never felt like the pacing was lagging or that we were just spending unnecessary amounts of time in one place after another; everything moves at a quick speed.My biggest complaint is...that it takes a little while for the characters personalities to shine through. Near the beginning, I felt like Kodai and Shima were pretty much blank slates with one-dimensional personalities, and their places could be swapped with each other with little difference. Luckily,\xa0 around episode 7, we start to get a lot more characterization for both of them that sets them apart as distinct. Another thing is that it becomes apparent that the Yamato has pretty strong plot armor and can take major beatings that even the supposedly superior Gamilus can't withstand. Also,\xa0 the Yamato is miraculously repaired on many occasions in the next episode after sustaining horrible damage. I guess this can mostly be attributed to reusing animation, so it's excusable to me.If you like old-school space operas, you'll like this.

This show from 1974 is by some concidered the inferior version of Yamato, with the remake 2199 being hailed as the better version. Is that really true though?The story of Yamato goes something like this. In the year 2199 the earth is under attack from aliens known as Gamilas. Humanity has been forced underground to escape the irradiated surface, but the deadly radiation is seeping underground and humanity will be destroyed within a year. Earth recieves a transmission from...a planet called Iscandar, who claims to have a device that can get rid of the deadly radiation on earth. However they have to travel 148000 light years from Earth to get to Iscandar. Thus humanity sets out in the spaceship Yamato on a desperate attempt at saving the earth.The first thing I noticed with this show was that for being made in 1974 it looks really good. Very few of the production hiccups you might expect from anime at this time was present in this show. The animation was decent and even though I found myself saying things like ""the effects animation looks kinda weak"", I was comparing that to modern day digital effects works. So I honestly have to give this show huge marks for having such a healthy production.To answer my earlier question, is Yamato (1974) a weaker show than Yamato 2199 (2012)? Honestly, I would have to say no. If anything I would say that despite adapting the same story they are very different. They are two completely different takes on the same story. The original Yamato focused on humanity\'s struggle to avoid going extinct, their travel to Iscandar and the dangers that comes, and 2199 seemed to focus more the crew aboard the Yamato and how they grew closer over the journey to Iscandar, as well as splits and conflicts between the crew members. Now, I will say that personally I enjoyed 2199 slightly more. It tied up some loose ends in the original and was overall just a good show, but that does not take anything away from the original. It was a solid show all the way through, and apart from a few things at the end that seemed to happen mostly for convinience or were left unexplained, it was a good show that I would recommend everyone to watch. And even if you for some reason don\'t want to watch the original, I still highly recommend the remake 2199. a planet called Iscandar, who claims to have a device that can get rid of the deadly radiation on earth.

It was a solid show all the way through, and apart from a few things at the end that seemed to happen mostly for convinience or were left unexplained, it was a good show that I would recommend everyone to watch. And even if you for some reason don\'t want to watch the original, I still highly recommend the remake 2199.', 'Space Battleship Yamato. Not something I would consider ordinary, nor was my encounter with the show exactly ordinary either. While looking up IJN ships on Wikipedia, I moved to an article about the Yamato Museum, a Japanese war museum that didn\'t stand out to me much, apart from one thing, and that was that it screened this show, which I\'d never heard of. The IJN Yamato is refitted to become a spaceship, and has to travel across the galaxy to obtain a \'Cosmo Cleaner\' to save the world from pollution. Well, that\'s such an absurd set-up that I had no choice but to watch it....But from all that, I gathered it was some sort of parody of space opera - a Japanese Spaceballs, if you will. But not only was it not a parody, it actually pre-dated Star Wars, perhaps the biggest sci-fi franchise of all time, as well as out-grossed it in Japan. But I\'ve digressed, too long, onto the actual review now.As previously stated, the story is about the IJN Yamato fighting against aliens to save the Earth. Personally, I do think that with the premise (I still don\'t get why they chose the Yamato, was the author the son of one of the main ship\'s engineers or something?), and for the most part, there really isn\'t a huge amount of intricate details in there, it\'s mostly just the Yamato flying through space to get to the (fictional) planet Iscandar, and each episode avoiding obstacles put before them. One thing I can praise the show for was that it did show us their motivations (i.e. they need to capitulate Earth to survive themselves), but I think if they were going to go ahead and do this, then they should\'ve really toned down all the ""we are evil and going to destroy Earth because we are evil and very bad and like slavery"" in all the episodes prior. At the end of the day, the story is a solid premise, executed well, and each episode brings about new and interesting developments.I am a modern viewer, watching this in the late 2010\'s, and so I\'ve gotten very used to the animation quality of this decade and the previous one, so naturally, a show from 1974 will seem of lesser quality in this regard. Still, as long as it\'s not actually painful to see, it really won\'t affect my viewing experience, and while I wouldn\'t go that far, the animation quality isn\'t that great. The lip syncing is off quite a bit, people have walk cycles like N64 games, and on the whole everything does look a bit stiff, but it\'s not terrible, it\'s not so bad it detracts from the experience, and the physical design of the characters, weapons, environments, etc. are all done with a clear sense of creativity, and I\'d say this more than makes up for it.Generally, I\'d describe the sound design to be rather similar to the animation. The music is of an acceptable standard, though it is interesting to note that both the usage of classical music and a leitmotif that sees frequent usage with several renditions. Beyond that, the voice acting and SFX are all just passable. Not much to write home about.The characters of Yamato are quite well presented, each with their own values, behaviours, and, well, character. Perhaps some viewers will find them lackluster in comparison to later titles such as Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop, but at the end of the day, they all stand on their own. Even the drunken doctor, who\'s really just there for the sake of humour, even he is a character you enjoy the presence of, there is nobody in the show you wish the author just never conceptualised.A shame I can\'t give a powerful and explosive conclusion like the real-life IJN, but I suppose there is no need to. Yamato is a quality sci-fi, and it has my seal of approval. It may be lagging behind other, more recent titles in some aspects, but it\'s no Metropolis, and any fan of sci-fi, or just military and action in general will not be disappointed.

I have a really deep love from the bottom of my heart for Yamato Anime and Manga.I am a soldier's boy who grew up in Military Lodgings until i was 13. When i was 9 or something, at one of these Military Lodgings, there was a Unripe Almond Tree, which the children including me called, The Yamato. We climbed on it, 4 boys and 1 girl and played Yamato most of the time when we were outside in Military Lodgings, playing. We would eat the unripe almonds on the branches of The Yamato on summer, it was our space battleship Yamato. We all...loved the Anime Space Battleship Yamato, so much.Those were really fun times which will never come back... I wonder if The Yamato is still alive, i hope they didn't cut it down. I would like to climb on it one last time and scream ''Yamato !!!'' ...one last time, before i die.I remember from one episode that Captain Okita once talked out loud to himself on the deck and explained to the young crew memeber, Susumu ''as you get old, you start to think out loud'' and that do happen ! , my father is 65, now and he started to think out loud... He Time to time says things without expecting any answer... And That Reminds me Okita all the time.Watching Yamato at an earlly age was a really Special Voyage. loved the Anime Space Battleship Yamato, so much.Those were really fun times which will never come back...

It was unique.Even though the art work was crude though it was  a sign of the early times and they made some blunders in it the concept of advanced physics they tried...to include made it a good science fiction story.Like I said I've watched it over different periods in my life.

Sora no Otoshimono: Tokeijikake no Angeloid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9790/Sora_no_Otoshimono__Tokeijikake_no_Angeloid,"[""Sora no Otoshimono is an incredibly remarkable series.  As an ecchi genre type show, it surpasses the vast majority of them in terms of almost everything imaginable.  Besides having a lot of fanservice, it is remarkable in terms of production quality, comedy, story, and character development. All in all it is a show that in spite of (or maybe because of) how ecchi it is, it manages to be solidly entertaining in every important way you can imagine.Two high quality seasons do the series justice, with a third as of now currently in the making. Generally, the way the series progresses is through...a mostly episodic format.  Each season would start by introducing characters, engaging them in comedic situations, and later expanding upon the story in detail.  The only problem with this format is that it is initially misleading for those who want to judge the series immediately upon watching a single episode, but as a whole the series is able to offer incredibly well-rounded entertainment as a result.Now one of the fundamental problems with this movie is the episodic nature of mixed comedy and drama lends itself to awkward execution for a standalone production that is meant to run for over 90 minutes. Sora no Otoshimono does not have a plot that is told continuously from start to end.  There are breaks in between action due to the comedic nature of the series, and story arcs are fairly brief. The brief nature of these story arcs isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for this movie it creates a situation where a lot of time is wasted simply trying to overextend the plot so that it fits in a 90 minute time window.The first 40 minutes of the movie go into the introduction of Hiyori Kazane, a character who was briefly seen late into the second season of the series.  Through flashbacks and reused footage of the previous two seasons, we see from her perspective how she has held constant romantic interest in Tomoki.  Understandably, this recap of previous events is somewhat helpful for viewers who have not seen the first two seasons. However, it also comes off as redundant as in each flashback from different episodes over the course of 40 minutes, essentially the same thing happens.  While Tomoki and his friends are up to some shenanigans, Hiyori is watching from the sidelines, narrating how she wants to have fun with Tomoki, but is scared to say anything to Tomoki or much less look him in the eye.As the character of focus in this movie, Hiyori proves to be a rather uninteresting character. She can be summed up as being a bad case of Yamato Nadeshiko, or in other words an ideal, soft spoken, and submissive Japanese woman. If there is anything entertaining about this personality, Hiyori's naivety around Tomoki's perverted schemes comes off as comedic, but as a character she exhibits very little development or enlightenment to strengthen any interest in her.The movie does have some good things going for it in spite of its glaring fundamental problems. The best part about this movie is that like the seasons before it, it maintains high production quality.  Animation for this show is top notch especially during the few high action scenes.  Voice acting for each of the familiar characters is appropriately executed. And even though Hiyori exhibits poor characterization and development, Hikasa Youko, who is probably known better for many strong-willed female roles, does an excellent job delivering her soft-spoken nature.All in all, Sora no Otoshimono, or at least the part of the story in this series that was chosen I do not feel lends itself to being able to support a full feature length movie by design.  While the series maintains a solid story, it does so in bits and pieces with comedy scattered in between, and it is not set up to normally maintain an extended plot arc. As such, most of the movie watching experience may feel largely like a waste of time when half the length of the feature is occupied by flashbacks involving reused footage with commentary from Hiyori. This production in this way fails to maintain what made the seasons before it so entertaining, by losing the ability to jump and flow readily from comedy to drama to maintain viewer interest.  The level of freshness and energy that the TV series could maintain for episode duration simply could not be accomplished for this movie.To be fair, the execution problems the movie has are not uncommon for a lot of movie adaptations for other popular series, due to the nature of movies picking up at a place somewhere in the middle of the story.  If you can accept that in your viewing experience, you can at least appreciate that this movie does have amazing production quality to redeem itself. a mostly episodic format.

Few minutes into the movie was a hilarious start. This movie does have ecchi element, but those ecchi moment is what made this series famous, no nudity but just panty and boobs. So feel safe to watch it if you are worrying about ecchi element.Story- 9I just can\'t stop grinning when the message pops up ""Have you guys forgot someone?"" (not 100%, but close enough translation). Then I burst into laughing as Tomoki leads the OP, a very funny OP that...is timed very accurate with the motion. After that we get to meet our new heroin Kazane Hiyori, there is a lot of blushes we see coming from Hiyori whenever she sees Tomoki. Despite the fact that the recap at the start was somewhat long, with some new additional scenes that Hiyori is in it, but I don\'t mind it it just felt nostalgic, got to see our characters again. Up to the point where Hiyori finally gather her courage to join the \'New World Discovery Club\' in order to get close to Tomoki, then the story start progressing.  Minutes of this movie goes by fast reaching to the point of where the climax of the movie begins. Comparing to the 2 seasons I think this movie have the power capture the emotional feelings of the audience. The story telling will jump from between Hiyori and Tomoki point of view. The pacing of the story has good not too fast nor slow, although you may feel a bit rushed when Hiyori\'s arc begins after those recaps, but is not true because the pace have been controlled well. Just like the two previous seasons the switching mood of the story has always been great, an instant click from funny moment to serious, serious to hilarious, hilarious to sad, so this is also a highlight of the story. There is some part in the manga of Hiyori\'s arc is not include in this movie, but nothing major all the important point are here.Art- 10The visual appeal are very pleasing, whether is the normal sized characters or the SD version characters both worked. One art work that i need to give credit to is the huge clock work design on Zeta\'s back. The details is amazing, all the clock mechanics was well displayed, overall look great. The battle visual effect is great too. The art is fantastic.Sound- 9Great to hear some new songs the funny OP, the insert songs, the ED song. As well as some old songs such as Tomoki\'s infamous solo song, plus \'Fallen Down\' by Ikaros. Such good music is never hurt to hear it again. The soundtrack is also good, some may be forgotten but once you hear you knew it was familiar.Character- 10I love it cast as funny as they can be. They are also lovable everyone of them. Hiyori as the new character has done well as being part of the New World Discovery club, as well as a very memorable character.Enjoyment- 10This movie have entertained me from start to finish. I enjoyed every second out of it, juicing the orange to it max. The story is emotional enough for me to feel for the characters, and funny enough to made me laugh every few minutes. Oh, just to let you know there is more after the credit. This movie is one of those better ecchi anime genre, and would recommend to give it a try.This movie I think is well worth the wait, and well worth a hour and 36 mins of my time. is timed very accurate with the motion.

I enjoyed this movie alot even though it's not its usual happy self.

First a sudden turn around happens to Tomoki that has never happened to him...before. Then a serious twist happens that caused me to go O Shit.

Its embarassing to admit it, but oh well, i am sure many of you will feel the same way.Sora no Otoshimono : Tokeijikake no Angeloid or in english Heaven's Lost Property the Movie: The Angeloid of Clockwork is the third sequel of Sora no Otoshimono series, So, if you havent watched the first season or the second season i recommend you to watch it first, well, it really doesnt matter since in this movie we have 40 minutes...of recap from the first season and the second season but we see it in Kayane point of view. Its good for all of you who have forgotten the plot.So, Lets get to the point.Q : Did i like this anime?A : Of course! you can see it from my score.Q : What this story about now in this movie?A : Its about Kayane Hiyori's arc. dont worry if you dont know who she is, while watching this,i bet you will know who she is.Q: Why do i like it?A : Its quite simple, if i would have a reason why i love this anime especially this movie was, they really mixed well between comedy, romance, and some tearjerker moments. I couldnt help to laugh and at the same time i crying too, and i have to clean up my tears from crying and hide it from my parents. But, my point, is the story itself was moving flawlessly, Well, i do admit it the 40 minutes of recap is kinda annoying for those who marathon this anime, but since it came to the movie, I think it was a good idea for making flashbacks. to make other viewers who maybe had forgot the story can remember it again.What makes this series was more special is of course the battle scenes, The art from the battle scene is the best appealing aside of the story, like the other two prequel, the quality of the art doesnt drop moreover, its increasing especially when the three angeloids (Ikarus, Nymph, Astrea) battle with the new angeloid (i am not gonna spoil it). It feels so realistic especially the weapon design of the new angeloid.And dont forget about the character itself, lets see we have a kuudere angeloid, Tsundere angeloid, clumsy angeloid, and our perverted main character. For the three angeloids, they still the same as the previous which is still love tomoki with their own way, Talking about Tomoki, I bet many of you were kinda annoying for having a perverted boy as our main character. Well, thats what i am afraid afor before i start watching this movie, but dont worry, in this movie we can see the good side of Tomoki aside of his perverted manners. Summary, its good to see the character doesnt really change.Q : Is there anything that i dont like?A : Particurally, there isnt. But for a people who marathon this series i would said the recap is a little bit annoying. Well, they had fill it with the Kayane role in it but still... 40 minutes of recap is kinda unlogical, It really wasting the time.

Most likely they're looking too deeply into it, and not just looking at in on a normal level, more rather, a English Literature level. The movie was terrible. Simple as that. but I'll break it down, just so you don't get a wrong Idea about it.Story: 6The story of this movie follows on from when Nymph, Ikoras and Astraea had defeated Chaos evolved. the first 40 minutes (give or take) is a recap of the previous two series of Sora No Otohimono (Heaven's Lost Property), of which the movie is a...sequel to. Not many people enjoyed it but I did, mainly because it showed a lot of the comedic parts and also because I enjoy the character, Nymph, a lot, and it showed a bit of recap on her. Even so I found it unnecessary. I'm not sure if anyone else does this, but as far as I am concerned, I never watch a movie that is sequel to a series, before actually watching the series, why would I? moving on, the storyline then starts to develop at a steady pace showing more of Hiyori and her experience with the Tomoki and friends. It mixed comedy with drama, and I enjoyed that, even though the transition was quite poor. The turning point for me was Hiyori's death. That's when the storyline really sucked. from Hiyori's death on, it was rushed. Simply as that, it's as clear as a bell (pun intended [Hiyori for those who don't pick up on it]). Obviously, they wanted this 'production' to only last 90 minutes, and that's where they lost their touch. I down graded them from a 8 or 9 to a 6 because the next 30 minutes made me want to cry, cry from pity of this movie. They destroyed a lot of anticipation from late season two (where Hiyori was introduced, and so was these 'capsules') all the way to Hiyori's death. They poorly told the purpose of the capsules, and only showed the obvious. (the Manga may have done the same, I do not know, I'm only stating what I have observed.) They should have got rid of the recap and allowed the storyline more space to grow. In regards to plot, the last 30 minutes went through all of the main structural point (Problem, Suspense, Climax and resolution) so fast and so confusingly, I really wanted to punch my laptop screen. I believe the producers and directors deserve to have had a pay cut on this 'production.' I feel sorry for Funimation for having very little to work with, but had no choice (well they did but, you know what I mean) to dub this because of the popularity of the previous two seasons. My disappointment is great. I would have given the storyline a 4 (harsh but if you've seen it and didn't watch it on an English literature level, you'd understand) but the first 60 minutes I did enjoy.Art: 7On a happier note, I love the artwork of this anime. The colours are bright and colourful, they easily manipulate your emotions because once a sad scenes appears, they'll dull the colours that it's a bit of a shock and a large transition that you also feel sad. This was not so much the case in the movie, but even so, the other aspects were still there and just as good. I love the chibi forms of all the characters are amazing, they supply such a comedic atmosphere. The clothing designs suit the characters a lot too, and I find a lot of them cute on Nymph. This may not seem so important to some people, but it's good to see a variety of clothing on character, makes them appear more interesting. also the scenic and angeloidic attacks artwork is amazing, I love them. The scenic may not be detailed sometimes, but they don't have to be detailed to look good.Sound: 7I didn't pay much attention to the sound, but the soundtrack is fairly good, and the sound effects of the angeloids are awesome.Character: 6Although 6 may sound harsh, when you think about it, this movie supplies very little character development of the original characters. Even when Nymph was about to brave up and confess her love to Tomoki, or Ikoras wanting to sacrifice herself with Hiyori (the second), it seemed so awkward and felt like it wasn't suppose to be there. They gave very little time to lead up to it and have a proper feel for the happenings. Hiyori is a bit of a boring character really. She's the typical quite-spoken, shy and kind girl. Although she braves it out in Tomoki's challenges, it doesn't say much about her personality because the purpose is to supply comedy of her doing such ridiculous things with her kind of personality. On the whole, I do enjoy that sort of character, but compared to the other's changing and different personalities (such as Nymph being a stuck up, superior-feeling, mean personality, to a more tsundere (kinda), fun, soapy-loving personality) she comes of as. Plain.Enjoyment: 6Overall: 6I'm putting them two together because the reason why is the same. I found the enjoyment and overall of this movie very disappointing. my anticipation had been destroyed with a poor Plot at the end, and a 40 minute recap. It was somewhat enjoyable, like I said before, but unnecessary all the same. In comparison to the previous seasons, this is just bad. I believe they should have cut down on the numerous and some of the time unnecessary comical relief episodes of both season one and two, and changed this movie in 3 or 4 episodes into the season, allowing a continuous and flowing transition from the storyline and also, giving the plot more time to develop and prosper. Very disappointing, and I'm sure I'm going to be just as disappointed with the next movie;  Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master. sequel to. Not many people enjoyed it but I did, mainly because it showed a lot of the comedic parts and also because I enjoy the character, Nymph, a lot, and it showed a bit of recap on her. Even so I found it unnecessary. I'm not sure if anyone else does this, but as far as I am concerned, I never watch a movie that is sequel to a series, before actually watching the series, why would I? moving on, the storyline then starts to develop at a steady pace showing more of Hiyori and her experience with the Tomoki and friends. It mixed comedy with drama, and I enjoyed that, even though the transition was quite poor. The turning point for me was Hiyori's death. That's when the storyline really sucked. from Hiyori's death on, it was rushed. Simply as that, it's as clear as a bell (pun intended [Hiyori for those who don't pick up on it]).

Have been following the manga ever since forte came out, and have been waiting for this movie FOREVER.However, this movie is a really really big troll and let down for me.I really don't mind the recap in the beginning. It capture some of the most epic moments in the previous series. Always enjoyable to watch them again and laugh at them.What I really didn't like though, is the fact that they put in so much recap that, (yes I am a quite strict manga follower), some of the...most epic moments during the hiyori arc is missed. Even more, those epic moments have been added onto the movie trailer waaaay long ago, so I was really expecting to see them being animated.Another thing I don't really like, is the fact that sora is supposed to be a very easy going, funny, enjoyable anime, but for some reason, the anime maker have to modify it to such a extent to force tragedy and bitter sweetness into it...

Typical Ecchi. The series did however have a deeper side to it with some darker plot and deeper emotions. This movie certainly had it's fair share of feels.The only thing that that I disliked about the movie is that the first 50 minutes was essentially a summary of the plot in the first two seasons. While it's important to have at least somewhat of a previous plot summary, this one took up almost half of the entire movie. It did...serve a purpose in introducing a new character, but it still would've worked for the plot as a whole if it had been shorter.All in all, it is definitely worth the watch if you're a SNO fan , and it's personally one of my favorite movies.

I thought that the makers were going to pull of the same thing, i.e give us ecchi and fanservice and forget about the plot. Absolutely not. This movie has done a great, no, perfect job of bringing the \'Sora no Otoshimo\' series back to masterpiece status.The opening is filled with comedy but that\'s about the only comedic part you\'re gonna get here. It\'s brief, it\'s funny - a great way to warm up the viewers. Now, the plot. So, this movie basically retells...the events of the first season and the second one from the viewpoint of... Hiyori Kazane. You might remember her from the second season and yes, she\'s the girl who was presumably sleeping in one of the synapse\'s tubes when Eishirou discovered her. She reminds me a bit of Shigure Asa from Shuffle!, especially with that hair ornament.At least three quarters of an hour, which is nearly half of the movie will be all about flashbacks and Hiyori\'s narrative as she tells the viewers about her time in Tomoko\'s school and how she watched him from the shadows...mhmm, my romance senses are tingling. Anyway, the movie goes on like this, slowly turning Sora no Otoshimono into a love pentagon, which doesn\'t bother me, mind you. But it does seem like there are way too many characters at this point who are into Tomoki. Either way, we have a lot of tension between the girls and Tomoki\'s female fanclub slowly decends into anarchy. Cliche, done a million times before but a great way to bring in more drama nevertheless. The plot of the movie then takes a tragic and dark detour and finally whacks you in the head with a tear-jerking ending. It is really dramatic.But the plot, ladies and gentlemen, the plot. The plot is starting to take shape, the big picture is slowly starting to come into view. This movie does a phenomenal job at tying up the lose ends of the 1st and 2nd seasons and now slowly we can start drawing our own conclusions. We\'re given more information, more flashbacks, more explanations... and within each scene this anime is slowly walking out of the supernatural genre to lodge itself comfortably in sci-fi. In fact at this point, there aren\'t many supernatural elements left because the overwhelming bulk of \'Sora no Otoshimono\' concepts are explained by science. As it was already mentioned in the 2nd season angeloids are actually \'made\' and their abilities and powers are literally programmed into them by their maker. It has also been mentioned by Ikaros and Nymph numerous times that angeloids have ""reactors"" (Nuclear!?) instead of hearts. Sci-fi much? Hell yeah and this movie takes that idea and gives you a little twist but to avoid spoiling the movie, I shall say no more.The visual effects were stunning to say the least, the fight scenes and the level of detail everywhere was jaw-dropping. Well-fricking-done. 10 points here straight away. Likewise the music and sounds have been extremely good but that\'s expected since they were of course taken from the previous (1st and 2nd) seasons.All in all, a very enjoyable movie and something that I was surely waiting for. The makers decided to focus on the plot and oh boy it makes \'Sora no Otoshimono\' a lot more enjoyable.

It only gets better.', ""Finally, after months of waiting, I've finally been able to watch the Heaven's Lost Property movie. All of the waiting was worth it, I promise you.It's been a while since I've seen a movie based off of an anime that actually had a good story to it. That's why I had high hopes for the Angeloid of Clockwork and the new Dragonball Z Movie that'll come out within the year. What every anime needs in order to be successful is a good story, and that's one of the reasons this movie is so good. I can tell you that I wasn't expecting a lot of...what went on. It had some good laughs, like all good comedies need, and a little romance, but I didn't expect the feels. Heaven's Lost Property doesn't seem to be the kind of anime to have many feels, so I wasn't expecting what happened in the show. That was a plus to watching the movie. However, I was a little confused in the beginning, because the first, oh, 1/3rd of the movie is a flashback of all the crap Tomoki has had to go through over the year, but from Hiori's perspective. After that it was all new stuff.As for the creators of Heaven's Lost Property, their art style is as good as always. Stunning visual effects, character art, and scenery is put together to end up with a beautiful movie.I have always been a fan of english dubbed animes because I don't have to read the subs. I'm not saying I hate subs, in fact I don't mind reading subs, but it's always easier to watch and listen instead of watch and read. However, when it comes to english dubbed animes, the voice acting is not always phenomenal. Luckily there was no need to worry, cause like the show, voice acting was superb. They had the original cast from the show play their characters again, which is good because no one likes it when the acting gets changed, plus some new actors and actresses. All of them nailed their roles and I enjoyed being able to laugh, cry, and watch without reading anything.Once again, all the characters come back in this show, even a few of the minor ones. Ikaros, Tomoki, and everyone else are doing what they normally do. HOWEVER, I was actually happy to see that even though Tomoki is still a pervert, they made it so he wasn't as big of a pervert as he is in the anime. Once in a while, I'm sure we all get sick of seeing him get beaten for peeping on girls, looking at dirty magazines, or just playing with panties, so it was kind of a relief to see that there was more to his character then just boobs, panties, and boobs. Then, there was a new character that came into the show, and I instantly felt the same love for her as I do Ikaros and Nymph. She fit right in with the show, and I really hope that when season 3 comes out she'll be in it.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was well worth the wait, and I will be anxiously waiting for Season 3 to air. Until then, I'm gonna have a hard time finding an anime that matches how good this movie was. what went on.

After waiting almost a year just to watch it, I have to say, it was pretty awesome.I loved how they did the OP. I also forgot about the little chick that Ikaros got at the festival lol. The recap was long, but I liked that part because it showed some of the best parts, plus from Kazane Hiyori's point of view, which I liked. After Hiyori decides to join the club, that's when everything starts progressing.The ending was unexpected because I thought it would have been...how the manga went, but I still loved it. Even though it was sad the Hiyori disappears, I kept on watching past the credits and what do you know, Hiyori starts to appear in the picture that Sohara took when they ate curry. I was somewhat amazed that she came back and to where Tomoki was, too.Overall, I loved this movie.

In fact, I’ve called it my favorite ecchi/harem anime. So with this movie, I expected to be in for quite a ride. Higher production values and an inclusive, long, exciting story, right?Nope. The movie starts with some original content then degrades into the ever popular recap. One third of the film is a recap of the television series told from the point of view of a character on the sideline who has never been named, but has been seen if only for a few seconds....The recap doesn’t really retell the story in any capacity, you can’t watch the movie and hope to learn what the series is truly about. Instead it seems to focus on the comedic portions more so than the story, which, to me, makes the recap useless. The only redeeming factor is we learn about Hiyori, who I guess is the main character of the movie. She’s in love with the perverted Tomoki (as is everyone apparently…I still don’t know why) and she watches him with his Angeloid friends, very jealous. But when she joins the New World Discovery Club in which all of Tomo’s friends participate, she winds up in a really bad situation despite being close to her crush.This is where the new content shows up, basically a forty minute OVA. And not a particularly good one. The main points of the plot include: Eishiro discovers more about the capsules in the Synapse, a new Angeloid shows up intent on killing Tomoki, and it’s understood that the Earth may, in fact, be part of some sort of virtual reality or computer program for the Angeloids to find peace.Truthfully, this movie is boring. The comedy is there for a little bit and funny, but ultimately dies down to about a half an hour of serious plot. While the main plot of the Synapse and Angeloids is interesting, the new Angeloid is not, and the ensuing fight isn’t as good as the one against Chaos in season two. Which means that a lot of the movie is depressingly slow and boring. There’s not a lot to see that is really worth sitting through ninety minutes. The only two things that really need to be seen are the continued exposition about the Synapse, and perhaps the continued development of Nymph. Otherwise, this is a stand-alone film that may have some impact on the third season, but a quick look at Wikipedia will be all you need to really appreciate the story any further.I hate to say that this film is not worth it, but it’s not. It doesn’t have any higher production values than the show, it doesn’t really add too much overall, and as far as the stand-alone plot goes, it’s none too exciting. It’s a lackluster and disappointing performance, especially for a fan of the show. The qualities that made me enjoy the series are pushed to the side and peek through only briefly, and the qualities of a very basic and uninspired episode of a harem/ecchi are made more prominent.I’m going to give this one a pass. Fans of the show will enjoy the additions to the plot and some further character development, but everyone who watches will be sorely disappointed.

The main points of the plot include: Eishiro discovers more about the capsules in the Synapse, a new Angeloid shows up intent on killing Tomoki, and it’s understood that the Earth may, in fact, be part of some sort of virtual reality or computer program for the Angeloids to find peace.Truthfully, this movie is boring. The comedy is there for a little bit and funny, but ultimately dies down to about a half an hour of serious plot. While the main plot of the Synapse and Angeloids is interesting, the new Angeloid is not, and the ensuing fight isn’t as good as the one against Chaos in season two. Which means that a lot of the movie is depressingly slow and boring. There’s not a lot to see that is really worth sitting through ninety minutes. The only two things that really need to be seen are the continued exposition about the Synapse, and perhaps the continued development of Nymph. Otherwise, this is a stand-alone film that may have some impact on the third season, but a quick look at Wikipedia will be all you need to really appreciate the story any further.I hate to say that this film is not worth it, but it’s not. It doesn’t have any higher production values than the show, it doesn’t really add too much overall, and as far as the stand-alone plot goes, it’s none too exciting. It’s a lackluster and disappointing performance, especially for a fan of the show. The qualities that made me enjoy the series are pushed to the side and peek through only briefly, and the qualities of a very basic and uninspired episode of a harem/ecchi are made more prominent.I’m going to give this one a pass. Fans of the show will enjoy the additions to the plot and some further character development, but everyone who watches will be sorely disappointed.', 'At first, I just thought this was going to be a recap movie with some added scenes, as most of these usually are. I was wrong. This movie actually has its own story while recapping some of the series as well, which is pretty impressive to say the least. I actually gave this movie a higher rating than both seasons of the anime because it was just that good to me. Obviously not perfect, but Needless to say, I enjoyed it alot.As the synopsis says, the story is an anime adaption of the Hiyori manga arc. I didn\'t read the manga so I didn\'t know...what to expect going into this. What I love is that the movie isn\'t filler, the story goes deeper into the lure of the angeloids and their world, while delivering an incredibly emotional story. The movie starts off with the usual weird antics of the show. If you watched both seasons you\'ll know what I mean. The story has a quick run in with Daedalous, and then the recap portion of the movie is narrated by Hiyori, the focus of the story itself. Instead of just coming off as a recap, we learn a bit about her character and her feelings. At the same time she\'s telling the story from her perspective, so you see scenes where she was added in to the background watching whatever is going on. The story starts off after the events of the second season, so it\'s not just a filler. The last half hour really picked up, that\'s what really did me in for giving this movie a 9. In an ecchi comedy, I never would have thought to have seen that much emotion in a sequence. The last portion of the movie really had me in the feels, infact the most emotion i\'ve felt watching the show all together. The relationship between Tomoki and Hiyori was done so well, and I genuinely felt sad at the end. Unfortunatly, some characters like Sohara and Mikako felt pushed aside and not involved in the story at all. This does make sense though, considering the story had to develop Hiyori and make us care about her. The chemistry was on point as ever, the dynamic between the characters (Hiyori and Tomoki in particular) was spot on and packed alot of emotion to the story. You just really got the sense that they were all friends. The action towards the end was great as well, short lived but executed well enough. The animation may not stand out, it wasn\'t as good as it was in season 2 but it wasn\'t a complete downgrade at all. The soundtrack worked well, nothing amazing but it was functional. I also enjoyed the fact that you learn a bit more about the angeloid ""sisters"" Ikaros, Nymph and Astrea..As well as their world in the sky. I do wish they dove into it a bit more, but the character drama involving Hiyori was certainly the strong point.I overall loved the movie just as I loved the anime. It didn\'t feel like filler at all, and came with plenty of action and compelling emotional moments in the end. It dove into the angeloid lure and backstory a bit more, and told a small recap of the story from a different perspective. If you\'re a fan of the show this is a must watch. Trust me on this, the movie is really. really good. It does of course have its flaws that I mentioned before, but otherwise it\'s a great watch.If you agreed give my review a thumbs up!

Thanks (:', 'THE MOVIE IS SUBBED BITCHES! Is it worth to watch it tho?  o_0Well I might be able to help you out with that decision with these 3 easy-ass steps! :DSTEP 1: AVOID THE SHIT RECAP!It takes up more than half the movie which sucks ASS! But nonetheless Skip to around 40:00 minutes. That is, unless you want to see commentary from Hiyori about how much she has fallen in love with Tomoki. And seeing somewhat through her perspective of Tomoki\'s ""peaceful life"". Other than that it is ALL recap about what happened in the 1st and 2nd season.STEP 2: DOWNLOAD IT OR SUFFER...CRAP QUALITY!Either download the movie for crisp clear sound and pic or deal with shit buffering (My speed is at 25MB so don\'t give me crap) on shit servers that are hosted on shit anime streaming sites. Most (if not all) streaming sites that I went to had Toaster Strudel quality. (I HATE Toaster Strudel) And the ones that did have crispy clear quality had video players that were programmed to give you a ""FUCK YOU BUDDY! You have to pay or wait 62 minutes to continue the rest of the video!"" Thankfully, I chose to download it (Google it) which made it a whole lot easier to watch. But if Google becomes a bitch and you can\'t find it due to copyright claims or some other gay crap, private message me and I MIGHT be able to help you out. ;DSTEP 3: DECIDE IF I HELPED YOU! :DThere is NO POINT in me organizing a huge list of complaints/compliments for you as your better off deciding what you think of it for yourself. It is exactly 2:21 A.M and I just finished the movie. I\'m tired as fuck but the movie kept me up as it was good enough to watch. It could have done better (A LOT BETTER) instead of having a stupid recap. But what was left of the movie was good enough to make me stop looking at my hentai and porn tabs. If you do end up heeding all of my advice then you\'ll probably feel how I felt.

It was the same character and art style, but felt like an entirely different show. It really did the manga no justice. It left too much out, and to be frank, was just plain lazy. It was an awful third season replacement. It makes me sad to think that the creators just gave up after how nice the first and second seasons were. Just absolutely terrible. Good storyline though. Just not enough detail to be put into the equivalent of 5 episodes. ', 'Tomoki is back to action!Yup everyone is expecting this anime since it made a great impact on the first 2 season. My expectation for this movies is high but some parts really ima really disappointed with.Story:As expected from sora no otoshimono series, the storyline is good ,started by around 37 minutes flashback. It recalls my memories on first 2 season. Afterall it was a good start. Then the story comes to the main track. The ending is quite unclear for me, its a bit like ""When someone shoot you, and you die ~The End"" something like that.The Presentation:The art and characters is almost the...same as the previous series,except hyori(new main character added). The sound/musics is little bit diffrent from the series,but its quite good but still cant beat the musics from the previous 2 season which made me can feel the sadness and moved to tears. The enjoyment is there,comes with some jokes and funny art,its really enjoyable. Overall its 9/10 from me, if they add extra time for the ending, then it will be 10/10.~Based on my perception.. same as the previous series,except hyori(new main character added).

Both seasons were amazing and, now, this... This was beautiful, made me cry...On Forte, a girl named Hiyori was briefly introduced, as she appeared talking about Tomoki to a friend of hers. Now, she becomes the main character, as a ""modded"" flashback takes the first half of this movie to recap the two seasons and show more about her.Shy, she is unable to confess her fellings to Tomoki, since she likes him. Hiyori tries to get his attention, walking with him and even joining the New World Discovery club to get closer....As the pervert he is, Tomoki doesn\'t get it and tries to make her give up, since he\'s now obligated to attend the club everyday because of her.Typical art from the anime series, a lot of ""chibi"" moments, tons of fanservice, comedy and an impressive final battle, followed by an emotive ending... A perfect combination that deserves a perfect rating!I\'m glad I had the chance to know this anime. It was amazing from the beginning and seeing that a possible sequel is coming up just makes me so happy and excited... This movie, as well as the anime series, is a ""must watch"", for sure!

Full of perverted antics by our main ""protagonist"" Tomoki, as well as a mystery behind the angeloids and the place they come from known as the Synapse.  For this movie, I personally expected the absolute best of Sora no otoshimono because I enjoyed the story itself and the ""good"" side of the main character.  Unfortunately, this movie didn\'t match up.Story: The story of Sora no otoshimono: Tokeijikake no Angeloid has a very interesting premise, involving a new girl in the series and putting her on the main front, named Hiyori Kazane....As a shy girl, she has fallen in love with Tomoki (big surprise), and attempts to get near to him as the story goes along.  While the premise is good, the execution...wasn\'t.  I\'ll explain.  While the story itself has a good idea, half the movie involved a recap of the Sora no otoshimono anime series, (the original and forte), making someone who\'s watched it, like me, a bit dissatisfied.  They also do some sort of trolling where they implement her into old scenes, almost like a middle finger saying ""here she is!  Remember her because she\'s important!""  As for the other half, the story becomes rather rushed and comes to a conclusion that almost comes...too fast.Characters: The characters in this movie are basically the same ones in the anime series.  None of them other then Tomoki and Hiyori have too much of a role.  The story of this movie is centered around these 2 and improves their relationship, as short-lived as it was.  This idea in the story was a good plot point and deserves much praise.Art and sound: The art in this anime is wonderful as always, putting as much detail as they can into the angeloids\' designs and making them truly as creatures of the heavens.  However, I can\'t help but think that the creators got lazy due to how much they recycled old scenes rather then making new ones as any anime movie does.  The sound wasn\'t too good and not really as catchy or interesting.Personal enjoyment: This movie has its ups and downs with its pacing and recycled scenes.  However, this movie does have things which, I\'m pleased about.  For starters, the fanservice can be said to be a minimum for where this movie comes from.  Almost like the creators thought, ""Why don\'t we focus on the plot rather then fanservice?"" Whoever thought of that, THANK YOU!  Anyway, the movie also does a great job at showing which characters are the center and helps with the progression.  It also creates a hint at the movie\'s end, hopefully following the correct storyline in the anime\'s 3rd season.  Though I do like the anime quite a bit, this movie did sort of downplay its credibility with a rushed plot.  Though due to time constraints, I can\'t really complain too much.  To put it short, I like this movie, but it could be better. As a shy girl, she has fallen in love with Tomoki (big surprise), and attempts to get near to him as the story goes along.

"", 'Sora no Otoshimono is something of an anomaly. When you see ""ecchi"" attached to any anime details, the thoughts that generally come to mind are an unimpressive story, average art and animation at best, woefully generic characters, and completely ridiculous and forced fan service. Yet Heaven\'s Lost Property miraculously transcends those stereotypes...well, except the fan service; it\'s got loads of that, more so than most other ecchi titles. But it\'s the shows ability to contain that much ecchi yet still achieve greatness in all those other areas that makes it so impressive. As you can assume, I had high hopes for this movie, hopes that...are mostly shot down unfortunately.The plot here is decent enough; Hiyori, a girl you see only once during the second season is revealed as having feelings for Tomoki. In an attempt to earn his love, she decides to join the New Continent Discovery Club. Despite his initial reluctance to accept her in the club, she eventually wins him over, but their friendship is abruptly ended as a result of a tragic secret she holds. Now that\'s good and all, but the issue is that this plot formulates far too late into the movie. Nearly half the runtime is wasted as a vehicle for development of Hiyori\'s character, and regrettably, this is done by means of what is basically a recap episode. Footage from throughout the series is cut and pasted into the movie, with generally only a few seconds of new footage of Hiyori spying on Tomoki thrown in. It\'s obvious what they were going for, but wasting away 40 minutes of a movie to achieve what five minutes could just feels lazy. As a result, when the fresh material finally starts it feels rushed. Even so, when you do get to the meat of the story, it\'s still rather good albeit gone far too soon.As far as the art goes, it has the same impressive quality as the series. And once again the best displays come out during the battle scenes. Honestly, there really isn\'t much to be said here other than they\'re extremely well done throughout. In the audio department, it\'s a similar case. As in the seasons, VA is excellent (referring to English dub), while everything else just does its job; nothing more really.Concerning the characters, development is confined basically to Hiyori alone. Honestly, that\'s fine by me; the movie is a continuation from the events that unfolded after the second series, so at this point you\'ll likely be familiar with all the others. If you\'re new to the show and this is your first time watching, the recap nature of the first half of the movie may actually prove useful as it does a passable job in familiarizing you with the characters. Unfortunately, that also works against Hiyori\'s character. Similarly to the story, her back story feels rushed, though what she eventually becomes is one of my favorite characters in the series.In the end the movie isn\'t bad, but it isn\'t great either. It squandered the potential it had due to a poor method of character development. Still, if you\'re a fan of the series, you\'ll definitely want to see it as it advances the plot, and if you\'re not, the great art and top-notch humor are two huge reasons to check it out. are mostly shot down unfortunately.The plot here is decent enough; Hiyori, a girl you see only once during the second season is revealed as having feelings for Tomoki.

It sounds like it belongs in Doom or Diablo or something. I can\'t believe I never noticed how good it was the first time I saw this movie.Now the first time I saw this movie, my opinion was rather sour, because 1/3rd of it is essentially recapping the whole series, followed by the actual story. Maybe because I\'ve read the manga, but now...that I watch it again, I really think this movie is pretty damn good.The recapping is done in a pretty brilliant way. Instead of blandly reusing animation, and replaying the same thing over again, they chose to go a different route.

It is very different from the previous seasons in that it takes a completely different approach to story telling. While the previous seasons were slow being focused mostly around humor and not having much direction outside of key moments, here it...feels like the film has a clear story to tell from the beginning and everything it shows is focused around that. This focus is centered around\xa0Hiyori\xa0Kazane, a girl that was lightly alluded to in the first season, but becomes the main character here. The film starts off with essentially a recap of the first two seasons, but from Hiyori\xa0Kazane's point of view. This was somewhat awkward at times, in that it went back and forth from scenes from the first season, where animation and art quality were noticeably worse, to new content for the film, which was the best the series has ever been. Still, it was a nice journey through everything that had happened so far, and being from Hiyori's perspective was a good way to get immediately invested in her. This was easy enough, because\xa0Hiyori is an amazing character that is all around tremendously likable and frankly difficult not to get invested in. This builds up to her joining the New World Discovery Club, and all sorts of hijinks and such play out, where the comedy is less jarring and flows better than previous seasons, but that continue to build Hiyori up as a great character that everyone else also gets along with. It is at this point that the plot gets really intense. Overarching mysteries that had been there from the start begin to unravel. The stakes are raised tremendously. And there's an ending that is tremendously emotional and impactful. Now that sort of gets diminished by the after credits scene, but from what I understand they needed to do that to stay consistent with the manga. Still, that's fine and doesn't change that how they\xa0 executed everything before that tremendously well.The music was solid, with the songs being good and used well, with the cut to credits working really well, and the repeat of Fallen Down being pretty nostalgic.

Now that sort of gets diminished by the after credits scene, but from what I understand they needed to do that to stay consistent with the manga. Still, that's fine and doesn't change that how they\xa0 executed everything before that tremendously well.The music was solid, with the songs being good and used well, with the cut to credits working really well, and the repeat of Fallen Down being pretty nostalgic. The art and animation were really good here and as always I still like the art style."", ""If you thought this was a comedy, I'd prefer to think of it as a tragedy. A really sad one. Kazane was just a school girl who loved to work with plants and crops, growin delicious vegetables. It's heart breaking to see her death as a little innocent girl who showed her love for Tomoki. I teared up....Before u watch this, I highly recommend u watch the first two seasons of this anime so u better understand this movie. Try not to read the wiki or manga beforehand, it will ruin the purpose of this movie. Also, the movie contains really little ecchi. The only...thing ecchi-like was showing panties. Other than that, it's entertaining, funny, tragic, and entertaining. It makes me want Kazane more than any other Angeloid. I'm sad nowStory-9Really good. And really sad at the end ): its basically retelling the two seasons of heavens lost property, only that it includes Kazane'a perspective. And then it leads to the main conflict and and new story develops from there. I'll say one thing, I hate, I absolutely hate the master of synapse.Art-9Angeloids are well designed. Great armor, weapons and effects. Kazane is beautiful too (: she's just my type of girl. Petite, semi long green hair, and two bells with a robe tied to one of her bangs. And also when she became the modified type zeta Angeloid. Massive gears behind her that form a large circle ring, resembling the inner part of a clock. Of course, it fits the name: Angeloid of clockworkSound-9I haven't paid too much attention to the music because I was so captivated by the movie. The music just adds along with the feelings and emotions, so It's great work anyway (: they also made a theme song for Kazane, which I find pretty sweet. Sorry, I am biased towards KazaneCharacter-10Kazane couldn't be a better girl. She's petite, friendly, beautiful, sweet, nice, caring, hard working, and compassionate. I really want to marry her, and I would do anything for her. Seeing that type of girl really breaks my heart because I doubt there will ever be another girl like her. Despite all this, the angeloids have a sense of humor and feelings themselves. They care for Tomoki when they realize he just started having feelings for Kazane. I like that they are not overly jealous, and I like that they all want to save Kazane just as much as Tomoki does.It's enjoying to watch. It's fun, entertaining, and heart breaking. I would definitely recommend this to whoever is a romance fan. I'm happy they made a movie like this. Would love to watch again thing ecchi-like was showing panties.
