Precure All Stars Movie New Stage 3: Eien no Tomodachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21031/Precure_All_Stars_Movie_New_Stage_3__Eien_no_Tomodachi,"['It\'s your standard All Stars movie. I immensely enjoyed the combat scenes. I\'m glad that some of the older Cures got speaking lines since in New Stage 1 they didn\'t talk at all. It was a good introduction to the Happiness Charge gals.The 3d ending was very pleasing to the eye too. My only real issue was pacing. It was just ""Precure defeat monster, monster powers up, repeat"" until we got past the 1 hour mark. The Nightmares were also very funny looking and I couldn\'t really take them seriously at all. In the DX installments, the villains were actually scary with Fusion, Bottom and...Black Hole.These were just raging neon teddy bears. But, overall, very fun movie.

Meng Qi Shi Shen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37618/Meng_Qi_Shi_Shen,"['The budget put into animation quality and graphical quality is pretty self explanatory, too bad the source material holds the art back. Its a rather straightforward work overall, you can see hints of its origins as a wuxia/xianxia if you\'re familiar with the genre, but the worst the original work was removed.Art & Sound 8/10The food and cooking is fantastic, with appropriate musical accompaniment. My only complaint is that there isn\'t enough of it. They barely manage a cooking scene an episode and its really the only reason to watch this anime.Writing 2/10Really just nothing much in the writing at all. The first arc is...an episodic isekai standard of getting to know the world, with a pretty unappealing romantic plot including multiple scenes of the heroine going ""wow i really like this handsome guy"" as he straight up threatens her. Its made more ridiculous when she actually has more chemistry with a character introduced in the second arc of the season (not that that\'s much of a romance either, its a low bar). The second arc sort of implies some dramatic plot points will be brought up but it goes no where as does the rest of the plot.The biggest issue is that there\'s no feeling of conflict, which is most likely because the original source material just lacked anything substantial.The first arc is never really explained properly, the conflict ending up pretty much just being a background detail.The second arc lacks any significant conflict (which is what i feel the series should have just been from the start, just an episodic cooking adventure).There\'s the overarcing drama, which is resolved unceremoniously with the sudden appearance of some goons, to generate a damsel in distress rescue.And there are 2 instances of cooking competition where they barely pretend that the heroine will lose.Overall its not like it isn\'t enjoyable, its easy to ignore the lack of any significant writing if you\'re just in it for the food scenes. There are some rather unfortunate stereotypical issues around playing character sexual orientation for comedy towards the end, which isn\'t great. Its a good effort on part of the production company and director for improving on what i would have considered an unsalvageable property. an episodic isekai standard of getting to know the world, with a pretty unappealing romantic plot including multiple scenes of the heroine going ""wow i really like this handsome guy"" as he straight up threatens her.

Story revolved around the daily struggle after waking up in medieval China.Story had it's plot twistRomance element had it quite touchy.Culinary and shokugeki will help anyone to wait for other cooking anime to get new seasonIn other word this anime is quite a time killNegative side:|...story writing could be a little bit strongAnd to be honest just by wearing male dress ,everyone is treating someone as male ..was medieval that dumb !!! didn't she also has a feminine voicelast but not the least ,Overall this is a pretty good animeJust give it a time to show color. story writing could be a little bit strongAnd to be honest just by wearing male dress ,everyone is treating someone as male ..was medieval that dumb !!! didn't she also has a feminine voicelast but not the least ,Overall this is a pretty good animeJust give it a time to show color."", ""The anime is very visually appealing and though the plot is kinda loose in its direction, it holds itself up pretty well between the character's interactions. Its premise is pretty simple, but I think it has enough interesting elements to make it worth a watch.  And though I'm not that into cooking anime, I found this one appealing enough to get through since, again, the characters interactions are really what does it for me. Most of the characters are a bit flat since most of the characterization focuses only on a 2-3 core characters, but that was really all the story needed to keep...the plot moving.Overall, it's a nice medieval slice of life with a few moments of high tension. I do hope for it to get renewed for a second season, but even if it doesn't, it's a nice show to casually watch, especially with such a charming opening song. the plot moving.Overall, it's a nice medieval slice of life with a few moments of high tension.

The studio tried to do a lot in 12 episodes and this left the series with an under-developed romance and plot points that are introduced but never followed up on. The studio had to gloss over the relationship build-up, but they provided enough material to compel me to keep watching. I wish they had time to explore the male lead's side of the story, which would've explored more of the action/drama aspects of the plot.Considering the short series length, I still thought they did a good job...balancing the genres and delivering a story that made me want more. The plot had a lot of potential and I only wish they had more episodes to work with.ART: 8/10I actually really like the art style. Also, the backgrounds and the food look amazing (food looks on par with Food Wars). While Food Wars' food reactions are more silly, I find the food reactions in Meng Qi Shi Shen beautifully metaphoric and calming, especially as the series goes on.The animation is not as smooth compared to mainstream anime, but it was good enough. Action scenes were still impressive enough and the cooking scenes were drool-worthy. I could live without all the repetitive Sailor Moon-like sequences of the female lead preparing to cook though.SOUND: 9/10I enjoyed the voice acting and the music and sound effects definitely enhanced my experience. Appropriate music was played for different moods, whether that was action, humor, or romance. I'm a sucker for historical anime/donghua music and Meng Qi Shi Shen's OST didn't disappoint.CHARACTER: 9/10This was a fun cast and I definitely enjoyed the character interactions throughout the series. Everyone was likable in their own ways.The female lead's cheerful personality is infectious. I admire her passion for food being a foodie myself and I love that she can take care of herself. She's not the damsel in distress, but she isn't the overtly strong female archetype either, which makes her more realistic to me. The male lead is stoic, but also compassionate and honorable. Some of their interactions are really cliche in the beginning, but thankfully that died down as the series progressed. After that, I felt like their relationship was believable and really sweet. :)ENJOYMENT: 9/10Despite some gripes about plot and romance development, I thought the overall execution was quite good given the short series length. I adored the cast and the animation and music was great. The series concluded with a lot of things left unanswered, but at least the romance and food plot ended on a satisfying and hopeful note. It was a fun ride and if there was a season 2, I would love to see it. balancing the genres and delivering a story that made me want more.

In there She must survive war and others. Then She found a good man which is fallen in love with Her. The only one that She can do is cook. Almost all of the episodes are about cooking, so you're gonna watch a lot of food that has been cooked by Her.Art (9)The art of this anime is very good. I love the cooking and battle scene that they were using to make this anime. Not only...that, but the food art they make are very nice and vibrant. It makes me want to cook something like that.Sound (8)All the sounds they used are very good and adjusted to the animation.Character (8)The main character is very memorable along with the supporter, especially the MC woman.Enjoyment (8)It's enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.

Because what isn't said in the description is that Meng Qi Shi Shen is in the same time a Comedy, a Drama, a Shoujo, a Gastronomy and an Isekaï anime :)Sounds rather odd, doesn’t it? I was quite puzzled at first, but I must admit I’ve had a very good time watching all the episodes in one go (and rewatching it a few months later) !What is all about? The...MC is an exceptional cook who dies (cooking of course), and reincarnates in the body of a girl from imperial China. So far, not very original, you might think… Yes, true, and the first episode cumulates many clichés of the genre… But as the story continues, the MC has to struggle in order to survive in this dangerous era. She is not skilled in combat, and has only one strength: her divine ability for cooking and her knowledge of Chinese cooking.Well and that’s all for the Isekai part… Following the recipe, you add a pinch of Shoujo + Romance with two – very stereotyped but still enjoyable – characters, several Chinese typical dishes, and some fun scenes including rainbow vomit and the MC’s power-rangers style transformation every time she starts cooking, and you get this very unusual and spicy anime (tipically from Sichuan, 这真的是麻辣菜).No pretention, quite short and complete (I don’t think there will be a second season), art and animation are very good and fluid (especially for Chinese anime which do not usually shine by their high artistic quality).The dishes look so yummy, and I can tell after living in China for months,  very typical, and you will soon crave for Chinese food.As I said before, the rhythm is good (you do not get bored for a second and I watched all in a row without really paying attention to the time). Maybe the only negative aspect would be the coup d’état of Gastronomy + Comedy genre in the few last episodes to the detriment of the main plot, but it really doesn’t matter.Ok if you’re still there, maybe I managed to raise your curiosity, if you have decided to watch this anime it is likely you’ll be pleasantly surprised, I personnally consider this anime to be a hidden gem and after having seen it 3/4 times I decided to add it to my favorites.

Our MC awakes in historic China. But she has amazing cooking talents. Being from the future and also being very knowledgeable of traditional dishes. She is able to wow the people of the time with her food. Which is believable think Dr. stone and his ramen being seen as Godly to a more primitive set of people.Its a great kick back for anyone suffering withdrawal from Soma or just...hungry.Its fun. I would of personally liked more of the first arc and some relationship building. As I originally was in the mood for romance, We get a few episodes in the middle where our leads don't even see each other. And their experiences are almost padded out with very quick flash backs. I feel like the two leads could have developed more.The main focus of the anime at its heart really is food. All the dishes are real life dishes which can be found in any China town. Which makes this more fun, the art style is great the food looks like its real life counter part.Although the anime feels like two different halves. with a unrelated filler chunk in the middle. The first half being more action packed, you can find some pretty nifty fight sequences here. The second half dragged a little for me. The pacing of both is very different. At times things felt rushed... but also in the latter half they felt dragged out.But this may just be the anime studio wasn't expecting to make a sequel. And as of yet it hasn't.The food aspect remains strong till the end.The art style is fun. Hearing the Chinese after years of Japanese can be a little jarring. But this anime is fun. Its comic and has some great moments.I would recommend it as a time killer. hungry.Its fun. I would of personally liked more of the first arc and some relationship building.

As a female, it can be tough to find a romance with good balance and that lacks the typical harem tropes / continuous misunderstandings etc. It gets tiring.This is the first Chinese anime I've finished too! Super brief summary: good chef gets isekaid to historical china, forced to marry a bandit leader (?), but stuff happens.STORYThe story is pretty lack luster, and is void of any notable conflict. There's some fighting scenes which I actually really enjoyed and were animated very well, I wish...there was more of them honestly! I didn't mind the pacing, but it quickly became more slice of life-ish as the show went on. This was a little strange, because the main conflict seemed tense and I was interested, but it was quickly dropped and it just became a slice of life.I got pretty lost during the first arc, I had no idea why people were fighting and who was in power etc. Kinda lost me there.The romance is pretty surface level, and the characters don't really get a chance to get to know each other. There isn't much progression by the end of it, but I'm hoping for more in the next season. I did really enjoy the scenes of them together though, some are definitely swoon worthy c:CHARACTERSI liked the character designs of the main characters, they're very visually appealing! It was refreshing to not have a dull main character (appearance wise) many romance animes with a female lead tend to put more attention on the surrounding men versus the MC. That being said, no one is fleshed out at all. By the end of this season, we really don't know much about any of the characters. Aside from that MC is a good cook.This show took a long time to begin introducing new characters. Second male isn't introduced until halfway into the show, that was different for me.Hoping that the second season will flesh out these characters more and maybe add some notable ones.ART/SOUNDThe art and animation is FANTASTIC. One of the best I've seen in a long time, it really does a great job transporting you to historical China. Super pretty scenes and the cooking was well done too. The background music is forgettable, BUT the OP is cute and catchy.Overall, I WOULD recommend this show to anyone craving a good romance. Like I said, it doesn't progress a ton but still has a lot of good scenes. I'm sure it will only get better in season 2! there was more of them honestly!

The main girl basically gets sent to another world, spends a short time falling for a handsome man, then they are torn apart by circumstances and the man spends his time trying to find her...through her cooking - hence the title Cinderella chef.The idea of this anime is really sweet and considering how much of the story they tried to squeeze into just 12 episodes, i feel pretty happy with it by the end. All of the characters are pretty likeable and there is some comedy here and there to lighten the otherwise pretty dramatic mood.It's a shame...they didn't make this into a longer series, as the story had a lot of potential. I definitely recommend it for anyone in the mood for a light-hearted, escapist rom com, after all the story and characters have got me reading the manga for more :) they didn't make this into a longer series, as the story had a lot of potential.

Feels like its trying to take the common chinese anime genre of modern girl reincarnated/transported to distant china and make the focus more food over martial arts and stuff.First off I just wanna mention the food flashback moments. Where similar to food wars, occasionally they have the food flashback scenes, where usually in food wars youd call these foodgasms here they are usually just super toned down flashbacks, and while they can be interesting and plotwise I think they use them kinda well, they can drag sometimes and feel a bit flat especially when compared to the food wars versions.Besides that...however, its a pretty entertaining show, with a slight downtick in fighting compared to its contemporaries, and a huuuge uptick in cooking as one would hope.Food looks and sounds delicious, definitely leaves me wanting to cook something for myself. however, its a pretty entertaining show, with a slight downtick in fighting compared to its contemporaries, and a huuuge uptick in cooking as one would hope.Food looks and sounds delicious, definitely leaves me wanting to cook something for myself.', ""Stockholm syndrome the anime.Girl gets isekai'd upon dying from her own cooking, finds herself in a body much like her own in ancient China, proceeds to be kidnapped then just starts cooking (you know, after she died from her own cooking, let's just brush that away)This anime should be above average, while I'm certainly not the target audience for the tropes I can still accept that this should be above average. . . but the girl got kidnapped and was practically making token resistance towards her captors. Since this is romance, I bet she ends up with one of them too.Again, story beats are...not for me, but I hate the fact that this girl didn't fight, poison everyone in the camp, they're practically bandits and they allowed her to handle the food.

The story is lacking in material and the characters don't really develope. The anime starts out as if will be story-driven but then becomes only about food. There are a few character relationships fleshed out, but even then they are... kinda empty. I thought there would be more story to the arranged marriage. the family selling her to the bandits, more conflict with the bandits and the two MC being on the run or something. But nope. The Chunyu is well taken care of. He is a fully flawed character but seems to...be written that way. I'm also trying to figure out why Jinxuan needs to pretend to be a guy. Maybe when she was traveling alone, for protection, but I'm sure the kid would have understood. There doesn't seem to be an issue of females in charge or who work. Also also... Chunyu says it was all an act, technically he's correct. He wasn't part of the bandits, and thus wouldn't have a wife. Especially if he is a Nobel, he would probably find someone or be matched. She made it an issue because he is attractive and that's enough for her to like him. He had done nothing for her to develop feelings--- if you analyze this anime it kinda sucks.

The animation is also gorgeous and full of life. It 100% will make you watchers hungry too! The story is pretty mediocre, some twists in some parts, but it's still adorable. I'm recommending this to people who are confused of what to watch next, but aren't ready to consume heavy themes or plotless storylines. It's literally the in between.It's an isekai, to put it shortly. Despite being predictable, it's still very...enjoyable since the theme is food. The animation... no words. BEAUTIFUL. Especially when they started to cook, it truly is an amazing visual experience. Putting chibi animations once in a while was really a great addition to this donghua, it makes it super fun to watch.The art style really aligns with the story since it's about food, it has to make the viewers hungry. The cooking scenes were great. The colors, the sound, the lighting, it was really mesmerising.When talking about slice of life-ish media, this donghua didn't give much depth into the characters. It's only the first season so let's hope that they would add more depth into these characters.

But every thing about this could be done a bit better.The story is filled with leaps of logic, where the MC gets access to cooking in ways that are totally implausible. She's has no money or resources, and somehow always can just waltz into a fully stocked kitchen and do her magic, for reasons. It throws in silly humor to skip some explanation of some other unlikely happenstances, but the tone feels very fragmented, with silly...BS happening at one moment, and serious trauma the next. Nevertheless, if you accept the logic, the story works at larger scale. There's no exposition, which is nice, but sometimes there's a short time skip between scenes and we are wondering how did she manage to get there?The animation is mixed. The staging of scenes is good, and the backgrounds and characters look fine, but it gets pretty choppy at times, with more complex scenes as still frames. The frame rate holds back the otherwise good fight choreography. Some attention is put to food scenes, which look good, though not as good as shokugeki.The way the MC acts doesn't seem natural for someone in her situation. Relationships happen too fast, without enough development.That said, it's not all bad, especially if you like food. You get to see an interesting main character overcome obstacles in unusual ways, with a satisfying sense of power whenever she enters the kitchen.

This time Hina want to talk about this OVA~OK, enough about being a preschool kid, time to get going...This OVA serve as a sequel to the main story-line of the anime, so I assume that everybody who want to watch this OVA already completed the anime (and it's sequel special).This OVA is divided into 3 smaller parts where each part focuses on each one of the three sisters (Sora, Miu and Hina respectively). Story-wise, it was quite good, cute and enjoying as we can see more to what happen to the characters after moving back to their old house.The first part revolves...around Sora and Raika, also the introduction of a new character, Shiori, that actually appeared much later in the light novel but never been introduced before in the anime. The second part is about Miu and Shiori which revolves around cosplay and some fanservices. Finally, the last part has the most heart touching and heartwarming moments in this OVA as it involves Hina and her adventures~About the art, sound, character and all that stuff, there's not much difference compared to the main anime. In fact, they didn't even bother to change the OP and ED song at all (which is the best).Overall, this OVA is not bad as a sequel if you truly like the anime.

It was great and after watching it I was like ""eh what? it\'s end? just like that?"". It was truly bad that anime just ended without anything and we were left with nothing but that uncertain feeling if girls were alright. We all knew how they were struggling and how hard it was for them. Happily enough, that OVA is sequel to main series.I was truly overjoyed watching it, however it should be divided by two in my opinion. First one would...stay OVA and second should be a movie.First episode threw us into their old home with new character and left us without a word of explanation. How they ended up in their old home? What happened with Yuuta\'s apartment? They were so many unanswered questions and this part of OVA was mostly ecchi... until very last part - Hina\'s part where I was truly touched by her actions. Hina ran away from home! It was surprising and I wasn\'t certain what to think about it, however I loved how it ended. It was nice part of anime and could stay as OVA.Second episode was special. It\'s something that should be animated as a Movie instead of OVA. There was a time skip 4 years into future. It was certain that characters developed well however a lot of story was missing and there was huge gap between what we seen and what we should see.I think that spectator shouldn\'t lose important events even if he can understand what\'s going on after overlooking them. I felt uncertain about this time skip and then... a wedding? It was told that they struggled a lot and decided to get married. There was huge gap between what we knew and what OVA was about. It\'s their life but we were watching over them from the beginning and I would love to watch over them until the very end. A movie would show us how they decided about marriage and what happened that they made their mind. Nice ending to it would be wedding itself.""It\'s been four years since that day. [...] I bet they\'ve really changed! [...] This is our only chance, remember? And they only gave us one day to do it"". The only chance that girls\' parents got to see their children after 4 years of being in heaven.I was feeling truly overjoyed and sad watching that. I felt like their parents that had to leave them without telling a word and came back to see if they are alright. I wanted to ask them about many thing but I wasn\'t able to. I wanted to check them and ask if all is fine but I wasn\'t able to. I was truly overjoyed that they matured a lot and they all became true family.I think that second episode could have a movie instead of OVA and it would be much better however, I would sincerely recommend this anime (anime + OVAs) to everyone.In summary:First episode was mediocre but second was amazing. I would never imagine that I will miss not my own kids and I will be missing them...Characters 10/10Characters were clearly outstanding and they developed truly well. They changed a lot from beginning of series and I loved these changes. I was surprised how girls matured, not only girls. Yuuta matured too. Characters were changing all time, it was just like in real life. Little events changed them a bit by bit. They had great times, time that they felt depressed and they were still doing their best and times that they regretted what they did. They were acting just like normal people, not dolls or fictional characters.Story 9/10I have loved main story and the stories in OVAs were truly suitable. It was proper sequel but that time skip messed a lot and made huge gap between us and characters. Surprising thing was that this gap was kinda filled up during last episode and I was sincerely moved by what happened. I would give 10/10 if that gap wasn\'t created and I would be able to watch whole story.Art 7/10It was nothing special and I can\'t say a lot about it.Overall: 9/10 stay OVA and second should be a movie.First episode threw us into their old home with new character and left us without a word of explanation.

If you want to get closure from the original season this is the perfect episode to do it.Story: 9The episode I wish all Romantic Anime's had. To tie the knot and show the 10 years later kind of thing. Or...in this case 4 years. The plot kind of starts off where it left off from the main season. I like the story of this because of the before mentioned closure.Art: 8Same art as before. Only released in 720p or something. From my experience it looks a little bit more fuzzy than before. Technical aside, the emotions and everything of that sort are drawn to make you feel them, which is why i liked the art.Sound: 8The opening and ending are both squished at the end for the second OVA. I believe the opening has slightly different animation with the same song. I enjoyed the opening more than the ending but that is my opinion. With that being said, that doesn't mean both aren't enjoyable.Character: 9Ah yes, the characters. Since they have grown up 4 years their personalities have changed a little bit. More so in the case of Sora. Miu is still her weird self, still teasing and making fun of sora. Hina acts more mature but pretty much still has the playful attitude. Yuuta is more mature and has excelled as a parent for the 3 girls. I enjoyed the character design in these episode because of the development shown from growing up.Enjoyment: 10Pertaining to OVA 1: To be honest, I enjoy fan service. So there is no reason to not like it you are the same as me. The third story however was nice but wasn't super exhilarating.OVA 2: The whole reason I'm writing this review. I LOVE it when shows wrap up, in the way of either: marriage,  confessions, or some other significant event to show that two (or more people in some cases) will be together forever. This OVA does just that, which is why I enjoyed it so much.Overall: 9OVA 1: 8 , because of the fact that not much was accomplished besides getting your rocks off a bit.OVA 2: 10, conclusions are awesome and it feels nice to know that things are going to be all right and that the efforts of the main heroine or the male counterpart were not wasted.All in all both were nice and were very enjoyable.*In the case of finding these Rori is the only one with OVA 1 on nyaa, and Doutei has OVA 2 on nyaa.* in this case 4 years.

Pokemon Movie 08: Mew to Hadou no Yuusha Lucario,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1526/Pokemon_Movie_08__Mew_to_Hadou_no_Yuusha_Lucario,"['After so many years and whatnot, most fans would think that eventually the Pokemon movies would lose their charm that the first few gave. I was starting to believe that myself.What made Lucario and the Mystery of Mew so appealing was that instead of just showing a legendary pokemon and making it more epic than it really needs to be, this Pokemon movie took a step backwards and just didn\'t use a legendary pokemon as a main character (Mew seemed more as a side character) but Lucario was also close to the old atmosphere that made the older movies so great.The very first scene shows...a raging two-sided war. That alone drew me in for I knew that this movie was much more than what Pokemon Ranger or The Spell of the Unknown was. It had the same feel as Pokemon 2000 and The First Movie. It was a fun ride, I\'ll tell you that.The animation was phenomenal in the movie. From the sparkling spirit of lucario\'s last moments to the action scenes, the movie never let up on the pretty graphics. Everything had a real fantasy look to it and it\'s very cool to see on a HD TV.The sound was great, even if a little familiar. The usual opening scene of Ash battling someone to the tune of a recent opening song from the main series (which was lost in some other movies) was a fun scene to watch. By now it seems the dub DVDs will never supply us with a Japanese track, which is disheartening to say the least.Lucario is by far one of the better ""main"" movie pokemon characters. He was lik a mix of Lugia and Entei combined into one and his personality was amusing. Sir Aaron was another likable character, though his time on screen is short.After Jirachi Wishmaker and Destiny Deoxys, many people thought that Pokemon movies were falling into a sinkhole but it\'s great to see that Lucario and the Mystery of Mew was able to pull through. I recommend it to the die-hard pokemon fans. And maybe a few others that are looking for something to watch on a Friday night. a raging two-sided war.

He was lik a mix of Lugia and Entei combined into one and his personality was amusing. Sir Aaron was another likable character, though his time on screen is short.After Jirachi Wishmaker and Destiny Deoxys, many people thought that Pokemon movies were falling into a sinkhole but it\'s great to see that Lucario and the Mystery of Mew was able to pull through. I recommend it to the die-hard pokemon fans. And maybe a few others that are looking for something to watch on a Friday night.', ""This movie, out of all the Pokemon movies, is my absolute favorite.-Story-The story line keeps you guessing, no matter what part it is at. I could watch this movie over and over and over again, and the ending is very moving. Anyone, even those who don't like Pokemn that much, will find this story absolutely great.-Art-They had a lot of new art, and the setting was beautiful.They had a lot of fun with the outfits (in the beginning). I did not see any art errors whatsoever.-Sound-I loved the theme song (it is my favorite one) and I loved the ending song as well. All the...songs in the middle during the different scenes really set the tone and mood. I have no complaints.-Character-The whole thing with Lucario being involved was a true throw-off from what the Pokemon series is use to. The only characters that are humans are extreme minor characters (except the Pokemon Hunter; she was a Major Minor character, but she did not fill an important role).-Enjoyment-I loved this moving. Whenever I watch the ending, I can't help but shead tears. I could watch this over and over, and I wouldn't get sick of watching it.-Overall-Overall, this is my absolute favorite Pokemon Movie so far. It has great backbones in the plot, and they did a lot of changes I wish would continue throughout the rest of the movies and series. songs in the middle during the different scenes really set the tone and mood. I have no complaints.-Character-The whole thing with Lucario being involved was a true throw-off from what the Pokemon series is use to.

I have many problems with it, but I can't say I think it's completely worthless. Mew was very cute in this and Lucario was actually cool. But I can't recommend this film. Bother only if you're an avid fan of Lucario or Mew.Better to get the good out of the way. The soundtrack was fine, even if not on the level of the first, second or fifth film. Art, on the other hand, was not fine - it was much better. Just like in the last film, the artists did a great job....While not breaking standards set by previous films, some images present in here will stay vividly with you for days after you've watched it.What else was good? Lucario ended up being a well crafted character, even if a bit stereotypical. Unfortunately, the relationship with his trainer was completely predictable and some of Lucario's lines towards his master were extremely bad. Fortunately, this didn't diminish Lucario's character. His interaction with Ash was a bit more aggressive than Pokemon sequels usually dare to go, making for a somewhat refreshing dynamic.When discussing this film, it can easily be broken down into three main sections. That is to say, the film shifts gears twice, changing its style. These sections are at the castle, aproaching the mountain and in the mountain. Of the three, the only one I'd characterize as good is the second one. It's also the shortest.Considering that the introduction scene is the same as in so many other Pokemon films, I don't have much to say about it. It isn't particulary bad, but I can't say much good about it either. It's just there. I guess seeing a hundred copy-pasted pokemon fighting was somewhat novel.Now we get to the real begining of the Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Film lures us in with neat arhitecture. We get to really enjoy the location for a few minutes as Ash battles another trainer. A bit later into the act, film uses classy outfits to draw us into an oppulent party. Both of these disguise the main problem of the film for only a few minutes. After the wow factor fades away, you start to notice the dialogue and interactions between the characters. Simply put, they aren't interesting. There are a few pokemon-only shenanigans used to distract the viewer, but they're not nearly as effective as in most other films.At one moment Brock sees a girl and opens his stalking notebook. As he reads through the insanely stupid list of the poor gal's achievements, the realization hits you that this is supposed to be funny. The party drags on forever and it's only after Ash summons Lucario that things get a bit interesting. How did he do it? Due to lazy writing, of course. For some unexplained reason his aura is the same as Lucario's master's (even if their character is nothing alike).Throughout these first 40 minutes of the film, we're treated to multiple scenes of Team Rocket and other characters doing irrelevant things. All in all, there's around fifteen minutes of footage which should have definitely been scraped, as it adds nothing to the experience.After the film shifts geas, we're sent on a journey towards the crystal mountain. The not-so-challenging journey is perilous since, well... No one's ever been there. As baffling as this is, the following 20 minutes feature some neat scenes. Ash and Lucario clash, Lucario gets to act tsundere and a few jokes are genuinely funny. On the other hand, the stupidity doesn't leave. We discover some flowers which record and show the past. Apparently no one's ever tried harvesting this power, or at the very least we aren't informed of it, as the film just glances over the topic. Next up, the gang trriggers a thousand year old crystal flower with Lucario's master's memories. How this is possible, I don't know. Then, as the gang is attacked by underwhelmingly weak Regi legendaries, we approach the third act.In the third part of the film we're treated to a fun subplot - Mew & Pikachu playing. A few of their scenes are shown earier, but the culmination of the subplot happens here and I gotta give credit where it's due - it works.As for the main plot, the film completely breaks down here. Starting here, the film contains numerous vices and sins that Pokemon films indulged into throughout the years. There's the sentinent mountain's very own defense system against humans (no, I'm not joking), villains having acces to impossible technology, there's shallow mysticism, characters surviving impossible falls and nature acting in baffling ways. Pokemon was never about realism, but within every work exists a treshold where the world starts breaking down. I could go in depth and explain each and every thing wrong, but this is a review, not an in depth critique. Not to mention the length of this piece is already going too far. The gist of what I'm saying is - at a certain point you simply stop caring as the rules have been bent too far and the whole thing becomes boring. Well, at the very least they haven't ruined Lucario's character.I'm left with two distinct impressions; I see a neat concept with a single nicely realized character. I also see a mess of a film with no consisteny, a boring first part and an inane second half. There are a few neat Lucario moments sprinkled therein, but I can't recommend it to anyone expecting a good film. Fortunately for Lucario and his Mistery, there's a rabbid fanbase of the character out there. And this fanbase will go through anything just to watch him some more. This film is tailored for them, even if it's a trainwreck. So, enjoy the film, I guess.

So, enjoy the film, I guess."", ""Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, as the name implies, follows Lucario, a rare Pokémon who was sent centuries into the future by being trapped in a staff by his teacher Aaron. Lucario has been my favorite Pokémon for as long as I can remember, and this movie represents him perfectly. His relationship with Aaron is great, and his character is cool, yet endearing. This movie has so much more heart than many other Pokémon movies. It's tragic, exciting, and uplifting. The animation is also fantastic, and while the cgi has aged badly, the 2D animation allows Lucario and the others to make some really...funny and charming expressions as well as really realistic movements and reactions. The backgrounds are also beautiful, the artists really getting a chance to show off the beauty of Lucario and Aaron's kingdom. Now, I know what you're asking. Should I watch the dub or the sub? Well, I think they both have their own strengths and weaknesses, but I would have to say the sub for a couple reasons I'll get into later. One of the best parts of the sub is the dynamic between Lucario and Sir Aaron. Lucario's deep gravely voice in the dub is awesome, but it has the downside of kind of undermining the dynamic of Aaron being Lucario's mentor since his voice is so much deeper thanAaron's. In the sub, Lucario still has an awesome voice, but he still sounds younger and less mature than . Aaron's voice is also a lot better in the sub. The final scene is great in the dub, but the fantastic performances of the Japanese voice actors brings it from good to great. I know some people don't really care for Ash's voice in the dub. I have a nostalgia bias for it, but I think just about anyone can enjoy Ash in the sub. Now, to explain this next part, and what truly makes this film a masterpiece, I'm going to have to spoil things a little. So if you haven't seen the movie yet, I'd consider waiting to read this. In the post credits scene, Ash and his friends return to Cameron Palace to find Lucario being added to the painting of Sir Aaron in order to honor them. In the dub, Lucario is running on all fours next to Sir Aaron and his Pidgeot. While this certainly is a great painting, the way the sub handles this is what truly makes it fantastic. In the sub, the painting shows Lucario standing tall on 2 feet next to Sir Aaron, the two of them the main focus against a backdrop of a barren landscape. In the sub, Ash is given an extra line, and this one comment says SO much. As a smile appears on Ash's face, he proudly proclaims that THIS, THIS acknowledgement, THIS closure, THIS is what let's him know that Lucario has finally met Sir Aaron again. This one moment, as Ash is finally able to smile again, and help the kingdom realize how much of a hero Lucario truly was, all while seeing the fricking awesome painting that perfectly represents Lucario and Sir Aaron's relationship is the greatest scene in any anime I've ever seen. I hope I've shown you why this film means so much to me and why I've given it a ten. I simply can't even imagine giving it anything lower. This film has just had such an effect on me, and I still tear up whenever I watch the ending. If this film even remotely interests you, I implore you to go on iTunes and buy or rent it, only the dub is offered right now, which is still good, but if we let them know we like this, maybe we'll get the sub! This is my first review ever, I know the beginning was weak, but I just don't really know where to begin with this film, and I really hope I've managed to convey how passionate and empowered this film makes me when I broke down the final scene.

One of the best movies in the series, for sure!', ""***This is a spoiler free review***I don’t necessarily want to be labeled as that guy who reviews Pokemon stuff but after seeing the two very drastically different reviews for Pokemon Movie 8: Lucario and The Mystery of Mew, there was a dire need for a decent review.Like many major anime franchises such as Bleach and Naruto, Pokemon has many movies that accompany the different seasons airing. While some of the Pokemon movies seem rushed out and bland, I believe Pokemon Movie 8: Lucario and The Mystery of Mew is a very well done movie wrapped around a fairly good cast.Story 6/10:So the eighth Pokemon movie...centers around the Pokemon Advanced cast of Ash, Brock, Max, and May which happens to be my 2nd favorite overall cast in the Pokemon universe. Ash and company are visiting a festival that has a pokemon competition as the main event. Ash does his thing and wins the whole shibang creating the starting point for the movie. Without giving too much away, things happen and with the help of Lucario, Ash and friends are off on a quest to save a freaking huge tree. It might sound uninteresting from my horribly written summary but to tell you the truth, this movie is based mostly on the backstory of Lucario and the chemistry he and Ash form. The plot is interesting enough to hold onto and I generally like the beginning, middle, and ending.Animation 8.3/10:It’s really hard to judge the animation because it might be a hit or miss for some people. The animation looks like it has some sort of filter (can't really describe it although its not a negitive thing). The production values from what I can tell were pretty high as some of the scenes are beautiful and full of outstanding reflections. The overall color palette emphasizes on dark shades and bright colors (very bright reds and greens) which works for me. Other than the big important scenes, everything else looks fine and not hard on the eyes. I rarely experienced any frame rate or blurring issues when watching the film. It looks great and everything is fluid.Sound 6.5/10:***This is biased off of watching the English Dub***I have always watched Pokemon in English since I was a kid and watching this in English made me respect English speaking voice actors even more than before. Every character has a very nicely done dub to accompany the animations of the characters. Ash, May, and Brock (I didn't check for Max but I am pretty sure its the same as well) have the same voice actors as the ones in the series, Pokemon Advanced which to loyal fans is a plus. The musical score is average at best, mostly consisting of orchestrated songs and pop one here and there. The pokemon sound like…pokemon. What I’m trying to get at here is that the English Dub is quite good and everything else works. Not spectacular but not horrible.Characters 7/10:Pokemon has always relied on the audience enjoying the interactions of the characters. When you have seasons branching out to 100+ episodes, if the characters don’t work well the series will flop. Ash is the same as when he started his adventure, rash, bold, and way too friendly. He’s not a male lead I respect as much as say Ichigo but he gets the job done. I hate Max; don’t really have a valid reason why but I just find him annoying. Brock is the world’s greatest “player” as he hits on everything that moves (props my main man). I have always liked May because every movie that she is in I have grown to like. She and Ash have nice chemistry together and it shows in the movie. I honestly didn’t feel for any of the other minor characters except for Lucario. Lucario initially is an a$$hole but eventually warms up to Ash. Overall, the main cast works well but definitely outshines the supporting roles.Overall 7/10:The movie kept me interested with the backstory of Lucario and the interaction between the characters as a whole. Animation was good enough to get the job done and in some incidents was very well done. The quality of the voice overs for the entire staff was very well done. The character interactions were quite good and made me want to watch Pokemon Advanced all over again. Overall, it’s a good movie whether you are a Pokemon fan or not. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for something to kill an hour and a half with.Enjoyment: 8/10***To Pokemon Lovers: If you are craving a different take on Pokemon, I strongly encourage you start reading the manga Pokemon Adventures as it follows the games and has a very different view of the Pokemon Universe. The manga faithfully follow the games and at the moment has +500 chapters to enjoy.***Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer"", ""The eighth Pokemon movie begins with a sequence showing events from years ago, during a medieval looking era. It was when the main Pokemon of the movie were introduced, Mew and Lucario, and also Lucario’s trainer/master Aaron, a kind of knight from a palace or kingdom. At that time, there was a war happening between different kingdoms, using Pokemon and people as soldiers. At the end of the sequence, Aaron abandoned Lucario and his kingdom, because of the war. Unfortunately, this left Lucario sad and confused. That was the most interesting part of the movie, maybe a good idea for a spin-off about that time.Back...to the present time, Satoshi and friends (Haruka, Takeshi and Masato) were going to a festival that happen in the palace from that time. The festival sequence was pretty fun and was used to introduce more movie only characters, like Eileen (the current queen of the palace) and Kidd Summers. Lucario also reappears, thanks to Satoshi, because he was similar to Aaron in spirit.The main plot really begins when Mew appeared and took away Pikachu and Nyarth to the Tree of World’s Origin, where that Mew lives. The movie was basically a rescue mission, about Satoshi and friends, and even Rocket Gang (Musashi and Kojirou), trying to bring back Pikachu and Nyarth, with the help of Lucario and Kidd. Exactly the same premise of the third Pokemon movie.The real problem with this movie starts here. Basically, there was no real urgency or an antagonist, unlike in the third movie. Pikachu and Nyarth weren’t actually in danger. For example, what would happen if Satoshi and friends took one week, one month or even one year to reach the Tree. Mew was having fun playing with Pikachu and Nyarth, Mew was not a real threat. Meanwhile, the movie spends a lot of time with the characters driving a car to reach the Tree, and showing flashbacks about Lucario’s life with Aaron at the war time. Wouldn’t be more interesting if they quickly arrived the Tree and the movie showed they walking in the Tree most part of the time, with Lucario interacting with them and becoming friends while they were in danger, instead of spending a lot time driving a car, without tension, to reach the Tree.When the characters were in the Tree, there was a bit of danger, because the Tree had some White Blood Cells, which protect the Tree against bacteria (humans in this case), which was a cool concept, but other than that, there were not many challenges in the Tree for the characters, unlike in the Crystal Tower of the third movie.It was a bit weird and disappointing how easily some things were solved or simply weren’t solved for whatever was the reason. For example, when they were in the Tree, Satoshi saw Pikachu at the top of the Tree, why didn't Satoshi just used Ohsubame to fly to the top of the Tree to get Pikachu, apparently that would be too easy, Satoshi plays in hard mode. In addition to the Tree’s Cells, there were also the Regi trio (Regirock, Regice and Registeel), that were like guardians of the Tree, which doesn’t make much sense, if the Cells already exist to protect the Tree and how the Regis were easily avoided. It was just because the Cells don’t count Pokemon as bacteria or because the movies need to show legendary Pokemon. When the characters were absorbed by the Cells, Mew simply appeared and solved the problem, telling to the Tree that Satoshi and friends were not bacteria.The movie also had the same problem as other Pokemon movies, the secondary characters like Haruka, Takeshi and Masato were not really important. Even characters like the queen and Kidd weren’t very important. It’s understandable that the characters of the series weren’t too useful, they need to be in the movie just because they are the main cast of the series, but other characters could have been more important. Even the Pokemon of the main cast weren’t much used, a common problem in some Pokemon movies. There weren’t many battles or action choreographies, that could show more tension or danger to the viewer, which was a bit disappointing, because people love a good Pokemon battle or action scene. Lucario protecting the characters from Regis was a bit similar to Lugia in the second movie, but even Lucario protecting them was not too impressive as Lugia.Finally, the climax, after finding Pikachu and Nyarth. The sudden human activity in the Tree caused problems for Mew and the Tree, because they were like one. Mew was weakened and the Tree started to collapse, exactly like the Crystal Tower in the third movie. In this part, there was a twist about Aaron. Lucario finally figured out the truth about him. Lucario then solved the situation, fulfilling its role in this movie and the movie ends, exactly like in the third movie, but extremely abrupt and easy.Like other Pokemon movies, this movie was enjoyable. It was well animated, the scenarios were beautiful, the opening sequence was fun, soundtrack was fine and there were some interesting ideas. However, was a bit disappointing in rewatch, considering the amount of time without real tension, the lack of an antagonist, how easily some things were solved, the abrupt ending and the lack of an interesting theme. It was fun to watch it as a child, but paying attention is easy to see that some things could be better. If you are not familiar with Pokemon movies, this movie probably is not the best entry, and if you are familiar, you will notice that some things here were done better in other Pokemon movies.That was my first review, sorry for any mistake. to the present time, Satoshi and friends (Haruka, Takeshi and Masato) were going to a festival that happen in the palace from that time. The festival sequence was pretty fun and was used to introduce more movie only characters, like Eileen (the current queen of the palace) and Kidd Summers. Lucario also reappears, thanks to Satoshi, because he was similar to Aaron in spirit.The main plot really begins when Mew appeared and took away Pikachu and Nyarth to the Tree of World’s Origin, where that Mew lives. The movie was basically a rescue mission, about Satoshi and friends, and even Rocket Gang (Musashi and Kojirou), trying to bring back Pikachu and Nyarth, with the help of Lucario and Kidd. Exactly the same premise of the third Pokemon movie.The real problem with this movie starts here. Basically, there was no real urgency or an antagonist, unlike in the third movie. Pikachu and Nyarth weren’t actually in danger. For example, what would happen if Satoshi and friends took one week, one month or even one year to reach the Tree. Mew was having fun playing with Pikachu and Nyarth, Mew was not a real threat. Meanwhile, the movie spends a lot of time with the characters driving a car to reach the Tree, and showing flashbacks about Lucario’s life with Aaron at the war time. Wouldn’t be more interesting if they quickly arrived the Tree and the movie showed they walking in the Tree most part of the time, with Lucario interacting with them and becoming friends while they were in danger, instead of spending a lot time driving a car, without tension, to reach the Tree.When the characters were in the Tree, there was a bit of danger, because the Tree had some White Blood Cells, which protect the Tree against bacteria (humans in this case), which was a cool concept, but other than that, there were not many challenges in the Tree for the characters, unlike in the Crystal Tower of the third movie.It was a bit weird and disappointing how easily some things were solved or simply weren’t solved for whatever was the reason. For example, when they were in the Tree, Satoshi saw Pikachu at the top of the Tree, why didn't Satoshi just used Ohsubame to fly to the top of the Tree to get Pikachu, apparently that would be too easy, Satoshi plays in hard mode. In addition to the Tree’s Cells, there were also the Regi trio (Regirock, Regice and Registeel), that were like guardians of the Tree, which doesn’t make much sense, if the Cells already exist to protect the Tree and how the Regis were easily avoided. It was just because the Cells don’t count Pokemon as bacteria or because the movies need to show legendary Pokemon. When the characters were absorbed by the Cells, Mew simply appeared and solved the problem, telling to the Tree that Satoshi and friends were not bacteria.The movie also had the same problem as other Pokemon movies, the secondary characters like Haruka, Takeshi and Masato were not really important. Even characters like the queen and Kidd weren’t very important. It’s understandable that the characters of the series weren’t too useful, they need to be in the movie just because they are the main cast of the series, but other characters could have been more important.

I didn’t like the use of medival fantasy elements, (never been a fan of those), and the plot wasn’t very interesting at first. The Rescue Pikachu stuff wasn’t really very engaging, and the whole ball scene was way too long.But by the halfway point of the movie, and especially by the point when the Regis were introduced, things got very interesting with the Tree of Beginning plot and the whole time flower stuff, and it built until the ending of the movie, which was as intense and emotional as expected for the franchise.The action scenes...were quite good, and though there wasn’t much good humor, there was a lot of nice emotional moments especially, once again, the ending.And as usual, the animation and atmosphere was great. The CGI was cringeworthy at times but for the most part things looked very lovely, especially scenes like the intro to the Tree of Beginning and the opening scene, but the entire final half felt really nice and “epic” too.So it’s not one of my very favorites, but quite good.

Watch the full thing here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tcgJ2BZHPVg“Pokemon hit the United States with unbridled success as children all over the world began to tune in to Ash Misty and Brock's adventures all over the world. It captured a raw, childlike enjoyment of seeing cute animals violenting engage in battles for the sake of a young child master everyone could relate too. But with the engagement of the morality of Pokémon capture being questioned on the daily, it was clear to Gamefreak it was time to change things up. With the late turn of the century and...the debut of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and the fourth generation of the series, Satoshi and his team took a great risk, taking the series in unheard of directions and culminating with the release of a more mature and adutlt film based on the series on July 15, 2005 as Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. This huge risk paid off and the fourth generation of the series became known by fans as one of the most groundbreaking and memorable entries, pushing the series into years of sucess, leading up to today with the series still going strong!What makes Lucario and the Mystery of Mew so strong and allows it to stand the test of time is that it presents its titular lead, Lucario, with perhaps one of most empathetic stories in the entire series. Lucario didn’t fight for his human friend Aaron, he wasn’t capture by Aaron in a Pokeball. No, Lucario and Aaron went through a literal war together and became buddies. This is without a doubt one of the most badas* feats in the Pokémon series so far, and the tragic fate that befalls these two friends says so much about this seemingly “perfect” childlike world. The fact that such empathetic and truly free characters met inch a hard fate is one of the most subversive statements I’ve ever seen an anime make.” the debut of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and the fourth generation of the series, Satoshi and his team took a great risk, taking the series in unheard of directions and culminating with the release of a more mature and adutlt film based on the series on July 15, 2005 as Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.

Minami-ke Okawari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3225/Minami-ke_Okawari,"[""Summary -Overall, I wouldn't recommend Okawari to anyone. Even if they loved the original series by all their heart. Okawari is a poor continuation of the orignal series and I wouldn't be honest if I said that its worth watching.Story -Okawari is a continuation of the original Minami-Ke series, which focuses on the lives of Kana, Haruka and Chiaki. Like the first season, there's no plot or greater goal for the main characters to accomplish. The Minami family has been normalized and you forget, occasionally, that you're watching a comedy anime. Okawari picks up where the original series left off and they rarely introduce anything...new to the series and offers next to no variety which makes it very plain and boring. There's no reason for the audience to watch the next episode unless they want to know whether or not X will ever get along with Y sooner of later.Art -Okawari is superior to its predecessor in terms of quality. The animations are well-drawn and the lineart itself is rather detailed. However, the style doesn't fit the anime and those who have watched the original series will most likely frown upon it.Sound -Okawari has some nice, yet simple, sound effects which, inc comparison to the original series, is far less comical. Some might consider this to be good while some won't.The background music often tends to be rather loud and pulls away the audiences attention from the dialogues.Character -Seeing as the original series already had fleshed out the characters. I'm rating the new series as to how the characters have been adapted.The personalities are pretty much the same. Haruka has hardened a bit but is still the considerate host and 'mom'. Kana is still the hyperactive junior-high student which puts little, if any, consideration into her actions. Chiaki, however, has almost completely resigned from being the mix of an overly intelligent and violent sister and has taken the role of a victim that Kana can freely harass without having Chiaki saying more than 'Dumbass'.Enjoyment -The good sense of humor that I enjoyed in the original series is, in the lack of a better term, completely gone. Its a stretch to call Okawari a comedy. It's just a slightly romantic slice of life anime which resorts to fanservice by putting weird images into the viewer's head.I found myself hoping,no -- begging, for something awesome to happen whenever Hosaka appeared but even here, I was let down. He simply appears, says something that doesn't make sense (Without being humorous in any way) and someone smacks their forehead and mumbles something along the lines of &quot;Idiot&quot;, &quot;Weirdo&quot; or &quot;Gross&quot;. I can't express my dissapointment enough. I watched the original series in a relatively short time and I loved it to the very last drop - Okawari feels like an angry sumo-guy stomping your crotch all the way through. It's a pointless anime with no common sense of humor and just a lot of odd references to japanese commercials and culture that few people will understand. new to the series and offers next to no variety which makes it very plain and boring.

With a fleshed out story in place, you're basically  getting more bang for your buck the second time around!Story (Very Good)As the description says, its a continuation of the daily lives of the three Minami Sisters. Thats a plot to the uninformed. Also called a sitcom (google it). Now this time around they actually have a rather large cast of characters supporting the three girls. The girls get put into more silly antics than before and all at the same time showing a lot of skin in the process. If...there was any fan service suggestions you thought of that was missed in the first season, its most likely in the second season. Common situations like bath house antics, winter time hijinks, and even valentines day blues they're all there and accounted for. Its all very cliche' but for such a great show as this one can't help but watch the girls in their form and laugh out loud. If you cant realize the story/plot in a sitcom is all about the comedy than one doesn't know what a comedy anime is all about.Characters (Great)You get to see all three sisters in every episode but now they're almost always surrounded by their friends in one situation or another. They follow the 'more the merrier' approach and put all of them in such hilarious situations. Their facial expressions are still as classic as ever complete with the arms in the air. If you had a favorite character you'll just like them even more (Haruka for me) as they're all are even cuter than before. Well aside from their thigh high and miniskirt school uniforms, they wear a lot of different fashions every episode. On top of that theres more antics and silliness in every episode as well. My only gripe is that their friends are a little too friendly. Meaning they like to do things for the minami sisters more often than a normal friend would do. But then again, thats a large reason why this show so funny.Sound (Very Good)The background sound effects are all there, the same as before. A lot of bare feet running on hardwood, the sound of the computer fan running, etc etc. All the same as before. The music is exactly the same as before which is fine for such a light hearted, brightly colored, cute anime such as this. Mainly piano solos and light percussions and wind instruments. The opening theme isn't as great as the first seasons but the ending theme is pretty good but really flashy and loud. At least the singers were the same.Art (Great)As hard as it may seem the art actually seems to be kicked up an extra notch. The background art is the same style as Season 1 but this time theres even more settings in every episode. Theres a lot of random still shots of their apartment, school, etc. But on top of that you will even get to see more things throughout their apartment than just their living room and kitchen. Also, they do a lot more things outside. But the obvious difference isn't just from the background art. The static objects are everywhere from random underwear hanging to dry to uncooked meat getting tossed in a fryer. It all looks like they're done up an extra notch. But the main difference of the artwork, are with the characters. Sure theres more main and supporting cast on screen but how they manage to give them ALL different outfits for almost every show (apart form the school uniform) is pretty impressive in my opinion. You almost wonder if they have a fashion stylist on their payroll.Overall, its like what the first season should have been. So in essence its a perfect sequel. More of the same stuff, with A LOT of extra additions in every episode. Slight word of caution a lot more skin is included with what I previously stated. But with the addition of all the extra characters theres bound to be a chuckle or two somewhere. It's obvious the different production company tried to emulate Domu's classic hilarity. For the most part it stays pretty well in tact although fans of Domu can spot slight differences. Its so well done, even a normal anime viewer (like me) could hardly tell that it was made by a different company. there was any fan service suggestions you thought of that was missed in the first season, its most likely in the second season.

The first thing to be said is that it's not as half as good as the first season. The second thing to be said is that despite that fact, it's still very enjoyable.I was following Minami-ke Okawari as it came out but I stopped around ep 4 and wasn't really watching it anymore. And with the first season, I searched for the new episode every week until the very last one. It took me a few months to get into Okawari to watch it,...but once I started watching it again I realized it wasn't so bad.One thing, I guess, is it just doesn't seem to have the charm the first one did. It's not as funny, I can tell you that. It has its moments, but some episodes in Okawari were just sort of mildly amusing.The story and voice actors and character do not differ from the first, which is good at least. If you don't know, the story consists of three sisters living under one roof and their daily lives. And that's about it for the story and characters. It may sound boring at a glance, but it's done so well that it never drags.However, the characters and story is not portrayed as well as in the first, so I give a little bit of lower of score than I did on the first season. The animation is very different, but I didn't find too much of a problem with it, though there's much more fanservice in this season which irked me a bit. Okawari's animation is not done spectacularly, but it is sufficent, and I liked how the kept the &quot;regular to serious&quot; style going in this season.While I enjoyed it, I couldn't give it too high because at first I was struggling to watch the episodes and didn't even watch them as they aired each week. If you were a good fan of the first season this may come off as a little dissapointing. However, I was glad to embrace some more Minami-ke, and it is still a good series. but once I started watching it again I realized it wasn't so bad.One thing, I guess, is it just doesn't seem to have the charm the first one did.

I started to took interest in this series after I watched  Minami-ke the first. Sadly, This series isn't within my expectation. Want to know why? read my review.Story~... Yes! Minami-ke is back again! This is what I said before I actually watch the Okawari. ... Huh? Isn't this joke a bit lame? This is what I said after I watched few episodes of Okawari... This is the bad point. For the one who've ever watch the first season might end up just like me. Disappointment. Guess this...can't be helped since other company remake the shows.Since this series is just about the ordinary days of three Minami sisters, nothing can be said regarding the plot because it is... plot less. Nothing is weird since this is just a slice of life anime. Step aside this matter because their ordinary life is not ordinary to us. Thus, their every actions will definitely carves a smile on everybody's face. This is the good point.Fan services? Yes of course I like it! But sadly, not for this series. Yep, I think the person who was in charge with this series is definitely a half bald perverted geezer. They just can't think that we will happy with it! What we want in pure comedy anime! It is just... comedy. I'd like to give this a good point but... Sorry, bad point for it because I don't really like it.Well, when we (who watched the first Minami-ke before) watch some episodes of Okawari, I is just like a flashback to us. Yes, this is the truth. They simply just modified the story from the first. Some are better than the first but some are worst than the first.  So, overall for the story is 7, good.Art~Nothing much can be say about the art but I still have some comments regarding with it. The color of background and character is stronger in Okawari compared to the first Minami-ke that just use smooth color in their works. Nothing to say about them since both of them got their own unique characteristics in their arts. But for character's coloring, I don't really like them. They just change the color of some of their character's hair. Chiaki for examples, why the hell she got 2 colors on her hair!? I understands the fact that they wanted to give some tone to the color, but this is too much. I can't seems to get used to her hair color even after I watched 10 episodes of it. Ok, if they don't recklessly change the color, I would give 9 but... sorry, you can be satisfied with my 7.Sound~This is great, really well made. Well they did changed the company, but they still preserved their original seiyuu. They got outstanding OP and ED and I can'r seems to be bored or get annoying with it. Their background music is still preserved and what can I say? No flaw at all! 10 to sound!Character~Yeah, their characters is weir... I mean unique. Their every characters got their own personality and it is quite enjoyable to watch their silly actions. Hosaka! How can I possibly forget about him? Yes! He is the most unique character in all the anime I've ever watch! But sadly, they'd really ruined the Hosaka's personality in Okawari. This is a shame. How could they change a pure hearted (but weird) person into a pervert? This is too much! can't give 10 but 9 to the characters.Enjoyment~7 without hesitation. It means good enough. I can still continues to watch this series without drops it. They maybe have some bad arts but still... who cares about that? They are still Minami-ke! I love Minami-ke so thre are no reason for me to give it lowers than that.Overall~Very good, except for some flaws they made. Regardless, this is still a great anime. If you into the comedic genre, then this is for you. 8.Thanks for reading my reviews. Hope you read my other reviews too. Thanks you.

It is just... comedy. I'd like to give this a good point but... Sorry, bad point for it because I don't really like it.Well, when we (who watched the first Minami-ke before) watch some episodes of Okawari, I is just like a flashback to us. Yes, this is the truth. They simply just modified the story from the first. Some are better than the first but some are worst than the first.  So, overall for the story is 7, good.Art~Nothing much can be say about the art but I still have some comments regarding with it. The color of background and character is stronger in Okawari compared to the first Minami-ke that just use smooth color in their works. Nothing to say about them since both of them got their own unique characteristics in their arts. But for character's coloring, I don't really like them. They just change the color of some of their character's hair. Chiaki for examples, why the hell she got 2 colors on her hair!? I understands the fact that they wanted to give some tone to the color, but this is too much. I can't seems to get used to her hair color even after I watched 10 episodes of it. Ok, if they don't recklessly change the color, I would give 9 but... sorry, you can be satisfied with my 7.Sound~This is great, really well made. Well they did changed the company, but they still preserved their original seiyuu. They got outstanding OP and ED and I can'r seems to be bored or get annoying with it. Their background music is still preserved and what can I say? No flaw at all! 10 to sound!Character~Yeah, their characters is weir... I mean unique. Their every characters got their own personality and it is quite enjoyable to watch their silly actions. Hosaka! How can I possibly forget about him? Yes! He is the most unique character in all the anime I've ever watch! But sadly, they'd really ruined the Hosaka's personality in Okawari. This is a shame. How could they change a pure hearted (but weird) person into a pervert? This is too much! can't give 10 but 9 to the characters.Enjoyment~7 without hesitation. It means good enough. I can still continues to watch this series without drops it. They maybe have some bad arts but still... who cares about that? They are still Minami-ke! I love Minami-ke so thre are no reason for me to give it lowers than that.Overall~Very good, except for some flaws they made. Regardless, this is still a great anime. If you into the comedic genre, then this is for you. 8.Thanks for reading my reviews. Hope you read my other reviews too. Thanks you. (I know I can't really compares this series with the first, but they are still Minami-ke right?)"", ""Following on from the hilarious slice of life anime series Minami-ke, Okawari continues the story of the daily lives of the Minami family and their friends. For its second season, Minami-ke switches to an entirely new production staff (though the voice actors remain the same), and the difference shows. Okawari changes quite a few things about its predecessor... mostly for the worse.The main problem with Okawari is the fact that it often seems to forget that it's supposed to be a comedy. Opportunities for jokes frequently go wasted, and the jokes that do appear are usually rather lame. There's the occasional moment of humour, but...for the most part with Okawari, it's like just watching the daily lives of the three sisters, waiting patiently in the hope that something funny might happen. Most of the cast from the previous season make a welcome return (although Hosaka isn't as funny as he used to be, as he now just does random things for no apparent reason), but newcomer Fuyuki is a somewhat annoying and tedious character. We never even get to see Touma's brothers (&quot;the other Minami family&quot;) in this season, which is a shame because they were pretty good characters in Minami-ke.Another problem with the series is the gratuitous amount of &quot;fanservice&quot;, to the point where this could essentially be called an ecchi anime. The series never misses a chance to follow the characters into the bath or show them with little or no clothing for whatever reason, and of course there's the obligatory public baths episode, which seems to be mandatory with all slice of life anime these days (though to be fair, that particular episode is one of the funnier ones).One thing that has improved over the first season is the art. For the most part it's pretty competent and there's no significant problems, however there is one issue: for some reason, background characters are all fully animated, with hairstyles and everything, except they're blacked out so you can't see their faces. It looks kind of creepy when you see it in motion, and takes quite some getting used to. Especially when they talk...The sound and music are fairly good. Both the opening and ending themes for the series are a little strange and don't quite fit the tone and genre of the series, but at the same time they're not bad.For all its faults, Okawari could be a lot worse. The series can be funny when it tries, and it never gets bad enough as to be unwatchable. Okawari fails to live up to the standard set by its predecessor, but it's not a bad series either. If the writers had concentrated less on unnecessary ecchi and more on humour, it could have been a winner. for the most part with Okawari, it's like just watching the daily lives of the three sisters, waiting patiently in the hope that something funny might happen.

While the series is mostly carried by the antics of Kana and Chiaki, and how...their elder sister haruka has to deal with them, I also particularly enjoyed the episodes where their friends Touma and Makoto were prominently featured. Both school friends of Chiaki, Touma is a tomboyish girl that is branded by Chiaki as her 'brother' and most often goes around pretending to be a boy, Makoto is a wimpy boy from Chiaki's class who through circumstances cross dresses as a girl -and starts liking it to boot-. The humorous situations arising from their combined cross-dressing proved to be more entertaining than the main character's silliness at times. I did miss Touma and Makoto more in the latter half of &ldquo;Minami-ke ~Okawari~&rdquo;, they are featured less prominently among the Minami sister's many friends (and Touma's brothers disappear altogether in this season).It also made Touma and Makoto slightly more original characters since the Minami sisters themselves are more stereotypical, the eldest sister Haruka is the perfect housewife with good looks and great academic skills, the middle sister Kana is the lazy troublemaker who will constantly tease the youngest sister Chiaki, who is a very serious bookworm that greatly admires Haruka. It's made clear throughout the series that regardless of their character, all of the Minami-ke sisters became who they are out of affection for their sisters.Both seasons were done by different production studios so there is a clear difference in character design, but this didn't bother me at all, especially not since both animation styles kept the 'serious' face mode the characters sometimes are portrayed in. (Instead of chibi facial expressions sometimes observed in other series, here their faces will become more realistically styled giving them an absurdly serious undertone compared to the light-hearted and silly content.)The different styles for both series gives a unique feel to each season which would else not be remarkable since they aired back to back and contained mostly episodic plots and events. For both &ldquo;Minami-ke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minami-ke ~Okawari~&rdquo;, the animation itself is good, it never particularly excels but also never drops in level, it remains solid throughout all episodes.While the soundtracks are more unremarkable and are typical for comedy series, the opening song 'Keikenchi Joushouchuu' of the first season &ldquo;Minami-ke&rdquo;, sung by the main seiyuu is a very catchy and happy-go lucky track that fits the series very well.Both &ldquo;Minami-ke&rdquo; season were fun from start to end, so if you're looking for a good laugh, you might want to check this series out. their elder sister haruka has to deal with them, I also particularly enjoyed the episodes where their friends Touma and Makoto were prominently featured.

These fears are realised in Okawari and there are large differences in story styles between the first and second series. Firstly Okawari plays a lot more on the slice of life genre, whereas the previous Minami-ke had some ridiculous, but none the less hilarious moments (Who can forget Kana tying Chiaki up to ward off the rain), this...series tones down the ridiculousness and concentrates more on the character interactions. Also changed are the episode styles, whereas in the first series each episode was split into miniature stories, Okawari dedicates the entire episode to one storyline.This may not seem like a bad thing and there are plenty of series that pull it off but whereas the first series jumped from incident to incident with little need for build up, Okawari has to build up each joke and follow it up with some relevant storytelling to get to the next laugh which is a little long winded. I found this especially hard during the 7th episode when Kana continually foils Chiaki’s good work and actually got me annoyed at Kana’s character. Kana was probably my favourite character from the first series and for it to turn round to me actually finding her irritating is a prime example of bad storytelling. There have also been a few losses in the studio takeover with the rest of Touma’s family disappearing (I thought Natsuki and Haruka were getting on nicely) and the addition of a new next door neighbour who does nothing for the storyline and is a pretty pointless character.However much I may complain that the story isn’t up to the excellent standard of the first series, the majority of the storylines are decent themselves, and it still provides a good laugh from time to time, with the addition of some fan service from the girls (not that I felt the series needed any of it) in the traditional onsen sketch and then on every occasion the girls get to jump in the bath.Art (9/10)I have to admit, I fell in love with the first season’s ‘soft art’ (serious poses aside) so I was worried to see what the new studio would change. It’s a pleasant surprise then to find that without notable exceptions the artwork is still the same soft art styling as before, and does contain the serious posing. What the new studio has added to the anime is better backgrounds – Okawari has lots of small unnoticed background objects that look like they should be in focus and also takes place in far more locations than the first series all of which are animated beautifully.My main complaints stem from character design changes and one of the biggest one for me being a layout change to the Minami household. The first shot of the first season shows each of the girls waking up in their respective rooms, whereas somewhere lost in the time which is New Year is the wall between Kana and Chiaki’s room. They have been shifted into a smaller room separated by a curtain which doesn’t really make sense from a continuity or production viewpoint. Secondly are the character changes to the eyes and hair, the eyes are given more depth and more colour – but I was seriously put off when viewing Haruka’s eyes turn red (I checked back in case I had missed something and they were definitely light brown in the first series), the hair also is given brighter colours and even two tone colours – Chiaki’s hair turning from Haruka dirty blonde into some blonde/dirty brown two tone combination which just looks weird.Once you get used to the changes you hardly notice them, but for the first few episodes it does sometimes take your attention away from the story when you are trying to figure out if someone on screen is a main character which it will be if they don’t have a blacked out face. The credible art of rendering additional background characters to a high standard, with lots of variety is utterly defeated when the studio isn’t going to actually add in facial features and just blacks out the rest of the character. It looks really odd, and just doesn't fit it with an otherwise fantastically animated show, ruining what is almost a perfect mark.Sound (7/10)All of the voice actors have stayed the same, so there is no change in the characters. The OP doesn’t really work well with the series I don’t feel, it’s not quite lively enough for the series nor is it catchy enough, it’s alright but a lot of songs out there would have been better choices for the OP. The ED is better than the OP but again doesn’t really catch the essence of the series which is a bit disappointing, the animation sequence with Kana wiggling her bum as she walks is a bit odd as well, there’s just something not quite right about it. The background music throughout the show is the same brilliant work as in the original however and sets up the jokes well.Characters (8/10)The main characters all stay the same and are all brilliant. The only completely new character in the series is Fuyuki, who moves in next door to the Minami’s and is such a disappointing character. He’s a restrained good guy type character, always doing things for other people etc but he never really makes an impression on the series at all, even though he may be mentioned or involved with more than half the show you never actually miss him or want the girls to become distracted with him.As for the cast from the previous series we get a lot more Touma, Fujioka, Hosaka and Makoto (mainly in the guise of Mako-chan), with the banter between the characters bringing the extra dimension that was in the first series. Gone however are the rest of Touma’s Minami’s which I thought was a shame as I liked Natsuki’s character as a counterbalance to Hosaka’s weirdness.Enjoyability (8/10)With the new episode format and the move to a more slice of life type show I think that a little bit of the Minami-ke charm has been lost in the mix, it’s just not as fun to watch as the first was. However comparing it to what is probably the most enjoyable show I’ve watched recently is perhaps not very fair, Okawari is still very fun to watch and the escapades in which the characters get into as still very enjoyable to watch once you get over the new styling.Overall (8/10)If you break the scores down its actually 7.6/10 but I really felt that Okawari was probably more than one mark away from the original (which I gave a 9), while still being good in its own right. In the end what brings the score down is the changes involved in the story, with the story focusing more on slice of life than humour the enjoyment of the series decreases, and the addition of Fuyuki is detrimental rather than positive. It’s still a good show and if you enjoyed the first series then I would recommend it, but with the warning that it is not Minami-ke as you know it. series tones down the ridiculousness and concentrates more on the character interactions.

However, most of the content that it has should be familiar to the Minami-Ke fans out there.The story seems to have picked up sometime later from where season one ended. Since this is a &quot;slice of life&quot; anime it has to be rated on its episode by episode plots. Her we find ourselves partaking in the daily lives of the three Minami sisters, who live alone in an apartment. The story will range from...one of the supporting male members trying to confess their love for one of them, to the girls having problematic trouble at school. This season seemed to be a bit more outgoing than the first one, and has a lot of episodes taking place outside (where as the first seemed to be limited more to their apartment and/or school). One important aspect that this title makes sure to do with its story, is keeping the audience entertained. This is especially true with &quot;the slice of life genera.&quot; And I am happy to say that Minami-ke  does it very well. The situations that occur can be down right funny at times. Kana is probably the funniest of the anime, she is so random and says things that might fly over the viewer&rsquo;s head, its the kind of humor that is intentionally not suppose to make sense though. (especially since her sisters don&rsquo;t get half of them either) Now its not all left up to this one character to keep the episodes funny, as Miname-ke is also complimented with a very funny supporting cast. I was pleasantly surprised to see the &quot;Makoto cross dressing&quot; running gag still going on. Unsurprisingly there isn&rsquo;t any real end to this season, as you could pretty much place the final episode anywhere in the count and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. But that won't come as a surprise if you are familiar with the whole slice of life theme. Some jokes in the series were not as funny as the original, while some came out even better.Miname-ke Okawari doesn&rsquo;t push any envelopes with its content, but does include some &quot;brief ecchi-ness&quot; on episode one, that may raise an eyebrow with younger children. Nothing over a PG rating though.As I said before, the art has been changed, and I feel that this was totally unnecessary to do and makes it feel a bit awkward when going into it, (though you do get use to it eventually). The series still retains it's soft anime art style, and that is how it can be best described as...&quot;soft art.&quot; For some reason the characters mouths seemed to stand out, because of their more triangular shapes, they almost would remind me of rabbits...or perhaps fish. (maybe its just my own imagination) One thing I found to be kind of creepy, was when ever on of the sisters would get into a more serious mood, they drew them like evil eyed adults. Not sure why they did this, it seemed a bit out of place and unnecessary, and felt a tad over used in the end.Both closing and opening themes are port-raid in a happy up beat song (yet a bit more somber than season 1). The background music is pretty sparse as expected, many scenes occur with no tracks at all, trying again to appeal to a more relaxed feel. When it does play some it comes in the form of a soft &quot;piano style&quot; melody, I really liked it! The only bad part about the tracks is that they have been recycled from season one, and I don't recall hearing anything new with it. The best part though is the character voices, all of them fit well with one another and I couldn&rsquo;t find one out of place with the character. And yes, the original voice cast has returned for this season.In any slice of life anime the characters are a crucial part of the series, you can&rsquo;t enjoy it unless you like them. Thankfully these three sisters each have their own likable personalities; which range from out going (Kana), to very discrete (Chiaki), to some where in the middle. (Haruka the eldest) Some people may be turned off some what by Kana, since she tends to like doing things her own way, and does seem to interfere with situations at time, but nothing major. The only real bad thing I can think of regarding the characters, is that since this is a comedy title-- many of them (the supporting cast) tend to act like one another, and some of them we never really get to know who they are. To help with this though, the more unique supporting characters do get pretty good spotlight time, as the anime will tend to shift to their situations at times. Which was nice, and won&rsquo;t make you feel like you&rsquo;re just watching the three sisters all the time. New characters have also been added to the mix, such as a new next door neighbor. Out of all the characters &quot;Chiaki&quot; was the only one who had been a bit changed as far as personality goes. As she seems to be a bit more &quot;nicer&quot; in these episodes. Yet nothing too extreme, she still retains that personality of- &quot;a 70 year old man, trapped in a 10 year old's body.&quot;&quot;Minami-ke Okawari&quot;did have some hit and misses, a good number of episodes were funny, and some not as much, but it overall came together and shouldn't disappoint the fans out there. It's a nice title if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a more realistic sense of humor. The characters aren&rsquo;t particularly deep and not all episodes are the most funny. The cast are a likable and funny bunch though, and should capture your hearts when it's over. If you have already watched the first season (or are a fan of slice of life anime with comedy), then I recommend trying this one out. one of the supporting male members trying to confess their love for one of them, to the girls having problematic trouble at school.

And yes, the original voice cast has returned for this season.In any slice of life anime the characters are a crucial part of the series, you can&rsquo;t enjoy it unless you like them. Thankfully these three sisters each have their own likable personalities; which range from out going (Kana), to very discrete (Chiaki), to some where in the middle. (Haruka the eldest) Some people may be turned off some what by Kana, since she tends to like doing things her own way, and does seem to interfere with situations at time, but nothing major. The only real bad thing I can think of regarding the characters, is that since this is a comedy title-- many of them (the supporting cast) tend to act like one another, and some of them we never really get to know who they are. To help with this though, the more unique supporting characters do get pretty good spotlight time, as the anime will tend to shift to their situations at times. Which was nice, and won&rsquo;t make you feel like you&rsquo;re just watching the three sisters all the time. New characters have also been added to the mix, such as a new next door neighbor. Out of all the characters &quot;Chiaki&quot; was the only one who had been a bit changed as far as personality goes. As she seems to be a bit more &quot;nicer&quot; in these episodes. Yet nothing too extreme, she still retains that personality of- &quot;a 70 year old man, trapped in a 10 year old's body.&quot;&quot;Minami-ke Okawari&quot;did have some hit and misses, a good number of episodes were funny, and some not as much, but it overall came together and shouldn't disappoint the fans out there. It's a nice title if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a more realistic sense of humor. The characters aren&rsquo;t particularly deep and not all episodes are the most funny. The cast are a likable and funny bunch though, and should capture your hearts when it's over. If you have already watched the first season (or are a fan of slice of life anime with comedy), then I recommend trying this one out."", 'I wrote this review after finishing season 3 (Okaeri), and yes, as much as I don\'t like to point cons to anime such as this, this needs to be settled.Minami-ke fans know much of what season 1 offered: the Kana-ness, Chiaki-ness, and Haruka-ness that we all enjoy---and to which, almost none of this existed on this season.Story = 6Story picked as much as where the season 1 left. Not much to say, but it has its first flaw when we keep seeing ""hot spring baths"" and ""less censored, more skin-showing"" on its first episode. Not only that, but we keep seeing those in the further...episodes. Minami-ke is not that wholesome, but animators know what not to show. Here, the second season seemed to have taken a different route, tried to allure the viewers of what fanservice is all about.

Best way to say it, you can forget Okawari and just jump right to Okaeri and you would not miss a thing. Okawari can be treated like an entirely different anime, every element (plot and character-wise) of it went out of the window. It went far from the original Minami-ke concept, tried to go on a different approach, but with the season 3 taking the original concept back to it, the Okawari season is just isolated--and maybe that\'s a rather good thing. You can rather forget this season ever exist in Minami-ke, and just go and enjoy yourself to Okaeri, the third season of Minami-ke.However, for Minami-ke fans, you can still watch this season to complete the entire series.

In every other way, Okawari falls short; not even the promise of gratuitous fanservice could help (which, by the way, the first season did just fine without). Not to say that it was bad. If you enjoyed the first season, then watching this one is the next logical step. Just don't expect any of the free-form plot progression that made Minami-Ke so outstanding. Apparently in the span of time between then and now the writers figured such unique pacing* was a bad...thing, and proceeded to eleminate almost all trace of it. Furthermore, what plot is there feels recycled and tedious, even uncomfortable in some cases. The character development feels forced and unneccesary where it could instead have been pleasant and rewarding; the addition of a new character is well done, but seems to come at the cost of overlooking other promising minor characters from s.1 (why is the female boncho in the opening credits, but only appearse in one episode?).

The next day I was really excited about beginning the season 2, but a bit worried about the change of studio. I couldn\'t imagine how right I was to be worried...First things first, the art. Many reviews here are saying the art is more...or less okay, and even better than in season 1. I couldn\'t disagree more. The character design of the first season has its flaws (weird triangular mouthes and sometimes some weird foreshortenings) but at least it was original (and nice). In the second season, the character design is generic as hell, seen about 10.000 times. All the characters looks the same. Asread even changed the color of the eyes, you can hardly recognise Haruka. In addition to that I think the use of colors is very bad (it was very nice in season 1).Then we\'ve got the animation. Better than season 1? Are you kidding?

The majority of the animation/sound/characters/humor remains the same.  I don't think I cried from laughing as much, but it was still hilarious.There are little changes here and there.  Chiaki's hair color has mysteriously changed and Kana has some crazy dog shirt instead of I AM BOSS, which made me sad.  The detailed animation style for some scenes is more downplayed so it's not as weird.  Chiaki sometimes seems cross-eyed in this season, which is disturbing like an itch...on the bottom of my foot.

So, as a...first, I will change up my format and list the negatives first.The art style. Man, I can not tell you how much I enjoyed the colors, scenery and everything about the first season, so for it to take such a drastic turn was so weird. I even knew this season was going to be entirely different when I saw a preview of it after the final first season episode, so I feared for the worst and patiently waited a month before even watching it, as I had a similar experience before when embracing the way a former season is when compared to the latter. And, that wait helped me a lot here.To go into further detail, the art is even more detailed than it was before and looks very beautiful, but the colors and a few other aspects of it are displeasing to the eye in a way where you grew attached to something, only for it to be replaced with something ""similar"" in nature, but not in essence. The characters themselves also faced a change that I did not like at all. In the first season, their eyes were drawn uniquely different than most anime, but in this season, they follow the cliché of being big and colorful like most do it. And I mean, BIG, since their eyes were small, yet detailed and original in the first season, and very circular. Well here, they are literally carbon copies of generic anime eyes.Since you are here, I assumed you watched the first season so character spoilers should not matter anymore and you are probably familiar with everyone by now, so I will address one character that I felt had the biggest change and then will go about it in minor detail of the others. I will draw a comparison of the first season counterpart as well so that you really know how much has changed.ChiakiSeason One: A tsundere-esque type of girl, Chiaki is very intelligent for her age. However, she is extremely ill-mannered towards many people, especially her older sister, Kana.In spite of this, she will ask Kana of adult matters that she does not know of, as Chiaki still retains the innocence that is befitting of her age. Kana usually answers comedically, much to the annoyance of Chiaki, but will answer respectfully on a few occasions.She is a very lovable character in a lot of ways, including her weird faces that she randomly makes, the very nature of her personality that is similar to Kana\'s in a sense that she can be both rude and nice (which I love a lot as it is very rich in writing), but the difference with Chiaki is that she does so with specific people instead of randomly. The most notable is with Fujioka, of whom she sees as a father figure; bringing forth a subliminal serious back-story to the anime that was not ever foretold before.Appearance wise, she has brown hair, a pretty lovable face, despite how angry it usually looks; and can actually look very cute at times. She for sure looks the most similar to Kana, as a sister should, in this season than ANY other season of this anime.She also has a noteworthy running gag of always sitting on Fujioka\'s lap whenever he is over, to accommodate the aforesaid information about how she sees him. She always seems to find pleasure well sitting on him and expresses a very innocent face when doing so, well Fujioka does not seem to mind it since he was trying to grow closer to Kana\'s family, as to grow closer to her, and he already jumped the biggest hurdle by actually managing to have a similar respect as Haruka does to Chiaki as she never insults Fujioka in even the slightest way and always speaks to him with a smile, just as she does with Haruka.Season Two: Ah, and the fun comes to an end. Okay, she did not change drastically in personality, but her art style is what really throws me off. As I mentioned before, the characters now have cliché anime eyes in that they drew them bigger, but Chiaki stands out the most with hers. Hell, her facial expressions and more are also effected by the new change in peepers as she does not feel the same as she used to here because of them.If you actually were a huge fan of the art style in the last season, which I sure as heck was because of how different it looks from most anime, it is depressing to see Chiaki just be given a makeover to look like most generic anime. Her hair is now blond, though has brown tips; hinting that she perhaps dyed it that way, as it was brown in the prior season. However, her eyes now match her hair, hinting that she just got a gene change for this season in that she now inherits a heavy mix of the blond hair from her mother\'s side overall and little of the brown hair from her father\'s through the tips.Appearance aside, her personality is not too changed, but she seems to have actually matured a bit here. She still treats Kana as rudely as ever, but she is more open to listening to her now (when Kana is being reasonable, that is) than she was before and even aids her in her comedy routines sometimes, which is actually quite enjoyable. However, to fit the nature of this season now having a somewhat dramatic approach to it, Chiaki also has some serious moments herself that come off as a bit harsh and change her character a bit, too.For instance, we just assumed that her rude nature was due to her being afraid to express her true self, as she does whenever she is around her more mature sister Haruka, but whenever she is being serious and trying to help someone out, she still does it in the same manner here; and it is a major turnoff since I was hoping her character was not actually that rude when she was trying to assist others. But, unfortunately, this season made her that way.I have not seen this particular season in a little while since I wrote up the reviews for this anime a bit late, but I still remember enough to have a clear enough grip on the two natures of Chiaki. If you watched the prior season, you will be disappointed with her here, but it shouldn\'t be a big enough bother to ruin the anime for you.Outside Chiaki, almost every other character looks noticeably different as a result of this new art style. One I would like to point out is Fujioka, mentioned earlier, whom now has blond hair instead of brown. It is a bit longer, more rugged and noticeably different. His reputation of being the popular boy is still intact, though not as major as it was before; and one of his followers brings forth the first love triangle of the series, and strangely the other follows of his disappear shortly after; and goes on to become one of the main cast members later on, alongside being a further hindrance to Keiko whom already has to put up with Kana\'s shenanigans as it is.One note on the anime itself are the activities. It appears that they really did embrace the slice of life genre in that now the characters have much more active school lives than they did before; even having actual events in a few of the episodes, which took away from the casual feel a bit. It is also a bit disappointing that it resorted to adding in further anime cliché to try and make up for the new change in crew, rather than the usual, already enjoyable comedy of the first. But, I did not hate the events. They just felt a bit off.On a mixed note I will throw in between the negative and positive. they made Haruka more of an authority figure in a more stern way in this season. They gave her red, menacing eyes and her hair has appeared to embrace the blond gene like Chiaki\'s did. One episode, notably, turned Haruka into a steaming powerhouse where, as implied, she punished Kana and Chiaki for something very simple to the point where the whole episode turned black and white and it got very disturbing. And then, you know, fades out to the credits shortly after. Overall, Haruka just became more aggressive and it was unfitting of her calm character.Now, with all that out of the way, it is time for my favorite part: the positives. You may be wondering: why was the humor never mentioned? I did say they added drama, and I said they have new people making this season, but I never said the comedy changed. Yes, fortunately, the anime is STILL as funny as ever, though you now have to put up with actual negativity in this season than the none that you did in the first. Simply put, the delivery of the comedy is still really good, though now has to deal with some drama parts and a few other unnecessary bits here and there.Most notably, every episode is now a whole episode instead of a segment show, which is possibly one of the reasons why they added in drama to begin with. Also, on an unrelated note regarding appearances, many of the characters look their age a bit more in this season. Most notably, Chiaki, whom when standing next to Haruka in one scene from a zoomed out isometric perspective, actually looks her age this time around.Can I recommend this season? If you\'re a fan of the first for its comedy alone, go for it as it is still very similar in nature to that. However, that I can remember right now, it abandons a lot of the traits found in the prior season. Most notably, the hilarious Ninomiya-kun segments, the episode introduction that warns you of the simplicity of the ""Minami household"" and a few other little comedy aspects. Lots of design changes, drama and just a small bit of other changes that you may or may not like. Regardless, it still feels the same mostly and it would not be a waste of time to check out. But, you will have to put up with a lot of change. first, I will change up my format and list the negatives first.The art style.

Okay, she did not change drastically in personality, but her art style is what really throws me off. As I mentioned before, the characters now have cliché anime eyes in that they drew them bigger, but Chiaki stands out the most with hers. Hell, her facial expressions and more are also effected by the new change in peepers as she does not feel the same as she used to here because of them.If you actually were a huge fan of the art style in the last season, which I sure as heck was because of how different it looks from most anime, it is depressing to see Chiaki just be given a makeover to look like most generic anime. Her hair is now blond, though has brown tips; hinting that she perhaps dyed it that way, as it was brown in the prior season. However, her eyes now match her hair, hinting that she just got a gene change for this season in that she now inherits a heavy mix of the blond hair from her mother\'s side overall and little of the brown hair from her father\'s through the tips.Appearance aside, her personality is not too changed, but she seems to have actually matured a bit here. She still treats Kana as rudely as ever, but she is more open to listening to her now (when Kana is being reasonable, that is) than she was before and even aids her in her comedy routines sometimes, which is actually quite enjoyable. However, to fit the nature of this season now having a somewhat dramatic approach to it, Chiaki also has some serious moments herself that come off as a bit harsh and change her character a bit, too.For instance, we just assumed that her rude nature was due to her being afraid to express her true self, as she does whenever she is around her more mature sister Haruka, but whenever she is being serious and trying to help someone out, she still does it in the same manner here; and it is a major turnoff since I was hoping her character was not actually that rude when she was trying to assist others. But, unfortunately, this season made her that way.I have not seen this particular season in a little while since I wrote up the reviews for this anime a bit late, but I still remember enough to have a clear enough grip on the two natures of Chiaki. If you watched the prior season, you will be disappointed with her here, but it shouldn\'t be a big enough bother to ruin the anime for you.Outside Chiaki, almost every other character looks noticeably different as a result of this new art style. One I would like to point out is Fujioka, mentioned earlier, whom now has blond hair instead of brown. It is a bit longer, more rugged and noticeably different. His reputation of being the popular boy is still intact, though not as major as it was before; and one of his followers brings forth the first love triangle of the series, and strangely the other follows of his disappear shortly after; and goes on to become one of the main cast members later on, alongside being a further hindrance to Keiko whom already has to put up with Kana\'s shenanigans as it is.One note on the anime itself are the activities. It appears that they really did embrace the slice of life genre in that now the characters have much more active school lives than they did before; even having actual events in a few of the episodes, which took away from the casual feel a bit. It is also a bit disappointing that it resorted to adding in further anime cliché to try and make up for the new change in crew, rather than the usual, already enjoyable comedy of the first. But, I did not hate the events. They just felt a bit off.On a mixed note I will throw in between the negative and positive. they made Haruka more of an authority figure in a more stern way in this season. They gave her red, menacing eyes and her hair has appeared to embrace the blond gene like Chiaki\'s did. One episode, notably, turned Haruka into a steaming powerhouse where, as implied, she punished Kana and Chiaki for something very simple to the point where the whole episode turned black and white and it got very disturbing. And then, you know, fades out to the credits shortly after. Overall, Haruka just became more aggressive and it was unfitting of her calm character.Now, with all that out of the way, it is time for my favorite part: the positives. You may be wondering: why was the humor never mentioned? I did say they added drama, and I said they have new people making this season, but I never said the comedy changed. Yes, fortunately, the anime is STILL as funny as ever, though you now have to put up with actual negativity in this season than the none that you did in the first. Simply put, the delivery of the comedy is still really good, though now has to deal with some drama parts and a few other unnecessary bits here and there.Most notably, every episode is now a whole episode instead of a segment show, which is possibly one of the reasons why they added in drama to begin with. Also, on an unrelated note regarding appearances, many of the characters look their age a bit more in this season. Most notably, Chiaki, whom when standing next to Haruka in one scene from a zoomed out isometric perspective, actually looks her age this time around.Can I recommend this season? If you\'re a fan of the first for its comedy alone, go for it as it is still very similar in nature to that. However, that I can remember right now, it abandons a lot of the traits found in the prior season. Most notably, the hilarious Ninomiya-kun segments, the episode introduction that warns you of the simplicity of the ""Minami household"" and a few other little comedy aspects. Lots of design changes, drama and just a small bit of other changes that you may or may not like. Regardless, it still feels the same mostly and it would not be a waste of time to check out. But, you will have to put up with a lot of change.', 'the 2nd season of minami ke left me feeling a little dissapointed....okay a lot disappointed at first for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons being the sloppy animation not only did the new producers change the way the characters looked completely they were so lazy that they didnt even draw faces of the random pedestrians in fact they were just black faced people with clothes and hair (extremely creepy). Another reason why i was disappointed is because this season just wasnt as witty and funny as the last one dont get me wrong it was pretty darn funny but just not as much....But dont get me wrong i still really enjoyed this anime actually the last couple of episodes were my favorite and had me just as excited as the first season. Overall i still think that minami ke okawari is a good anime it just that the sloppy drawings and not as gut busting jokes didnt come up to par with the 1s season.

The first noticeable difference from the first season is the art style. The lines are all very hard and everything looks darker. Sure, the backgrounds certainly have more detail, but perhaps too much hard-lined details. The art overall seems out-of-place for the lighthearted comedy we grew to love in Minami-ke. There also seems to be a bit more fanservice, which...takes away a bit from what the series means as a lighthearted comedy.The episodic stories are quite varied and still involve a plethora of characters, however, it seems like this season lacks the comedy we grew to love in the first season. Opportunities for punchlines are missed. For example, Hosaka appears multiple times but nothing really happens with him.The characters, Haruka, Kana, and Chiaki are more-or-less the same as they were in the first season, with Chiaki probably being the most different in her attitude towards Haruka.All this being said, because the MC's are so likable, I still enjoyed this series and went on to watch the rest of the seasons. I wouldn't recommend this season by itself; I think it's required that one watches the first season before this. takes away a bit from what the series means as a lighthearted comedy.The episodic stories are quite varied and still involve a plethora of characters, however, it seems like this season lacks the comedy we grew to love in the first season.

Nekojiru-sou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/601/Nekojiru-sou,"[""Every once in a while, a truly magnificent and original anime shows up. Being a media everyone relates with silly characters, a fun story and a little ecchi now and then, the typical anime-lover would get a mild shock from a movie such as this.Through the film, we follow the cat Nyatto on his quest to reclaim his sister's lost soul. They embark on a strange journey filled with mystery, darkness and disturbing obstacles. There isn't much more to say, really.Nyatto and his sister - and also a few other characters -  were all in Nekojiru Gekijou, the series this film spawned from. Although...this story takes place in the same world as the original series, this is not similar to it at all. All the black humor that Nekojiru Gekijou was built upon have been replaced with a dark and disturbing tale.When people watch a movie such as this that blends surrealism and symbolism into a lovely mix, they usually react differently. The writer might not have had any ideas behind all of it, and there's a possibility that there are no real answers to the mysteries. In other words, you're free to interpret it as you like. That's what made David Lynch's &quot;Eraserhead&quot; so popular amongst some, while being hated by others.The only thing I don't like with Cat Soup is that it's a tad too short. There's potential for so much more. One can only hope for some kind of sequel in the future.-Fred this story takes place in the same world as the original series, this is not similar to it at all.

One can only hope for some kind of sequel in the future.-Fred"", 'Cat Soup or Nekojiru-sou in its Japanese title is a lot stranger than its own name makes it out to be. It can be best described if you gave a loony philosopher, who just happened to love cats, some drugs this short film would probably be the result of what they see in their high. A series of abstract ideas presented in such a bizarre manner while seemingly nonsensical is alluring in its strange nature. It is very difficult to make any sense of it or confirm it means anything, but that’s part of what makes this short film have such a strong impression in...such a small amount of time.Good: Simple and deepThe story is basically about two cat siblings with Nyako, the brother, searching for some way to resurrect, Nyatta, his dead sister. The opening minutes of the short film are about as direct it’ll get. Beyond that point, it becomes a journey into the abstract. Filled with a visit to the circus involving seeing a magic act of a woman getting completely chopped into pieces, discovering an elephant made out of water in a desert, and the ocean becoming completely frozen to name few odd things you’ll see. As odd some of these descriptions are, they do get across simple ideas. For example, when the cat siblings visit the circus Nyako firmly believes he can fully resurrect his dead sister after seeing a circus act performing a seemingly impossible act. It is a simple moment that is straight to the point.Virtually non-existent dialogue, the story is told in a way that the few lines of dialogue aren’t needed to understand the story. It’s a risky decision, but pays off to give off the vibe of being in a strange dream. Nothing is given a direct explanation when going from one event to the next. Instead of stopping in one area to explain the significance of a scene, it goes straight to the next odd scene. Its story is quite simple to get behind, but whether or not it has any meaning is never confirmed within the work itself.Good: Once again, simple and easy to get behindIt’s a single OVA meaning the protagonist motivation is kept at a basic level. Being more than enough to follow Nyako on his journey. His simplicity makes him appealing and immediately thoughtful. Simply seeing his parents\' negligence towards him and his sister in the household says allot about the bond he has with his family. With that said the story is essentially what you see is all you get. Allowing the viewer to form their own interpretation on everything that unfolded.The supporting cast is filled mostly with anthropomorphic animals with some humans. Whenever a human character is on screen, it usually leads to trouble. They’re only given one purpose which is entirely fine since it’s going for more showing than actually telling. The only true negative to the characters is there is not much to analyze or sink into. All the characters are straightforward without ever diverting from their set path.Good: Even the technical side of it is oddOn the animation side J.C. Staff succeeds in creating a dreamlike feeling. Anathanpromorbic animals are given simple design that makes them look cute to greatly contrast against the cruel action. Humans are drawn like humans, though they don’t appear much in the OVA and often use a blank expression. It has a muted color palette that seems off visually making it seem as if life has been taken out of it. Emphasizing the whole surreal nature of the world where all the oddities belong can belong together. By design, it at times looks hand drawn and at one point even begins to look like a kid’s coloring book. Whatever J.C. Staff used to color their images in this OVA it looks as natural as coloring by hands instead of a computer.There’s virtually no voice acting in the OVA. When there is dialogue it’s presented through a speech bubble that adds more to the dreamlike feeling than adding to the story. In the sound department stuff like footsteps, water flowing, ticking clocks, squeaky toys, and a dozen other effects make up the sound department. The music is split between sounding light hearted and welcoming which soon become interrupted by eerie static like noises. It fits the OVA perfectly giving an eerie, unsettling atmosphere in the darker scenes. It can also be sweet when in use during scenes where nothing out of the ordinary happens to simply show the cat siblings taking care of one another. The closing credits uses the most editing with a music box to close the OVA. Combining both childlike wonder and an eerie presence by looping the music box in at random moment.On the DVD there’s an audio commentary track that is not exactly helpful to say the least. Director Tatsuo Sato explains that many of the scenes do not have an underlying meaning or if there was one, he forgot what it was. Admitting he had no intention in mind when putting the film together. So pretty much you make of what you see.Personal Enjoyment: I liked it, even if it’s possibly meaninglessIt was an oddity about half an hour long so even if I did dislike it the short length would be a saving grace. I like seeing strange stuff no matter how weird it gets. I’m just in shocked J.C. Staff actually made something I would call smart. In general, J.C. Staff doesn’t come across as a studio to take risks or stray off from their comfort zone with anime that are heavy on the slice of life elements or attempting to duplicate their previous success with a Shakugan no Shana clone. This short film doesn’t change my views on the studio as anything other than being average, but it has earned them more of my respect by creating something out of their comfort zone.Calculating Points:Story: 2/3Characters: 2/3Technical (Animation, Music, Sound Effect, ect.): 3/3Personal Enjoyment: 1/1Final Thoughts:Cat Soup/Nekojiru-sou is like a collection of episodic shorts splice together into a 32 minute OVA with any true meaning to it left with no answer from what the material provides. It’s a short film with virtually non-existing dialogue that’s reliant on visuals alone by combining cute, simple designed characters in bizarrely dark situations to tell its story. This OVA is very much a visual experience that’s intriguing for the creativity it display in a short length. Watch it for the visuals and creativity, leave with your own meaning.That concludes the review portion of this review. The remainder is simply a paragraph on my interpretation of the OVA. After that, it’s five paragraphs of what I learned about Chiyomi Hashiguchi, the mangaka of Nekojiru-sou. MAL has their own biography on the mangaka, but it was rather short so I wrote what I gather. With that written, continue if you like.Bonus Passage: My Interpretation on the film (SPOILERS, SPOILERS HERE)Based on my opinion and what I gathered. Nyako is sister is dead. Living alone with his drunkard father and mother who did not care. Nyatta was the only one who he had and he chased a miracle to rescue her. Catching god of death himself, Nyako took half of her soul, returning it back. However, she was not whole. He tried to find the other part half, and there is where the deeper part starts. The main idea of this anime is nobody can decide the lives of the others which can be seen in every person they have met. Old hag who made people from spare parts, being patched up herself. Guy who killed others, getting his again. Merciless, selfish circus which destroyed the whole world in the end and in the end Nyako never saw that his desires were actually selfish and that he opposed the God, who showed him how easily he can manipulate time and that only something like God can bring life back. When Nyako in the end saved his sister, because he was mortal it brought a total disorder to the Universe, literally canceling everything, making it vanish. This anime also brings up a topics like natural order, and that we all are part of the circle which is life and death. And that it\'s nobody\'s fault, that\'s just how it is. In the end, God is just laid back dude who eats watermelons and sometimes turns back the time when he drops it down. Or in plain English, it’s likely represent the mangaka husband trying everything he can to save his wife by projecting his feelings onto the characters he and his wife created.Condense Information I gather about the mangaka:Chiyomi Hashiguchi, or Nekojiru by her pseudonymous pen name, was the author of a manga called ""Nekojiru Udon"" published in Garo magazine. ""Nekojiru Udon"" were based around her own bizarre dream experiences. In Hashiguchi diary (going by reproduced scrawls) reveals a very a fascination with communication breakdown and bodily malfunction, objectively noting every unpleasantry from vomiting dogs to accident victims.With only the book, “Jusatsu Sarecgatta Boku” (some direct passages from the book), by Yoshiaki Yoshinaga to go on for information my knowledge on Chiyomi Hashiguchi is dense. According to those who knew Chiyomi Hashiguchi personally found her to be somewhat plain and misunderstood, but also unpredictable, mysterious and seemingly fragile if not for shadowy side of her internal personality which she expressed so vividly in her manga. According to the book Chiyomi was diagnosed with manic depressions as well in several occasions being heard saying “I’m not afraid of death”.At the peak of her popularity in 1997-98, her once relaxed working atmosphere was no more as she had to produce large quantities of work which was out of character. Further reading reveals Chiyomi and her husband, Hajime Yamano (the artist of the manga) didn’t turn down a single offer for work meeting deadline after deadline. At this point in the book, it says many of the scenes depicted in “Nekojiru” were a blend of Chiyomi dreams and what she saw in real life. It’s rather unclear on the details of how to separate what were part of her dream and what she actually saw since she couldn’t separate it herself.Overworked, she began to drink heavily from being overworked. It stopped being fun for Chiyomi to do her work and now was only a matter of making the deadline. Eventually Chiyomi had run out of ideas, but she had deadlines to meet, and did the best she could manage. She had a strong sense of responsibility, and always found a way of come through in the end. More than once, she found herself cornered by several deadlines and had to push herself to the brink of collapse to finish everything. Having was trying to commit suicide in the past, Nekojiru had written wills on a number of occasions. Her last extant will dated from several years prior. She committed suicide on May 10, in 1998 with the cause of her suicide unknown. The accounts of how it affected her friends were also in the book.After some research on Chiyomi Hashiguchi doing a simple review wasn’t satisfactory for me. As depressing as it might have been reading the book knowing her tragic end I couldn’t find bring it in me to leave out what I learned about her. The book goes into detail about how she was as a person from accounts from those who her whereas I simply condensed the information I read. In turn, after learning all of this it has made me look at the short OVA in a different way. It’s depressing reading about Chiyomi Hashiguchi and what happened to her, but this OVA is proof she has not been forgotten which in a way makes me happy about its creation no matter what feeling the viewer will have after watching it. such a small amount of time.Good: Simple and deepThe story is basically about two cat siblings with Nyako, the brother, searching for some way to resurrect, Nyatta, his dead sister.

According to the book Chiyomi was diagnosed with manic depressions as well in several occasions being heard saying “I’m not afraid of death”.At the peak of her popularity in 1997-98, her once relaxed working atmosphere was no more as she had to produce large quantities of work which was out of character. Further reading reveals Chiyomi and her husband, Hajime Yamano (the artist of the manga) didn’t turn down a single offer for work meeting deadline after deadline. At this point in the book, it says many of the scenes depicted in “Nekojiru” were a blend of Chiyomi dreams and what she saw in real life. It’s rather unclear on the details of how to separate what were part of her dream and what she actually saw since she couldn’t separate it herself.Overworked, she began to drink heavily from being overworked. It stopped being fun for Chiyomi to do her work and now was only a matter of making the deadline. Eventually Chiyomi had run out of ideas, but she had deadlines to meet, and did the best she could manage. She had a strong sense of responsibility, and always found a way of come through in the end. More than once, she found herself cornered by several deadlines and had to push herself to the brink of collapse to finish everything. Having was trying to commit suicide in the past, Nekojiru had written wills on a number of occasions. Her last extant will dated from several years prior. She committed suicide on May 10, in 1998 with the cause of her suicide unknown. The accounts of how it affected her friends were also in the book.After some research on Chiyomi Hashiguchi doing a simple review wasn’t satisfactory for me. As depressing as it might have been reading the book knowing her tragic end I couldn’t find bring it in me to leave out what I learned about her. The book goes into detail about how she was as a person from accounts from those who her whereas I simply condensed the information I read. In turn, after learning all of this it has made me look at the short OVA in a different way. It’s depressing reading about Chiyomi Hashiguchi and what happened to her, but this OVA is proof she has not been forgotten which in a way makes me happy about its creation no matter what feeling the viewer will have after watching it.', ""I have to start with that this is probably THE weirdest movie I have ever seen.

Simply put, the answer is that this one had no end goal or general direction in mind. It crams - or tries to cram for lack of a better word - several ideas and themes down the viewer’s throat, and tries to present and highlight several topics and issues that aren’t even interminably connected, to the point where it becomes blurry as to what it’s reach and end goal is. It presents several ideas of religion, the circle of life, death and the afterlife, etc. yet it never explains why they are...there. These are all good ideas, and the presentation is not iffy in the slightest, but the problem here arises from how forced the presentation feels.

I am a fan of surrealism and of the art movie genre in general. I was sorely disapointed however. Despite all of the rave reviews and excitement around it I could never seem to get myself into the film. At first I tried to analyze every piece of it and work it into some overall theme. The problem is when it comes right down to it there is no theme or overall message present in the movie. It comes off as a jumbled mess of half ideas like they were sitting at the drawing board and decided this...scene would look really good here. I was lefting feeling like the creators had no idea in mind and that the movie had no message. Thinking I must be wrong and missing something of valuable importance I looked into it further and once again tried to analyze it but found a few scattered thoughts but nothing tangible. Finally I went to the source and tried to see what the director had to say and found that there was no meaning behind it and even the creator admits they put stuff in there just to mess with people leaving it up for the watcher to create their own meaning. In short sorely disapointed that I spent so much of my time on the film. I will give it a six out of ten simply because despite the lack of meaning I still did manage to find it to be a mildly entertaining the first time around. scene would look really good here.

There is no dialogue for starters, and after the first couple of minutes, there is barely any coherence either, just random scenes flashing across the screen. I just don\'t get it - what exactly is the point of this kind of anime? The art is ultra simplistic, the story is non-existent, and to...say the characters are zero dimensional would be flattering to the extreme. If it\'s suppose to be entertaining, then it failed as I found it intensely boring despite its short length.

Cat Soup belongs firmly in the second category; the creators themselves have proclaimed that it doesn't really mean anything but the storyline is bizarre enough to demand fair amounts of attention. I see this anime as, above all else, a visual experience and this review exists for the purpose of explaining why.As far as narration goes, Cat Soup speaks in strict visual language without any traces of verbal communication to convey its plot developments. The core of the...story is comprised of a journey that is neither a quest for self-discovery or knowledge but rather the tale of a cat named Nyako who searches for a piece of his sister's soul that's been stolen. Together the siblings face plenty of disturbing adversities ranging from a man dressed in bondage-gear attacking with a scissor as well as God himself accidentally causing some problems in the flow of time.Regardless of its gruesome intentions, Cat Soup maintains a decent level of sophistication but also creativity. Simply put, it boasts some of the most fascinating animation I've seen, not necessarily in terms of fluidity or detail but rather sheer imagination alone. This is backed up with lots of simplistic but suitable melodies that are about as quirky as the storyline itself.Characterization was never really a priority nor necessity with a project of such bizarre qualities but it ends up being memorable as well. Despite the lack of development or elaborations, most of the strange creatures encountered by the cat siblings are about as interesting as... well, everything else!Cat Soup is, in the end, an OVA that needs to be seen to be believed; not because it's a masterpiece but since it by far exceeds the promises of its title and premise with loads of eccentric insanity.

It’s a tale of two kitties, and i’m not talking about that abysmal Garfield sequel. Nyako and Nyatta are two sibling kittens living in a quaint little house with their parents, a doting homemaker mommy cat and a lazy, slovenly daddy cat. One day, while the older sister Nyako is fatally ill, her little brother Nyatta accidentily drowns while playing in the bathtub. Death doesn’t come for him, however, as a Japanese grim reaper comes for his sister, who passed moments before him. Taking advantage of this unique opportunity, Nyatta pursues the two, finds them...under a series of street lamps, and attempts to wrestle his older sister’s soul away from the deity. Their struggle unfortunately results in her soul being torn in half, with Nyatta and the reaper each getting away with an incomplete soul. Nyatta is revived by his father, at which point he returns the soul he recovered to the body it once inhabited.His sister comes back to life, but is she truly alive? With only half of her soul intact, she may have resumed breathing, but there’s no light in her eyes, and she’s basically been left in a sort of waking coma. She can eat and drink for herself, providing that you put food and water in her mouth, but she shows no sign of independent thought or movement. Not satisfied with this half-brained husk of a sibling. Nyatta embarks on a journey to bring her back to the way she was. He starts off by visiting a circus that allegedly specializes in creating spectacular miracles, under the hope that she can be revived there, but his hopes are dashed when the two of them are swept up in an odyssey of oddities, becoming sojourners of a strange, surreal space. They’ll battle to survive as they break through the very boundaries of reality, contending against drought, starvation, an unstable time frame, and the cruel whims of God himself, all while finding the answer to one simple, albeit haunting, question: How far would you go for the sake of your family?If there’s one thing that stands out about JC Staff, it’s that they don’t really seem to have a distinctive style. If I were to look at Excel Saga next to Toradora, or Karin next to Kill Me Baby, or even Index next to Ookamisan, I would never guess they were animated and produced by the exact same company. The majority of their work looks nothing alike, and this is nowhere as pronounced as it is with Cat Soup. JC Staff uses a variety of styles in this project, from fluidly animated traditional style to the kind of broken, frameless style that they’ve used in other anime to give the illusion of frenetic motion to what I can only describe as stop-motion animation of rough, graphic chalk drawings. Some of those styles probably sound cheap to you, but oh no, they spared to expense on this OVA, even though they’re animating what’s basically the story of a world of anthropomorphic animals, which nobody really needs to see in fluid motion. I mean, if you’ve seen the anime this one is based on, it wasn’t exactly the most lavish production.And these styles aren’t being used randomly, either, there’s a point to them throughout the story. We start out with traditional animation, but something amazing happens with it... Instead of keeping to a two dimensional perspective, JC Staff managed to pull off a three dimensional perspective without using a lick of CGI, employing an inventive use of shading, angles, and the occasional wide-angle lense. This style is largely on display when the cats themselves are on screen, rightfully painting their material as the “Real world” material, or as real as anthropomorphic animals can be. That’s not to say there’s no CG, as I’m pretty sure it shows up for certain shots involving water and gears, and a giant creature summoned during the carnival, but it’s used sparingly, and never as a crutch, instead appearing so that film can take advantage of it’s clash with 2D aesthetic. The broken style comes into play when actual humans are on screen, giving an other-worldly look to what should seem the most familiar to us. It’s also used on a figure that I’m going to presumptively call God, who shows up later on. Still, these people are somewhat cartoony, and to take the disparity between reality and fantasy even further, the chalky aesthetic is used in moments involving photorealistic people.There’s barely any music, with the first track only appearing around 12 minutes in, and with the exception of the last two tracks used, none of it is really worth mentioning, as what’s left is repetitive and generic sounding. They work well in context, and provide decent background music for certain scenes, but it’s not the kind of thing you’d really want to listen to independently. There is some very real beauty to the last two tracks, however, as a certain spoiler one does sound kind of heartwarming, and the ending tune sounds like an old music box being played with by a child. The opening tune which I didn’t lump in with the others, is your typical anime walking music, but with an old timey echo and a hypnotic underlay of footsteps and everyday noises making it into the likes of something you’ll swear you’ve never heard before. Speaking of everyday noises, while there’s little to no music throughout almost half of it, the sound design is amazing, with everything from the footsteps to chirping crickets to underwater sound distortion making it sound like you’re really there with the characters. There’s almost no dialogue, save for some text balloons accompanied by some meep-meep-meeping, so lets just move on.I wasn’t planning to write this review... It came about as a result of another idea that popped into my head, that it might be fun to write down my top ten series-based OVAs. This idea led to a second idea, which was “Hey, instead of just taking up one slot in my schedule this winter, how about I write a full review of the number one spot, and make it two?” Well, I wound up backing off of my original number one, when I realized that I’d already reviewed Wolf’s Rain, and I couldn’t talk at length about the last four episodes without giving away major spoilers. A-doy. In comes number 2 to the rescue, and Oh God, it’s Cat Soup. I was simultaneously excited and terrified of the corner I’d backed myself into, because I genuinely love this little film, but I didn’t know if there’d be enough talking points that a guy who refuses to review FLCL could successfully articulate. Upon second watch, however, I don’t think that’s going to be a problem. There’s a lot more here to unload then I thought.First things first, if I’m going to talk about Nekojiru Sou, I need to talk briefly about the whole Nekojiru thing. Chiyomi Hashiguchi was a manga artist in the eighties and nineties who took the traditional image of the good luck cats... The things Meowth was based on? And sent them on adventures that spoke to Japanese youths at the time through a bleak, pragmatic lens that explored the cruelty of the world with a casual, childish approach. It’s basically like if Ayn Rand were to direct a story set in the Busy World of Richard Scarry. Yes, you’ve got anthropomorphic animals talking in human languages and acting like people, but they also hunt and eat each other, both friend and foe. She committed suicide at the age of 31, and while her reasoning isn’t exactly known, there’s speculation that the success and commercialization of her work, combined with the creative exhaustion of having to fill more and more work orders may have overtaxed her already troubled mind. I mean, hell, her two main characters were just about to be adopted as safety mascots when she did it. Imagine how much that would have blown things up.Likewise, the two animated adaptations of her work were released posthumously. I haven’t read any of her original work, I’m only vaguely aware that her first comic involved a baby cat being killed and turned into soup after a botched neutering was performed to keep it quiet, but I am aware that the two releases represented different sides of her work. The series, Cat Soup Theater, or “Nekojiru Gekijou,” was based on her more common work, the Snoopy-like tales of Nyatta and Nyako. One of the most famous moments from this series involves the older girl’s friend, a pig, being brutally murdered and turned into pork cutlets by her father, who gives just as little of a shit as she does about the fact that he’s scared to die and having the only normal reaction to this deed. He’s ultimately fed to the family, as well as to his clueless little brother, all while his parents... Ahem, ‘pork,’ in the background. This clip was featured in AMV Hell 5 along with a song about how delicious pork is, because AMV Hell 5 wasn’t very good. Sorry, it’s true.The problem with having such a horrific event take place so early in the production is that there’s really nowhere else to go from there. You can’t very well bank on the shock value of people dying when a slide throws them into a brick wall or a little Tanuki getting shot in the head by Daddy cat when you’ve already gone into such dark territory, and if I’m being perfectly honest, the series wasn’t very good. Maybe it’s because I’m not the specific Japanese audience it was targeting at the time, and yeah, I can see things like this being more entertaining in comic form, but after such a huge bump early on, the rest of the show just felt kinda dull to me. Luckily, it wouldn’t be the only adaptation of Chiyomi Hashiguchi’s work, as we’d soon get Nekojiru Sou, which translates to Cat Soup Grass... Possibly a nod to the other side of her material that it would be representing. Yeah, some of her work was surreal and druggy enough to make Alice in Wonderland’s book look like the Disney version. The cartoon version, not the “Oh-ho-ho, look at silly Johnny Depp gasping whimsically in facepaint” version.The first time you watch Cat Soup, named in English releases after the creator, it may feel like little more than random weirdness. Even the opening segment is easy to get lost in, as the characters say nothing, and the OVA does little to nothing to explain to the viewer what’s going on. For some people, it takes a plot synopsis online just to figure out that Nyatta drowned just long enough to save Nyako from dying of her illness, and that’s with the giant foreshadowing clue of Nyatta playing in the bath with a truck, which would sink, instead of a floaty boat. Cat Soup relies on it’s viewers to use their brains to interpret and figure out what they’re watching, spoon-feeding you so little that even the little bit of thought bubble dialogue we’re given seems out of character for it. It’s easy to write it off as a couple of kitties eating some badly dated magic mushrooms and experiencing all of the other-worldly weirdness through the lens of their drug-addled eyes, and I’m sure on some level this assumption would be accurate to the comics, but to do so would be seriously reductive of the material.It took me multiple views to connect as many dots as I have, but Cat Soup isn’t random by any means. There are a few sequences I can’t place any significant meaning to, like a fish escaping from a horde of sword swinging samurai, but that doesn’t mean that there’s no meaning that can be found. For the most part, at least as far as I’ve observed, this thirty minute OVA is packed with complex metaphors that act as an extension of what Hasegawa’s original point was, as it carries two very important and interwoven themes with them. The first theme is the bleak nature of existence. The circle of life isn’t always life affirming like it is in the Lion King. The world is cruel, and life itself is harsh by it’s very own nature. Everything that’s born will inevitably die, and to believe that your brief existence holds any significance to a grand plan or that you’ll leave a major impact merely by existing is a childish illusion. Life continues in a cycle, nobody can escape from it, and even those who consider themselves prey are, in some way, predatory. Even if you don’t eat living things, you still use them, and often without thanks as they die for you.The other theme, and this may come as a surprise to anyone who can’t get past the casual cruelty of Hasegawa’s work, is the importance of family. The world is full of violence, people and animals die in massive numbers every day, history is full of people committing horrifying acts on one another, but it pays to focus your attention on those closest to you... To treasure and cherish your family and loved ones, because in the end, their lives mean the most to you, and their deaths are the ones you should go to the ends of the earth to prevent. According to Cat Soup, as is shown constantly throughout the film but most noticeably through a callback to the series’ disposal of pig characters, there’s nothing wrong with killing and taking advantage of others for the sake of your older sister, because in the end, she’s what should matter to you. It doesn’t even matter if you’re defying God... God is a fickle being who cares more about his next meal than the lives of people who are just going to be born to die anyway.I could go on and on with a point-by-point analysis of what everything in this OVA means... Or at least I could try to overcome the futility of doing so... But in the end, you’ve got to experience it for yourself. I haven’t figured everything out yet, but I still have faith that everything in this anime means something, however small, and not a second of screen time was wasted. I could explain the water-elephant, the tall mosquito figures, the stitches on the fat dude’s head, even the ending, but... No, I probably should say something about the ending, because that’s one of the most confusing parts of the show. I’m only ever going to do this once, because I swore I’d never recommend this dude’s work to anybody, but it’s the only way to help you out without spoiling anything. After watching Cat Soup, if you’re confused about the final segment, watch the movie Dogma. I’m not saying it’s a good movie, in fact I think Kevin smith is severely over-rated, but some parts of the movie will go a long way in explaining the end of this one.Cat Soup is available from... Well, nobody, really. It was released on two different DVD sets by Central Park Media, one in a normal case and a limited edition in a bloodier Liquid Art case, both versions now out of print. Nekojiru’s written works have not been released stateside, nor has the series the OVA was based on, but they can be imported from Japan. If you’re looking to read more on Chiyomi Hashiguchi, you can find an essay online by Thom Bailey at http://www.hz-journal.org/n5/bailey.html.I don’t think I’m overselling Cat Soup when I call it a surrealist masterpiece. It can be viewed from either the perspective of those looking to find meaning in it as well as by those who are just looking for some weird shit to look at, either to get stoned through or to confuse their friends with, and it works perfectly either way. I don’t entirely agree with everything it says, being that I am christian myself, but I still find it’s representation of a depressed individual’s outlook on life to be fascinating down to it’s core. It’s beautiful to look at, rich with introspection, and somehow manages to have a solid heart behind all of it’s cruel observations. To call it a major improvement over the preceding series would be like calling the Mona Lisa a major improvement over your tween cousin’s selfies. If I can find any flaw in it, it would be that the music was a bit lacking, but it was obviously never intending to have a huge soundtrack, and the brilliant sound design more than makes up for it. I can watch it multiple times a week without getting sick of it, and you should too. I give Cat Soup a 10/10. under a series of street lamps, and attempts to wrestle his older sister’s soul away from the deity. Their struggle unfortunately results in her soul being torn in half, with Nyatta and the reaper each getting away with an incomplete soul. Nyatta is revived by his father, at which point he returns the soul he recovered to the body it once inhabited.His sister comes back to life, but is she truly alive?

They work well in context, and provide decent background music for certain scenes, but it’s not the kind of thing you’d really want to listen to independently. There is some very real beauty to the last two tracks, however, as a certain spoiler one does sound kind of heartwarming, and the ending tune sounds like an old music box being played with by a child. The opening tune which I didn’t lump in with the others, is your typical anime walking music, but with an old timey echo and a hypnotic underlay of footsteps and everyday noises making it into the likes of something you’ll swear you’ve never heard before. Speaking of everyday noises, while there’s little to no music throughout almost half of it, the sound design is amazing, with everything from the footsteps to chirping crickets to underwater sound distortion making it sound like you’re really there with the characters. There’s almost no dialogue, save for some text balloons accompanied by some meep-meep-meeping, so lets just move on.I wasn’t planning to write this review... It came about as a result of another idea that popped into my head, that it might be fun to write down my top ten series-based OVAs. This idea led to a second idea, which was “Hey, instead of just taking up one slot in my schedule this winter, how about I write a full review of the number one spot, and make it two?” Well, I wound up backing off of my original number one, when I realized that I’d already reviewed Wolf’s Rain, and I couldn’t talk at length about the last four episodes without giving away major spoilers. A-doy. In comes number 2 to the rescue, and Oh God, it’s Cat Soup. I was simultaneously excited and terrified of the corner I’d backed myself into, because I genuinely love this little film, but I didn’t know if there’d be enough talking points that a guy who refuses to review FLCL could successfully articulate. Upon second watch, however, I don’t think that’s going to be a problem. There’s a lot more here to unload then I thought.First things first, if I’m going to talk about Nekojiru Sou, I need to talk briefly about the whole Nekojiru thing. Chiyomi Hashiguchi was a manga artist in the eighties and nineties who took the traditional image of the good luck cats... The things Meowth was based on? And sent them on adventures that spoke to Japanese youths at the time through a bleak, pragmatic lens that explored the cruelty of the world with a casual, childish approach. It’s basically like if Ayn Rand were to direct a story set in the Busy World of Richard Scarry. Yes, you’ve got anthropomorphic animals talking in human languages and acting like people, but they also hunt and eat each other, both friend and foe. She committed suicide at the age of 31, and while her reasoning isn’t exactly known, there’s speculation that the success and commercialization of her work, combined with the creative exhaustion of having to fill more and more work orders may have overtaxed her already troubled mind. I mean, hell, her two main characters were just about to be adopted as safety mascots when she did it. Imagine how much that would have blown things up.Likewise, the two animated adaptations of her work were released posthumously. I haven’t read any of her original work, I’m only vaguely aware that her first comic involved a baby cat being killed and turned into soup after a botched neutering was performed to keep it quiet, but I am aware that the two releases represented different sides of her work. The series, Cat Soup Theater, or “Nekojiru Gekijou,” was based on her more common work, the Snoopy-like tales of Nyatta and Nyako. One of the most famous moments from this series involves the older girl’s friend, a pig, being brutally murdered and turned into pork cutlets by her father, who gives just as little of a shit as she does about the fact that he’s scared to die and having the only normal reaction to this deed. He’s ultimately fed to the family, as well as to his clueless little brother, all while his parents... Ahem, ‘pork,’ in the background. This clip was featured in AMV Hell 5 along with a song about how delicious pork is, because AMV Hell 5 wasn’t very good. Sorry, it’s true.The problem with having such a horrific event take place so early in the production is that there’s really nowhere else to go from there. You can’t very well bank on the shock value of people dying when a slide throws them into a brick wall or a little Tanuki getting shot in the head by Daddy cat when you’ve already gone into such dark territory, and if I’m being perfectly honest, the series wasn’t very good. Maybe it’s because I’m not the specific Japanese audience it was targeting at the time, and yeah, I can see things like this being more entertaining in comic form, but after such a huge bump early on, the rest of the show just felt kinda dull to me. Luckily, it wouldn’t be the only adaptation of Chiyomi Hashiguchi’s work, as we’d soon get Nekojiru Sou, which translates to Cat Soup Grass... Possibly a nod to the other side of her material that it would be representing. Yeah, some of her work was surreal and druggy enough to make Alice in Wonderland’s book look like the Disney version. The cartoon version, not the “Oh-ho-ho, look at silly Johnny Depp gasping whimsically in facepaint” version.The first time you watch Cat Soup, named in English releases after the creator, it may feel like little more than random weirdness. Even the opening segment is easy to get lost in, as the characters say nothing, and the OVA does little to nothing to explain to the viewer what’s going on. For some people, it takes a plot synopsis online just to figure out that Nyatta drowned just long enough to save Nyako from dying of her illness, and that’s with the giant foreshadowing clue of Nyatta playing in the bath with a truck, which would sink, instead of a floaty boat. Cat Soup relies on it’s viewers to use their brains to interpret and figure out what they’re watching, spoon-feeding you so little that even the little bit of thought bubble dialogue we’re given seems out of character for it. It’s easy to write it off as a couple of kitties eating some badly dated magic mushrooms and experiencing all of the other-worldly weirdness through the lens of their drug-addled eyes, and I’m sure on some level this assumption would be accurate to the comics, but to do so would be seriously reductive of the material.It took me multiple views to connect as many dots as I have, but Cat Soup isn’t random by any means. There are a few sequences I can’t place any significant meaning to, like a fish escaping from a horde of sword swinging samurai, but that doesn’t mean that there’s no meaning that can be found. For the most part, at least as far as I’ve observed, this thirty minute OVA is packed with complex metaphors that act as an extension of what Hasegawa’s original point was, as it carries two very important and interwoven themes with them. The first theme is the bleak nature of existence. The circle of life isn’t always life affirming like it is in the Lion King. The world is cruel, and life itself is harsh by it’s very own nature. Everything that’s born will inevitably die, and to believe that your brief existence holds any significance to a grand plan or that you’ll leave a major impact merely by existing is a childish illusion. Life continues in a cycle, nobody can escape from it, and even those who consider themselves prey are, in some way, predatory. Even if you don’t eat living things, you still use them, and often without thanks as they die for you.The other theme, and this may come as a surprise to anyone who can’t get past the casual cruelty of Hasegawa’s work, is the importance of family. The world is full of violence, people and animals die in massive numbers every day, history is full of people committing horrifying acts on one another, but it pays to focus your attention on those closest to you... To treasure and cherish your family and loved ones, because in the end, their lives mean the most to you, and their deaths are the ones you should go to the ends of the earth to prevent. According to Cat Soup, as is shown constantly throughout the film but most noticeably through a callback to the series’ disposal of pig characters, there’s nothing wrong with killing and taking advantage of others for the sake of your older sister, because in the end, she’s what should matter to you. It doesn’t even matter if you’re defying God... God is a fickle being who cares more about his next meal than the lives of people who are just going to be born to die anyway.I could go on and on with a point-by-point analysis of what everything in this OVA means... Or at least I could try to overcome the futility of doing so... But in the end, you’ve got to experience it for yourself. I haven’t figured everything out yet, but I still have faith that everything in this anime means something, however small, and not a second of screen time was wasted. I could explain the water-elephant, the tall mosquito figures, the stitches on the fat dude’s head, even the ending, but... No, I probably should say something about the ending, because that’s one of the most confusing parts of the show. I’m only ever going to do this once, because I swore I’d never recommend this dude’s work to anybody, but it’s the only way to help you out without spoiling anything. After watching Cat Soup, if you’re confused about the final segment, watch the movie Dogma. I’m not saying it’s a good movie, in fact I think Kevin smith is severely over-rated, but some parts of the movie will go a long way in explaining the end of this one.Cat Soup is available from... Well, nobody, really. It was released on two different DVD sets by Central Park Media, one in a normal case and a limited edition in a bloodier Liquid Art case, both versions now out of print. Nekojiru’s written works have not been released stateside, nor has the series the OVA was based on, but they can be imported from Japan. If you’re looking to read more on Chiyomi Hashiguchi, you can find an essay online by Thom Bailey at http://www.hz-journal.org/n5/bailey.html.I don’t think I’m overselling Cat Soup when I call it a surrealist masterpiece. It can be viewed from either the perspective of those looking to find meaning in it as well as by those who are just looking for some weird shit to look at, either to get stoned through or to confuse their friends with, and it works perfectly either way. I don’t entirely agree with everything it says, being that I am christian myself, but I still find it’s representation of a depressed individual’s outlook on life to be fascinating down to it’s core. It’s beautiful to look at, rich with introspection, and somehow manages to have a solid heart behind all of it’s cruel observations. To call it a major improvement over the preceding series would be like calling the Mona Lisa a major improvement over your tween cousin’s selfies. If I can find any flaw in it, it would be that the music was a bit lacking, but it was obviously never intending to have a huge soundtrack, and the brilliant sound design more than makes up for it. I can watch it multiple times a week without getting sick of it, and you should too. I give Cat Soup a 10/10.', 'Cat Soup is not something you\'ll want to read a review of before watching. It\'s completely pointless, and will make the actual watching less enjoyable. Instead, I\'d prefer you to read this AFTER you have finished watching, be it because you want to see others\' thoughts or shape your own, or to understand what you\'ve seen or whatnot.The first thing that comes to mind while watching is that this is not a story told, nor an idea that can be put to words being conveyed, but rather a ""journey of the state of mind"". I believe this is the best way I can describe the...experience of watching Nekojiru-sou. Or so I would like to say, but there are two ways to watch the OVA. And both I believe are equally as important, and so I feel was meant by the author; don\'t quote me on that though. The two ways are:• ""The journey of the state of mind""• Seeing the actual plotAlthough much depends on the viewer, the way you watch Cat Soup gradually changes by itself, from the ""Journey"" to ""seeing that the author(s) actually meant a lot of things"". It changes from an abstract painting into a book.Let me first describe ""the journey of the state of mind"" part.Just as with any abstract work of art, once you\'ve ""tuned into it"", for the lack of better term, it can become a most powerful medium. If you can\'t, or won\'t ""tune in"" however, you\'ll just see random crap. Period. Now... If you let your mind be guided by the atmosphere, shape and ideas of the movie, you are guaranteed to get a ton of enjoyment. It\'s hard to describe this kind of enjoyment. You know how it feels good when you watch a good Mecha with a lot of fighting? Now compare this to the ""feels good"" of a quality love story... Well, the feeling is just as different for Nekojiru-sou. The best I can do to describe it is, I feel refreshed. In a way that my mind feels... clean? Blank and clean, but very pleasant. Don\'t confuse for ""What."" blank, as after a mindfuck or anything of the sorts please.The actual plot, or rather the ""idea"", is a whole another thing to discuss. Now this is important: this is an abstract work of art. You must know by know that any perception of it depends more on the consumer than on the author, even. Keep it in mind. My opinion can\'t be ""right"" by default - I\'m conveying how I saw it.Now, let me rephrase the movie\'s name for a second: ""The Story of Life"". That\'s all. This is the most simple, the most beautiful way you can describe the thing. As the two (one and a half?) kittens make their way through the somewhat bizarre world, they witness life, naked. The story makes no remarks about the cruelty of it. Since I have to put this into words... The cruelty here strikes more than any violent movie, anime or other medium would do, because, among other things, it\'s shown without excessive emotion to hide behind, without reason... It\'s stated, it\'s a fact. Yet, it doesn\'t hurt at all. You know how in a good story, a character\'s death (if put right) can be extremely depressing, sad..? It\'s not the case here. The anime makes you experience extreme acceptance. You see and accept the way of life - you\'re born, you live, you die. You kill to live. You die to feed somebody, you want it or not. So? It\'s the way it is - it\'s not anything you have control over, anything you\'d want to take control over. Not anything to be happy or sad about, just a fact. That\'s the feeling I experienced while watching this. It might seem far fetched, or maybe weird, or alien to somebody perhaps, but if you\'ve watched the OVA by now, maybe you\'ll know exactly how I feel.In other words, Cat Soup is a perfect depiction to the ""Circle of Life"" - capitalized to emphasize how it\'s the idea of the anime. Not only life ends and rises, but so does time and existence, and Earth along with them. There was a very interesting concept of God too, but putting that into words seems unnecessary to me - even I don\'t exactly know what I\'d say - it only imprinted on my subconsciousness.But broad and general ideas are not the only thing about this work of art (both in the way you\'d call any anime a work of art - by definition; and Cat Soup in its own special way). There is a huge amount if miniature episodes, conveying different, often very deep ideas.The biggest of them all was the circus episode. *To understand what I\'m actually talking about, you\'d want the whole OVA watched by now.* You should remember God showing miracles, right? It\'s all the same for him, either to create a chair, or an elephant made of gold. Come to think of it, it\'s nothing weird - regardless of what you believe in, the sole idea of God implies no difference to him between these objects. Whether he actually exists and thus is there really a difference is a completely different topic though. Now back to my story - shortly after that, people adopted his way; enter the giant bird. And here\'s the idea, as people tear its left off just to see a little magic. That\'s us, people; that\'s how we roll. And then Earth got flooded - isn\'t it similar to our present world? Although not literally, but you won\'t find a person who hasn\'t heard of the story of how we are draining nature\'s resources and doing reckless things just to live in comfort for a little longer. Shall we keep this up, and there\'s not much future to await us - be it natural disasters, ecosystem\'s collapse, a war caused by the ever rising economical and political tensions...This idea\'s nothing new... However not only it\'s relevant today too, but the way how beautifully it was conveyed grants it my mention all by itself.Also, the flood is not mere coincidence I believe - but it\'s very symbolic. Don\'t look at ""pulling the bird\'s leg"" as something we are doing right now - it\'s what will happen in the end, soon or not. It\'s the ""final sin"" that\'s followed by a global flood. Doesn\'t it remind you of anything? That may be the authors\' message regarding our human nature, our ""global"" lifestyle - and they portray people pretty accurately - at least right now we mostly consume... The boat that the characters use can be perceived as none other but an arc, too. So, pretty symbolic among other things.All right, that\'s one of the anime\'s ""human nature"" depiction. Note how people perceived ""God\'s"" miracles as mere entertainment too.There\'s much more to it, but I believe I can begin to conclude my review already. Besides, you\'d get 10 times as much if you watch the real thing instead of reading my analysis. I tried not to use cliche\'d expressions as ""beautiful"" when talking about the story, but forgetting about that, the story is indeed ""beautiful"". And you know, this anime reminds me of a piece of music - in a lot of ways. And what impression did it leave on me? This is something that goes broader that the term ""anime"" provides. I don\'t see it as an ""anime"", but rather as a separate piece of art. Something in between a painting and a musical composition, all animated and given a soul. That creates a problem, though; when I began to rate it. You see, this is not something you can rate the same way you rate other anime, exactly due to the reasons I stated above. I can\'t put it on the same scales as other anime I\'ve watched.I usually compare my anime depending on the emotional footprint they left on me. I had a big big depression after watching Neon Genesis Evangelion for example (prior to that too... but NGE propelled it exponentially), or when I read the Deep Love series I cried like a little girl... In other words, I was overfilled with emotion. This isn\'t the case here, but it isn\'t the anime\'s goal either. It\'s silly to blame a car for being unable to swim. So, if you rate this independently, it\'s 10/10. Since I (try my best to) approach every movie, anime, book or manga in its own way, looking at what it really is without the interference of genres\' cliches and whatnot, Nekojiru-sou is indeed a 10/10. Not the 10/10 you see on every other review, but a special, meaningful 10/10 that reserved the place for this anime in my heart forever. When I put it in my list though, I hesitated for a while. 9 or 10? Because, I\'ll tell you - it\'s not as big as NGE, no matter if you loved NGE or not. It\'s not as big as Gurren Lagann. That\'s not bad or good. It\'s different. And there\'s a lot of things to love it for that you won\'t find in any NGE or TTGL. experience of watching Nekojiru-sou.

The youngest child is try to cheer him up by going to a circus, but everything goes wrong...Yet it does have a bit of a happy atmosphere, even though the story seems a bit sad.I really like the OVA, because it is so random you can always watch it!^^ "", 'An abstract anime that  brilliantly captures the feelings of dreams and nightmares.  The music is often lighthearted and causes the viewer to question the seriousness of what he / she is seeing.  There is a lot of repeated imagry in this film which has a strange effect on those that notice it.  There is also a lot of symbolism.  I will not go any further into this but I had a fun time watching the macabre scenes shilst analyzing the possible meanings and links.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a dream-like anime which never ceases to surprise whoever...is watching! is watching!', 'The plot of cat soup is simple, but easy to miss without a small summary, so here is a quick one: a young girl kitten is bed ridden with illness, close to death. Her younger brother sees a spirit take his sister`s soul with it, and he fights to take the soul back. He only gets half of it, which is enough to keep her alive, but brain dead. They set off on a journey to find a flower that will return her to normal. I made the mistake of not reading a synopsis.  Because the cats all look alike at first and there`s...no voice acting to help distinguish them, I didn`t recognize what was going on. One thing to note is that the brother wears a green shirt and shorts while the sister wears a peach colored shirt and a skirt that looks a lot like shorts. You`ll figure this out eventually, but it sure makes a lot more sense if you know this from the get go (I thought the sister was a brother until a text bubble corrected me).Cat Soup is a 30 minute mind trip. The whole journey is one largely unrelated piece of insanity after another. Like a mumbling senile man, it`s hard to translate what he`s saying with syntax and logic, but you often get the feeling that you kind of understand on some deeper, yet simpler level, what he`s trying to get at. Themes like nature, gluttony, time, god, and how disgustingly sick some people can be are represented. They`re there, but there`s no way I could articulate in sentence form some message that each scene was trying to convey.  The film highlights these ideas viscerally instead of providing any philosophical insights.Cat Soup doesn`t require a whole lot of dissection to appreciate. There`s certainly room for dissection if braving the vagueness of this silent film isn`t too daunting a task. The themes are all illustrated clearly, but Cat Soup never dwells.  Those who love to deconstruct every detail will have plenty of fodder here, and the rest of us will probably come away with a primal understanding of what the film is trying to convey.It`s easier on the viewer when the metaphors are direct. When the viewer can pick out a clear and pointed message like ""be good to nature"" or ""life is precious,"" provided he makes the astute observations necessary to decode the symbolism.  It almost adds a layer of satisfaction.  On the other hand, pointed messages can often come off as pretentious, treating the viewer like a 5 year old listening to a fairy tale with a moral.  Too often is the presentation of these messages unabashedly contrived, or overt.  Cat Soup`s approach to its central theme of death is decidedly more emotional, which in one sense is more complex than a simple message, but because it tries to tug more at your heart strings than your higher thought processes, it`s in a different sense, simpler, more primal.  While I would love to discuss it, describing it any further will surely spoil the experience.

When the viewer can pick out a clear and pointed message like ""be good to nature"" or ""life is precious,"" provided he makes the astute observations necessary to decode the symbolism.  It almost adds a layer of satisfaction.  On the other hand, pointed messages can often come off as pretentious, treating the viewer like a 5 year old listening to a fairy tale with a moral.  Too often is the presentation of these messages unabashedly contrived, or overt.  Cat Soup`s approach to its central theme of death is decidedly more emotional, which in one sense is more complex than a simple message, but because it tries to tug more at your heart strings than your higher thought processes, it`s in a different sense, simpler, more primal.  While I would love to discuss it, describing it any further will surely spoil the experience.  Like looking at a painting where you can trace the painter`s brush strokes, Cat Soup lets you trace the inspirational emotions that sparked the need to make this film.', ""As a major fan of surrealism, I love this movie more than I can express.This is exactly what this movie is. An adaptation of an amazing (now deceased, sadly) mangaka who's works centered around her subconscious. Even the characters depicted are based off her dreams, her trademark characters.Anyone familiar with her stories would not be surprised about the content of this movie.If you enjoy surreal, dream-like tales and the sort of morbid world that can only come from the subconscious mind, you will love this movie. I've watched it 3, maybe 4 times in the past 6 months. The imagery and mysterious atmosphere of...the movie invoke an astonishing lonely and wholesome feeling as you watch a small cat traverse his wacky, unbelievable world to attempt to save his sister all the while remaining silent near almost the entirety of the film.There's something childlike and innocent that creates an amazing contrast between the dark and macabre setting of the story; yet it retains this innocence throughout it's entirety. It has the mysterious, nonsensical element that can only be seen in surreal works.Even though I amend it, I can see why casual anime fans would dislike this. The way this anime is, when compared to the checklist applied to 'everyday' anime, could not even compete in interest. You have to criticise this movie as a work of postmodern art, rather than an anime meant to entertain in the ways more popular anime does. The storyline of this movie, for example, when applied to any other setting, would probably come out dull, lame, and unbelievable. When it's applied to Cat Soup? I wouldn't have it any other way.In the end, this movie will be/is loved by fans of nekojiru, people that want to remember her for her unique works, and fans of surrealism. Casual anime fans, however, will probably have no interest nor appreciation for something like Cat Soup. the movie invoke an astonishing lonely and wholesome feeling as you watch a small cat traverse his wacky, unbelievable world to attempt to save his sister all the while remaining silent near almost the entirety of the film.There's something childlike and innocent that creates an amazing contrast between the dark and macabre setting of the story; yet it retains this innocence throughout it's entirety.

Because, even though I've watched it, I still don't really understand it... so let's see how this review goes!Story (9): It's... a strange one, I'll give it that. I must thank the people that directed me to that, because it really is awesome. Confusing, but awesome. I can't really tell you what the story is about, because I don't undertand it... but it's about two cats, which I think that the older sister cat lost her soul or something because she drowned. Most of the humans are replaced with cats, but it's interesting. There wasn't one...point in the whole thing where I wasn't going WHAT THE FUCK?!?Art (10): The art in this is so cute! I just love it all! Some of the characters looked so strange that it just made it even more enjoyable. Most of the time, the strange characters were the few humans in this.Sound (10): Well, I can't criticise the voice actors, because there weren't any... talk about saving money on the cast. =P Any time there was talking, it was in a bubble. The background music was usually very pretty, which made it confusing as to why it was in there, but it somehow fit.Character (9): Since there was no character development in this, and there wasn't meant to be, I can't really criticise that, either. But other than that, the characters were pretty awesome. Don't know a whole lot about them, though...Enjoyment (9): There were times where I actually had to stop watching for a minute, because I was trying to figure things out, which never worked... and I found the part when they were at the circus kind of boring. But other than that, it was really fun to watch.Overall (9): My rating of the anime altogether is actually a seven, but if I break it down like this, then it comes out to be a nine (which doesn't really make sense.) There isn't much that you could bash in this, except for maybe the fact that you can't understand ANYTHING, but I think that that was the point of this anime. It's just fun to watch!If you have half an hour to waste, I suggest you go find this. It is just... psychologically fucked up. It's seriously hard to explain if you've never seen it before. It's not long, and it's just interesting. I suggest it, as long as you don't mind seeing some really messed up stuff.

How can anyone resist that?I am now sincerely glad I did. It is one of the strangest and greatest animes I have watched to date. The story is simple, the music practically nonexistent, and the characters don't speak, so as a result you have no choice but to be plunged headfirst into the eerie, empty, echoing world of these disturbingly cute cats. The animation itself is clear and colourful, the movement smooth...to the extent of unnatural.One truly great element is the complete lack of rational method in which any scene was thought out. One moment they are in a field, the next they are sliding down a glass wave; their reactions and moods completely unpredictable. This is the same right to the end. Don't 'expect' anything. You will be wrong.The artwork itself in this short film is the thing I must applaud most however. It is beautifully drawn; everything is ever so slightly abnormal, supernatural, or macabre. Normality is skewed beautifully - it is both inspiring and disturbing, and the balance between childish enjoyment and adult themes have been balanced to perfection. You don't need to understand it to enjoy it, but if you do catch some of the much darker undertones, the whole thing hits that much harder, and leaves you pondering the meaning of life for the next hour and a half.There needs to be more anime out there like this.

In the movie there are many dynamics of influence, scenery, imagery, and philosophical impressions. It follows the story of a small cat trying to get his sisters souls back. Even though it is a short movie it was one that really captivated me. ', 'Hauntingly beautiful. The visuals are so striking and otherworldly. There are so many creative ideas thrown about that it’s sort of hard to really keep track of what is happening. However, I think attaching meaning to every little scene is a bit wrong. Yes the imagery is symbolic of various ideas but we as the viewer are meant to react in awe contrasting the expressionless reactions of the adorable cats as they walk through both hellish and dreamlike landscapes. The humor is very dry and dark, but instead of it being edgy for the sake of being weird it adds to the atmosphere. I also...love the music, as it perfectly captures the vibes of the scenes. Oddly enough, for a movie with no supposed “meaning” it made me very emotional. There’s an odd and inexplicable sense of melancholy with a beautiful hint of nostalgic loneliness that I wish I had the writing prowess to properly convey. The exploration of death and the cruelness of the cats and the world, contrasts the cute and dreamy visuals so hard that it gives you whiplash. I believe only the circus scene is an actual adaptation of the manga, and everything else is original. I’ll be checking out the original work very soon but this is an amazing tribute.

Not so far above your head to be completely obscure, yet artistic with creative scene ideas. Nice, memorable, and quick watch worth your half an hour of time.*** Story ***The official synopsis is this:  Nyatta, an anthropomorphic kitten, on his travel to the land of the dead and back in an effort to save his sister\'s soul.My own summary goes like this. Two dead kitten siblings go on a journey into an afterlife world, experience many scenes with highly symbolic and religious imagery from several religions, such as creation, a flood,...temptation, and a mechanical butterfly. The younger brother eventually heals his onee-san, and both return to life in a 2001-esque scene. There they find their impoverished family whom we already met at the beginning, and everybody goes to sleep. The end.At least this what I see after reading into the plot a bit using essays. The story is exclusively told by means of surreal imagery with very little and insignificant dialog only. No two persons will fully agree on what happens. The several dozens of surrealistic scenes are loosely connected by the kids\' voyage. Some of the ideas presented are absolutely stunning and blistering with creativity. Fortunately, the anime never loses itself completely in inaccessible symbolism. While not having done it myself, I\'m quite sure given the official synopsis, you can narrow down each scene to a religious concept and interpret it. Which doesn\'t stop the anime from bending your unprepared mind on first watch.I like the full circle the story takes, off the children\'s home and back to there again. I also like that the surreal ideas are really weird, but accessible enough to tell a coherent story one can actually follow. It\'s just short (or long) enough to not become boring. And having a proper overarching plot with a classic conclusion is just satisfying and calming classic story telling. If the conclusion is what it seems is open to interpretation again, of course. All in all, an above average story told in a creative and unconventional way. (8/10)*** Animation ***The animation is about as average as it gets, neither standing out nor hurting the experience with sub-par visuals. Neither the characters nor the backgrounds are very detailed or complex, but their animation is quite fluent. Some scenes were given increased detail level, for example the water effect right at the beginning and the circus scenes. An unspectacular (5/10).*** Sound ***Much of what was said about animation holds for the sound effects as well. They are reliably present and supporting the visuals well, but nothing spectacular. Most of the time there is no music playing, just the noises of the world. When music is used, it is picked to support the visuals, e.g. when samurais slice a fish typical ancient japan music plays. But these musical interludes are short and not particularly impressive compositions, more like functional music setting or supporting a mood. Another unspectacular (5/10).*** Character ***The two protagonists, Nyatto and his medically brain-damaged onee-san, are travelers in a strange world. They discover it and interact with what they find, but they have no real personalities standing out or developing  with time. This allows only for a low rating here, and this is not because the anime\'s writing would be exceptionally bad. It just comes with the story which puts emphasis on the world, not the protagonists experiencing it.The nearly same holds for the personified actors in some scenes, such as the creator god, the hindu god, or the evil person wanting to eat them. They are just there because the surreal scene needs a humanoid, not because they are real characters. In the end, I could count them into ""characters"" or ""story"", but I will distribute points for them only once. And my decision is to consider them just plot devices, resulting in an overall (3/10).*** Enjoyment ***Yup, I enjoyed it. The 32 minutes of run-time were certainly better spent on this little acid trip than on vanilla seasonal junk food. You of course need to enjoy it at the story level, and accept surreal symbols as story telling first hand. And that\'s already the verdict, same as the story minus one for average execution.

Recommended.', ""I'm writing this review after reading most of Nekojiru's work, however Cat Soup was my introduction to her. Knowing more about her story, her death, and her work, this short feels like a true love-letter to Nekojiru as a person, rather than just as a creator. It features the more introspective and absurdist chapters from Nekojiru Udon, and strings them together into a beautiful narrative about life and death, and everything between.This is the kind of thing that requires some background to fully appreciate and understand, however it can still be enjoyed by a complete outsider to Nekojiru's work, although its meanings and message...may seem a little vague. I'd highly recommend you watch this, loock at Nekojiru's work, specifically Nekojiru Udon Volume 1, and then go back to watch it a second time.The art direction is on point, encapsulating Nekojiru's artstyle yet transporting it to another dimension, devoid of most of the blatant shock humor, yet it still makes subtle references to Nekojiru's iconic humor. Nyatto and Nyata's relationship feels very real and human, despite them being neither real nor human.Cat Soup feels like a journey through Nekojiru's mind; it shows her fears, experiences, and life, through metaphors that play on ideas she initially made in much more light-hearted contexts. It slowly devolves into madness yet showcases the strength of hope and love, a theme that is only vaguely implied in her comics, through Nyatto and Nyata's relationship as siblings.Overall, this is a perfect capsule of the soul of Nekojiru—all of her dreams, stories, and experiences— and it leaves you feeling melancholic yet appreciative of life and its beauties. may seem a little vague.

I can therefore say, many will be turned off.  After all, surrealism is not the most appreciated sub-genre.  Nekojiro-sou is strange, but good, understandable as its director is Tatsuo Satou, with Masaaki Yuasa behind him (and heavily involved).  Thereofre, if you are a fan Yuasa you will appreciate this title.  Also, those of you who enjoy Mind Game, Serial Experiments Lain, and especially Kaiba, check this out. Inversely, if you are not a fan of unfettered absurdism, with stream-of-consciousness plot pacing, avoid.Let's break...it down:Story (8):For Nekojiru-sou, story is 'what happens'.  In other words, it is paced in an uncontrolled manner: think Seinfeld.  Truly, surrealist plots are best when progressed in a stream-of-consciousness manner.  Nekojiro-sou effectively does this.Art (9):The art/animation is what you would expect from an independent studio's work in the late 90's/early 2000's.  I personally prefer it; it is able to effectively create a surreal atmosphere.  No reason to scrutinize too farr-it has only a 30 minute run time.  From my recollection, the color pallet is drab and unsettling, and animation itself, fluid.Character (9):Again, since stream of consciousness plots are unconventional, the character arc is surely hard to judge, other than whether characters are out of place in the world they are created in, I suppose.  The characters are minimally portrayed, as I recollect, as dialogue is reduced to word bubbles, and noises.  They are cats after all.  This segues to sound.Sound (9):The soundtrack piqued my interest as it was very atmospheric, befitting the context of Nekojiru-sou's 'world'.  It adds to the inclination of weird that is Nekojiru-sou.Enjoyment (10):If you are a fan of off-kilter things and want to watch something different, this is for you.  Perhaps not so hidden of a gem, but a gem nonetheless.  Ultimately, the short was a refreshing rabbit hole to dive into, albeit for only a small duration. it down:Story (8):For Nekojiru-sou, story is 'what happens'.

The characters (of few words) are yet colorful and spike the primal curiosity that remains present for the entirety of the 30~ minutes of run time. Sounds in the film are coordinated in a wonderful scheme that helps bring the viewer even deeper into this easily manipulable, and wild world.I will say that the enjoyment of this film is highly based on whether you have an affinity for abstract workings. Therefore, it...is understandable if some do not enjoy such a film but even working through a tough medium like animation, the enjoyment of this film is incredible. All it takes to see how incredible it is; is to pay attention to the scape that is provided to you. The art is eye-candy but there are prevalent frame-rate issues, while they may be intentional, are often quite distracting from the surrounding scenery.Overall I give this film a solid 9 out of 10 where my only complaint rested on frame-rate issues.

None other than the “great” Masaaki Yuasa.  I use great in parenthesis, because besides Ping Pong The Animation, I tend to believe his work is a bit overrated (still good, just not great).  The Tatami Galaxy, for example, was far from a masterpiece, as it reused tired anime tropes, and revealed its central philosophical thrust — to grasp onto the opportunities that lie in front of you, and stop chasing the rose-colored, “perfect” life — in the very first episode, rendering much of what came...afterwards as trivial fluff.  It was a lean 11 episodes, but, honestly speaking, it could have been six, due to its repetitive nature.Keeping this in mind, If Tatami galaxy suffers from excessive explaining and revealing its theme(s) too forwardly, then Nekojiru-sou (Cat Soup) collapses from an antithetical reason — not having a theme at all.  This is not to say there aren’t interesting ideas presented to the viewer for deeper contemplation, such as: animal cruelty, the transience of life, and the interconnectedness of all species towards collective sustainability (e.g. the cat poops, and the fish eat the poop).  That all being said, however, the anime film must be recognized for what it is, and far more importantly, for what it is not.  And what it is not, is a competent work with an identifiable message that resonates with the audience long after the initial viewing experience.To put it bluntly: obscurity + random ideas (that have no association with one another) = crap! afterwards as trivial fluff.

Does one have to get the level of detail and intrinsic messages to fully comprehend the authentic nature of this visual beauty, ermm… I don\'t know, they kinda just wooshed all over the place and warped the setting way too much. Probably a reference to the distorted reality around here. That makes sense considering how black the comedy was in the original TV series.Oh, there is no dialogue either. It has manga speech text though, you have to make do with that if nothing else.Anyhow, the anime was indeed strange, it took a path and kept taking that path until it ended abruptly. It is good, is there an underlying message? Maybe it is just a visual representation of some ideas. Whatever it is. It was certainly a very good idea.Have you ever been, to the Cat Soup?It melts,your mind.Overall, 8/10. What else is there?

Personally, I love Nekojiru-sou for its weirdness and abstract art. It takes you on a journey through psychedelic world which is so fluent that you involuntarily get immersed and try to follow or even uncode what is happening. I could compare it to a dream because of this abstraction. Though, the difference is you will probably be trying to figure out the meaning of everything while watching. It's extremely absorbing as nothing in particular is clear. I'm not going...to share my reflections as they're completely individual and most probably different from others'. The point is, somehow Nekojiru-sou gives an impression of connection to the real world in a way. The reality in the show is twisted and kind of unstable but at the same time calm (at least this was my feeling), as if the bizarre occurances were quite normal there. Simuntaniouosly, I was following the two cats in this madness and wondering how or if those strange events affect them. I could say the show inspires to raise a few questions and interprete the odd journey to perhaps come up with some conclusions. On the other hand, everything is very fluid. Maybe it indeed is pure randomness. However, it doesn't change the fact it was pleasent to let my mind immerse in such an original creation.The animation and music are also specific but at the same time done greatly. They help create this weird reality. Actually, everything was so fluid and smooth that it seemed to me much shorter in duration than it is. I wish it lasted longer.I can recommend Nekojiru-sou to those who would like to watch something completely different, even psychedelic and absolutely open to interpretation. to share my reflections as they're completely individual and most probably different from others'.

There are elements which guide you right from the beginning, but as the story progresses, you keep those elements in mind purely as markers of reference. Put another way... its like being lost in a maze and making your way through it, only to realize, there was nothing achieved once you are free from the maze. And frankly, there wasn\'t much else to say for the story other than it used the art for progression.The same perspective applies to Character, frankly speaking. Although they seem developed, they are heavily reliant...on the art and sound in order to portray their own arcs. Of all the anime that I have seen, this one has the most... subtle and mysterious characters I have ever seen. Very bizarre presentation to say the least. But the fascinating bizarre that grips you and pushes you forward.Art and Sound:I have absolutely no way of stating it other than: the most intriguing use of modern ""abstract"" art-style anime I have come across, with a succinct, atmospheric, and engrossing score. This anime\'s characters - with extremely limited dialogues - do not have a single voice actor saying anything. It is reliant almost purely on visuals - a clever trick to enhance the experience of this anime. However, both the sound and the art work side by side to present the themes that this anime discusses. And those themes range from the story\'s barebone plot, through to very visual critiques of a philosophical and sociological nature.In a way, the art reminded me of Monty Python (but far less ""humorous"") and even some very obscure, and very lesser known anime like Tenshi no Tamago (""Angel Egg"", 1986), and some even lesser known short films (Eastern European ones, mostly). It certainly is something worth watching once, and particularly when the ending is reached... leaving a haunting, empty feeling in its wake. on the art and sound in order to portray their own arcs.

The visuals are absolutely incredible, and everything is animated very nicely.However, the part where it falls apart for me is the incredible lack of a plot, storyline, or character development. The main characters simply go on this wild adventure through these random lands of insanity and they discover them together with the viewer, without having much of a personality at all, simply being there essentially as a...surrogate for the viewer.Thus, there really isn't much to be said about why any of the stuff on-screen is happening, it simply just happens... for seemingly no reason.The art is nice, and REALLY interesting to look at, so it's worth watching for that alone. I also really like the soundtrack, which gives the whole thing this creepy, atmospheric tone. However, I can't simply ignore it's faults on the story side of things.

You can look at other reviews and opinions of it to see what I mean. It\'s definitely not however at the other end of the spectrum, I wouldn\'t call cat soup a...masterpiece but it\'s definitely worth a watch.

I just thought this was worth noting as someone almost entirely desensitised to violence when humanity is involved, I still find seeing violence towards animals upsetting. If however you can get past the initial discomfort it may cause, it\'s not exactly a core theme of the OVA.

This is not for kid. But fun your up to watch something scary in a anime wait. XD ', 'Nekojiru is the pseudonym for a mangaka that had a brief stint of popularity in the \'90s, and was known for purveying a sense of strikingly cruel, social commentary from the perspective of young, cat characters. Nekojiru is a portmanteau of the Japanese words: neko ねこ ""cat"", and shiru しる ""soup,"" creating ねこぢる (""cat soup""). The creator was born Chiyomi Nakayama, and then would later change her name to Chiyomi ""Hashiguchi."" Ms. Hashiguchi tragically died on May 10th, 1998, from suicide, only eight days after the death of HIDE from X Japan. People close to Ms. Hashiguchi claim that the two had nothing to do...with each other, the mangaka had stated that she didn\'t like rock music because it was too ""noisy"" and preferred to listen to Aphex Twin records.From Ms. Hashiguchi\'s biography, she seemed to be a very troubled and eccentric woman. Supposedly, she was bone-thin because she viewed eating solid foods as repulsive. According to her spouse, when she would go to restaurants, she would only order plain broth. A close friend claimed that Ms. Hashiguchi was utterly repulsed by raw meat and fish, saying that she would often say that, ""The taste of blood is disgusting.""This sentiment is echoed throughout her works, even the name ""Cat Soup"" hints at her disgust towards the consumption of other living beings. In her comics, there is a caste-system with talking cats and pigs. The pigs are mercilessly slaughtered and eaten, despite having cognizance and going to school with the cats. Her spouse would later comment that Ms. Hashiguchi would get censored for attempting to address social hierarchies and racism in the ""Nekojiru"" series.The documentary seemed to imply that her publishers and agents seemed to try to commercialize the ""cute"" characters, rather than focusing on the merit of her work. One her publishers in the television special stated that before Ms. Hashiguchi\'s suicide, she seemed to have grown weary of publishing comics. That also may have been due to Ms. Hashiguchi\'s issues with alcoholism. In her biography, it is stated that instead of eating physical meals, Ms. Hashiguchi would live on a diet of broth and Jack Daniels whiskey.From an outside perspective, it seemed that Chiyomi Hashiguchi had an awakening sense of consciousness about the world around her. Famously, Ms. Hashiguchi is said to have travelled to India and tried LSD, thus causing her to entirely genuflect to Indian culture and the iconography in Hindu mythology. It is incorporated in many of her published works. In the thirty-minute film, created by J.C. Staff to memorialize her life and death, the heroine (""Nyako"") is taken away by a blue-skinned being. The deity resembles the Hindu god, Vishnu.In the biography, according to Ms. Hashiguchi\'s spouse, the little brother character (""Nyatta"") was supposed to a comic representation of him. With that information, it is even more heart-breaking that Nyatta is desperately trying to save Nyako, from the looming shadow of death. I personally believe that because of Ms. Hashiguchi\'s tête-à-tête with her inner demons, writing from an uncaring child\'s perspective probably brought her relief.Chiyomi Hashiguchi chooses to illustrate her world-view through the unconscious cruelty of children. The cat characters experience things like death, torture, and money laundering... and they don\'t understand the consequences or ramifications of their actions. In her biography, Ms. Hashiguchi was said to be very harsh. She had absolutely no filter in what she said out-loud. Her close friends would say that they would be ashamed to go out to eat with her, because she would often berate the server openly.It\'s probable that because of Ms. Hashiguchi\'s realization of the world\'s evils, topics that her publishers didn\'t allow her to express, that caused her to feel very lonely and depressed. As an adult, people eventually realize hard truths and they have two choices: a) turn a blind eye or b) look at all of the world\'s atrocities, face-forward. To choose the latter can be unbelievably painful. Although, her work can be interpreted as cruel and vulgar... the harsh messages really affected me. Chiyomi Hashiguchi may be viewed by most as an edgy, indie artist (some people even categorize her work as ""guro""), but her views on the flaws of our society are an important thing to keep in mind.⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersSynopsis: The main character, a cat named Nyatta, embarks upon a journey to save his sister\'s soul, which was ripped in two when Nyatta tried to save her from Death. She trails after him, brain-dead. They encounter many brilliant, mind-bending situations, beginning with a disturbing magic show.The thirty-minute, avant-garde film (known as ""Nekojiru-sō"") is almost a direct adaptation of the ""Tamashii no Maki"" chapter in Nekojiru Udon. There isn\'t as much characterization in this installment, the whole thing is more of a symbolic, visual spectacle. Watching Mr. Satō\'s adaptation is like staring into an animated version of a Salvador Dalí painting. The most characterization emphasized in Nekojiru-sō, is Nyatta\'s desperation to save his older sister.Nekojiru Gekijō Jirujiru is done in the style of a 4-koma adaptation; it is more indicative of Chiyomi Hashiguchi\'s main body of work, while ""Tamashii no Maki"" is indicative of one of her rare, spiritual speculations. In this version, Nyako and Nyatto are portrayed as being cruelly oblivious to the consequences of things like crime and murder. Like, Ms. Hashiguchi\'s savage honestly, the children convey a total lack of caring for anything, other than their own interests and survival. I believe that this is how Chiyomi Hashiguchi sees the general public and it must have also been attributed to a sense of self-loathing, regarding her own existence.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅For Nekojiru-sōTatsuo Satō (director), notable works:* Atom: The Beginning* Basquash!* Gakuen Senki Muryō* Jūbee Ninpūchō: Ryūhōgyoku-hen (""Ninja Scroll: The Series"")* Kidō Senkan Nadesico ✅* Kidō Senkan Nadesico: The Prince of Darkness ✅* Lord Marksman and Vanadis* Mōretsu Pirates* Rinne no Lagrange* Shigofumi ✅* Tobe!

Violence, gore, sex all of these acts are portrayed in Nekojiru-sou. The whole concept of a soul isn't viewed through the eyes of a romantic or optimism. Rather the person with the soul is the one that commits horrific acts.Story:The story takes backstage. At its core a cat is trying to save the soul of his little sister. The cat goes on a journey showing various forms of entertainment. This entertainment includes tasting different foods while torturing animals, viewing violent magic tricks, etc. The entertainment that the young cat shows are all savage acts. However what brings the older sister's soul back...is the beauty of a single flower. This theme goes against all of the violence previously done. The theme instead, being to love nature and see the beauty in it.Art:The art serves its purpose. The art often changes style to juxtapose different moments. This causes violence to become more apparent.Sound:The music is very good. It manages to show hints of mystery and creepiness. Since conversation is barely present, the music takes center stage.

Often times the characters are portrayed causing harm simply to accomplish minimal tasks. God plays around with time to fulfill his hunger. The cats beat a pig to hurry him up.

This is such a beautiful movie. In my opinion (and I know not many will agree with me but whatever), this by far surpasses any Ghibli movies, as well as Kimi no na wa. Of course there were a few things it could have done better, but honestly, everything was too superb for me to notice many flaws at all.Art: 10/10. Literally so gorgeous. The vibrant colors and scenery were incredibly majestic and stunning, and the whole time I felt completely immersed. Not to mention, all of...the characters were super well done. The cats were really attractive, which is a plus for me, but in general -- everyone had their own little quirks about them instead of being bland and repetitive.Animation: 9/10. I would give it a 10/10, just for being so smooth and extremely well done, but the use of real footage at some points was a bit annoying. Even so, the studio still managed to meld it together without it being too standoffish. It was unique, if anything, so I had almost no problems with it.Story/Plot: 10/10. I might be sounding super biased, but honestly, I've never seen such a well done plot revolving around water, and the concept of life. It's perfect to me, and because I was raised around this type of belief, it really hits home to see something depicting it in such a way.Voice acting: 8/10. There were some parts - especially towards the beginning of the movie where I was not yet used to the voices - that I felt the emotions were not being portrayed as powerfully as they should have been, and were lackluster. But overtime I was able to adapt quickly to it, and throughout the movie it almost felt like the voice actors themselves grew, as I was hearing much more depth in the tones they were taking on. I did, in particular, really enjoy Nyako's older voice. Very wise sounding (as she should be, after all she went through).Soundtrack: 10/10. I loved it. It's not too over the top, yet still very impactful. There were no scenes where I felt that the ost was out of place.Characters Development: 8/10. I didn't see much of this with Nyatta, honestly. She seemed to stay the same throughout the whole movie, and I didn't feel like she grew very much. Nyako, on the other hand, went through a heck of a lot of development. She was somewhat selfish at first, caring more about what would happen to Nyatta than listening to what Nyatta herself actually wanted, and then ended up sacrificing quite a bit for her wishes nearer to the end.Overall: Deep storyline, beautiful message, and lots and lots of much appreciated heartwarming feels. To me, it was perfect, and I will most definitely be re-watching this again.(Yes, this was a review by some chinese bot and it was written so bland and generalised, that I thought it could fit any other movie, which is not Keit-ai or a ghibli movie.

It's short enough that it's not much of a commitment to watch, and engaging enough that it's hard to lose interest.  The story is almost non-narrative, yet with a direction; and there is very minimal dialog to help move the story along.  It's like a silent film filled with background music and atmospheric sound.For me though the most interesting part about Nekojiro-sou is it's commentaries on the real world.  There are references to taking advantage of animals, over-exhausting natural resources, and hints at how to deal with mental health.  All of these are addressed in...a surreal, whimsical way--but they are serious issues.

The way the themes of nihilism and society being evil are conveyed are so unique. I think the movie perfectly described how a child would look at society, war, god, and death.

Watching it is something of an experience, since plotlines emerge and disappear in the blink of an eye, all the while fast-paced trippy imagery makes it hard to really understand what’s even going on. Drawing some kind of overarching analysis out of it and claiming that to be the point of the film would be disingenuous because there isn’t really a point to be drawn or a moral to be learned. Still, its imagery is far too interesting to leave alone, and prodding at it until it vomits something up makes for some interesting discussion,...whether intended or not.The film follows two cats, brother and sister, and begins with the latter’s death. As the grim reaper arrives to take her, her brother refuses to accept her death and attempts to wrest her from the reaper’s grasp. He manages to retrieve half her soul, and much of the film follows the two cats as they journey through a series of increasingly bizarre landscapes to find the other half, hidden in a flower.One of the images that comes up time and time again is that of destruction, and, more specifically, the destruction of some kind of body or the other. For example, one part of the film is set in a circus, where there is a large bird with a transparent body, filled with clouds. When the bird is squeezed, it lets out fireworks, and each time it is squeezed it grows more and more agitated, until it is finally killed. Upon its death, a great flood is unleashed upon the earth that leaves behind a vast desert once it finally dries up. Stuck in this desert with only a pig as their companion, the two cats resort to morbidly using their own friend for food. They carve out parts of his body and eat it, with the pig even cannibalizing his own body at one point.The pig dies soon after, but the cats manage to make it to a large mansion in which a tall bald man lives. Much like the witch from Hansel and Gretel, he fattens them up with food before throwing them into a large cauldron and attempting to cook them. The cats manage to escape just in time, throwing him in and running away. All of these examples, of the bird, the pig, and the man, are all of bodies being destroyed or maimed in some way. The question is though, what ties them together thematically? More importantly, why is the film doing this, showing us these sometimes horrific images of arms and legs being cut off, or animals being abused?Well, in each of these situations bodies are not destroyed for no purpose — there is something being extracted from this destruction. The bird provides entertainment, the pig provides food, and the cats when cooked and eaten serve as a way for the man, long past his prime, to vampirically consume youth and thereby become youthful again. Destruction is here a tool to create useful things for some people at the expense of others. Weirdly enough, the cats seem to enjoy and/or partake in this destruction themselves. After all, when the bird is being tortured for entertainment, they clap along just as excited as the rest of the crowd, and they are the ones responsible for the death of the pig. Even with the man, the only reason they really dislike what’s happening to them is that they are the ones at the receiving end of this destructive extraction.But…why? Why on earth would they not question these things as they happen? As an observer it’s obvious that these things are, on some fundamental level, wrong, or at least morally questionable. The answer to this lies all the way back in the beginning of the film, where we get a brief glimpse into the kind of household the cats grew up in. We see that their father is an alcoholic, and their mother either ignorant, scared, or both. It wouldn’t really be much of a stretch then, to say that there was probably some kind of abuse going on, whether that be physical or mental. Abuse is, in some way, something that tears you down and destroys parts of you, exploiting you in some form. Your body becomes a thing from which your parents ‘extract’ something, such as physical or emotional labor.As a child, these things are often accepted and internalized uncritically, and so witnessing the same being done to others might be seen as normal, or expected. All of this explains why the cats are partially oblivious and tacitly endorse destruction — they grew up with it, after all. The film ends with the brother finally finding the flower, and making his sister whole again. This is the only act in the entire film where something is created without anything being destroyed. No one had to die or be tortured for it to happen, and symbolically it represents the cats breaking out of their cycle of internalized abuse, to strive to be better than their parents, and better as people. whether intended or not.The film follows two cats, brother and sister, and begins with the latter’s death.

His sister falls ill, leading them on a strangely dark and interesting adventure. If I'm honest, it really was very original. The only part I didn't like was the very end.

It goes very well with the vibe the creators wanted to send, matching the rather dark theme. I don't see a reason not to give the art a 9/10.Sound : The music matched the anime very well. It's very simple, and manages not to sound to dark and brooding, or upbeat and happy. Music gets a 7/10.Characters : In the short amount of time we had, we see that Nyako and his sister are very close.

For my non-Chinese speaking friends, Chinese has quite a lot of nuance and non-official translation might not make for the best viewing experience. This is definitely better than the third season as there is a lot more progression and upgrade in terms of animation quality. The story has also progressed quite a lot notably in terms of Mo Fan magic growth. Sound is really good as the music opening and ending are still really good. Character development is really interesting and provides a...lot more opportunity for growth in the next season. All in all, I have to say this is a really satisfying anime and at the end of the anime, the producers collected some of the opinions and comments about the anime from their Chinese forum. Till next time, next season I will bring you more great content. This is a 9/10 easily. Really good hype anime. lot more opportunity for growth in the next season.

Till next time, next season I will bring you more great content. This is a 9/10 easily. Really good hype anime.', 'Season 4 of Quanzhi Fashi follows the story almost exactly to the manga, with slight changes in the detail. While I highly recommended the manga as the artwork is beautiful and has no corners cut, it is slightly harder to recommend the anime solely based on quality, as the animation can be very poor at times. That being said, the animation of season 4 is slightly better than season 1, and on par with the previous seasons, making it decent at best. Additionally, poor translations really ruined some parts for me, however, I will only take off one point on enjoyment because that is not...the fault of the animation studio. That being said, without the previous knowledge of the story from the manga, I would be very lost at times. Once again, I was never into manga, however this was the one exception, and I highly highly recommend the manga for Quanzhi Fashi, while the anime is slightly worse in my opinion. Therefore, I rate Quanzhi Fashi season 4 as a 7, as it is just good, definitely not great, but if you liked the past 3 seasons, you will like this season. the fault of the animation studio. That being said, without the previous knowledge of the story from the manga, I would be very lost at times.

Yes, i might not have experience, because of my lack of watching anime. But took alone, this anime is quite good when is comes to ,,enjoyable"".We can see in this season a great quality of imagine, an improvement from past seasons.If you saw the past seasons you can agree that, like the others, the action happens quite quickly and it takes a bit to understand what is happening. It was quite a try to read the subtitle ( not producers fault ),...but thanks to those, who manage to translate. Maybe that was a minus cuz\' i had to try and read....and i feel like i lost some feelings from the season, that is why i will watch again.The end of season 3, doesn\'t appear to be continued in this season, so maybe is just an idea of a story to put the actual story on.The characters presented in this season are great and has a lot of team power.Overall am I am thrilled about this, i love it and i love the other seasons.I am waiting for season 5.The story is good, and thought he is powering up, so fast that we loose the track of his abilities, the actions takes care of that and you will find it great.Is sad to see so few episodes and so short time, you don\'t have so much of the feeling of space and recreation.Even if it feels like: take this, take that, deal with that, you will like this.Waiting for season 5. Good luck and have fun watching. This will be always one of my favorite anime. but thanks to those, who manage to translate.

This was my first chinese anime. And yeah it was so good that i ended up reading manga ( versatile mage ). Season 1 was nice , like how mc with the aim of becoming the best and to take revenge for the insult of his father and all( i like that part) . Season 2 was perfect for me it totally holded me and never felt bore ..yeah some scene were misigonic like how mc father was like totally safe and how lucky he was and...etc. And coming to season 3 , it was good too but i like first 2 season more and 4 was good too , like at last how he turned into demon and just loved the way how people understimate him but he ends up shocking everyone ( its the best one comparing to anime which share similar theme )Animation was just okay( as production cost was low so its obvio) but it improved season to season and there wasnt many ost but i liked ending song tbh which was in eng i guess.

And yeah story was good for me.', ""This anime has been a rollercoaster, and I am glad that I persisted with it as Season 4 really rewards you for sticking with this series.All the story elements of previous seasons come together in season 4, giving it a much more enjoyable and complete experience.Season 3 felt disconnected from the rest, almost like a reset, with previous characters almost vanishing from the series with a focus on a new setting and a new set of characters. Season 4 brings the old characters and new characters together in a satisfying way.For the first half of Season 4 the story is the main focus, and not...just in the background and something to hang everything else off, the second half is more action focused, with the story slipping into the background, although that might be a result of bad translations.The story in the second half seemed muddled and at times it wasn't too clear what was going on, but I am inclined to blame the translation for this as I felt like I was trying to crack some kind of code as I tried to understand what was going on, and it took me longer than I would like to admit to realise that they were referring to someone as 'apartment' - which I'm sure was a translation errorYes if anything, my only gripe with Season 4 is the poor quality translations on the fansub, while the translations on seasons 1-3 were cheesy and were cringe at times, they were at least competent and easy to follow, this time it was like a bad MTLBut as that has nothing to do with the series itself, it doesn't affect my score, it is instead just a word of caution for people who look to watch this series.I would say that the art has improved slightly, or is more consistent.The fact that my only gripe is the fansub, shows just how good season 4 is, and how far it has come, it's still not perfect, on a technical level it's no where near as good as many other anime it has to compete against, but in terms of story, character and enjoyment, Season 4 stands toe to toe with many of them.Also season 4 actually seems to be well paced, this is a revelation, and something that the entire anime has struggled with, but season 4 doesn't have pacing issues. just in the background and something to hang everything else off, the second half is more action focused, with the story slipping into the background, although that might be a result of bad translations.The story in the second half seemed muddled and at times it wasn't too clear what was going on, but I am inclined to blame the translation for this as I felt like I was trying to crack some kind of code as I tried to understand what was going on, and it took me longer than I would like to admit to realise that they were referring to someone as 'apartment' - which I'm sure was a translation errorYes if anything, my only gripe with Season 4 is the poor quality translations on the fansub, while the translations on seasons 1-3 were cheesy and were cringe at times, they were at least competent and easy to follow, this time it was like a bad MTLBut as that has nothing to do with the series itself, it doesn't affect my score, it is instead just a word of caution for people who look to watch this series.I would say that the art has improved slightly, or is more consistent.The fact that my only gripe is the fansub, shows just how good season 4 is, and how far it has come, it's still not perfect, on a technical level it's no where near as good as many other anime it has to compete against, but in terms of story, character and enjoyment, Season 4 stands toe to toe with many of them.Also season 4 actually seems to be well paced, this is a revelation, and something that the entire anime has struggled with, but season 4 doesn't have pacing issues."", ""After watching the series from the beginning to the fourth season I can confirm this show is so poor in all aspects and have no hope of being better in the future.Don't get me wrong the show idea is great but the execution is Horrible 50% of the show does not make any sense some scenes got cut and they do not explain what happened in those scenes, animation is kid channel level, voice acting is awful you will notice there are no emotions nor excitement, the power system is a mess there is no logic especially season wise :), monsters levels are random if...you encounter one eye demon you may kill him with shot or struggle is depends on how the studio feels ;) finally, MC is weird he is the strongest character but still gets hurt from basic magic level this does not make any sense at all.I gave this work a chance till this season now I give up.

Slam Dunk (Movie),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1764/Slam_Dunk_Movie,"['It\'s more than easy to say that this is the weakest out of the four Slam Dunk films currently available. This series does a pretty good job balancing it\'s character drama with the high intensity basketball games it\'s known for. However, for this not-quite-feature-length movie, the character drama seems to take center stage with middling results. Oda Tatsumasa, a former junior high classmate of Sakuragi\'s, loathes the idea of having the former delinquent turned ""basketball genius"" play on the same court as him. Oda finds the head to head match against Sakuragi\'s school the perfect opportunity to disgrace him and thus purifying...the sport from soiled hands. Sakuragi, as stubbornly confident as ever, intends to wipe the floor with Oda (despite his relatively weak grasp on the sport at this point in the series) for even suggesting that his justification for joining the sport is too shallow and, therefore, doesn\'t deserve to play it. Meanwhile, the relationship of Oda and his girlfriend is....also here. This is where the problems start to arise.Oda isn\'t exactly an interesting character, but when the focus shifts to one more concerned with his relationship to his girlfriend, the result ranges from boring to unfortunately laughable. A scene depicting Oda slapping his girlfriend for even suggesting that basketball has made him a more unlikeable person with something missing in his life is a good summation of the two aforementioned results. The placement of this character detour also contrasts pretty poorly with this series\' patented comedy. Most of the charm of this film is placed strictly on Sakuragi\'s shoulders as he boldly shows his passion for basketball (whether he knows it or not), injuring himself multiple times in the process. This culminates in the movie\'s climax, in which Sakuragi makes one last desperate lunge off court as he tries to save the basketball for his team. He succeeds right before slamming face-first into a wall and rendering himself immobile for a few seconds. In those seconds, the jeers of the crowd fall silent and a lone standing ovation from the opposing team\'s coach is heard. And then they all clapped :) . This scene not only goes on for way too long, as it pans to every character\'s reaction before clapping themselves, but it also throws away the character conflict in this film. Oda, amongst the cheers, reaches out to help Sakuragi up--immediately acknowledging him as a sportsmen without words or transition despite his constant undermining of him up until this point. I\'d like to commend it for it\'s subtly, but all of this comes of as really cheesy (and not in a good way as seen in the third film). Then the match is just...over. We never see the end of the match because the movie opts to transition to the two teams coaches post-game after the clapping scene. I haven\'t mentioned the basketball match itself due to the very forgettable nature of it in this film; to have the end of the game not even shown tells me that the focus isn\'t really on the match, but on the characters instead (which one could imagine how that might make me feel given the context of what\'s been written). This comes off strange in a series usually concerned with depicting the grand battles and outcomes of a basketball match--giving hyper importance to even practice games.On the production end this isn\'t all that strong either. The OST is borrowed from the show so it\'s hardly worth mentioning that it\'s quality (though never utilized in any significantly impactful way). The animation this time around prioritizes having more detailed still frames rather than actually animating well. Action/Sports scenes come off as stiffly paced, and often will hold on a still frame in that uniquely awkward old-anime way which dates it instantly. It\'s all moderately serviceable, but, thankfully the character performances are likable enough to enjoy.This isn\'t a horrible movie, just a really bland representation of what Slam Dunk is as a series. Though moments in this film, from a comedy standpoint, properly showcase glimmers of understanding of what the series is; the overall construction of the movie and how it goes about it almost seems misrepresentitive and confused, despite the theme of full body dedication/passion to the sport implying otherwise. the sport from soiled hands.

The story /plot was good and had a nice pacing to it. The visuals and music were good usual. I think what I found most enjoyable was the meaning that this movie had. Even though you love basketball more than anything life isn't only just basketball and there are other things too just as important.  And also the spirit to play each basketball game with intensity and passion.

Or maybe I do but there isn\'t much to remember.The main ""conflict"" in this movie is the one between Sakuragi and Oda (a basketball player from his previous middle school  aka before Sakuragi got into Basketball). Oda is very serious about loving Basketball and is veeeery insulted by former hooligan Sakuragi\'s participation in the sport. While said conflict isn\'t that new, it also isn\'t particularly bad. It is however badly executed or rather just plainly rushed. It\'s like there is a full 10 minutes missing from the story that explores...both characters\' development. Also Oda\'s girlfriend is the girl that rejected Sakuragi in the beginning of the manga which is honestly the most entertaining thing about this movie.In conclusion this was more a filler anime episode (with tv quality and tv runtime) that wasn\'t offensive. It is pretty easy to watch but also quite forgettable. both characters\' development.

Tamayura: Hitotose,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10232/Tamayura__Hitotose,"['Dreams. Small or big, simple or far-fetched, related to hobbies, future job or just dreams of making friends. Almost everyone have dreamt of something at least once. Tamayura is an anime about chasing these dreams. And no, not about huge triumphs. It\'s about achieving small successes and enjoying them.First of all, if you:a) automatically mark every anime similar to K-On! as moeblob crap, without even bothering about things like story or characters;b) don\'t like slow-paced shows that, unlike mentioned above K-On!, mainly focus on drama than on comedy;just give up already. You will not like Tamayura either.Tamayura ~Hitotose~ is a sequel to OVAs (which take...place in between 1st and 2nd Hitotose episodes on the timeline, however) and should be watched after them. Otherwise you\'ll not recognise some gags, and start without knowing most of main cast.Story - 8/10Tamayura is, just as the MAL description for OVAs says, some kind of ""healing anime"". It makes viewers be able to unwind a bit. The main plot is very simple. It resolves around a girl, Fu, who\'s interested in photography. It\'s somehow similar to Aria in many aspects (not to mention they share the same director).However, unlike Aria, which shows an idealised vision of future, Tamayura takes place in our times. It doesn\'t show how the world could be beautiful, but how it actually is.Also, in contrast to other shows focusing on everyday life of groups of friends (eg. A-Channel, Yuru Yuri, Lucky Star, Kimi to Boku or mentioned above: K-On! and Aria) Tamayura: Hitotose doesn\'t contain any completely filler episodes, which don\'t advance the story at all. Almost every single one either develop characters a bit or shows some of the backstory, which explains their current behaviours. The OVAs didn\'t have so well-thought story, so it\'s already the first thing, that shows that Hitotose is better.Nevertheless, even through everything seem to form a coherent whole, the show is still episodic and not really ambitious in comparison to more complex stories we can see in other series.Characters - 9/10Characters are definitely strong point of Tamayura ~Hitotose~. Like I\'ve already stated before, they are somehow developed in almost every single episode. Their backstories are very well-presented, too. As the characters develop, we can also see that they have more depth than it was shown in OVAs.Every girl has a bit different personality and different interests as well. Yes, different hobbies. You won\'t see anything like light music clubs or gondola companies here. Photography could be the core of story here, like mahjong in Saki or drawing in Hidamari Sketch. However, not focusing on only one thing makes Tamayura somewhat more universal.These two things also makes them seem more realistic. Probably no one wonders why Azusa Nakano started to play guitar, or why Akari Mizunashi decided to become undine in Neo Venezia, leaving her family behind on another planet. Such information usually aren\'t considered as important, but in fact they are essential for the most of the story to take place. And they are provided in Tamayura.Art & Sound - 10/10As far as I\'m concerned, only average thing here is design of characters. Sceneries are really wonderful, they just make you want to take a photo of them (oh, well, you can still take a screenshot).Taking into account, that the production hasn\'t very high budget and its studio is almost unknown, backgrounds in urban areas have really many details such as irregular bricks in the old pavement. So do many objects such as Fu\'s camera.The animation is fine, however unlike in fantasy or shounen shows, in slice of life anime it isn\'t something you pay much attention to.Music fits very well, at least if you don\'t find singing in BGM annoying. The opening and ending both fit in climate of the series, whereas the second one is quite meaningful, especially if you connect lyrics, story of Tamayura and photos shown in it.Enjoyment and Other Aspects - 7/10The sole purpose of this series is to relax viewers, allow them to chill out after rough day and forget about the shadows of everyday life. In this aspect, Tamayura is almost perfect - it has calm slow-paced story, sympathetic characters and pretty sceneries, it also has some kind of \'warm feeling\'. OVAs, with duration of only 2 regular anime episodes couldn\'t do that better than TV series, cause there wasn\'t enough of them and viewer, who happened to like it, was left with deficiency, wanting for more.It also has an ability to show how beautiful the world is. For me, who lives in industrial region, chimneys of factories, power plants or ironworks don\'t seem to beautify the surroundings. Nah, it even makes everything uglier. Therefore, it was quite shocking for me, when Noire and Maon looked at a red-and-white-painted factory chimney and said that it was... beautiful. It made me come to conclusion, that maybe they really aren\'t that bad as I always thought. It forces to think, if it is Tamayura\'s reality being idealized, or is it just our view of the real world as something vile, foul.It is also really good, that they resigned from needless fanservice that appeared once in OVAs. In my book, such series shouldn\'t have any, really.It seems everything is fine, but... you wonder, why I gave enjoyment only seven points of ten? Well... Despite all the relaxation and manifestation of world\'s beauty, the humour in this series is just average. In combination with really slow-paced story the whole thing can be really boring for everyone, who is expecting comedy, action, or just isn\'t in mood to watch something like that. Enough boring to quickly give up on it.Final thoughts:Tamayura is an anime about the world around us. However, it shows everything around in way more positive, yet gentle way. If you are in mood to spend your fabulous time on watching something peaceful and optimistic, something without overcomplicated story, deaths, sex or shocking plot twists, I can highly recommend Tamayura to you.Final grade: (8+9+10+7)/4 = 8.5 => 9 of 10 place in between 1st and 2nd Hitotose episodes on the timeline, however) and should be watched after them.

There's anime that's written to excite, and there's also animes that bring out laughter. And then, there's animes like Aria the Animation (and it's sequels) and Tamayura: Hitotose, where there is only one purpose behind it - to make the viewer smile, and to bring joy to their hearts. I suppose Tamayura, is an anime that you could call heartwarming, and there's no doubt that that's quite the fitting descriptor. Because it really, really is quite heartwarming indeed. Watching Tamayura, brought me so much joy and warmth that no shounen or seinen anime has ever brought me. I...can’t even begin to describe the warmth that Tamayura poured into me through it’s telling of the stories of a group of friends.That being said, because Tamayura really is, when you boil it down, a slice-of-life anime, it really isn’t for everybody. If you like your anime girls clad in armor wielding legendary swords and fighting epic assassins and overthrowing evil families, Tamayura is probably not for you. If you like animes where every single episode is a cliffhanger, and you’re absolutely dying to see what happens to the kid ninja next, this anime’s probably not for you. But, if you like to enjoy the stories of the lives of four high school girls, and like to enjoy an anime where you can relax and plaster all your worries away, then absolutely watch this anime.Because realistically, that’s all Tamayura was meant for. It wasn’t meant to be a massive blockbuster in the anime world, it wasn’t meant to be an adaptation of some famous manga, no, not at all. In fact, I’m pretty sure (no, I’m absolutely sure) that Tamayura: Hitotose, was written for the sole purpose of helping people find good in life. It seems like the entire anime as a whole, constantly aims to show people the positive sides of life, and fill their hearts with warmth as they display possibly the most positive of emotions only to be bested by the final season of Aria.In that sense, there really is no plot - there is no suspense, no rising action, no climax, no finale, there really is only daily life, a daily life that’s filled with the joy and happiness of four high school girls. In fact, the development of said girls, is probably the greatest achievement if Tamayura: Hitotose. The wonderfully told story of Fuu and her friends, as well as her photographic past, was not only heartwarming, but extremely motivating. Actually, I’m sure that's exactly what Junichi Sato aimed to create - an anime that fills people with joy, hope, and motivation, just like his previous creations, namely Aria the Animation and it’s sequels. Of course, having watched both, it was pretty easy to draw parallels in style. Both animes, have this incredibly peaceful feel that nothing else can replicate. It seems like I could just wash my worries away and immerse myself in the world of Fuu and her friends forever, and remove all the weight off my shoulders.Unfortunately though, since I watched Aria, I can also see why Tamayura is not as good as Aria. The reason why I brought Aria up, even knowing that reviews should not include other animes, is because it proves my point very well. The place that's “lacking” per se, in Tamayura, is it’s setting. Obviously, a quiet town definitely fits Tamayura very well, but the problem with this is, is that it narrows the audience, as it makes the anime “less interesting” for a certain demographic. But, this goes both ways. Personally, I wouldn’t have changed a thing - while the setting may have been monotonous, and slightly boring, I found that not only did it fit the anime quite well, the way it was described painted a very peaceful and quiet atmosphere, something perfect for Tamayura. On the other hand, having such a normal setting means that the anime has to rely on it’s other aspects to make it interesting - and daily life like the one seen in Tamayura, isn’t always the best medium of choice when trying to create a great anime.Of course, if I had to name one thing every decent anime needs, is great animation. And Tamayura has good animation. Although not as artsy and incredible as Aria, Tamayura has that modern, smooth, and flowing animation that also comes off as quite peaceful. Of course, like the setting, it’s also quite normal. Which personally, I liked.The same goes for this series - I quite enjoyed it. It filled me with a soft, warm happiness that no other anime, save for Aria, gave me. To me, it was the anime that I would sit down and truthfully enjoy, no matter what  happened to me that day, Tamayura would still have made me smile. And it did, quite often.So, thank you, Junichi Sato, for putting a smile on my face. Thank you, for an anime that gave me a warm happiness that seems to be easily forgotten in this fast-paced, action-packed world.I’ll definitely look forward to Tamayura: More Aggressive. can’t even begin to describe the warmth that Tamayura poured into me through it’s telling of the stories of a group of friends.That being said, because Tamayura really is, when you boil it down, a slice-of-life anime, it really isn’t for everybody. If you like your anime girls clad in armor wielding legendary swords and fighting epic assassins and overthrowing evil families, Tamayura is probably not for you. If you like animes where every single episode is a cliffhanger, and you’re absolutely dying to see what happens to the kid ninja next, this anime’s probably not for you. But, if you like to enjoy the stories of the lives of four high school girls, and like to enjoy an anime where you can relax and plaster all your worries away, then absolutely watch this anime.Because realistically, that’s all Tamayura was meant for. It wasn’t meant to be a massive blockbuster in the anime world, it wasn’t meant to be an adaptation of some famous manga, no, not at all. In fact, I’m pretty sure (no, I’m absolutely sure) that Tamayura: Hitotose, was written for the sole purpose of helping people find good in life. It seems like the entire anime as a whole, constantly aims to show people the positive sides of life, and fill their hearts with warmth as they display possibly the most positive of emotions only to be bested by the final season of Aria.In that sense, there really is no plot - there is no suspense, no rising action, no climax, no finale, there really is only daily life, a daily life that’s filled with the joy and happiness of four high school girls. In fact, the development of said girls, is probably the greatest achievement if Tamayura: Hitotose. The wonderfully told story of Fuu and her friends, as well as her photographic past, was not only heartwarming, but extremely motivating. Actually, I’m sure that's exactly what Junichi Sato aimed to create - an anime that fills people with joy, hope, and motivation, just like his previous creations, namely Aria the Animation and it’s sequels. Of course, having watched both, it was pretty easy to draw parallels in style. Both animes, have this incredibly peaceful feel that nothing else can replicate. It seems like I could just wash my worries away and immerse myself in the world of Fuu and her friends forever, and remove all the weight off my shoulders.Unfortunately though, since I watched Aria, I can also see why Tamayura is not as good as Aria.

Tamayura is a stunningly emotional tale of a girl finding beauty in what had been the source of her sorrow before: photography. Reminded by the loss of her father, she distances herself from his former favorite activity and struggles to cope with the situation she was suddenly forced into.Tamayura sets off when she finally succeeded in accepting reality and regaining her vitality, which allows her to dive into the memories she has been keeping buried for...years. By deciding to pick up photography by herself, she enters a journey to discovering the background of her late father's passion towards making photographs to understand more about him and the emotional value of keeping mementos.This short synopsis already brings me close to tears. The premise sounds perfect for a highly emotional ride, but what you get was, unfortunately, not elaborated in detail. Tamayura is a 'high slice of life' series, meaning it is almost episodic and doesn't follow a decent story. In contrast to Aria, Tamayura lacks a firmly set goal, and the episodes just float by, so to speak, which is ultimately the reason there is much unused potential in terms of storytelling.Impressively enough that Tamayura excels in 'floating by', creating a wonderfully soothing and peaceful atmosphere that is well known from the Aria franchise. Instead of integrating plot elements with high depth that encourage the viewer to think and reflect, this show focuses on depicting peacefulness and harmony with every detail it comes with. In the same manner, emotional, mostly beautiful scenes just 'float by' and add some intensity to the entire thing, which is otherwise defined by more or less random slice of life plotlets.Although the synopsis literally cries out for character development, only traces of it can be found in Tamayura. The character development can be summarized as the process of bonding with friends and becoming more mentally stable throughout the show while discovering happiness. And this applies to all the main characters there are, namely the heroine Fuu and her close friends. It totally makes sense, in my opinion, that an atmosphere-oriented show rarely offers in-depth characters, and I don't consider this a weakness of Tamayura at all. That, what is important in this case, is the credibility of the characters' personalities, which is absolutely present in this show. Both the main characters as well the side characters provide a very consistent personality with authentic attitudes. This luckily outshines the sometimes rather clichéd dialogues.Those who know Aria are well aware of how much the soundtrack contributes to the peaceful atmosphere that was aimed for with Tamayura as well. The background music turned out as beautiful as the atmosphere created by the characters, thus implying a high fit between the content and the technical dimension. The opening song by Maaya Sakamoto is an excellent addition to that and gets the viewer in the right mood for what is to follow. A noticeable disappointment, however, is the considerable amount of unused potential regarding sceneries and landscapes. A show that focuses on beauty (esp. in nature) would be wise to emphasize this aspect by delivering more impressive images/drawings to enhance the emotional impact. Aria did this masterfully, but that was primarily thanks to a more creative sci-fi setting.Once again, the director of the Aria franchise has shown his qualities in creating an immersive experience that is defined by shallowness, peacefulness, harmony, and beauty. It absolutely meets my taste, although I would have wished for a decent storyline adding to Tamayura's density of emotional substance. If you are the type for hardly demanding and calming anime, Tamayura can be highly recommended.Rating: 8.13/10(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.) years.

Tamayura: Hitotose is best described as ""special"" it was  so heartwarming and pleasant without being sappy or abnormally tragic. The feelings and emotions were so relateable, even for someone much older than the characters themselves. The story progressed at a nice pace, the soundtrack matched well, and I loved the art. Each character was distinct and memorable in their own right, I changed favorites every week! Also, I want to live in that...town! It seems like such a wonderful place and the art captured the natural beauty so well, I want to see it in person.

Now that I have watched the anime I definitely have to read the manga.I\'m really impressed with this anime overall and it is one of the best representations of the ""slice of life"" genre I have ever had the pleasure of watching.', 'This review includes both the OVAs and TV series.I give this adorable, warm, and fluffy anime from the slice-of-life master himself...a 95/100!Have any of you seen the anime Aria? Well, apparently it\'s famous for being a sweet, calm, heartwarming, and just downright relaxing anime, which warmed and relaxed the hearts of many. It\'s based on the popular manga by Kozue Amano, and it\'s gained a massive fanbase. Oddly enough, it also inspired the director of said anime, Junichi Sato, who is famous for working on anime like Sailor Moon, Goldfish Warning, Ojamajo Doremi, Kaleido Star, and Princess Tutu, to work on more slice of life...anime just like it. He began working on ""healing anime"", which are anime with basically no epic plots or fan service or violence or anything of the like. Just plain, calm, heartwarming, touching, and relaxing anime about characters who go through their daily lives while growing up and learning to appreciate the small things in life. His second healing anime, Umi Monogatari, doesn\'t REALLY fit the healing anime standard, and while I didn\'t really like it as much as I would have, it\'s still a nice little anime. However, his third healing anime, Tamayura, is what I consider Sato\'s personal best, and for many many MANY reasons to come!Now before all you moe haters go bashing and flaming this anime (like the person who reviewed this show here, giving it a 3 out of 10), saying it\'s nothing but a rip off of K-ON and is nothing more than moeblobs doing moe things and all that garbage, let me tell you this: prepare to be proven wrong. Okay, yes, K-On DOES have a rather strong fan base and did start the new wave in moe. In fact, I\'m one of the many who watched it. Unfortunately, I grew tired of watching K-On upon seeing it\'s second season stretch to 26 episodes, as it became more about the girls doing stupid things and becoming nothing but exposition bait. I actually liked the episodes were Hokago Tea Time WEREN\'T present!!! Basically, my initial liking for K-On dwindled down to nothing. But Tamayura? Tamayura...is a VERY VERY VERY different creature entirely. It\'s not about music, not about mindless moe, not about stupidity or fan service, and not about trying to do stupid things in order to get an audience! I\'ll explain more further down.The story\'s about a young, partially timid but sweet girl named Fu Sawatari who loves taking pictures and wants to be a photographer when she grows up, like her idol, the photographer Riho Shihomi (voiced by Akari Mizunashi herself from Aria). Some years ago, her photographer father died (they don\'t explain how so just deal with it), and her interest dwindled after his death. But years later, she regains interest and her family moves to a peaceful town called Takehara, where they used to visit on their spare time. Fu makes some new friends in the form of Kaoru Hanawa, a strong-willed girl with a love for aromas, Norie Okazaki, a rather hyper and rambuctious girl with a love for baking, and Maon Sakurada, a timid and soft-spoken girl who loves whistling but has other dreams up her sleeves. This group of friends are close-knit, but they all have different dreams of their own, though at times they\'re unsure about what they want to do with their lives or what\'s the right path for them. As Fu and her friends would find, dreams and choosing paths is much more complex than they initially thought.Let me start by talking about the animation. This anime is produced by the company Hal Film Maker, famous for works like Princess Tutu, Sketchbook, Futago Hime, and Aria, and wouldn\'t you know it, IT IS FREAKING BEAUTIFUL. The animation is really top tier! These animators CLEARLY had a big budget, and they used it masterfully. The characters are animated very nicely, from their facial expressions to hand gestures and other fluid bodily movements. The backgrounds are impeccably lush and detailed, down to even the smallest little things that most would find insignificant (I\'ll go more into that further down). There were a lot of scenes were the sun was reflected on the sea, and they\'re just beautiful and downright amazing, and anybody who knows me knows that I almost NEVER say the words beautiful and amazing unless I really see something beautiful and amazing! I also notice that the places that the characters go to are actual locations and places in real life! Sato sure did his research, because I can really see that he put a lot of work into making these places come to life, from their food to other traditions, like festivals. I tried looking up the place called Mitarai, but didn\'t find anything so I can\'t say much about that, but I sure loved the look of it all!The same goes for the soundtrack, which is VERY soothing. There\'s no hard rock, soft rock, rap, hip-hop, bombast cheesiness or anything of the like. It consists mostly of soft piano tunes and low tune woodwind instruments, and they\'re used quite nicely! It makes the show more subtle and relaxing with the softness of the music. Seriously, the music\'s just so pleasant to listen to! It\'s the type of music you want to listen to after a really rough day and just want to take a breath, close your eyes, and drift off to dreamland, full of fluffy clouds and warm thoughts. That\'s what I think anyway. In the series, a vast majority of the episodes have insert songs sung by the characters\' seiyuus. I wish that vocal album would come out already because I want all the songs on it!! The songs, on top of being VERY well sung and well composed, are not only sweet, beautiful, touching, and heartwarming, but their lyrics and themes fully relate to the show and it\'s message, morals, and themes as well. They\'re not cheesy high pitched moe pop tunes or hard rock bombast or anything like that. They\'re like the rest of the OST: totally sweet, pleasant, easy on the ears, heartwarming, touching, and relaxing. And to think I thought Art Garfunkel\'s songs were the cream of the crop when it came to easy listening! Tamayura\'s insert songs wipes his out of the water, though I still love listening to him. Man! I\'d love to get that vocal album for Christmas, but it doesn\'t come out until three days afterward!Now onto the thing that people both love and hate the most: the characters. For this paragraph I\'m going to talk about the main characters. Now for all you moe haters and bashers out there, I will confess that yes, it does look as though the characters DO start off as an overused stereotype at first (the clumsy one, the level-headed one, the hyper one, and the shy one), but let me tell you that Tamayura may look like a pointless moe fest, but I personally feel it has the most well rounded characters in recent times! What do I mean? Well, you know how in most fanservice anime characters only do stupid things and not grow out of their stereotypes? Tamayura is another story. It\'s characters are wonderfully engaging, and even though this is a 12 episode (or 16 episode if you include the OVAs) anime series, they\'re constantly evolving. The lead character, Fu, loves photography and is a little shy, but throughout the series, you watch her grow into a wonderful person, even though she still has doubts about whether she wants to pursue photography forever. Her friend Kaoru suffers the same problem, only to a higher degree. She may seem lively and level headed, but she doesn\'t quite know what to do with her life. The same for Norie, the loud and hyper one, who may seem annoying at first, but once you get a good look into her past and motivations for doing what she does, you\'ll find that she\'s really a sweet person. However, out of all the characters, the most developed one has to be Maon. I\'m well aware of the fact that at the beginning, people didn\'t like her because she whistled most of the time. I didn\'t really think this to be a problem, but others did. But for those of you who want to continue the series but fear that she\'ll never stop whistling, fret not, because the more you watch the show, the less and less she whistles on a regular basis. I can\'t say why because of spoilers, but she has the most edge in the show. Maybe even more so than Fu. But these are real characters with real doubts and real dreams that they want to pursue, not bland and pointless moeblobs.Now for the minor characters. What I find a problem in most anime nowadays is that more and more anime kids don\'t have any parental authority figures in their lives. Tamayura, however, subverts this overdone cliche by giving each character a family. What a wonderful breath of fresh air! Fu\'s family is awesome (her mother, grandmother, and little brother), though I wish they went into more detail about her late father. I kinda didn\'t like Kaoru\'s sister Sayomi for various reasons, but not to a high degree. Other characters are given some nice and subtle presence too, like a okonomiyaki shop owner and frequent customers who come by (and who are given an episode featuring their development). But the side character I loved the most is Fu\'s childhood friend Chihiro. She\'s sooooo ungodly cute! I want to hug her, she\'s so adorable! She may have only appeared for a few episodes, but even she becomes a nice and versatile character by the end of the series. Some of you may find some of her antics somewhat annoying, but I found them very endearing. However, the character I find to be the most refreshing is a new character by the name of Komachi. When she first appeared, I immediately thought she was going to turn into another Minko (UGH!!!) because of some stuff. But the more the episode went on, the more she realized that just because something looks like what she sees doesn\'t mean that it IS what she sees (watch the episode and find out). Thank GOD she didn\'t turn out the way I dreaded!! Another thing I want to mention: do you notice that more and more anime are showing characters who are UNGODLY stubborn, fill their heads with a bazillion delusions and never want to hear other character\'s reasons for doing what they do and usually respond with overused phrases like ""This has nothing to do with you!"" (My GOD I hear that sentence in EVERY ANIME I WATCH NOW!!!) and how they NEVER let the other characters clarify themselves? For me, I think this has become a very fatal flaw in all anime that came out since 2005. THANK GOD this anime subverted this overdone trope, BIG TIME!!!Now I must speak of the premise. It doesn\'t look like much, as it\'s been done many times before, but NEVER with this much substance and meaning behind it. It\'s simple, but in this case, it\'s sublimely well done thanks to the directors and writers that actually KNOW what they want to do instead of randomly slap some pointless fan service in it. Also, there\'s quite a lot of symbolism in this anime (Not Utena or Mawaru Penguin Drum type symbolism, mind you), the biggest one being the blue ticket that Fu carries around. It has no destination and it seems insignificant, but it represents the vagueness of the future, but that it\'s okay to change your path in life when you feel it needs to change. There\'s no set path in life, and it\'s fine to move around freely and try new things. It changes and changes and then you finally arrive at your destination. Many people in real life deal with the problem of trying to decide our future (I know I\'m sort of going through that phase), and it\'s normal because we don\'t know what will become of us. I also noticed that there\'s a lot of sky and ocean scenes, and I think they also symbolize the vastness of the future and the world around us. Sato\'s labeled this as a healing anime, and I think he means healing in the way of helping people overcome the every day struggles that we all face in life. Tamayura isn\'t anything big, but for me, it felt like a really big warm and fuzzy bear hug that squeezed all the troubles out of me with it\'s sheer warmth and pleasance and fluffiness. I could be wrong here, but I think the Tamayura, those little light balls that appear in photos sometimes, may represent happiness or the feeling of being at ease or joyous. I have no idea if the big pink fluffy cat, Momoneko, represents anything...BUT HE IS SO CUTE!!!What do you think, moe haters and bashers? Think this is a pointless moe anime now? Well, I don\'t really consider it to be moe. In my view, I think of moe as the act of animating teenaged girls into looking, sounding, and acting younger than they should just for the purpose of gaining a nerdy male audience (Kodomo no Jikan and Ro-Kyu-Bu are GREAT examples of this). Tamayura isn\'t trying to get an audience, nor is it willing to submit to horrid and overused tropes to become known or to get its message across. It\'s simply a sweet and heartwarming anime that teaches us to appreciate the little things in life. Who knows, maybe it\'ll help you turn into a better person. Unfortunately, as much as I LOVE Tamayura, the anime AnoHana still beats it in my book because of how much it hit me with long repressed memories that I had forgotten and how nostalgic and dramatic it was. But that doesn\'t mean I hate Tamayura for lacking those qualities. Yes, Tamayura doesn\'t have a lot of conflict, nor is it epic or bombastic. But I don\'t mind. Sometimes we need a little peace and quiet once in a while, and Tamayura is definitely one of those peaceful and serene anime that lulls you into a happy dreamland.If you ask me, Tamayura is the epitome and pinnacle of gentle and serene slice of life anime done absolutely right, hands down. Still think this is a moeblob fest? Well...you heartless person. >:P anime just like it. He began working on ""healing anime"", which are anime with basically no epic plots or fan service or violence or anything of the like.

Her friend Kaoru suffers the same problem, only to a higher degree. She may seem lively and level headed, but she doesn\'t quite know what to do with her life. The same for Norie, the loud and hyper one, who may seem annoying at first, but once you get a good look into her past and motivations for doing what she does, you\'ll find that she\'s really a sweet person. However, out of all the characters, the most developed one has to be Maon. I\'m well aware of the fact that at the beginning, people didn\'t like her because she whistled most of the time. I didn\'t really think this to be a problem, but others did. But for those of you who want to continue the series but fear that she\'ll never stop whistling, fret not, because the more you watch the show, the less and less she whistles on a regular basis. I can\'t say why because of spoilers, but she has the most edge in the show. Maybe even more so than Fu. But these are real characters with real doubts and real dreams that they want to pursue, not bland and pointless moeblobs.Now for the minor characters. What I find a problem in most anime nowadays is that more and more anime kids don\'t have any parental authority figures in their lives. Tamayura, however, subverts this overdone cliche by giving each character a family. What a wonderful breath of fresh air! Fu\'s family is awesome (her mother, grandmother, and little brother), though I wish they went into more detail about her late father. I kinda didn\'t like Kaoru\'s sister Sayomi for various reasons, but not to a high degree. Other characters are given some nice and subtle presence too, like a okonomiyaki shop owner and frequent customers who come by (and who are given an episode featuring their development). But the side character I loved the most is Fu\'s childhood friend Chihiro. She\'s sooooo ungodly cute! I want to hug her, she\'s so adorable! She may have only appeared for a few episodes, but even she becomes a nice and versatile character by the end of the series. Some of you may find some of her antics somewhat annoying, but I found them very endearing. However, the character I find to be the most refreshing is a new character by the name of Komachi. When she first appeared, I immediately thought she was going to turn into another Minko (UGH!!!) because of some stuff. But the more the episode went on, the more she realized that just because something looks like what she sees doesn\'t mean that it IS what she sees (watch the episode and find out). Thank GOD she didn\'t turn out the way I dreaded!! Another thing I want to mention: do you notice that more and more anime are showing characters who are UNGODLY stubborn, fill their heads with a bazillion delusions and never want to hear other character\'s reasons for doing what they do and usually respond with overused phrases like ""This has nothing to do with you!"" (My GOD I hear that sentence in EVERY ANIME I WATCH NOW!!!) and how they NEVER let the other characters clarify themselves? For me, I think this has become a very fatal flaw in all anime that came out since 2005. THANK GOD this anime subverted this overdone trope, BIG TIME!!!Now I must speak of the premise. It doesn\'t look like much, as it\'s been done many times before, but NEVER with this much substance and meaning behind it. It\'s simple, but in this case, it\'s sublimely well done thanks to the directors and writers that actually KNOW what they want to do instead of randomly slap some pointless fan service in it. Also, there\'s quite a lot of symbolism in this anime (Not Utena or Mawaru Penguin Drum type symbolism, mind you), the biggest one being the blue ticket that Fu carries around. It has no destination and it seems insignificant, but it represents the vagueness of the future, but that it\'s okay to change your path in life when you feel it needs to change. There\'s no set path in life, and it\'s fine to move around freely and try new things. It changes and changes and then you finally arrive at your destination. Many people in real life deal with the problem of trying to decide our future (I know I\'m sort of going through that phase), and it\'s normal because we don\'t know what will become of us. I also noticed that there\'s a lot of sky and ocean scenes, and I think they also symbolize the vastness of the future and the world around us. Sato\'s labeled this as a healing anime, and I think he means healing in the way of helping people overcome the every day struggles that we all face in life. Tamayura isn\'t anything big, but for me, it felt like a really big warm and fuzzy bear hug that squeezed all the troubles out of me with it\'s sheer warmth and pleasance and fluffiness. I could be wrong here, but I think the Tamayura, those little light balls that appear in photos sometimes, may represent happiness or the feeling of being at ease or joyous. I have no idea if the big pink fluffy cat, Momoneko, represents anything...BUT HE IS SO CUTE!!!What do you think, moe haters and bashers? Think this is a pointless moe anime now? Well, I don\'t really consider it to be moe. In my view, I think of moe as the act of animating teenaged girls into looking, sounding, and acting younger than they should just for the purpose of gaining a nerdy male audience (Kodomo no Jikan and Ro-Kyu-Bu are GREAT examples of this). Tamayura isn\'t trying to get an audience, nor is it willing to submit to horrid and overused tropes to become known or to get its message across. It\'s simply a sweet and heartwarming anime that teaches us to appreciate the little things in life. Who knows, maybe it\'ll help you turn into a better person. Unfortunately, as much as I LOVE Tamayura, the anime AnoHana still beats it in my book because of how much it hit me with long repressed memories that I had forgotten and how nostalgic and dramatic it was. But that doesn\'t mean I hate Tamayura for lacking those qualities. Yes, Tamayura doesn\'t have a lot of conflict, nor is it epic or bombastic. But I don\'t mind. Sometimes we need a little peace and quiet once in a while, and Tamayura is definitely one of those peaceful and serene anime that lulls you into a happy dreamland.If you ask me, Tamayura is the epitome and pinnacle of gentle and serene slice of life anime done absolutely right, hands down. Still think this is a moeblob fest? Well...you heartless person. >:P', ""Even though I began to watch a few anime since 5 or 6, but I only began to watch a lot of anime in 2011. I thought that most anime were mainly focusing on action and violence, but then...I saw a trailer on a video about Tamayura: Hitotose. I was really curious, since I see no violence or anything in the trailer, then I realized that there are more anime genres than I thought. Tamayura: Hitotose is actually the very first slice of life anime I've ever watched. I was really glad that I watched it. I never have realized, that even a slow-paced anime...like this one, can be so well-executed.----Story----The story is really simple, easy to understand and has no complexity. It's mainly about a girl named Fu Sawatari, who likes photography and likes to spend her time with her best friends - Kaoru, Norie and Maon (and Chihiro, who Fu said farewell to in episode 1, before she moved back to where her late father used to live). She loves taking pictures of whatever she sees using her late father's camera. The story may seem boring to some people, but since there are a lot of meaning behind each photo that Fu (and her late father) took, it makes the show kind of stands out from many other anime. I like anime with great themes and this one really did a good job on it. It shows how a photo can hold so many memories, and how a photo can display what a person loves in life. Episode 1 may be boring for some people. But for me, I actually stayed watching to the end without asking myself ''How long is it left?''. Chihiro may seem annoying, as she is a crybaby. But I eventually don't mind about it anymore, since her crying is a symbol of how she cares about Fu. Chihiro doesn't want Fu to get too upset about the death of her father, so she usually does the crying for her. A great bond of friendship here, which made me want to watch this anime further, as I like anime where there is a great bond in friendship.----Art----I've nothing to say about the art. It's really well drawn and good quality.----Sound----Sound is excellent. The voices of each character are suited to their age. Opening and ending themes are excellent as well and suited to a slice of life anime.----Character----The characters in this anime are well developed. Each character eventually became more mature and began to wonder what they'll do in life. Kaoru became more confident on what she is about to do in the future. Maon is no longer a shy girl and began to talk more near the end of the anime instead of whistling a lot. Fu overcame the sadness of her father's death and decided to continue with photography. Norie may seem to be annoying due to her energetic nature, but her caring side was shown in some episodes, which made her a less annoying character.----Enjoyment----I really enjoyed this series. I recommend this series to people who like slow-paced anime. This anime is a healing anime, so there are no conflicts (like war etc.). It leaves you with a very relaxed and positive feeling in the end of the anime. However, those who like action, or fast-paced anime, then better stay away from this anime. like this one, can be so well-executed.----Story----The story is really simple, easy to understand and has no complexity.

I actually came to love photography viewing this...The characters are pretty well established throughout the series: Fu is sweet, considerate, slightly airheaded and cute, Norie is excitable, extremely energetic (but loses the energy quickly) and is a amazing cook. Kaoru has been proven to be reliable, levelheaded and has quite a unique sense of smell. Typical girl Maon is gentle, quiet (as in, so quiet, she rarely speaks but whistles) a wonderful writer and overall loveable in every aspect. Junichi Satō must\'ve had plenty of fun creating them...The music is calming, refreshing and...fits the show like a glove. ""Okaerinasai"", Hitotose\'s opening is the pinacle of gentle breezes and a warm welcome to the town of Takahara, where Fū lives. Personally my favorite is ""Natsudori"" by Megumi Nakajima. Ah, the feels.Art is okay. I\'m personally not a fan of big eyed girls, but I am pleased that Kaoru has a ponytail, something with I am very fond of. Okay...sorry, I\'m weird. The simplistic style however, also contributes to the slowness and warmth of the show. At least I think so...In my opinion, this show is one that needs to be watched quite slowly, a fact which I am sure most people say also. Yes, in fact, a several week interval is just about right. However, if you were like me, foolish, unexpecting, not-thinking and rushing, you can also watch it in one day...though it may take your enjoyment out of the show.Overall, I chose a 9 because even with the imperfect art, storyline and what not, Junichi Satō definitely put his heart into working this story..and I can feel it. Certainly an underrated show, and needs more recognition. If you need a warm blanket of feels in the anime world, maybe this is your invitation. fits the show like a glove.

THATS ALL.', 'たまゆら ~ Tamayura: Hitotose - is a beautiful slice of life and a charming healing anime, that captivates with a well done composition of visuals and music, that creates an appealing atmosphere. The genre of so-called Iyashikei is still small, but already includes some very popular titles such as Aria, Tamago Market or Natsume Yuujinchou.Story: wholesomely relaxed, good pacing, episodic and simple, but thoughtful and without filler (8/10).The introduction is moving. It reveals the heroine\'s grief when she finds her father\'s old Rollei camera. The anime\'s beautiful and charming subtlety lies in its ability to convey deep emotions while still gently communicating life experiences. We...accompany the protagonist, Fuu Sawatari, on her journey to come to terms with her individual repressed memories and feelings, as well as the daily difficulties and challenges of her everyday life. We follow her decision to share her father\'s passion for photography and the peaceful, charming hometown where she finds new friends. The small town of ""Takehara"" is real, by the way, and is located in Hiroshima Prefecture, right on the Seto Inland Sea.Characters: Lovable, but not fully realised potential (7/10).All lovingly described, but not always with the depth that could have been possible. A nice contrast to other representatives of this genre like Hidamari Sketch, where all characters share the same interests, each member of Tamayura Hitotose\'s small clique has a different interest and personality.Sawatari Fuu:Her good heart and kindness will quickly grow on you. At first, she seems a little reserved, but she soon begins to grow and develop. Her slightly clumsy and quirky nature makes her character even sweeter and more lovable.Hanawa Kaoru:Always keeping an eye out for the odd misfortune, she is like a big sister to Fuu. She sometimes laughs heartily at Fuu\'s clumsiness, as is usual in such a relationship.Sakurada Maon:In nature, she is very similar to Fuu in shyness, but with a lot of heart. Maon has the charming and witty uniqueness of whistling her answers instead of speaking.Okazaki-Norie:Funny, spontaneous and impulsive, Norie is the energetic counterpart. Her character is often misunderstood by critics, as her lively nature is a complete contrast to the other characters. It should be noted that something would be missing without her, and not just the ability to articulate Maon\'s whistle language.The supporting characters also have coherent personalities and authentic attitudes. As a result, the cast as a whole is able to create a believable overall picture of the individual personalities through interaction.Visuals: Beautiful, charming, unfortunately with a bit of unused potential (7/10).The character design is a little overdone, but still beautiful and adorable for this type of anime, and therefore fits well overall. Tamayura bears the signature of Satô Junichi, so the parallel to the anime Aria comes as no surprise. The moods of the individual episodes are conveyed well. The surrounding landscape has something picturesque about it, in the truest sense of the word. The animation is nice to look at, but you get the impression, probably due to the tight budget, that more potential could have been exploited in this aspect. I don\'t think this is a major flaw, because despite the low budget, a lot of details have been put into the pictures. For example, Fuu\'s camera, which has the smallest of details, or the landscape, in which irregularities such as differences in colour, cracks in the brickwork or other slight signs of age can be seen. Overall, the animation and drawing style, even when CG elements have been used, result in a realistic overall picture, and the series can convince atmospherically.Sound: nice and harmonious, beautiful OP, the dialogues are a little bit clichéd (7/10).The BGM by Nobuyuki Nakajim underlines the atmosphere of the anime very well and gives it a very appealing musical framework.The OP ""Okaeri Nasai"" by Maaya Sakamoto is incredibly beautiful and fits the anime very well in its gentle way. The visual design of the OP underlines this impression with pictures of the quiet little town, the inclusion of pictures that look like they were taken by a camera is a nice touch.Several ending themes were used, the titles are:The end credits of episodes 1, 3 to 6 and 8 to 10 feature the song ""Kami-sama no Itazura"" by Megumi Nakajima. Her voice is high-pitched, but has a warm and clear sound, making it a very nice and gentle end to the episodes.""Natsudori"", also by Nakajima-san, graces the end credits of episode 2 and was used only for this episode. A beautiful and fitting arrangement for this episode.""Hoshizora"" has a very sensitive and beautiful melody and with Nakajima-san\'s voice it is very nice to hear at the end of episode 7.""Ashita no Hidamari"" is the title of episode 11 and is sung by the Seiyū: Taketatsu-, Asumi-, Iguchi- and Gibu-san.""A Happy New Year"" is sung again by Sakamoto Maaya. The song is performed in the closing sequence of episode 12, but very quietly, so that Sakamoto-san\'s beautiful voice doesn\'t really come to the fore. Still, a very beautiful song.The choice of voice actors for the anime was very good, unfortunately the dialogues are a bit clichéd from time to time. Nevertheless, I liked the voices and the way they were spoken. Especially the voice of Hanawa Kaoru, spoken by Asumi Kana. For the supporting characters, I really liked Kotobuki Minako as the voice for Miyoshi Chihiro as well as the voice of Nakata Jouji as Maestro. Last but not least, Iguchi Yuka\'s voice for Norie is a great achievement, as she does such a good job with this lively, fiery character.A gentle, charming story about how friendship and passion for photography helps overcome sadness, accept situations and rediscover the beauty of everyday life. Accompanied by beautiful imagery, lovable characters and the feeling of almost being there, the series hits just the right note if you are looking for a healing anime. The anime ""Tamayura"" (OVA), ""Tamayura futatsu (more aggressive)"" as well as the anime ""Aria"" or ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" may be of interest to you as well.Thank you for reading and have fun watching! accompany the protagonist, Fuu Sawatari, on her journey to come to terms with her individual repressed memories and feelings, as well as the daily difficulties and challenges of her everyday life.

What do you expect from anyone like after the death of someone dearly to them, of course, they don\'t want to be reminded of those sad moments.

There, she lived with her grandmother and having fun with her childhood friends and...get this, she starts to pick up what her late father used to do.

This is the kind of anime that you can sit back on a couch and enjoy it with families and friends.

In this anime, Tamayura who appears signifies happy memories which can be called beautiful memories.According to the genre Comedy, Slice of Life and Drama. Everything is very well displayed. When I watch it somehow I can feel the warmth inside. The drama is light, Slice of Life is fun, and the Comedy is light and good so it doesn\'t interfere with the sad or happy atmosphere.The synopsis tells the daily life of a...teenager named Sawatari Fuu and 3 of his friends.

Vivy is a show that had many highs and each episode felt very different from the last.I am not usually one for watching recap episodes, but I think this did a great job reminding us of the journey this amazing show has taken us on.Honestly, Studio Wit made the right decision creating this show instead of AOT s4 and I hope they continue making similar decisions.Sincerely,Idkbrojustmyopinion ', 'Not really a lot of things to say, other than it being a good recap episode of a truly amazing showThe episode served its purpose, going over all the main plot points, and summing up the Singularity Project and everything else, while also including some epic action scenes.The art is detailed and great as always, the action scenes are very detailed and exciting to watch even though it is a recap.The ost playing in the background are great music that I can definitely listen to for weeks.The episode does everything that a recap is supposed to do, overall very good.

The clips chosen tell the story pretty well for such an abridged retelling. The sound and art direction were likewise up to par for what I would expect from the team that put this show together.The execution does however beg the question of why? I understand recap episodes when they are trying to milk production time mid season or when there has been a gap in episode release dates, but a recap the week after finishing what seems like a well tied off story does perplex me a bit. As much as I think...the quality is among the best recaps I have seen, I just can't get over how strange it was rewatching the story in an inferior format immediately after finishing watching the full story. In short - this is an episode that ends up as less than the sum of it's parts. the quality is among the best recaps I have seen, I just can't get over how strange it was rewatching the story in an inferior format immediately after finishing watching the full story.

This show is a beautiful experience that combines timeless themes such as the evolution of artificial intelligences and the exploration of the human condition and I enjoyed every episode of it. Normally, I refrain from watching clip shows because they often disrupt the narrative of the main story, but since the show is already over and there's nothing left to tell, I guess I can make an exception for Vivy. So, was this little recap any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?StoryAs told by Matsumoto in the first few minutes,...this clip show recaps the entirety of the show in a 25-minute runtime and we get to see the trials and tribulations Vivy and Matsumoto have to endure in their mission to prevent a human-robot war 100 years in the future. As expected of every single clipshow out there, we're only told the broad strokes of their adventures, without the little details and nuances that made such adventures so entertaining and endearing in the first place. That's not to say that the recap is bad, because it isn't, but a recap isn't a substitute for the full story. (6/10)CharactersAgain, a clipshow cannot and should not replace the full story of an anime and one of the reasons why is because we're missing out on crucial elements of Vivy's character development.

Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38759/Sewayaki_Kitsune_no_Senko-san,"['Remember that time when your parents, grandparents, sibling, teacher, your best friend, your lover, or someone told you that ‘there’s no such thing as free lunch?’ Tell that to Kuroto Nakano and he may surprise you. It just happens so one day when he comes home after a long day of work and finds a kitsune demi-goddess in his home!Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is about the fluffiest anime you can find this year. Literally, Senko’s long smooth tail combined with her gentle personality brings a feeling of easiness. Nakano’s miserable life changes forever after meeting Senko. From the very first episode, I was prepared of...nothing less than a relaxing slice of life comedy. It’s what makes the manga so charming to read with the amount of daily life adventures…and misadventures. Animated by Dogakobo, this was also the perfect choice for a studio. They’ve been known to be involved with a lot of slice of life content, though recently leaning more into the ‘cute girls doing cute things’ category. This show makes that mold in some ways with an adult main character and demi-goddesses that does more than cute things.Slice of life, as everyone knows, is not much about a linear plot or complex storytelling. If you’re new to the genre, that’s ok because it’s easy to discover why the genre works so well for this anime. From day one, Senko decides to take care of Kuroto without any form of real payment. It’s essentially free lunch with some added bonus such as Senko’s fluffy tail. Besides that, Nakano can hardly resist the adorable charm of Senko and the being taken care of after a long day. Anyone who works the generic 8-5 pm shifts will know how enduring that can be. What awaits Nakano at home is this adorable little goddess declaring her duties to take care of him. While not being experienced like a housemaid, she is very much devoted to her promise. When Nakano feels down, she tries to cheer him up; often with the aid of her tail if necessary. When he needs advice, Senko becomes his personal life coach. It seems Nakano’s life really turned around with this newfound luck.Or does it?As this all sounds like him winning the lottery, it’s not as easy as it seems. Other characters such as the kitsune Shiro and Nakano’s neighbor Yasuko also gets involved in their lives. Contrary to Senko, Shiro treats Nakano more as a servant. On the other hand, Yasuko also gets very curious about Senko. With her otherworldly appearance, she becomes a joke for cosplay. Later in the story, we have the alluring kitsune Yozora entering Nakano’s life and aims to show her seductiveness. But really, there’s not much else to add for its main cast or is it necessary. The anime is aimed to be as relaxing as it can be. Despite the additional elements of drama, this never turns into a moody show with oversaturated melancholy. This may surprise viewers considering the way the synopsis sounds at first. Realistically, Nakano does feel a heavy weight in his life. He works at a company with long grudging hours that puts a stress on his mental health. If you put yourself in his shoes, you’ll understand.At some point in this anime, I asked myself the real reasons to watch this in the first place. The simple answer is to relax and enjoy the simplicity of slice of life. While there’s some subtle romance elements and minor drama, it always succeeds at what a slice of life show is. Here, we have 12 episodes that ranges from the reality of a stress at work to a relaxing day at the beach. Senko is also way too charming to keep eyes off of despite her inexperience with working with modern technology. However, the overall vibe of the show may occasionally rub viewers in the wrong way. There’s the age difference and it doesn’t help that Nakano gets mistaken for a pervert early on. Senko herself is also a target for hilarious borderline fan service moments. The show aims to bring comedy but there’s definitely some hidden innuendo when Nakano buries himself into Senko’s fluffy tail. I mean, the show is trying to be fluffy, right….?Finally, I do want to applaud the voice acting for such a small yet talented cast. Senko’s dialect contains an accent of formal Japanese and ancient speech tone. With her personality, it makes her sound very distinctive compared to other characters. We also shouldn’t forget the colorful and vibrant upbeat theme songs performed by the voice actors themselves. The fact is, there’s a lot of talent that went into this show beyond just the adorable character designs and charm.I love a classic slice of life anime these days and Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san managed to be just that. The author knew what they were aiming for from the start and this anime turned out to be a terrific picture. It uses supernatural characters to blend in with real life segments to bring about this charming creative work.

Now, maybe there is such a thing as free lunch.', ""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is not your typical slice of life. The reason for that is because of the focus of the show. This anime tells about a demigod fox named Senko who one day decided to take care of our poor and miserable Nakano who's exhausted from work. That's it, there is hardly anything more of it. What makes it not typical is that the focus is on self-insert.This show tries to makes Nakano simple so it is easy to self-insert ourselves. This is, of course, to make you fantasize how lovely it is to have someone like Senko take care of you....This point is further reinforced by the extra parts post-ending song. This part is the real self-insert with the first-person perspective. It is fanservice, but not the lewd kind of fanservice. And as bonus info, this anime likes to present about fluffy tails of Senko and the other demigod foxes.The fact that this is anime focuses on self-insert is not the bad thing about it. It does it, and it does it pretty well. The bad thing about this anime is the lack of depth. Nakano and Senko can be very shallow characters. There are not much to see from them as the focus is not on the characters. Side characters get it worse, as they get even less screentime than the main characters.I won't deny that the art and sound are great to help you feel relaxed while Senko does whatever different things she does each episode. The animations are not a spectacle, but I argue that sound and music usage is more important at keeping the viewers relaxed.And so, here is how Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san stands. This anime is a great watch to help you relax by self-inserting yourself into the position of Nakano. Enjoy Senko pampering you with her fluffy tail.  However, it has hardly anything to offer in terms of character depth. Characters and their interactions won't be memorable. Just focus on Senko taking care of you and It will be good to enjoy.

This really could've easily been a solid 8/10 from me if it didn't end up completely switching paces. I watched the 5th episode halfheartedly, and skimmed the 6th episode to confirm it did in fact continue full force with this harem theme. It does, and I believe it will only get worse assuming the harem gets larger.This came as a big disappointment since nobody really labels this anime as...falling within the harem genre, and very few if any people would inform you of such. It's a genre I don't enjoy and generally leaves me with a bad aftertaste. Personal gripes aside, I feel the genre objectively lacks much creativity or room for creators to do something unique with their story. While Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is not explicitly sexual, there are some sexual overtones within this anime, ranging from mild to metaphorical orgasm, further establishing itself into the harem genre.If you want to be completely emotionlessly objective, sure, it's a well-made and relatively enjoyable anime that obviously had a lot of effort put into making it; much more than other shows within the same genres. Personally, it's not my thing, and your mileage may vary. falling within the harem genre, and very few if any people would inform you of such.

The show is both cute, snug and generally just gave ME at least a feeling of content...I usually wouldn\'t get from just watching any anime. ""Senko"" the fox is from the first episode shown as having quite a significance to the show itself and shows herself as being very cheery, happy and all-loving.I could easily say it has some similarities to shows such as ""Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon"" which that too gives off a very generally snug feeling and a general feel of comedy, which THIS show does as well! From the first encounter a lot of comedy can be seen which I won\'t be mentioning specifically as to not spoil anything from the show itself.The series revolves around this idea of peoples well-being (in a negative term) can be given off to others close to oneself just because you are feeling bad yourself, the anime studio animating this made it very easy to understand quick by using black clouds as a way to show anger, negativity and generally when someone is close to their breaking point.The art is great, the sound is great, the character is great, and my enjoyment of it was GREAT! the only thing that could maybe be seen as being a little bit more lackluster is the story which to be honest isn\'t bad but it isn\'t anything special either.Therefore I\'ll give📔Story: 6/10🎨Art: 9/10🔊Sound: 8/10💬Character: 9/10🌈Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8.2/10This show has been able to outdo itself episode after episode and is slowly making it\'s way into my top anime list.

Senko-san is a perfect watch, or re-watch, for any level of weeb, whether...you are a seasoned pro, or just starting out, it will hold your attention and make you smile, watching this anime is like having your own personal Senko to pamper you.The pacing of the story is a little faster than in the Manga but that is to be expected with any adaptation, there is too much to fit in and needs to be placed a little sooner, however this does not detract from the value at all, sure there is no overarching plot or journey that the story has but that isn\'t the subject of the series, Senko-san has what it needs and it performs it well, the entire show is about Nakano being pampered and his daily life with our helpful fox Senko-san. The story and each episode is only designed to be happy and make the audience feel good, and that is exactly what happens, Senko-san is just a wholesome Slice of Life meant to make you smile.Art and Animation wise the style is very enjoyable, it\'s true to the manga and fits the bubbly, happy, warm atmosphere of the show. the characters all look distinct and there aren\'t any fall offs or mistakes, the effects where used are all clean and interesting, and seeing the reactions and movement adds to the feel more than the manga could achieve. during the flash backs the filtering used doesn\'t detract from what\'s being watched but is still there enough to be seen and noticed, the detailing is nice and the colour palette is warm and feels fresh, the only thing i would like to see is a tiny bit more detail into the backgrounds but that is just personal preference as they do still look very nice.Sound in this show is very well done, the effects and voice acting are perfectly placed and add so much to the general feel and atmosphere of the show that in my opinion the manga could never achieve only because of the lack of audio and animation. The VA\'s of the characters fit well with how they look and their personalities and overall adds a large amount to the finished product. The OP and ED are both fun and entertaining and I cant find a reason to skip either because I enjoy them too much. Effects and sound design play a HUGE role in the feel of a show and with watching Senko-san it feels like they are genuine sounds taken right from context, not someone making them in a studio. One of my favorite examples of the very exceptional voice work would be when Nakano stubbed his toe in the beginning of episode 2 my only thoughts were ""I know that feeling"" because of how well done the voicing was. Each line is delivered well and fits the expression/tone of the scene.The characters in Senko-san all feel different and fresh, the art is as it was in the manga and it fits each character\'s personality very well, the interactions feel clean and fun and with every episode I feel like a good amount of though and time was put into how the scenes should flow and the general direction of the episode, this being credit to the manga and the very well done adaptation. Each character has their own thoughts and motivations, as well with their own likes and dislikes and they all stand out as themselves and not just as a plot device. My only gripe is that the internet makes me look at Senko and picture Holo from Spice and Wolf.I can\'t take my attention off of my screen while watching, each time the opening starts my foot starts tapping and I start smiling knowing that I\'m in for a good time, as i stated before, this is one of if not the best feelgood manga i have ever read, and the animation and sound only further adds to the feeling. you are a seasoned pro, or just starting out, it will hold your attention and make you smile, watching this anime is like having your own personal Senko to pamper you.The pacing of the story is a little faster than in the Manga but that is to be expected with any adaptation, there is too much to fit in and needs to be placed a little sooner, however this does not detract from the value at all, sure there is no overarching plot or journey that the story has but that isn\'t the subject of the series, Senko-san has what it needs and it performs it well, the entire show is about Nakano being pampered and his daily life with our helpful fox Senko-san. The story and each episode is only designed to be happy and make the audience feel good, and that is exactly what happens, Senko-san is just a wholesome Slice of Life meant to make you smile.Art and Animation wise the style is very enjoyable, it\'s true to the manga and fits the bubbly, happy, warm atmosphere of the show. the characters all look distinct and there aren\'t any fall offs or mistakes, the effects where used are all clean and interesting, and seeing the reactions and movement adds to the feel more than the manga could achieve. during the flash backs the filtering used doesn\'t detract from what\'s being watched but is still there enough to be seen and noticed, the detailing is nice and the colour palette is warm and feels fresh, the only thing i would like to see is a tiny bit more detail into the backgrounds but that is just personal preference as they do still look very nice.Sound in this show is very well done, the effects and voice acting are perfectly placed and add so much to the general feel and atmosphere of the show that in my opinion the manga could never achieve only because of the lack of audio and animation. The VA\'s of the characters fit well with how they look and their personalities and overall adds a large amount to the finished product. The OP and ED are both fun and entertaining and I cant find a reason to skip either because I enjoy them too much.

Those words drew me in and got me hopeful at first, but by this point I think Senko is anything but wholesome and healing.The idea is solid - some dude living a stressful life meets a magical being that can help make it better by calming and caring for him. It does sound very healing, and looks great on paper to me. Enter Senko. Generally when I think wholesome, I think something the whole family could watch, or something you wouldn\'t mind your parents walking in on. My god,...I would not be caught dead watching Senko-san. I was expecting character-driven, heartwarming stories, but the majority of this show has been a loli fox-girl fantasy complete with constant blushing, awkward noises, and \'fluffing\'. Please for the love of the Inari god of old, no more \'fluffing\'.I like fantasy slice of life shows for the meaningful character interactions they have. Maybe it\'s a lonely old yokai and the main character comforts them, or a frustrated spirit trying to move on to the next world. That\'s healing - that\'s heartwarming. And it can be wonderful. Senko-san, so far, has had very little of this character interaction and a whole lot more \'cute girl doing overly cutesy things\'. It\'s not entirely absent, sure - it\'s just buried under the weight of suggestive loli fanservice.I started to think, after a few episodes, about alternative approaches. What if Senko, instead of being a little girl, looked and acted like an old woman befitting her 800 years? She would try to help Nakano, and they would trade stories of their lives. It would calm and reassure the two of them and form a bond. They would struggle through their own lives in separate human and godly worlds, but in the end come home to talk and relax and deal with their problems (maybe even focus on aging and a wasted, job-centered life). Just an idea, but I can\'t help but think of the potential in these kind of shows if the main focus wasn\'t just \'cute girl doing cute things\' (with an older guy suggestively playing along). Hell, if someone knows an anime similar to the idea above, I\'d love to try it!I\'m gonna keep watching this show. It\'s already halfway done, but unless it pulls a miracle turnaround, and fast, there\'s no way I can score it higher than this (it\'s on the verge of dropping to a 3, even). So no, I don\'t think Senko-san is very healing, and it\'s ANYTHING but wholesome. It\'s not an offensively bad show, but if Senko-san continues like this to the end, it will have left me nothing but disappointment and nightmares of ""Nyaaaaaa, uwuuuu, gwaahhh"".(I don\'t agree with your score doesn\'t automatically = inaccurate. 3/10 is downright generous for these characters by me, and if all you want is a shallow fox-girl trip, more power to you - but I don\'t, hence the score. Plain and simple. I think other anime [like Natsume Yuujinchou] have done the healing thing WAY better.)I finished it. It never got any better. Three. I would not be caught dead watching Senko-san.

Three.', 'Doga Kobo has done it again with a series that\'s exactly what it sets out to be, a cute heartwarming show. Senko-san does this perfectly and you get exactly as advertised in high quality.The story follows a hard working man who\'s beginning to be slammed with massive depression due to how rough just living and working is, when a fox girl who feels like she owes his ancestors arrives to start helping him feel better. If you can accept that as a concept, the show performs it perfectly, so it\'s just a matter of if that concept could be appealing to you. Every episode...is a breath of life and happiness, and I couldn\'t help but smile when watching and that\'s saying a lot.The art is standard Doga Kobo moe art, very well done though and very fitting for the show.The sound was also good and helped to create the ""breath of life"" atmosphere the show has going for itself.The characters were pretty likable, the titular character was memorable.Overall I\'d give this a 10/10 for being near perfect at what it sets out to be, although I\'d understand lower scores if this isn\'t what you\'re looking for, you may still find enjoyment in it. To know if you\'d dislike it simply go back and read what I said the story is about, if that just sounds plain bad to you then you\'ll likely dislike this show. is a breath of life and happiness, and I couldn\'t help but smile when watching and that\'s saying a lot.The art is standard Doga Kobo moe art, very well done though and very fitting for the show.The sound was also good and helped to create the ""breath of life"" atmosphere the show has going for itself.The characters were pretty likable, the titular character was memorable.Overall I\'d give this a 10/10 for being near perfect at what it sets out to be, although I\'d understand lower scores if this isn\'t what you\'re looking for, you may still find enjoyment in it.

So it has been a good year and on paper this anime has a lot going for it. It\'s relatable, especially for a Japanese audience where overworking seems to be the norm. Having something to come home to after a long work day however is something we can all relate to.And that\'s basically the plot of this anime. A fox spirit named Senko...is helping one of those overworked and depressed Japanese men back on his feet by simply having him relax. And I already said, on paper that can go in a miriad of interesting directions while still remaining one of those typical slow iyashikei plots.Too bad the execution is just terrible, I\'d rather describe this as a pervy fetish anime than a healing anime, and frankly it\'s something that\'s simply making me uncomfortable, which is exactly the opposite of what I want it to be. This anime is filled to the brim with weird fetish needs, the ever annoying tail ""fluffing"" they go in bath together, she steps on him as a massage, he finds her in weird suggestive poses, she\'s being dressed up in  a maid costume by the pervy neighbour... This all while there\'s practically 0 character moments, not a moment in the now 7 episode run have I seen the 2 characters actually learn from each other or grown as a pair (whatever that could mean). This anime is completely built on its pervy moments, nothing happens in between and sometimes a joke is made about these moments.The best one I recall can be found in episode 7 where the main character gets a massage from Senko, she simply steps on him with way too many foot shots and the main character returns the favour (he even massages her butt but she\'s SO sensative there). Then, the next day, the pervy neighbour comments on the fact that the main character is a lot happier and Senko makes the suggestive comment ""that\'s because I stepped on him yesterday"", the joke being that the pervy neighbour now gives Senko a strange look. The thing is, it\'s exactly what happened basically, it was just extremely vanilla hentai with all the suggestions that it\'s more or less a sex act here. Even the commentary during the massage scene was just filled with sexual innuendos. Her waist is so thin that my hands completely fit around hers, she\'s sensative around the base of the tail etc. This while the anime constantly reminds you: This isn\'t supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, she\'s 800 years old, how\'s this pervy???Well anime, it is pervy, and if this is your way of relaxing your audience, I can see why sexual harassment is so high in Japan. As of the writing of this review, this anime has a solid 7,66 on MAL, directly below it is Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight, The Quintessential Quintuplets, and Amagi Brilliant Park. All flawed series, absolutely, but at least they have something going for them. This anime doesn\'t, it\'s just an uncomfortable mess.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)I\'m really enjoying the story and art style of this anime, making it one of my favorite ones this season. It\'s honestly just so wholesome and pure and makes me wish I would have a helpful fox of my own (even though that\'s never going to happen and I will most likely die alone). I\'m not sure what it is about the art style, but I am genuinely in love with Senko-san. She is just so damn cute and fluffy! (don\'t you dare lewd her though......she must be protected)The sound is also amazing. The OP is without a doubt my favorite one of this season and the ED is also amazing. So far I\'ve listened to the OP a couple hundred times on repeat, and I\'m still enjoying it as if I heard it for the first time.In the end, the characters and story are similar in a way to ""Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon"", except replace the dragons with Mofu Mofu foxes. But don\'t get me wrong, it\'s a complete different experience and is without a doubt not a ""Dragon Maid Clone"".Overall, I\'m giving Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san a solid 8/10. If you\'re looking for a nice and happy FeelsGood anime, look no futher as this one is for you. <3 she must be protected)The sound is also amazing.

Like this is the saddest anime this season. Like I get why people are liking it, but it makes it even sadder.The anime in a nutshell:There\'s a guy in his 30\'s working an exploiting job, and instead of fixing his life, he gets high and hallucinates 10 year old looking furry girls \'pampering\' him. Of course to dissolve moral concerns, ""luckily they are 800 years old"". Naturally, they become soulmates instantly, because whatever else would you want when you are 30, other than having 10-year-old little girl soulmates.The anime...is somewhat similar to UzaMaid, having the same age gap between the main characters, but there we were constantly reminded that this way of thinking is unethical, they took it to the extremes and made fun of it, resulting in a quite funny show overall. Speaking of humor, there isn\'t a single drop of it in this show.Story:There is ZERO story, nothing is happening at all. Dude spends all his time (when he\'s not working his 12h shift) basically molesting said ""800-year-old girls"" or taking a bath with them. Of course he wasn\'t the one initiated the bath together but certainly didn\'t object too much.Characters:No development at all, bland characters, they are basically exist to satisfy the self-insert male MC.Art, sound:I guess ok, nothing out of the ordinary. Although the dude\'s voice... If I didn\'t have depression before, after listening to it I certainly have now.Basically the point of the anime that there are a lot of similar people in Japan, working at exploitative jobs, outside of it having no life at all. And instead of fixing your burning garbage can of life, just accept it, and watch this feel-good show. is somewhat similar to UzaMaid, having the same age gap between the main characters, but there we were constantly reminded that this way of thinking is unethical, they took it to the extremes and made fun of it, resulting in a quite funny show overall.

And an entertaining one if you buy into it\'s premise: a divine loli-waifu becomes your personal therapist, cleaning woman and love interest. While the show fails to achieve the full quality of it’s obvious role model “Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid”, it solidly entertains with feel-good slice-of-life comedy centered around the titular kemonomimi girl\'s vibrant personality.*** Story ***Let\'s start right with the elephant in the room. ""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san"" stars a furry harem, and it’s best loli Senko and the MC Nakano  have a lot of intimate physical contact situations. This includes bathing and...back scrubbing, ear cleaning, back massage with bare feet, hair cutting, and they share a bed of course. This intimacy and it\'s depression-breaking effect on MC are not only central to the story, they are the story. Then there is that tail touching trope, and the orgasmic sounds it triggers in Senko. It\'s not even a hidden metaphor for sex, it\'s just a metaphor for it. Like Nakano himself concludes the bathing episode: ""I did a lot of fluffy-fluffing that night. Thank you, Senko!"". You are welcome, this fantasy is a little weird but probably PG-13.So undercurrent sexual tension is present in spades, and the resulting sitcom is at the heart of the show\'s comedy. The genius of the narrative is that this is never defiled by mundane sexualized fan service. The story teases the audience along a fine line without ever crossing it, even in the bare skin episodes. Probably much to the delight of doujinshi artists, who get a pure A-tier loli to build on in Senko. Studio Doga Kobo is very aware of the situation. Self-parody scenes of a police raid (E01, 6:35m) and multiple pedo-bear references (E03, 9:02m and 11:12m) make this abundantly clear.The complete story could be seen as a well executed wish-fulfillment fantasy with moe and fetish elements. Many males, not only in Japan, will consider the titular cute loli elder with her magic powers, housewifiness, perfect traditional manners, a sprinkle of innocent sexual attraction, and foremost a planet-sized positive vibrancy the apex of womanhood. The evil genius is to accept and never question the fact MC is exploited and burnt-out in his job. Rather than changing this, as it happens in Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid, he\'s sent a peak-kawaii foxy lady from heaven to sooth the pain. Why remove causes when you can deal with the symptoms in such an adorable way?Overall Senko-san is a one kitsune personality show, the remaining cast, even the MC, are accessories to produce slice-of-life plot for her. And to be honest, I could watch her doing cute things for hours. In this aspect, the show completely succeeds. Excursions into slapstick comedy, like in the vacuum cleaner episode, and the submissive routine pampering are less entertaining in my book. The penultimate episode deserves a special place in my heart, because of the amazing change in tone and direction quality. Senko\'s party, her misunderstood good-bye speech, and the lone walk into the rain hit poetic melancholy notes beyond simple tearjerking. (6/10)*** Animation ***The center of gravity in ""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san"" animation are the fox-goddess\' ears. The further apart an object is from them, the lower the animation quality. Even alleged mains like Nakano are no exception from this rule. Senkos elaborate design with big, expressive golden eyes, her detailed shrine maiden\'s hakama outfit, and most importantly the fluffy head and tail get the extra pen-stroke, and that\'s fine with me. The overall animation excluding her is just average, if not slightly below. Cost-saving techniques such as low-detail still backgrounds, zooms into stills, simplified faces, mouth moving only dialog animation and structure-less clothing are highly visible. The animation is not fully fluent all the time, often falling back to extended still montages.Despite all that, the artwork\'s style resonates with a “made with love and passion” feeling in me. Summing this mixed results up, there is an overall average quality (4/10).*** Sound ***The show has a really catchy OP and an above average ED. Sound effects such as the clapping of Senko\'s wooden shoes or effects such as a chime when she perks her ears are appropriately used. There are recurring mini-themes of functional music for moods, persons and situations, many of them done using traditional Japanese instruments. This of course supports Senko-san\'s told-fashioned Japanese themes very well. Overall, the sound is solidly average, (5/10).*** Characters ***There are five characters in the cast. Beside the titular kitsune Senko, the second main (in name only) is self-insert MC Nakano, a burnt-out software engineer. Then there is the harem consisting of spoiled brat kitsune loli Shiro, her and Senko\'s voluptuous boss and femme fatale Sora, and the slightly maniac manga-drawing neighbor Yasuko Kouenji.Senko is an very well designed character combining traditional Japanese values, unlimited vibrancy, and a smart polite humbleness. With up to eleven cuteness features such as fang, cat mouth, light clumsiness, and the sweetest pouting of the season you just can\'t avoid falling in love. There\'s some but not much character development with her, e.g. towards the end she develops jealousy towards other harem members approaching the MC. She\'s in full control of the events, without ever dropping her friendly to the point of submissiveness, humble and vibrant facade. This character carries the weight of nearly all of the show on her small shoulders, and makes it look easy.MC Nakano is so self-insert that there literally is a first person view bonus scene after the ED in which he/you is given the pampering of the week. Nakano\'s genericness is emphasized by expressionless eyes, rudimentary drawing style, plain clothing, and mostly reactive dialog. He enjoys the kitsune show, but never is in control of it. Of course he recovers from his burn-out courtesy of Senko\'s influence, but neither is he ever fully cured, nor does he tackle the causes of his condition. In that sense, he is not developing at all. A typical plot point example for him is to teach Senko about some feature of the modern world, such as electricity. This earns him admiration for the miracle she just learnt about, cleverly assigned to the messenger. But in the end knowing how a vacuum cleaner works is nothing special.The two other kitsunes are hardly more than fanservice girls and significantly more sexualized than Senko. Ironically it’s Nakano\'s neighbour Yasuko who seems to get the most character development of all the cast. She picks up cooking, gets her life organized, and starts to get out of her shell. (4/10)***  Enjoyment ***Yes, the show is quite enjoyable, just don\'t think too much about it\'s premise to avoid waking up. Despite average production values, flat cast beside best girl, and borderline-submissive plot for Senko she simply makes you smile and calm down. Moe design at it\'s best. Senko-san is heroin-grade escapism at highest degree of perfection. Just don\'t confuse that with real iyashikei (healing anime). One for the story, and six for the fox. (7/10)*** Overall ***(6+4+5+4+7)/26=5.1, which means average mainstream. ""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san"" is an enjoyable, average show with a strong and cute female main. You will not regret watching it, but forget it the moment the next cute waifu is washed on the seasonal shores. For fans of lolis and furries, the show will surely become part of their ""special list"". Senko’s character makes up most of the fun, so I can understand perfectly well if people rate the show higher than 5/10. In the end, they rate the waifu, not the show - which is fine. I would defend my rating as a base line, just add extra points for fluffyness as needed.

Cost-saving techniques such as low-detail still backgrounds, zooms into stills, simplified faces, mouth moving only dialog animation and structure-less clothing are highly visible. The animation is not fully fluent all the time, often falling back to extended still montages.Despite all that, the artwork\'s style resonates with a “made with love and passion” feeling in me. Summing this mixed results up, there is an overall average quality (4/10).*** Sound ***The show has a really catchy OP and an above average ED. Sound effects such as the clapping of Senko\'s wooden shoes or effects such as a chime when she perks her ears are appropriately used. There are recurring mini-themes of functional music for moods, persons and situations, many of them done using traditional Japanese instruments. This of course supports Senko-san\'s told-fashioned Japanese themes very well. Overall, the sound is solidly average, (5/10).*** Characters ***There are five characters in the cast. Beside the titular kitsune Senko, the second main (in name only) is self-insert MC Nakano, a burnt-out software engineer. Then there is the harem consisting of spoiled brat kitsune loli Shiro, her and Senko\'s voluptuous boss and femme fatale Sora, and the slightly maniac manga-drawing neighbor Yasuko Kouenji.Senko is an very well designed character combining traditional Japanese values, unlimited vibrancy, and a smart polite humbleness. With up to eleven cuteness features such as fang, cat mouth, light clumsiness, and the sweetest pouting of the season you just can\'t avoid falling in love. There\'s some but not much character development with her, e.g. towards the end she develops jealousy towards other harem members approaching the MC. She\'s in full control of the events, without ever dropping her friendly to the point of submissiveness, humble and vibrant facade. This character carries the weight of nearly all of the show on her small shoulders, and makes it look easy.MC Nakano is so self-insert that there literally is a first person view bonus scene after the ED in which he/you is given the pampering of the week. Nakano\'s genericness is emphasized by expressionless eyes, rudimentary drawing style, plain clothing, and mostly reactive dialog. He enjoys the kitsune show, but never is in control of it. Of course he recovers from his burn-out courtesy of Senko\'s influence, but neither is he ever fully cured, nor does he tackle the causes of his condition. In that sense, he is not developing at all. A typical plot point example for him is to teach Senko about some feature of the modern world, such as electricity. This earns him admiration for the miracle she just learnt about, cleverly assigned to the messenger. But in the end knowing how a vacuum cleaner works is nothing special.The two other kitsunes are hardly more than fanservice girls and significantly more sexualized than Senko. Ironically it’s Nakano\'s neighbour Yasuko who seems to get the most character development of all the cast. She picks up cooking, gets her life organized, and starts to get out of her shell. (4/10)***  Enjoyment ***Yes, the show is quite enjoyable, just don\'t think too much about it\'s premise to avoid waking up. Despite average production values, flat cast beside best girl, and borderline-submissive plot for Senko she simply makes you smile and calm down. Moe design at it\'s best. Senko-san is heroin-grade escapism at highest degree of perfection. Just don\'t confuse that with real iyashikei (healing anime). One for the story, and six for the fox. (7/10)*** Overall ***(6+4+5+4+7)/26=5.1, which means average mainstream. ""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san"" is an enjoyable, average show with a strong and cute female main. You will not regret watching it, but forget it the moment the next cute waifu is washed on the seasonal shores. For fans of lolis and furries, the show will surely become part of their ""special list"". Senko’s character makes up most of the fun, so I can understand perfectly well if people rate the show higher than 5/10. In the end, they rate the waifu, not the show - which is fine. I would defend my rating as a base line, just add extra points for fluffyness as needed. (5/10)', 'Sorry, but i\'m not getting the healing feeling that this anime promised.Rather, it has given me very weird and uncomfortable vibes that make me feel like some things are not okay in here...We have our typical self insert MC here that has a rough work life, like many japanese men do, so i\'m sure a lot of people can insert themselves well because other that what i\'ve seen from the MC, there isn\'t much else. he\'s basically as blank as a canvas.And on the other hand, we have senko, who\'s the main reason i\'m getting these uncomfortable feelings. Senko is an 800 year old fox...girl, who visually more resembles a child that is fulfilling a wife role out of her own will. Excuse me? you heard right. The entire time, the thought hasn\'t left my mind that she is basically what i see as a child bride, a big nono in my eyes when it comes to people\'s loli fantasies.The anime itself presents some weird ""forgotten childhood memories"" here and there that, in my opinion, were just there to slam in a bit of story so that senko doesn\'t just appear out of nowhere in some random dude\'s house to be his 800 year old loli fox wife.and from here on is where i\'ve given up with high hopes of the healing properties that it, and many people i\'ve met, promised me i\'ll find. to this date i can only remember that creepy feeling and a lackluster character presentation. girl, who visually more resembles a child that is fulfilling a wife role out of her own will.

furthermore--what is helpful senko-san performing for exactly in its genre? this is half rhetorical--i realize obsessive otaku is the answer, but the other half is genuine, and reflective: what do otaku like about this? a slice of life anime involving cute girls doing cute things, for instance, is vapid but comfortable in its simplicity: cute girls really do just go around and do cute things for twelve episodes, ticking off the tropes of the genre and cementing themselves as the usual 7/10s that they are. helpful senko-san feels immeasurably worse than that concept, however. it bills itself as a ""romance"" involving a certain male nobody, a black hole of personality fit for self insertion, and a doting fox-girl who is completely and utterly sanitized to be a robotic personal maid/servant/lover/mother. now, whether the otaku audience has mommy issues or girlfriend troubles or anything else, i must ask this question i\'ve been leading up to: is this show REALLY the aphrodisiac to the masses that it\'s set up to be? does it really placate otaku who yearn for these sorts of fantasies? as in... when the show is set up and finished and done, where exactly are you? a CGDCTSOL (how\'s that for a mouthful) is a window into the lives of cute girls screwing around and then you look away from the window. helpful senko-san is you, the viewer, stepping into the flesh suit of character nakano for twelve episodes, imagining yourself ""pampered"" and taken care of by the littlest most perfect aide to ever exist, and then it ends and...well, i have trouble shaking away the imagery of seeing your self insert laugh along with all his friends in a richly colored world before the screen dims, the camera pulls back, and there sits the otaku, the illumination of his computer monitor not only capturing him but the squalor of his desk, the rows of beer bottles clumped together, an undone mattress in the corner, a--let me be direct. i am not making fun of senko viewers. what i am getting at is an unintentional cruelness on the part of the show: what is the archetype of those who self insert strongest supposed to do next? how do they even feel? how SHOULD they feel? and all of this leads to another line of questioning: am i projecting? hah, i suppose so, but the question stands. and another line of questioning: is there anything wrong with a self insert in a romantic setting? romance is a big genre, after all, so why am i being unfair towards this one when there stands thousands more? and now, we can take apart the meat of the show.the helpful senko san is unbelievably shallow. ankle deep. the wet on your skin after a shower but before the towel. over twelve episodes, we meet five characters, and each one of them is, without exaggeration, absolutely nothing. main character nakano is an every man who works a demanding job (and i\'ll touch on that later) who has very, very, very simple characteristics: he is a hard worker. he likes to eat food. he can feel embarrassment. he plays video games and watches anime sometimes. that\'s it. there\'s the character. i\'ll just unzip his costume for you so you can gear up, okay? across from him is his lovely fox servant, senko, and here is her character: cheerful. doting. happy. subservient. docile. willing. very willing. exists for nakano. alright, there\'s your girlfriend for twelve episodes! or, wait, that\'s not right, because the show gets really, really weird with the crossing boundaries of what constitutes a marriage and what constitutes having a sugar mommy. indeed, these lines are blurred between whether nakano sees his submissive servant as his partner or his mom, and she feeds into it, and it\'s all... kind of disturbing, really. and empty, because there\'s so little to either of their characters that, really, whatever kind of ""relationship"" they form is vapid... and worthless. it\'s so much worse than just being ""not that deep"".and to what plots do these characters engage in? all sorts! like... shopping for groceries. drinking. eating. taking a bath. using a vacuum cleaner. working. yeah, real exciting, but why is this different from the aforementioned CGDCTSOL genre? well, it\'s been awhile, but in the last two i watched--yuru yuri and new game--i seem to remember there being some forms of conflict and character squabbles in each episode, even if only slightly. characters in these shows somehow define themselves more than anyone in senko-san, and that\'s surprising... and kind of depressing. every episode here is a wet blanket of plot. there never exists any kind of real pushback to anything save for an absolutely paper thin pathetic attempt at underlying drama that one will unearth for themselves should THEY choose to follow this episodic virtual pampering. and, again, if the point isn\'t to watch cute girls do cute things nor to have any sort of real, substantial plot develop, then the point has to be, again, to self insert and indulge myself. but what am i indulging in? nakano gets a backrub. i\'m not getting a backrub. i\'m not getting anything.i\'ve written way, way too much about such an empty show, but this last bit of criticism is something i feel more necessary than anything else: helpful senko-san plays with the idea of critiquing the rigorous and disgustingly unhealthy standard of japan working culture. the phase is ""plays with it"", unfortunately, and that pisses me off, because why do it all then? in almost every episode, we get glances into his working life, the unfair conditions, the constant stress imbued, the, frankly, harassment stemming from his coworkers and boss that feed into his own time, the... oh, it\'s all such bullshit because nakano just shrugs it off, right. well, he\'s got senko-san, it\'s all okay! that\'s fucking great, but there\'s millions of workers who DON\'T have senko-san, and they DO face the constant horseshit conditions that nakano does, and the show just doesn\'t do enough with the window it offers. lean into it more, damn it. have some teeth, you pathetic otaku fantasy. a conversation begins with the easiest placation an anxious populace purposefully seeks--entertainment.... sorry, one more quip. i don\'t fucking get the tail thing. at all adapting to be an art and that an adaptation should strive to eclipse the source material and exist as its own unique product. in a final sense, i can totally forgive the team because this was a tick-off-all-the-boxes money machine through and through and they chased that money to the bank because why the hell would they not. additionally, a lot of the complaints i\'m going to have here are probably more than just senko-san, instead probably more appropriately focused on the ""hole"" it is digging into. but i watched senko-san, so here we fucking are.enough preamble. first thing\'s first: the art is quite good. there\'s really never anything too special to look at: i don\'t remember more than four or five different environments even existing, the majority of the show taking place inside an apartment (not that this is a problem, but as far as art variety goes...). characters are certainly drawn appealingly, and there\'s rarely any animation that sticks out in a negative sense (with the only example really coming to mind being a backrubbing scene with zero weight or interaction to it). sound design is good, too, and it\'s not like any song in the show is obnoxious or anything. so hat\'s off, there.now, let\'s dive in.the first thing i want to truly ask: who is this show intended for?

The first episode introduces us to our main character, whose name doesn\'t at all matter, since he may very well be the most self-insertable character of all time. A late 20s to early 30s plank of wood with a fairly ambiguous ""white collar"" job that he is discontent with. He is afflicted with ""anime-darkness disease"", which is - as far as I can tell - just a black cloud manifestation of his discontent that may or may not also cause discontent in those around him. This isn\'t made all that clear.In order to help him, the titular 800 year-old-fox-lolita-demigod Senko-san begins to live with him and ""pamper"" him in order to mitigate the aforementioned darkness. Basically, she is a house maid, but also a demigod, so she\'s good at everything.For those of you who have seen Kobayashi... this is probably sounding a little bit familiar.Senko-san is super cute, and her character design is cute - albeit a bit one-dimensional. Other than her desire to pamper Wood-kun and to make him happy after he comes home from work, there is basically nothing to her character. She is carefree, is a great cook, is 800 years old, and has a fluffy tail. That\'s it.If you were looking for any of the characters to develop or change at any point, you are looking at the wrong anime my friend. Whereas Kobayashi forms a sort of family with Tooru and Kanna, and her behavior changes as a result of this, there is no discernible difference between Wood-kun at the beginning and end of the anime. He started out as a basically flawless character, and ended the same way, just now he had a fox-maid and is slightly happier.He is a sad, overworked, white-collar worker in the beginning, and he becomes a slightly less sad, but still overworked white-collar worker in the end.The anime ends by paying some lip-service to some sort of contrived conflict that doesn\'t really exist, but had to so that we can cry at the end.All of the other characters are good (with a special shoutout to the next-door neighbor character, whom I found adorable), but none of them honestly matter that much to the plot. Honestly, I think that they were kind of just there so that there could be any variation in character interaction at all.I\'ve been told that this anime is part of a niche sub-genre of anime called ""healing"" anime, where you are supposed to project yourself onto the protagonist to such an extent that you yourself feel pampered by Senko-san (aided by first-person post credit scenes where Senko-san pampers the viewer directly), and thus you feel better in real life... or something like that.Basically, the only reason why this anime exists is to be the ultimate form of self insert bait, and if that\'s what you\'re looking for, this is the anime for you.The sound design in this anime is delicious, and the voice actors did an incredible job bringing characters to life that would otherwise be completely lifeless. They deserve my highest praise, especially the voice actors for Senko-san and the neighbor characters. Senko-san in particular uses a sort of antiquated diction in a cutesy, child-like tone, which is pulled off brilliantly by Ms. Azumi. Well done for sure.Now, we are going to do a quick contrast of this anime with Kobayashi, and we are going to scout out some key differences between these two anime, which I hope can help to better characterize them.Kobayashi is an inherently flawed character. She\'s dreary, pretty cynical, and is a borderline alcoholic. When she gets drunk (which she does often), she ranges from hyper-passionate, to outright abusive - at one point even going to far as to force Tooru to strip nude in a public place as she reprimands her about how she doesn\'t dress as a proper maid should. She is also a highly aloof genius, who rarely does anything of outside of work, drink with her friend from work, and shirk social interaction beyond the bare minimum.The plot is kick-started by two of her key flaws: she drinks too much, and ends up talking to a dragon in the woods, with whom she continues to drink and complain about her day-to-day, before inviting the dragon back to her place to live as a maid. Then, when she wakes up and has to confront her mistake, she realizes that her aloofness has made her late to work, and thus is forced to reluctantly accept the dragon - named Tooru\'s help, marking the beginning of their relationship.Wood-kun has exactly one character flaw to start: he doesn\'t get enough sleep.Then, Senko-san shows up, and we remedy this problem almost immediately, and replace it with the problem that Wood-kun likes Senko\'s fluffy tail to an almost fetishistic degree. Now they live together.As the story progresses for Kobayashi, she becomes evidently more cheerful, becoming more accepting of Tooru\'s affection and bumbling assistance, becoming a parental figure for Kanna, and becoming friends with a number of other dragons. She also drinks markedly less as the show goes on, and it\'s clear that the character that we end the series with is vastly improved from the one we start with.Wood-kun gets pampered by the virtually perfect Senko-san. He eats various delicious-looking meals, gets massages, bathes, and cuddles with Senko-san\'s tail. She gets upset once or twice, which seems to have no real consequence.In the end, Kobayashi completes her character arc by confronting powers far beyond her control in order to keep her new familial unit together, showing how strong she has become as a person through association with her new friends.To avoid spoilers, I will simply assure you that there is no such confrontation for Wood-kun, and if there was, it would be contrived and terrible.To make a long review short, if you simply want to feel good, and you want to be able to project yourself onto the main character, Senko-san is definitely the anime for you. If you want characters that grow and change, or if you want a story: just watch Kobayashi.Score: 6/10I appreciate what the anime was trying to do, and the anime is technically sound.

There’s a bit of light drama here and there, but there isn’t really much substance to it, at least as far as the anime gets. There’s some romance too, but that too is pretty minimal with nothing like relationship development beyond setting up the initial premise. There’s comedy throughout as well, though surprisingly I felt this aspect too wasn’t all that common, and thus I don’t really consider this a comedy anime either.And thus we’re...left with the slice of life aspect. There are other characters that have some presence, but the anime is very heavily centered around Nakano, an office worker who has a job so terrible that the stress from it is causing some sort of dark miasma to develop around him, and Senko, a fox deity that has come to pamper him in order to diminish his stress. There’s some variety to how this goes, such as in that it may involve other characters or there may be some event that initiates things, but in the end it usually comes down to Senko taking care of Nakano in various wholesome ways, ranging from cooking for him, giving him a massage, playing games with him, etc. Nakano himself is pretty much a blank slate self insert character for those feeling the weight of the daily white collar job grind who never really does anything of note and is thus hard to get invested in, but him being such a character allows Senko’s bright personality and kindness to shine through well so the overall dynamic is solid.Ultimately, I would say that it does what it’s trying to do well, in that it does have a very relaxing feel. But at the same time, I felt that just that wasn’t enough to hold up the anime, and it overall started feeling like too much of the same thing. If there was a bit more of an overarching plot, if Nakano had more of a personality, if there were more characters and they had more of an impact, if there was more variety and quantity with the comedy, and/or if the show was just paced faster overall, then I think the good aspects of this anime would have shined through a lot better. However, that isn’t the case, and thus the anime overall felt pretty slow, even straight up dull at times.The art and animation were pretty solid but not particularly exceptional. The character designs were also good for the three fox deities, though it wasn’t particularly good at using all of them as it was overtly focused on Senko. Designs outside of that weren’t particularly notable. The OP and ED were both solid in terms of audio and visuals and fit the anime well. The soundtrack also fit well, having tracks that were both relaxing and fit the fantasy related themes, though no single track was particularly memorable. left with the slice of life aspect.

Sometimes they are the ones who are true to their nature, and give us a sense of fulfillment that is rare to see.Senko-san has beautifully filled that sense of fulfillment niche with a grace and ease that I believe hasn't been done since the Aria franchise. The sense of nurturing and calmness that viewers get to experience is akin to a breezy, spring day with a warm cup of oolong tea. The complete environment that can whisk you away into a different place through...a portal of serenity takes extreme care and effort.Every single moment of Senko-san never loses its way with trying to be more than a fluffy-SOL that is meant to make you smile through personable, relatable interactions. This may not be a show that will entice everyone, and I can see for a crowd who want copious amounts of action that this would be far removed.However, if you ever feel like you need an anime that is going to give you a loving-motherly hold, I cannot think of many better options than Senko-san. It won't blow you away with its art, sound, or character development. It is not that type of anime. It's a finessed 10/10 through its execution and niche.Please give this anime a try.

Senko-San is the 1b to Attack on Titan's 1a for Anime of the Season."", ""Senko-san is an anime that aims at a certain audience, overworked and stressed otaku that have a lose grip on reality, but let's start from the beginning:The Anime follows the life of the standard salary man Nakano, that is basically a 'yes' man pushover that can't say 'no' to save his life. Thanks to that, basically his only character trait apart from his love for fluffy things, he is endlessly overworked in a job where he is seemingly surrounded by bad coworkers that shove their work on him.Some day a demigod fox girl (that is a 800-year-old legal loli, as the anime never fails to...mention) drops into his life and starts pampering him to take away his stress that is so bad it manifests as a black aura around him and starts to threaten to infect other people around him (allegedly, we never see that happen).That is all you need to know, because that is all that happens. Some shenanigans ensue with sometimes more and sometimes less awkwardness (bathing together, ear cleaning, eating, drinking etc.).The problem with the show is twofold.On one hand there are just better anime with similar concepts out there, Dragon Maid comes to mind or Sakura Quest.Those have more character depth and way more general development on every level and while Senko-san has decent animation, it is nowhere near KyoAni or PA Works.It is just worse than the competition.On the second hand it feels like the show endorses a lot of bad concepts. There is the implication of 'if you work hard and are overworked maybe you will get a dream wife somehow that makes all your problems disappear without you needing to do anything about your own life', which is clearly problematic and especially worrisome considering the Japanese work culture.There is also the whole legal loli theme that makes things awkward and plays into certain tastes and is nothing to endorse, at least in my opinion, and most of the show can also be seen as mindless pandering to those questionable tastes.In the end we have a show that excels at nothing.The story is non existent. The art, animation and sound are all between 5-7, but the area where the good Iyashikei are weeded out from the bad, the characters, is an utter disaster. The characters are forgettable and worst of all, show zero growth over the course of the show and stay the same for the entire run.Oh, and I didn't even mention the weird ego perspective parts that are usually situated after the ED with Senko directly talking to the viewers to give the sense that the viewer is the one having Senko caring for...I can take some pandering here and there, some obnoxious lolis, or some characters that are less than deep, but this show has all of it and no redeeming qualities.Overall I still give the show an average rating of 5, because the animation and sound is sometimes good and there is no fault in appreciating the work put into those parts, even if it is overall nothing special, but make no mistake this only leads to a very slim 5 that is probably more in the 4.6 area rounded up.There might be people that need exactly what the show gives you (a legal loli that tells you that everything will be okay), but for everyone else, just stay away, you won't miss anything. mention) drops into his life and starts pampering him to take away his stress that is so bad it manifests as a black aura around him and starts to threaten to infect other people around him (allegedly, we never see that happen).That is all you need to know, because that is all that happens.

Theres better comedies. theres better harems. theres better slice of lifes. i cant shake the feeling this is geared towards a certain demographic, I mean someone drew her this way in a bathtub with a full grown adult man for a reason right?', 'The premise is as straightforward as this sort of thing can be. Kuroto Nakano is a single, depressed Japanese office worker perpetually stressed out by his job. Still, seeing as he lives alone, he has no choice but to struggle and push forward to sustain himself. According to the show\'s supernatural conceit, all of that stress, sleep deprivation, and depression inevitably takes the form of a darkness residing within the body, and once it surpasses containment level, it manifests itself externally as a sort of black smog, which not only negatively affects the people around one\'s self, but will also bring one\'s life to ruin.Thankfully,...the demigod servants of the Shinto gods, fox deities, always keep a watchful eye over humans. They can physically see the darkness caused by anguish and suffering and it is their duty to help people and alleviate their burdens - to save them before it\'s too late. As such, Senko, an 800-year-old loli foxgirl volunteers to live with Kuroto and pamper him in every way imaginable so as to relieve the tension in his weary soul.Having aired in the spring of 2019, Senko-san is a Doga Kobo production. In terms of what they are known for, I hesitate to say they are known at all, period, but for what it\'s worth, they seem to generally specialize in cutesy loli shit. They\'re the studio being Umaru-chan, Yuru Yuri, and most notably Gabriel DropOut. While nothing stands out about Senko-san\'s production value, neither in terms of audio, nor in terms of video, it does its best to feel as warm and welcoming as possible. By and large, it succeeds.In principle, Senko-san is simply meant as a wish-fulfillment show for single, older, working (mostly) men who have a hard time coping and finding a reason to keep going. It satiates a deep-seated need by providing a Tinkerbell-type substitute for a housewife in the form of an adorable foxgirl with an outlandishly fluffy tail. For the most part, that\'s exactly what it is.Now that\'s all fine and dandy. Alas, if you\'ve seen the poster or a trailer, you already fucking know what my problem with the show is. Alarm bells might have been ringing in your head ever since I mentioned the term ""loli"". You might be thinking: ""Hold up, hold the fucking phone. What are you telling me here? Setting aside the supernatural trappings about 800 years and tails and what not, you\'re essentially saying this is a story about a 12-year-old-looking little girl moving in to live with a grown ass single man and having all sorts of physical contact with him?"" Well... yes. That\'s exactly what it is. I mean, one can imagine a world in which this show wouldn\'t really be that offensive, a version of this show in which she only cooks and cleans for him, say, and otherwise just entertains him with conversation. That still wouldn\'t address some of the fundamental ethical concerns, but it would be a damn sight better.Unfortunately, we do not live in that universe and we don\'t have that version of the show. No, we have the actual show where she has him lay his head on her lap to clean his ears, lays in the bed next to him to spoon him and help him fall asleep, changes clothing in his line of sight (though he has the decency to look away in horror - har har), they give each other massages, and they even end up bathing together, they wash each other\'s backs and everything.Whenever they do have physical contact, be it her washing his back or giving him a massage, or when doing either of those to her in turn, his constant emphasis on how small her back and hands are really doesn\'t help.Yeah, no, it\'s just as fucked up and indefensible as you think it is. Thing is, if this were real life and a fox deity that looked like a child, but was really supernatural and 800 years old and all that jazz showed up on your doorstep, yeah, fine, whatever. Let her take care of you. It is what it is. That said, this isn\'t real life. It\'s fiction. That means that as this universe\'s omnipotent god, Rimukoro, the manga\'s (yes, this is a manga adaptation - I was surprised, too) author made a conscious choice to make her be a 12-year-old girl. ""Uhm, ackshually, she\'s 800 years ol-""; Shut up! What sane grown ass man would make the conscious choice to have their housewife substitute be a small 12-year-old girl? Why? Rimukoro had the option to make her anything he wanted. Why, then, did she turn out to be a 12-year-old girl? Be honest here, as a guy, if you had the option to be personally and closely pampered by a small, frail child versus a grown, voluptuous woman, which would you choose? Hell, I\'m not even suggesting that she would have to have an anime bimbo physique. Make her flat-chested for all I care. Make her be Sakura from Naruto Shippuuden. I give two fucks. But why the fuck a child? Why the fuck not an adult?Why is this a story about a grown ass man having inappropriate physical contact with a child? Why is this a story about a child who is not that grown ass man\'s daughter getting naked and changing in the same room as him? Why is anime so fucking full of this cancer? Doga Kobo\'s other production I\'m familiar with, Gabriel DropOut, had the same problem. Despite being an infinitely better and hilarious show, it still insisted on sexualizing its main cast of 4 extremely young girls by dressing them up in all manner of suggestive clothing that you can\'t have me pretend isn\'t exactly what it is.As if to make my point, the one thing that Kuroto really finds fascinating and attractive about Senko is her fluffy tail and ears. Well, judging by the way she reacts when he touches and fondles them, they are, to put it as bluntly as I can, such an obviously a paper-thin metaphor for genitalia, that not even the innocent mind of a child could miss that something illicit is going on. Particularly, when he fondles her ears and accidentally slips his fingers inside them and she gets mad, like, bro... could you possibly be any more transparent with your anal sex metaphor? Yeah, dude, we weren\'t born yesterday. We\'ve all heard ""wrong hole"" jokes before. This isn\'t some obscure symbolism whose secrets have yet to be divined.For what it\'s worth, if you manage to look past the degenerate aspects, Senko-san is a genuinely pleasant, and at times, really funny slice-of-life show. Nothing much happens, but then again, nothing needs to happen. The whole point of the anime is taking it easy and relaxing. Alas, I wouldn\'t call this a binge-worthy show. The novelty of the R&R wears off after a couple of episodes and the rest becomes a bit of a slog to get through.Besides, every single episode ends on a short PoV segment where Kuroto disappears as a character and the idea is that you get to see what it\'s like to be him, to have Senko take care of you and talk to you. She speaks directly into the camera and reacts to silent answers the viewer is presumably giving her, like in Dora the Explorer. The camera even shakes left-right or up-down to simulate you, the viewer, shaking or nodding your head in response to Senko\'s queries and prompts. Ugh, I fucking hate that sort of thing with a passion. No matter how funny or pleasant each episode was, those segments always left a sour taste in my mouth at the end.The one technical aspect of the show I feel compelled to note is that the protagonist is voiced by my favorite voice actor of all time, Junichi Suwabe. He is the voice of Grimmjow from Bleach, Greed from the original Fullmetal Alchemist, Daiki Aomine from Kuroko no Basket, Takashi Komuro from High School of the Dead, Emiya Archer from Fate, Siegfriend also from Fate, Eraserhead from My Hero Academia, etc. I won\'t pretend not to be disappointed to see him play a central role in a show like... this, but what can I say, Suwabe goodness is still Suwabe goodness. Alas, Kuroto admittedly doesn\'t have the aggressive quality of characters like Grimmjow or Aomine that Suwabe brings to life so well, so all in all, this is in no way an outstanding performance. the demigod servants of the Shinto gods, fox deities, always keep a watchful eye over humans.

The storyline is senko, a fox demi-god, comes to help a workaholic called nakano and you see scenes of how she handles life in nakano's home whilst he is at work.This storyline may be called standard because it's slice of life and this genre doesn't have major plot twists most of the time.

I also have many times of stress, uncontrollable anger, it is the gentleness and receptivity of the film that makes me happy a lot.I would like to suggest that the author should change the setting, situation, plot, add more characters. I have been following the manga and I am satisfied with the following seasons.I'm really a picky person. This is the first series I feel like, hope this review helps.Senko-san may overindulge...him and piss you off, but he's the portal to doom if he gets too stressed out =)))) him and piss you off, but he's the portal to doom if he gets too stressed out =))))"", ""Look it's not an anime that's gonna blow your mind. It doesn't have amazing character development or a story that really hooks you in. However it is something that's easy to watch and a good anime if you just wanna relax.

The anime is 12 episodes long, which consists of the combination of the slice of life, comedy, supernatural, and a little bit of romance, I think (I doubt about this anime’s romance genre, though). The story’s concept is the deity fox can see the darkness surrounding humans and try to help and save them before too late. The story itself is entertaining and engaging. The arts are well-animated, and the music, opening song, and ending song are catchy.It revolves about the Senko and Nakano. Senko is the golden-color deity fox who help...Nakano to help relieve stress because of the overwork. She helps Nakano a lot of things, such as housing, cleaning, cooking, and even… (watch it yourself). It has a cute opening in the introduction and a solid conclusion in the ending. Not only the main characters are well-development, but the side characters are good introduction and development, too.Even though this anime is pretty good, of course, this anime isn’t for all people. I strongly advise people who hate the slice of life or maybe cliché story and supernatural to avoid this anime no matter what. If you hate to see a loli character (this one is 800 hundred years old, so it’s legal anyway), better get out and watch another anime or movie. Overall for myself, I really enjoy it, and I can replay one scene several times. The comedy is amusing, and also the story is very heartwarming. It even is in my favorite list. It’s worthy to re-watch in the future. In the end, if you love heartwarming and the slice of life story, you mostly will love this.Long ReviewAfter complete watching Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san, I will give my review and opinion.Story and Plot (9/10)The story is about a slice of life, which means daily life. I think the story is inspired by overworking in Japan. You may search for the information or literature about overworking or reality in there if you want to know comprehensively. In my opinion, this issue isn’t only in Japan, but also in most countries in the world. The story starts about the Nakano is overworking in the company. Every day he looks exhausted and eats instant foods. Then, one day, Senko, the golden-color deity fox, come to his place and cooking food to him. She tries to pampering him to relieve his stress about work, and thus the story begins.Though the story’s concept is a little dark, it delivers to the audience is really well. You won’t be confused about the story because it is easy to follow. The anime is full of comedic and heartwarming time. I really like how the interaction between Senko, Nakano, and others who support the story. Their interaction is written really well and even well-development. It has good consistency in the development and story. There are no sexualized, even though the description says something like a special service as long as I watch. It is really full of heartwarming moments, so you don’t have anything to worry about. I feel the comedic is pretty well, and I even replay it several times. It even makes me remember how good childhood is. Overall, I really enjoy it, and I may re-watch in the future.Art and Animation (9/10)The art and animation are well-drawn and pictured. It has excellent art both as a whole and in detail. They draw the character is so lovely and charming, especially Senko. The background is beautiful and really emphasis the atmosphere and mood about the story. The change from one scene to another scene is really fluent and smooth. You can see how beautiful the sunset, beach, and snow at specific episodes. The opening art is really well done, and the ending of the art is really heartwarming. Personally, I love pout-face and angry-face Senko. Anyway, you mostly won’t complain about the art.Sound and Music (10+/10)OST is pleasant to hear. Both the opening and ending are catchy, and the lyrics describe the story’s general really well. Combination with opening and ending, and it will be perfect. Voice Actor’s voice is excellent to tell us about the mood and situation of the story.Character (9.5/10)It’s rare to watch anime with almost all characters is well-development. Every character is well written. Every character has their own story, such as why Senko helps Nakano, why Nakano still works in that company. Furthermore, The interaction between the characters is really engaging, interesting, and funny. Not only the main characters’ interaction but also with support characters’, too.Enjoyment and Conclusion (10+/10)I am lucky to find this anime. The mix of the slice of life, comedy, and supernatural are magnificent. It’s pretty rare to see fox human in anime, so I really like it. Moreover, It’s a pure comedy, and I really like it. Besides, it has a good message for all of us, too. For me, it is to enjoy more about our life and give more time to our family. You can watch it yourself to see what message you can get. In the end, this anime is really enjoyable, and I really love it. I wish I can have the helpful fox-like Senko.Overall (10+/10)I take note of my score (1-12) from all episodes (12) and OP/ED.Episodes - Score(1)   - 10, 10, 9.75(4)   - 10, 9.75, 10(7)   - 9.75, 10 9.5(10) - 10.5, 8.75, 9.5Total Raw Score: 116.75Main Anime Score: 117.5 / 12 x 10 x 90% = 88.11Opening & Ending Score: 110 x 10% = 11Total score is 99.19 that means overall score is 10.It is one of my favorite anime, really worth for re-watch.I hope my review will help you!!!

It kept progressing and when it reached episode 7 or 8 (don\'t remember) where Sora came into the deal and kept saying about Senko\'s departure.

However, what's truly impressive about The Helpful Fox Senko-san is its ability to turn a very basic premise into something worth binge-watching for 12 episodes straight. I have to admit, initially it was difficult to imagine how an anime about a cute demifox pampering a depressed salaryman as something to be invested in and best case scenario, this would simply be a Moe slideshows through and through. However, the good people at Doga Kobo were more than...ready to conquer that challenge-- by slapping in incredible music score, background art close to Makoto Shinkai-level, and a very nuanced approach on how the most valuable things in life are actually the smaller ones. Anxiety and depression are always relatable themes but as opposed to over-analyzing them, Senko-san knows all too well to focus on the solution: unconditional comfort both for her new master and her audience outside the glass screen in front of us.For otaku out there, I sincerely hope you reach Cloud #9 with your Senko-san figures but please remember the most important thing about The Helpful Fox Senko-san: that a good Moe anime is actually very, very hard to find.#felixlovesanime ready to conquer that challenge-- by slapping in incredible music score, background art close to Makoto Shinkai-level, and a very nuanced approach on how the most valuable things in life are actually the smaller ones.

Senko-san: that a good Moe anime is actually very, very hard to find.#felixlovesanime"", 'You know, even though I\'ve read the manga, it wasn\'t until I watched the anime that I realized the depressing undertones this series actually has.\xa0 Oh well, cute fox mom/wife ahoy nanoja and all that.Story:The kitsune are a divine order of demigod spirits that serve to help humanity during hard times.\xa0 On one particular case involving an overworked salaryman by the name of Kuroto Nakano, the spirited Senko nominates herself as to be his caretaker to help wipe away the stress and negative emotions that plague this lonely man\'s life.With each episode based around roughly two episodes of the manga, Senko-san is a series built...around the general schtick of seeing Nakano go about his daily life being pampered by and taken care of by this eight hundred year old fox through various means after work.\xa0 Episodes consist of the characters having a nice home-cooked meal or spending some time off either at home or somewhere outside, almost always wrapped around a story set in the slice of life genre with fluffing Senko\'s tail typically being the show\'s running gag as the allure of a cute foxgirl\'s tail is too much for one man to handle.Because of this, Senko-san doesn\'t really stray too far in its storytelling and is one of those series\'s that\'s good for a nice bit of unwinding, as there\'s hardly any episode drama and the pleasant ease of its overwhelming slice of life elements is the kind of comfort and tone the show sets out and exceeds in.\xa0 Pacing\'s pretty casual as a result and I think it\'s definitely worth watching for the more casual audience.\xa0 The one \'anime-only\' detail I find uncomfortable happens after the credits and actually gives the show a dark undertone especially in relation to Japanese culture.After the credits roll and just before the next episode preview, the show takes a few minutes in a first person POV perspective where Senko welcomes the viewer home, treats them to dinner, all while pausing briefly every so often as if she\'s waiting for a response with appropriate screen shakes for \'yes\' and \'no\'.\xa0 It\'s intended to put the viewer in the shoes of Nakano and be pampered by Senko which, given the current status of Japanese salary workers and the declining birth rates due to various factors, paints a really grim picture on who this series, especially these scenes, are intended for.\xa0 I am not a fan of this and I honestly think it spoils the show\'s good points with what I believe to be a cultural dysfunction in the home country.\xa0 But that\'s just my take of the matter.Characters:The titular Senko is an eight hundred year old Kitsune who enjoys being the homemaker, enjoying all manners of chores such as cooking and cleaning.\xa0 In essence, the perfect housewife in a small foxgirl package with the tic of \'Nanoja\' tacked on to every sentence she says.\xa0 Due to the content of the series, there\'s not really a lot of depth to Senko or the rest of the cast for that matter, so she pretty much stays static throughout.\xa0 The only real complexity has to deal with some backstory that Senko has in regards to Nakano\'s family line, a footnote that\'s only rarely taken into consideration, which I find to be a shame because it\'s clear the backstory has a lot more than meets the eye.\xa0 Nonetheless, I still find her to be enjoyable because she is ultimately what gives the series its casual and warm tone and atmosphere.Kuroto Nakano conversely serves as the target of Senko\'s pampering, spending a majority of the series undergoing a massive character change in atmosphere on account of his constant reactions towards Senko\'s aggressively warm and homely actions, rivaled only by his love for soft and warm fox tails.\xa0 He\'s kind of the series\'s version of a payoff since his happiness and head clarity are the reason why Senko is taking care of him in the first place.\xa0 His depth is even less than what Senko has, only having maybe one scene in regards to the time they met before in the past.\xa0 But for a slice of life series, that\'s not really a major concern though I wish there was more detail put into that.The rest of the cast is filled by Shiro and Sora, Senko\'s friend and boss respectively, and Kouenji, a mangaka who\'s also Nakano\'s neighbor.\xa0 This frighteningly small cast largely fills up the second half of the series where the show focuses more on social activities with others rather than just ones in the home, and they all pretty much stay static throughout the series\'s runtime.\xa0 Shiro is the haughty and confident kitsune with a love for Senko\'s cooking and Kouenji\'s a mangaka who runs on fumes, deadlines, and an anime about a magical girl kitsune named Yoko.\xa0 The only unfortunate cast member is Sora who gets hardly any screentime (even in the manga) despite being the supposed boss of Senko and such.\xa0 I just wish there was more of her because the teasingly seductive nature in kitsune lore is really only touched on by her and it\'s clear her age has brought about wisdom not known by many of her contemporaries.Aesthetics:Doga Kobo pretty much only knows how to do one thing and that\'s \'cute\'.\xa0 Senko-san is pretty standard by the company\'s usual standards and modern anime, so there\'s not much to note beyond the bright colors and the cute designs similar to that of the original manga.\xa0 There isn\'t much animation since hardly anything heavy drawing-wise happens over the course of the series, and in place of that, we get consistency and few animation errors as far as I can see.\xa0 It\'s cute, it\'s charming, not really much else to say honestly.Because the series makes such a massive effort to run the gag of fluffing the tails of adorable foxgirls, both the OP and ED are conveniently named ""Koyoi mofumofu!!"" and ""Moffumoffu DE Yoi no Ja yo"" in order to continue that theming.\xa0 Both are sung by Senko\'s VA with Shiro\'s acting as a backup for OP and honestly I don\'t find a lot to note about them beyond: catchy.\xa0 They\'re both really cute songs all about fluffing, and that\'s pretty much all they are.\xa0 Catchy lyrics, cheerful melodies, fits the show, fits the overall tone, but that\'s about all I can really say.Personal Enjoyment:I\'m pretty sure there was a weird switch in my head that flipped the moment I heard that this series was getting an adaptation.\xa0 I\'ve been a fan of this series since the series\'s infancy for the manga, and I was extremely happy and surprised to see this series get an anime adaptation as soon as it did.\xa0 So really I don\'t have many complaints about the series because I still enjoyed the content adapted from the manga to its fullest now that it was in animated form.Aside from the uncomfortable aftercredits scenes involving the viewer in the shoes of Nakano, I honestly expected Senko\'s VA to be a bit scratchier or \'older\' in my head since she\'s commonly referred to be more like an old woman instead of a cute, modern housewife.\xa0 It\'s a weird thing to complain about I know, but it\'s how I always imagined her talking in my head, so having her sound like a cute younger girl in animation threw me for a loop.\xa0 They still manage to execute the \'old woman\' joke a few times with some success, but part of me is a bit disappointed with the casting in the end even if it doesn\'t really ruin the experience all that much.\xa0 There\'s also the lack of Sora and the kind of sadistic antics she gets up to behind the scenes in contrast to the show\'s usually happy exterior, but that\'s more of a criticism for the series as a whole rather than just the anime.As for recommendations, I think Senko-san is a good series if you\'re looking for something to relax to.\xa0 It\'s not something that\'s outlandish or does anything innovative beyond \'cute fox mom/wife\' (which is her actual self-proclaimed role in the show), but it does give this pleasant homely feel that a lot of slice of life beyond a few rare shows like Sweetness and Lightning don\'t really do.\xa0 So if you want something to unwind to, I highly suggest this one.\xa0 Just my suggestion though, cut off the episode the moment the credits start rolling.\xa0 You really don\'t want to see what comes after that. around the general schtick of seeing Nakano go about his daily life being pampered by and taken care of by this eight hundred year old fox through various means after work.\xa0 Episodes consist

actually enjoyed the super-relaxed, cutesy SoL content it offered quite a lot: Senko, the 800 years old fox spirit with a history of watching over family of the protagonist, Nakano, comes to the human world to give him respite in his lonely life of an abused salaryman. Being quite out-of-touch with the modern world, she still tries to help him find balance in his life, which also leads to other characters, such as another fox spirit, Shiro and Nakano\'s quirky college student/mangaka neighbour, Koenji, entering the scene....All of it is quite cute and amusing, at least from my point of view.While I\'ve seen people expressing discomfort about the romantic undertones with the loli heroine (those are really quite vague) and the wish-fulfilment character of the whole scenario, I have a different issue with this show and it is connected with the message of its story. The protagonist\'s problems come mostly from one place - his horribly abusive workplace, which burns him out and destroys any chance of connecting with people, leaving him lonely and exhausted all the time. Senko\'s presence, while positive, is more or less a bandaid placed over a gushing wound and the protagonist does nothing to change his situation, accepting the exploitation in a truly Japanese manner, mostly blaming himself for not being able to bend reality to his asshole boss\' impossible requests.I enjoyed this series on a moment-to-moment basis, but I find especially the way it concluded straight-up disturbing and harmful. A good ending would find Nakano, for example, finding a better job, bonding with the neighbour (or other potential love interest) with an implied chance of romance - basically, putting him in a place where Senko\'s constant presence would no longer be necessary and she could maybe not leave permanently, but give up on her caretaker role. A situation where ""darkness in the protagonist\'s heart"" would truly have a chance of being healed. The way it plays out fixes nothing and embodies the worst parts of Japanese attitudes towards life - passive acceptance of whatever reality throws your way, rather than striving to improve your circumstances and fight for your dignity. The protagonist is not a loser by nature - the way his boss and coworkers rely on him shows clearly that he\'s a talented and dedicated individual. He is exploited because he chooses to tolerate it and the way the show legitimizes that is absolutely appaling. It doesn\'t kill the whole series for me... But it\'s an issue, and kind of disturbing in the grand scheme of things - hopefully, people both here and in Japan knows better than to just accept this series\' message, whether it was intentional or not, as legitimate.

Instead, I see a simple, yet brilliantly heart-warming slice of life anime.I suppose this requires an explanation:  In order to understand what makes this anime so appealing, you may need some degree of personal experience in what the male lead character is going through.  Kuroto Nakano lives as a single, overworked salaryman, which isn\'t that uncommon for young Japanese men.  If you\'ve ever worked a crappy job for long hours...and minimal benefits, you can probably relate to what he goes through every day.  For those of you who can\'t, imagine having to work a job that you don\'t particularly like for 70+ hours a week.  You don\'t feel like you can change jobs, you don\'t have any friends, you no longer have time for your old hobbies or even to stop and smell the flowers every once in a while.  Every day becomes a soul-corroding routine of waking up, getting ready for work, working until late at night, and coming home to nothing but a crappy microwave dinner and a bed.  Repeat every day for years on end.  If you\'re lucky, you will only end up like Mr. Nakano here at the beginning of the series.  In a life like that, even something as simple as a home-cooked meal is a godsend.Indeed, it is fitting that a messenger of the gods, the fox-girl Senko, arrives at Nakano\'s home to bring him the simple pleasures of a clean home, a warm bath, delicious home cooking, and the... fluffiness (only gentlemen of refined taste can truly appreciate the fluff)... to slowly relieve all of the stress that has been accumulating over the years and make life more enjoyable.  The main theme of the story isn\'t much more complicated than that, but I find it satisfying and endearing.Your own mileage may vary with this show.  The story is simple, the art, sound, and character development are distinctly adequate - nothing jaw dropping.

You can see it when she cooks, cleans, and just has a general conversation with the main character. I was very impressed by this. One example of another anime that did this was Spice and Wolf.

The tails are absolutely beautiful too, make sure to watch out for them.

The general sounds of characters and noises made by the girls are very cute.CHARACTER:The protagonist and Senko-san both develop nicely with more than meets the eye in terms of the history which is a nice twist. The reluctance of the main character slowly being worn down by our adorable fox girl is great to see. The other personalities of those around really makes for interesting developments.

How did it hold up overall? Well here\'s what I thought about thisStory: 5/10. There really isn\'t much to the story. It\'s basically ""Fox god visits a salary man and tries to pamper him."" To put it even simply, it\'s a wish fulfilling anime (the mangaka even admitted to it being a wish fulfillment series as within the first couple chapters of the manga he reflects on wanting to make this type of series cause he wished a loli fox goddess pampered him after a...rough day of work.) It\'s a comfy story but, again, there isn\'t much to go on story wise.Art: 7/10. The art style of the anime did a really good job of capturing the unique art style of the manga. Did a good job capturing the fluffyness of Senko\'s tail. Overall, the unique style from the manga was captured well in the anime.Sound: 7/10. The OP is pretty catchy while the ED is forgettable. I don\'t remember much of the background music honestly. Originally, I was surprised when I first heard Senko\'s voice in trailers because I imagined her to sound a bit...older as based off how she comes off in the manga but her overall voice was good. I enjoyed Shiro\'s childlike, arrogant sounding voice. The other characters were fine as well.Character: 6/10. The only character worth note is Kuroto Nakano, the salary man who\'s enjoyment from being pampered was the highlight of the series. The other characters (espeically the foxes) are just one dimensional versions of the dragons in Ms Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid. The reason I bring that up is one of the anime people compare Senko-san to is Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid as they both involve salaryman characters meeting supernatural characters (fox gods vs powerful dragons.) The difference between the two is that while the dragons in Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid have depth, the foxes are one dimensional characters. Senko pampers Nakano and Shiro acts like an arrogant child, that\'s all their characters are. Yasuko is forgettable and Sora (the head fox god) just has big boobs....yeah that\'s all they kinda focus on with her.Enjoyment: 6/10. Would\'ve been a 7 but the last two episodes I just did not really enjoy and was really waiting for it end. Basically its your average ""add drama for the sake of drama"" endings which, for the most part, I do not enjoy. Just because the anime is a comfy, turn your brain off and relax show, doesn\'t mean it\'s not enjoyable. Unfortunately the last two episodes soured me on the anime. Super Senko TIme at the end of each episode (one episode had Shiro and one had Sora) where Senko ""pampers"" the viewer was pretty enjoyable and probably one of the most enjoyable thing from the show overall.Overall: 6/10. This anime is basically Ms Kobayashi\'s Dragon Maid without any depth. That doesn\'t mean its bad but don\'t expect to be amazed or anything. This show, however, is worth watching.

It’s an anime that doesn’t really delve deeper into its world other than the few characters who may be adorable or obnoxious. Comedy is present; however, romance isn’t frequent in the anime, just wholesomeness in the relationship between characters.The story is focused on the daily lives of these characters where Nakano is always stressed and tired from work and Senko always pampers him after work. Senko may be a demi-god who is good in relieving Nakano, but she is not knowledgeable in the ways of technology. Shiro is also a fox...demi-god, but anyone would think she is obnoxious. However, they are still adorable and satisfying to watch. Kouenji is a young working student who is a hermit. She lives next-door to Nakano’s and later joins the cast who is oblivious to the identities of these foxes. These are probably the only main characters to remember in the story while there are a few more who didn’t really have much screentime as they do.Overall, it is fun to watch them hangout. A short entertainment that is focused on wholesomeness. Animation is not a problem, and the sounds are not dissatisfying especially for those who appreciate anime openings and ending songs. Enjoyment varies whether the calming story or the entertaining actions of characters would appeal to you or not. Honestly, I like the anime because I enjoyed watching the characters live together along with the humor that accompanies it.I would still recommend it only for a short light-story to add in your watchlist, however, it is also a waste of time if you find this kind of story boring, especially if that’s what you think in the first few episodes. demi-god, but anyone would think she is obnoxious.

Its main appeal is the cute/wholesome aspect and I think it does a fine job with that. I still think its just kind of average though. The designs and artstyle is cute, kudos to them for getting that right. But the overall plot and individual episode content is a bit lacking in some areas. Sometimes it can be kind of boring, with nothing of note really going on. Not that I want Senko slinging AK\'s over her shoulder and shooting up police stations (although that would...be interesting), I just want... more.Senko-san achieves its goal and purpose of being a sit down and relax kind of show, but I think it could have been better. A great example is Nichijou, which is one of my favorite ""feel-good"" kind of shows. It does everything Senko-san hopes to achieve, of just making the viewer feel happy and relaxed, but better. It has even less of a plot, which I think is good for this kind of show, it lets you turn off your brain a bit more and just relax.

When held by that standard, it fulfills its purpose well. However, it\'s standard outside of this niche.Story:The story has little to no drive. The episodes are nearly always self-contained with conflict of little stake. The show offers little to no incentive to tune in to the next episode because there is no overarching conflict. However, this doesn\'t necessarily make the show objectively unenjoyable. The target demographic of the show is likely to be people looking for something laid back such as this. The predictable storylines for...each episode suits the comfy story it\'s trying to tell. It would be fine to pick up the show in the middle of the season or drop it after a few episodes.Art:The art style compliments the atmosphere of the show. The characters\' style, their faces specifically, contributes to a playful mood. The show favors a bright, warm, and pastoral color palette that compliments the characters\' designs. The food looks particularly alluring, and the impactful scenes are well drawn. The specific reason why this category is rated so high is because of the attention to detail to Nakano, the male lead, left an impression on me throughout the show. Nakano\'s eyes are always bland and devoid of life, unlike the casts\'. I\'m unsure if this is intentional, but the detail of Nakano\'s eyes adds a layer of submersion.Sound:Not much is to be said about the sound of the show. The OST is fairly standard, without negatives nor positives. The OP and ED reinforces the tone of the show, and they\'re both quite catchy.Character:The characters, specifically Senko, are what holds the show together. It\'s apparent from the after credit scenes that Nakano is meant to be our self insert, which is fine given the show\'s nature. Although the cast is static in the way neither of them undergo any significant development, this slice of life is meant to highlight the interactions between them. The wholesome cast is the main appeal.Enjoyment:Although this show fulfills its role well, it relies too much on its characters. While I enjoyed watching it in the moment, the mediocrity of its other elements made it a forgettable show.Overall:""Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san"" is not meant for everyone. A perfectly valid criticism of it is that it has no depth and meaning behind the plot, and it doesn\'t.

However the show isnt without its flaws.First of all the show and the MC time and time again dances between the thin ice of being adorable and being creepy while needing to remind you every episode for some reason that Senko is 800 years old. Like the MCs obsession with Senkos tail.Another problem the show has is that there is a plot that elaborates little and leaves quite a lot to imagination, the plot mainly consists of the...MC going to work, being sad because of it and Senko cheering him up/ pampering him. That's it, that's what most of your episodes in Senko consist of. We also get next to nothing in terms of character development. We get characters that are introduced but not much is explained about them let alone their backgrounds.Overall while I did enjoy this show and I want to be clear that I in no way dislike it either. Its flaws overall dont make it good enough to me to make it into my all time favorites list and it felt like another flavor of the season anime.

The later episodes get more into why exactly Senko is so devoted to pampering Nakno which stems from some actual trauma on her part.

Senko-san is that a show for me.  A simple show about and overworked, unpaid white collar working in modern Japan who hate his life so much that he literally has a dark cloud above his head. This attracts the attention of Senko, who knows his ancestor to come into his life and brighten...it up in hopes of making him happier. Now I find that these slice f life kind of shows can\'t be judged with the same lens that you would judge any other show because when you do they fall apart. they don\'t really have any plot or specific story that they follow. they don\'t seem very interesting and come off as very boring. But these kinds of shows have a different kind of enjoy ability, relating to the characters and feeling at home in their world. Senko-san has this kind of world where you can relate to its main character and feel yourself in his shoes, I know I did, going through similar things in life and maybe finding someone of your own that can pull you out of your literal, in this case, darkness.This show is not very deep, the figurative ""dark cloud"" is about as deep as it goes, don\'t expect an Evangelion level of writing here, After all not all stories need this and in the case of this show its works. The very shallow stories supports the simplicity of the point, that overworking and loathing are horrible for everyone and can literally affect people around you, whether through how you act or treat people or as the show does it, a dark cloud corrupting everyone around the main character.I find this show fascinating because I feel that is says a lot about Japan as a whole. Much anime, at least the well written shows, I find have a large connection to japan a a whole, they have such a unique culture with unique problems, its one of the things that drew me to anime it it comes out in interesting ways in some shows. Senko-san is one of these shows, on a shallow level I will admit, but in a simple way that I could relate to easily. Theire are shows like Evangelion and Shin Sekai Yori that you have to contemplate for a week to understand, not necessarily a bad thing but in my opinion it takes away from the point of a story when I have to look up a video on what the faq the ending of Evangelion meant. And I know I\'m not the first judging by the millions of views the video has. Now this could be due to my very limited experience with the bible and related books, of which Evangelion takes HEAVY inspiration from but the point I am trying to make is that a simple theme that dosen\'t require me to read three books can go a long way in a story, and it works here, for me at least.to wrap up this some what disconnected review, I like this show because it has a simple premise ad relatable characters, it doesn\'t need to be any more than that and I feel that some people tend to miss the point in these shows and misconstrue them, and I feel this how is one of those cases for many people. it up in hopes of making him happier.

The show is incredibly laid back, and super easy to binge, our main idea here is that the helpful fox god Senko is doing nice things for Nakano to relieve his stress, she does whips out the fried tofu, uses tail tactics and is generally pleasant to be around.Not that I have any issue with the show though it may sound like it soon. Nothing really happens, each episode is a continuation from the last but they could, for the most part,...be watched out of order and still make just as much sense, though that's fine since the show isn't about pushing groundbreaking stories or developing our characters (Some happens but not enough to mention it as a key point) since they are already fantastic characters who just need or want to chill.This show is so sweet and really worth the time investment, The characters both main and side are enjoyable, you won't fall off your chair laughing but you will crack a smile.

I really like the small scenes at the end of the epsiodes, it was greatGood anime to spend time', 'Iyashikei - a sub-genre of anime, attributed to slice-of-life, that is meant to facilitate a soothing and healing environment for the viewer. Senko-san and Nakano capture this perfectly through their bond. The intro is somewhat nebulous, but everything makes sense by the end of the first episode. By the time you start the second episode, it feels like the show has strongly established its meaning to you as the viewer.While being driven by its lax slice-of-life nature, the story is nothing to be overlooked. More importantly, the moral of the story is clear - what a difference somebody can make in the life of another,...even for things we normally take for granted. After the pandemic that shut the world down, it hit really close to home. When feeling like a burden to somebody who cares for you, does one ever stop to consider that perhaps that person needs those for whom they care for, just as much as the one they care for needs them? The purity of love, in a way not often displayed in actual ""romance"" genre. Because, well, there isn\'t really a romantic element - this is the type of way you love family.What does it mean to love somebody with all of your heart? That\'s a subjective question, but Senko shows her love in a way that is very on the nose. Through both words and action, this 800 year old fox deity grips the heart with a tremendous amount of wholesome, honey-sweet compassion that will make even the strongest man or woman cry hot, salty tears of happiness and pent up stress. Verily, the wholesome nature feels oddly human, for a series revolving around a demi-god and her amazing power to heal.The characters are written to imperfect perfection. Sweet, selfless Senko is still capable of anger and over/underconfidence at times, and is open about not being anything remotely perfect at age 800. Nakano and Koenji are great representations of the target audience. Overwhelmed, emotionally and mentally exhausted. Seeing character flaws addressed without too much vague deliberation, brings a refreshing new light to a category that most don\'t expect any character progression. Somehow in 12 episodes, we see an entirely new Nakano and even a more refined Senko that is discovering the meaning of her own emotions.The screen time is used well for each character, and you get enough time to be satisfied with their interaction, yet not enough to draw attention away from the main point. Their are very few main characters, which makes this show very easy to follow and reminiscent of how few actually stand out to us as the main cast of our own lives. This writing seems very much intentional. That includes Nakano\'s ultra-dependent coworker who cannot live without Nakano to save his grass every time he lights his own fire. Nakano\'s coworker is the only truly despicable character in an otherwise blissful warm blanket of comfort. A perfect foil to Senko, really. Yet, he is made so insignificant compared to Senko, and that really stands out as one of the strengths this story drives home. On top of all of that, the voice acting (Dub) is excellent and really set a mood. It feels as if the actors mean what they\'re saying, in character and out of character. Makes this feel so much more impactful. Great localization, everything felt so natural.That leads to the few flaws that really stand out with this series. Most of the ""flaws"" are what make this story such a strong contender - they\'re more or less hints at the viewer on how to find grace in a chaotic life. In a way that serenity and joy are rarely shown on screen, Senko-san earns a 10/10 for going above and beyond to provide a soothing, healing motif. Even the end splash ""Super Senko time"" is worth watching every time. The biggest flaw so far is that it is 2023 and we NEED a second season after what the world has been through.

What it does with this isn't special in any way, but the stories themselves are fairly special in their own regard, as they each take an essential part of how life was back when it was easy, and shows us to never forget the feelings and memories you have of those times. I know...for a fact that none of us have a demigod fox spirit at our house who's able to relieve stress for us, so the story uses this to its advantage by evoking memories in the audience that leads to a much higher rate that the audience will connect with our main character, Nakano. Since the story itself follows an episodal format, I can't say much for the overall big picture story, but the small snipets of life that we see across a year do bring a lot to the table. Each episode may have a premise where Nakano returns to his apartment stressed due to work, but each episode has its own special thing that Senko does for him. This may vary from cooking, to getting a haircut, to a backwash, etc. These all serve as great reminders to never forget your time as a child, as it'll all go away once you're out there by yourself.Art: The art in Senko-san is fairly unique to me, since the character designs are more geometric in nature while sporting a nice pastel palette. Each character also has a unique design choice (aside from tails), and this really gives each character a distinct personality. This in itself works with the story as while you get to reminisce about the past, you get to relax by seeing art that isn't harsh or action packed. There's plenty to love, especially with such amazing stills such as smug Senko, and the ending song animation featuring simplistic Senko. With animation, I'd say that it's what you'd expect, however.Sound: The OST in Senko-san is really playful and relaxing, which really accommodates each episode well. It's simple, but effective, and works in its own regard. Voice acting is also done well, with Nakano being done really well. Every time you see the darkness return to him, you can hear the stress in his voice and the sense of defeat. This is obviously contrasted really well with how he feels after being able to fluff Senko's tail.Character: This show really draws attention towards the characters with the situations it gives. While the characters are by no means complex, they have enough development that you can really tell how they would act in certain situations. However, if you don't really fit into the niche of these characters, it may be harder to relate to them on a personal level. I feel that if the show spent some time developing characters, it would have been more beneficial towards giving characters more life.Enjoyment: Senko-san was a treat to watch, and although overly sweet, was a great show to relax to. While I personally don't relate intensely to one character, each one in their own way had a certain appeal that made watching them enjoyable. Coupled with the episodal premises and the soft pastel colors for the art, Senko-san was really enjoyable.Overall: Extra fluffy. for a fact that none of us have a demigod fox spirit at our house who's able to relieve stress for us, so the story uses this to its advantage by evoking memories in the audience that leads to a much higher rate that the audience will connect with our main character, Nakano.

A treat for myself for the hard work that I've been putting in working 50-64 hour work weeks, at work 6 out of 7 days of the week.In short, I needed this.Sewyaki Kitsune no Senko-san is an iyashikei style slice of life anime that follows the non-adventures of worn down (same), overworked (same), and consistently stressed out (same) salaryman Nakano after an 800 year old loli fox girl demigod named Senko enters his...life and starts pampering him to his heart's content. The story is loosely connected throughout the series as you learn more about the characters and their connection.Doga Kobo has been consistently delivering moe art for a while now, and while the character designs, Doga Kobo's typical light color palette, and neatly drawn backgrounds and environments all lend themselves very well to the iyashikei style, I found the animation to be fairly weak when compared to some of their other works.The sound design is just fine for the series, playful cheery music when needed, VAs performing well, and audio cues for the subtle tone shifts are all fairly well done.The characters are pretty one dimensional, and the attempts at giving them depth are hit or miss. You can pretty much figure out how everything will play out by the end of the first or second episode. Nakano is extremely relatable from the perspective of a worn out employee. Senko is endearing and almost seems to be written as waifu bait. I thought the additions of Shiro and the neighbor Jouska were interesting although their interactions with the main characters could have been explored far more.Overall, I really enjoyed watching this series. It took my mind off the fact that I would be waking up early, riding my bike which had it's brakepads stolen an hour to work on suburban roads, only to work a 10 hour day and take that hour ride in the opposite direction.

In my mind, anything 8 or higher must either have a well presented artistic message to state, or firmly sticks out in your mind.Don\'t get me wrong, the show accomplished exactly what it set out to do, which was to essentially create a ""If you had a fox spirit girlfriend simulator"". What the show does do, it does it relatively well, I enjoyed the show overall. But the show\'s shortcomings cripple it\'s ability to be anything more than fantasy escapism.The show has virtually no plot....Which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, but doesn\'t make it stand out. Yes, it\'s a slice of life show, which isn\'t supposed to have any sort of grand Odyssey for a story. But I\'ve seen slice of life shows be done far more eloquently - ""Ascendence of a Bookworm"" for instance.I liked all the characters, though the main character is essentially a placeholder for the viewer.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:Well actually, due to a lack of plot, you could consider this minor, or major spoilers, as it essentially involves the entirety of ""the plot"".This issue I know wasn\'t intentional, as they needed some sort of plot to allow progression and some form of struggle, but in my experience it kind of hindered my ability to enjoy the show.The entire show, they drop hints that Senko being there is only temporary. This is a major issue, as the show tries to get you attached to her. So the entire time I\'m watching, I\'m wanting to get invested, but with the threat of all that being demolished by the end made me constantly wary of Senko. To top it off, the show (and not the character\'s actions) also makes you question Senko\'s motives.I wanted him, or her, to say the words ""I love you"" the entire way through. Not because I was on the edge of my seat, as if it were some extravagant love tragedy. But because I needed some sort of definitive clarification of where they stand, so I can say: ""OK it\'s safe to get invested in these characters"". I didn\'t get any sort of definitive statement until the very end when he said ""Let\'s stick together"". That\'s it. Had I gotten that statement sooner, I would have enjoyed the show far more.So what are my final thoughts?It\'s a fun, warm, charming little show, just don\'t expect the well to run deep. I honestly hope this show gets a second chance with a season 2, because despite people\'s complaints about some of the characters being one-dimensional, I actually see a huge reservoir of untapped potential here. There are so many different directions they could take this, with both plot and character development. Maybe Kuroto could propose to Senko, and hijinks ensues when they tell the priest that she\'s a real fox spirit. Or maybe Kuroto finally finds a better job, and requires him and Senko to move across country, or maybe overseas. Maybe Senko meets Kurotos parents, or Kuroto Senko\'s parents (does she have parents?).Regardless - Like I said, there are many different directions they could choose to take it, and I really hope that if they get the the chance to evolve this show further - They take it. Which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, but doesn\'t make it stand out. Yes, it\'s a slice of life show, which isn\'t supposed to have any sort of grand Odyssey for a story. But I\'ve seen slice of life shows be done far more eloquently - ""Ascendence of a Bookworm"" for instance.I liked all the characters, though the main character is essentially a placeholder for the viewer.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:Well actually, due to a lack of plot, you could consider this minor, or major spoilers, as it essentially involves the entirety of ""the plot"".This issue I know wasn\'t intentional, as they needed some sort of plot to allow progression and some form of struggle, but in my experience it kind of hindered my ability to enjoy the show.The entire show, they drop hints that Senko being there is only temporary. This is a major issue, as the show tries to get you attached to her. So the entire time I\'m watching, I\'m wanting to get invested, but with the threat of all that being demolished by the end made me constantly wary of Senko. To top it off, the show (and not the character\'s actions) also makes you question Senko\'s motives.I wanted him, or her, to say the words ""I love you"" the entire way through. Not because I was on the edge of my seat, as if it were some extravagant love tragedy. But because I needed some sort of definitive clarification of where they stand, so I can say: ""OK it\'s safe to get invested in these characters"". I didn\'t get any sort of definitive statement until the very end when he said ""Let\'s stick together"". That\'s it.

While it's suppose to emphasise on the struggles of a stereotypical Japanese salary office worker, the story, premises and other day to day per episode situations all are heavily recycled, which makes the anime almost boring to watch.For the cuteness part, every episode is all about the male protagonist getting a hard on for the fox girl's tail. First few episodes it's ok, anything more then that it gets dreary.Artwork is horrible. it really exposes the cheap budgeted nature of the anime.There is zero character development literally. Almost every episode is all about guy coming back from work,...fox girl either cooks, washes or do some other form of grooming.Overall it's a forgettable anime with zero re-watch value. fox girl either cooks, washes or do some other form of grooming.Overall it's a forgettable anime with zero re-watch value."", ""To put it shortly, it's your typical moe SoL anime show, but with a slight twist.

I'd recommend it if you are looking for just a calm and nice show.The story didn't have that much depth, but tbh it really doesn't need it. It has a straight forward plot and is nothing complicated.The art and sound were done very well, and I don't have anything special to add.The characters are very well written. Yasuko added...that spice the show needed and made it good. Senko wasn't just a 1-dimensional maid but had her own motives to pamper Nakano.

And this it does - While I have heard some unflattering things about this anime, I can say - as someone who has had/has a very stressful job, working long hours, getting home alone - this anime always manages to lift my spirits.The story is only somewhat relevant, because the episodes are supposed to be pretty much selfcontained (with a few side-characters- and the plot sprinkled in).Something I have been asked from my friends, when talking about this anime - no, I do not believe, that senko being a ""legal...loli"" has much- or any bearing on the story and enjoyment. I have heard, that some call it loli-bait, but I have to disagree. 95% of the time I see senko-san more as an old-lady, more than just the ""lol but i am legal""-trope. I will talk about the character-design a little later in this review.Breaking up the points a bit more:Story 7/10:Like I said - only secondary most of the time, however I quite liked the dynamic between the two main characters and their feelings for each other.Art 10/10:It tries to seperate between the cold colors, harder edges between the ""real world"" and the very warm colors, softer edges, when senko-san is around. The art itself looks very nice to look at (maybe some of the ""real world"" looks kinda ""too"" real aka bland but that is a nitpick).Sound 8/10:10/10 for the voiceacting, even the english dub sounds quite nice (even tho I personally prefer the ""older""-sounding senko-voiceactress in the japanese dub).Everything else, including music is a 7/10 from me, there is nothing really that stands out to me.Characters 10/10:While the character of nakano is quite bland by design, I think he captures who the audience is supposed to be quite well - worn out, very tired and getting older.Where the character-design stands out are the three Kitsune-Characters. I think, that the idea to make Senko-San so young/very old  looking was a good idea to keep the ""romance"" towards the ""caring"" side, rather than the obvious attraction between characters, if Senko would have looked a lot more like .. well like Sora, the story/feel of the show would have been a lot different,  (not that a little eyecandy is something bad, but I think the story would have been a lot less wholesome IMHO).Enjoyment 10/10:As I said - I have watched this anime a lot over time and I still enjoy it. Hell, I am in my third rewatch and I just had to write this review, because even tho I am a very cynical person - this anime still manages to make me smile.Thank you for reading this - I hope, you will enjoy this show as much as I did. loli"" has much- or any bearing on the story and enjoyment.

I really did. But goodness, this was just so, so disappointing.I\'ll start with what I like. The series looks beautiful, props to the animators for this. Gentle, soft, and always really nice to look at, which fit the tone of the series. And the MC\'s neighbor, Kouenji, is always a joy to watch whenever she\'s on screen. Unfortunately, that\'s it, and it\'s far from enough to make me enjoy this series.The premise: a salaryman suffering from massive stress receives a blessing in the form of the helpful fox, Senko (roll credits), who is willing to do just about anything...to help him from day to day and get rid of his miserable life. A really nice, really comfy premise that had so much promise. But as I watched and watched, the novelty wore off extremely quickly - especially when you realized that every episode, every segment of every episode, had the same plot: ""man is depressed, fox helps, fluffy-fluffy"". It wore thin so, so quickly, to the point where I was constantly checking to see how much time each episode had left.With a lackluster plot, the characters never had any room to grow, either. Apart from the neighbor, none of the characters were able to keep me interested - they neither started complex nor grew over time. Kuroto (the salaryman) was always depressed but happy to see Senko. Senko was just always helpful. And none of the other foxes that showed up were particularly fascinating either. At least the neighbor was funny and eccentric!In short, this series was just really, really disappointing.

However, as the episodes roll on, certain consistent undertones become hard to brush aside.The central fox deity, despite her age-old backstory, is presented with a jarringly childlike appearance and behavior. This heavy lean into the 'loli' trope, complete with recurrent jokes about her youthful demeanor, can detract from the intended comforting theme and make for some uneasy viewing moments.While some might breeze past these elements, for others, like me, it tends to overshadow the potential charm of the series. As with any show, it's...vital to gauge it based on personal comfort. vital to gauge it based on personal comfort."", 'So far, this anime is exactly as it is advertised on the cover.  A helpful fox demigod comes to help an overworked man.Unfortunately, that sentence is uncomfortably close to a spoiler, because that\'s the entire plot.  There doesn\'t seem to be much more to it than that.  You get additional characters added, and the fox does some silly and cute stuff, but at the end of the day, that\'s really all it is.  You get exactly as advertised, and nothing more.I rated this anime low, but not for that reason.  Also not for any technical reason.  The music is...alright, the character design is alright, everything\'s fine.  Not great, not amazing (except for some of the background scenes which are *amazing*, such as the opening scene with the office building), but not awful either.But there is a reason I rated it as low as I did.This anime is purely, and solely, wish fulfillment.  It\'s, as others said, a self-insert.  Nothing more.  Just panders to lonely people looking for someone to take care of them, even just for a little bit, once in their life.And that\'s why I rated it so low.See, if you think about it, this anime, while significantly more wholesome (clearly), isn\'t really all that different from a harem, ecchi or even hentai anime, and for much the same reason. You get to put yourself into the shoes of a main character, and for a few minutes excape from your life with an imaginary person who you can imagine can meet your needs in the way you don\'t get in real life.  And then, after the thirty minutes are up, you turn off your TV or computer or tablet or whatever, you look around, and realize it was all an illusion.That feeling of realizing it was all an illusion is awful, and it\'s probably worse than if you just didn\'t watch this at all.In a way, this anime is a victim of its own success, because that\'s exactly why it exists, and exactly what it was going for.  That\'s kind of the whole point of an iyashikei.  But, there are other iyashikei anime that don\'t have this - because they\'re not self-insert.  They take you into a beautiful world and tell you beautiful stories with beautiful backgrounds and beautiful characters, and while there\'s a certain sense of loss when it ends, it\'s not the same *kind* of loss.  They try to draw you into their beautiful world and leave you enriched for the experience.  ""Akebi\'s Sailor Uniform"" and ""Is the Order a Rabbit"" are two iyashikei-ish anime of this type, and I can\'t really speak highly enough of the beautiful world they draw you into.But this anime doesn\'t draw you into a beautiful world full of beautiful artwork, lovely characters, friends, happiness, etc.  It doesn\'t have a warm, European-style town into which you just kind of want to move to and spend the rest of your life.  It doesn\'t have adorable, innocent characters that make you want to have a child of your own.  It just has a demigod who takes care of the main character, and quite transparently wants to make you wish it was you (the self-insert minute or two at the end of each episode makes that *abundantly* and quite flagrantly clear).  In my view, this is an unhealthy illusion, and for that reason, watching this makes your life *worse* instead of *better*.Are these just my issues?  I don\'t think so.  While I acknowledge there are many people out there who seek this kind of illusion out (I mean, there\'s a certain brand of otaku, etc., who base their *entire life* around such parasocial distortions, see ""I would die if I met my favorite pop star""), I think this is pretty much the *exact opposite* of Hachiman from Oregairu when he said ""I want something genuine"".  This isn\'t genuine.  Yes, it\'s an anime.  Anime aren\'t supposed to be genuine, they tell a story (at least the good ones do).  But there\'s good storytelling that has a positive impact on your life, and then there\'s well, narrative transactional intercourse, and in my view, this squarely fits into the latter category.So would I recommend this?  No, I don\'t think so.  Not because it\'s not cute, because it is.  Not because it\'s not even adorable, because it is.  Not because it\'s not well produced, because it is.  All these things are true - it\'s a well made anime and it does exactly what it sets out to do, and does it well.  And it\'s that fact that makes me not recommend it.  At the end of the day, I think it\'s one of the more unhealthy anime out there, and so much the worse because it masquerades as a ""healing"" anime.That\'s my review.  As with many of my reviews, I\'m probably spitting into the wind - I know that many folks love anime like this, and I understand why.  After all, this kind of anime is popular for a reason, just as some other *ahem* forms of media are.

You shouldn't expect a lot of depth, but it's nice, meaningless fluff.Positives:+ Relaxing and comforting vibe.

It's cute slice of life and nothing more, and it's admirably...upfront about that.Negatives:- There's sort of a tease that there will be a plot or mystery regarding the MC's dreams of his ancestor and Senko, but it ultimately comes to nothing. What little they do with this is inconsequential and would have been better left out.- It's pure slice of life. There is no character or plot progression at all between the first and last episodes.  It's not like it ever pretends otherwise, but it would have been nice to have at least a little continuity between episodes.- Lack of compelling B plots or side characters.  There's nothing going on here except for MC and Senko doing stuff together.

Although it had a lot of potential as other reviews have noted regarding different concepts and how the characters could have interacted, the way in which this show was executed was, frankly, disappointing. The art and sound design were good and spectacular respectively, however, the complete lack of character development throughout the show, or indeed, of any cohesive storyline, completely ruined the viewing experience for me. The thing it most resembled to me was a season-long exposition to some more exciting show, but as I'm sure one should be aware, no such project exists or has been announced. The second...half of the show was more of a grind, more of wanting to have the thing finished than actually enjoying it. Aside from the first, 11th, and last episodes, which, in a higher-quality anime, would have been perfectly fine episodes, I honestly regret spending the 3 hours of the remainder of the show on this anime in particular. half of the show was more of a grind, more of wanting to have the thing finished than actually enjoying it.

Does the idea of somone telling you you've done a good job while petting your head make you want to cry?If so, this anime is for you.There's really not much of a story, but it's a slice of life so there doesn't need to be. The art is super generic, with one exception -- they really put time and effort into drawing Senko's tail, and it shows. The opening and closing are fair, but nothing about the sound design is going to blow you away, or really be noticable. Additionally, all the characters are very simple -- but, for goal...this anime has, they don't need to be anything but that. If the characters were any more complex, it'd detract from the enjoyment this series gives.And this series provides a lot of enjoyment, provided you meet the criteria up above. This show is cathartic as all hell, and -- if you're like me -- will lead to lots of crying just from the shear relatability of the MC's situation. This show was a wonderful guilty pleasure, and was best watched slowly -- each episode saved for a particularly horrible day at the office, so I had something to help clear the stress from my mind.Overall, I gave this show a 6/10. It's cathartic, and has it's place. But, it's not for everyone, and it's not anything that could be considered deep.

One of anime\'s strengths is its instantaneous hook from maximized aesthetic appeal in character design, so wish fulfillment entertainment is simply a natural progression. Nonetheless, there are many ways for an anime rooted in pandering to go wrong, one of which Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san is a pretty good example.Our protagonist Nakano is afflicted with a general malaise from being overworked by his office job, and Senko plays opposite as a fox spirit who decides to become his housemaid as a means of alleviating his exhaustion. There\'s nothing especially unique about Nakano. Besides having...an affinity for Senko\'s fluffy tail, being an average exploited Japanese salaryman is Nakano\'s defining characteristic. Neither feel like fully realized characters, rather they act as commensal concepts. Hence, the essence of the show lies in a emotionally fulfilling atmosphere (often described as ""healing"") enkindled by Senko\'s caring for him. Nakano exists diegetically to be pampered by Senko; likewise, Senko\'s main purpose as a character is to care for Nakano. There is another fox spirit, Shiro, who befriends Nakano, but she never really aggressively competes with Senko for his attention, instead functioning like an alternative texture.Having outlined the mechanics, we can now ascertain how its narrative falls apart in several aspects. Firstly, since Senko has no personal motivation to act as Nakano\'s housemaid (the canonical explanation that he resembles one of his ancestors who previously had a rapport with Senko means that her interest at first is a matter of happenstance, i.e. any inciting attraction is negligible), there is no real chemistry between the two. This is aggravated further by their strictly platonic interactions, and although there may be sexual/romantic undertones, any development in this direction is repeatedly extinguished by Nakano\'s inner remarks that Senko both looks too young for his taste and acts too maternal for him. The show falls flat here since it\'s mostly focused on their relationship, or lack thereof.Because there is no foundational attraction between the two, the weight of Senko\'s motivation to nurture falls onto the circumstances surrounding Nakano\'s unhappiness. This is actually the show\'s biggest misstep. As the emphasis shifts to Nakano\'s abuse at work, Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san evolves from flaccid slice of life into something much more sinister.Japan\'s work environment is an unignorable cultural dilemma. Extremely long hours, unpaid overtime. and unused vacation days are common realities experienced by Japanese salarymen, often leading to stress, depression, sleep deprivation, and, at its extreme, karōshi (overwork death). ""Death marches"" and ""black companies"" are serious issues facing Japan, and the nightmare of actually working as an animator in Japan is pretty well understood by fans. But what does this have to do with the show?To help illustrate why this is a narrative problem, let me pose a question: Why Nakano? Surely, he isn\'t the only salaryman suffering as a result of his exploitative company. So where is everyone else\'s Senko-san? What did Nakano do to get his own fox spirit housemaid? Of course, we know the answer, and we already know it to be facile and convenient. Nakano had no decision in his ancestry, and there is nothing particularly special about his victimization. Thus, the answer the show provides is also its general prescription for the salarymen at large: moe escapism. Instead of identifying a cultural emergency that the government has even been taking action against, Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san sees an opportunity to exploit for its own benefit. Why bother questioning the circumstances of stress, isolation, and disconnection when you can just watch anime like Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san and self-insert yourself into faceless leads like Nakano? This is unintentionally egregiously harmful social commentary, and in a culture in which a man married a Vocaloid character to escape loneliness, this is unacceptable. In the logic of Senko-san, exploitation in the workplace is a necessity for the salarymen to fully embrace a moe lifestyle.Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san doesn\'t need to be a show with deep social commentary; the most frustrating thing is that the perfect adaptation already exists in the form of the post-credits ""Super Senko-san"" scenes. These segments showcase the real spirit of the show stripped down to its essentials. They reimagine the episode without all the fat, without the self-insert character, divorced from any social context, as a first-person POV one-sided dialogue short à la One Room. It\'s a format that works. But this was not the choice made, and the final product is merely a coddling vulgarity meant to fill a gaping demand in Japanese culture for domestic and emotional sustenance, abetting unethical work-life balance norms like convenience stores selling clean shirts for office workers unable to return home for the night for the sake of its own existence. Maybe this is ""wholesome"" entertainment for some, but the social implications are too glaring for me to find any iota of worth. an affinity for Senko\'s fluffy tail, being an average exploited Japanese salaryman is Nakano\'s defining characteristic.

Because there is an extremely problematic element regarding Nakano and Senko's relationship and (by extension) most of the relationships in this story with exception to maybe his friendship with Koenji: pedophilia.You can tell me over and over again until you're blue in the face that Senko is 800+ years old and when it comes to the culture...of the gods, pedophilia might not be an issue, but that doesn't change the fact that the creators of this story thought it was a good idea to have the waifu in this look like a LITTLE GIRL.  In fact, it's admitted in both the manga and the anime (when they first meet Koenji) that (as far as Senko goes) she's BOTH the WIFE AND THE MOTHER.If I didn't know any better, I'd strongly believe that this was a male's fantasy story to an extent (which I can believe if you look at the artist's notes): coming home from a hard day at work and bringing in the bread to his wife who's not only beautiful and (dangerously) young, but is pampering him to his heart's content.  With as young as Senko LOOKS (NOT IS), there is a disturbing implication: a child bride/wife.Add the fact that all of the girls are young in some degree with the fact on how (at least two) of them dress, and it's only adding fuel to the fire.  Sure, I've seen it common in stories from Japan to use sexiness as a joke, but when girls under the age of consent are seducing older men (in this case, Nakano) for any reason, you've got a problem.I used to love this series for the hurt/comfort element and how sweet it was Senko just wanting to do something nice: on reflection, hurt/comfort one of my favorite genres.

Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40902/Shokugeki_no_Souma__Gou_no_Sara,"[""So 13 weeks in and now at the end of Gou no Sara, I never got to a point where I felt this season was as bad as people had hyped it up to be. I waited week after week for it to get awful and it just never came for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of this final season and saw it as a victory lap of sorts for the series. We saw everyone come full circle this season and show off their development. Of particular importance for me was the growth that Megumi, Erina and Aldini have had. For me, that...was enough to really enjoy the final season. I understand that this is an unpopular opinion and that's fine, you can judge for yourself, but if you're a fan of SnS, you should definitely give this last season a try.Production wise, you can definitely tell JC staff started to rely on the established name of SnS instead of actually putting a lot of effort into the show. The panning camera shots, off model characters and other quality control issues are not a huge deal to me, because I personally watch things for the story and how they make me feel rather than as an art critic, but they do exist and are noticeable. I also could feel that pacing was very rushed especially in the final half of the season. It felt like the Shokgeki's were on 2.5x speed and the detail and educational bits that we're accustomed to seeing were just not there anymore. It felt like they instead transitioned to relying on the girls getting naked as our sole source of entertainment during shokugeki's. I was able to overlook this because I'm easy to please, you may not be.Overall, you can definitely see a dip in quality from SnS season 1 to season 5. It's gradual, it's painful and it's pretty sad because of how well done season 1-3 were. But, it is it the sad reality of ongoing shows. You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become Food Wars Season 5. The anime original ending wasn't bad to me, but it wasn't great like how I felt at the end of Totsuki Train either. I was still left wanting more. Despite all the flaws, I still love the series and enjoyed this a lot even with its issues.

The fans were 100% right, this season blows and there isn’t a better or easier way to describe it, Shokugeki no Soma was never a series known for being particularly good, its essentially food porn the anime, with exaggerated over the top reactions and some great comedy. However, even with knowledge of the manga having...a questionable turn in the story, it was hard to see this absolute disaster coming.Story: 1This is the first time I have ever given a 1 to a story, this season of food wars throws out literally everything the series built up and cherished. Soma and his dad’s rivalry being built up? Doesn’t matter since Soma’s father loses off screen to some edge lord teenage version of Nakiri’s dad, who happens to have the cooking equivalent of Sharingan. The competitions being legitimate measures of a student being able to run a restaurant? It’s all about game show theater now with chefs bringing in actual chainsaws, motorcycles and goddam explosives into the kitchen.Noir as the antagonists pretty much made the entire season unbearable, the moment the black KKK robe wearing gang showed up I genuinely lost any ability to continue taking this show seriously, it was simply too comical, I don’t know how the mangaka actually thought that look was supposed to be cool or intimidating. I don’t care about them, I cant even try to understand their motivations, and the entire concept of criminal cooks seems like poorly written fanfiction. Elite chefs who work for Mafia and such, don’t cook with chainsaws, they cook the way a regular chef would using regular kitchen tools. The author who used to at least try to get his series grounded in reality threw out everything and completely destroyed any suspension of disbelief.Art: 3The art style is very basic, in fact it might be the peak JC staff Power Point, even the opening consists of cut out characters, colored manga panels, and recycled movement. Its actually jarring to compare the art in this season to that of the first season, the difference in animation, the gorgeous backgrounds and mental imagery, and the overall change for the worse in even the foodgasms. Absolutely every aspect of the art in this series has faced a decline, there are no redeeming factors, and if not for the fact that I have seen even worse declines this year like Deen taking over the third season of a certain shonen series, I would have given the art a 1 as well.The sound: 5Its passable, I would write more but realistically there isn’t much to write here. The sound is extremely forgettable, generic sound effects, generic dramatic background music, reuse of the old soundtrack many times, forgettable OP. Overall its just passable sound, its not bad enough to be remembered, and not good enough to be noteworthy.Characters: 4Jobbing is a common trope in any battle themed form of entertainment, be it pro wrestling or shonen manga, it occurs to hype up new threats. However there is a good way to job and a poor way to do it, having all the fan favorite characters completely annihilated by Noir with no redemption or come back arc is among the worst ways to go about it. Remember what an amazing chef Yukihira’s dad was? Well he gets beaten off screen even before Asahi managed to get more cooking skills with his food copy ability. Remember the previous seasons top rival chef Tsusaka? He gets unceremoniously beaten without even managing to beat a single noir chef. Tadakoro got some respect but was reduced to her usually damsel role after Asahi tears her apart with ease. Overall the complete ruination and downplay of all the characters built up through the series in the final competition by complete outsiders, have utterly destroyed any enjoyment of the characters I had. It also doesn’t help that the majority of the coolest characters, did not even show up for the competition but just as spectators, and that Erina had all her character progress thrown out the window. Overall, the fans of this series will be very disappointed by the jobbing, the out of character behavior, and the overall cutting out of fan favorite characters in this final season.Enjoyment: 4I did not enjoy this season, I don’t see fans of the series enjoying this season either. It feels like the prior season is where the series should have ended, and that this season was an unwanted arc written by a mangaka who genuinely wanted to torpedo their own story to end it.Overall: 4This wasn’t a particularly good show, in fact it was probably among the worst things I have seen this year, a 4 is the lowest score I give to anime. I only give a 4 to animes that I absolutely despise and think are hot trash, the only reason this even gets a generous 4 is because it had some decent cooking reaction scenes and because the show was watchable to the end. a questionable turn in the story, it was hard to see this absolute disaster coming.Story: 1This is the first time I have ever given a 1 to a story, this season of food wars throws out literally everything the series built up and cherished.

With that in mind, I am having an extremely difficult time getting behind this adaptation and am finding myself really forcing myself to watch each new episode. As a fan, this hurts and is quite disheartening, but unfortunately I knew this was coming.To start, lets address the little elephant in the room, BLUE arc absolutely sucked in comparison to the rest of the fantastic (imho) manga. Everyone is aware of this....With the knowledge that BLUE arc is widely considered as terrible it was going to be an uphill battle for J.C. Staff to adapt it. But who knows, there is always the potential that J.C. Staff could actually make it somewhat entertaining and stomachable (is that even a word….?), making it into a worthwhile anime to consume in the later episodes, and I would gladly change my review in the future if that is the case. Unfortunately, with a saddened heart, that appears to be not the case as of now.Of course, with Covid-19 greatly affecting the lives of everyone globally, some leeway can be easily given to those in the anime industry as it makes their jobs just that much more difficult (not even going to begin to pretend that I know the exact ways they’re affected so I’ll leave it at that). There is no doubt that the quality of the anime is going to be affected in a negative manner, and this review takes that into account.Story: 4/10As stated earlier, BLUE arc is by far the worst arc in this wonderful series. With that in mind, it would be very difficult to turn it into a good story unless J.C. turned it into an anime original season or conclude with an anime original ending (which I still deeply hope happens).The entire arc gives hardly any sense of danger to Soma, nor really builds upon any previous character relationships to make a memorable finale, which is a huge disappointment. For anime only fans, I’ll stop there and let you form your own opinions, as the experience may be completely different from your point of view, and hope you aren’t as soured as myself and other fans. However, my biggest gripe is that the main “villain” Asahi Saiba also is just thrown into the story as the next villain that Soma must defeat in order to fully understand what it means to master his cooking through finding someone who he wants to cook for. As of now in the anime, Asahi is nothing but a shallow character who lacks any form of depth, and J.C. Staff has done nothing to change that in the adaptation. He gets an extremely rushed introduction with no real motive but to take Erina as his bride. Another major turn off is that majority of the side characters who lots of us have grown to love over the last four seasons have been neutered to become even less important in the story (minus Erina, Megumin, and Takumi of course). I’ve got nothing against those three, on the contrary they’re my favorite three characters other than Soma, but the entire cast of characters were important in helping this show become what it is.The cooking battles are still entertaining in their own right, but the story itself is just so rushed and lackluster in terms of why the BLUE tournament is now of this format instead of the traditional tournament and the motives behind Asahi Saiba that it is much more difficult to get behind and enjoy the story. I will say that the whole idea of underground chef's is cool in theory, but in practice here, it is really not doing it for me as it is not done very well nor are they really fleshed out as a whole. Instead, they are almost portrayed as a cult of chefs who blindly follow their leader, Asahi.I won’t even begin on the drastic change in tone from moving from spending more time on the epicness (again not a word lol) related to the actual cooking of the dishes to spending most of the screen time illustrating the foodgasms. I mean, who doesn’t like a good foodgasm from time to time, as that’s a reason why we are degenerate enough to watch and enjoy this show, but a lot of the allure was in the actual cooking of the dishes (or I can just be the only one who thinks this, that’s cool too). Simply, I just don’t like this shift in style, as it takes the show in the wrong direction.Art/Animation: 7/10I will be honest right of the bat, getting a partial bias out of the way. As of the last few years, I think that J.C. Staff has begun to rank as one of the worst companies in the industry in terms of animation quality (you can rake my feet over coal or agree if you would like). This unfortunately is quite evident in the last two seasons of Food Wars as they were glorified power point presentations with a moving background and music (damn awesome music I might add). However, even with the global dumpster fire hampering the ability of these fantastic professionals to bring us our anime fix, the animation quality this season is definitely better than the two previous seasons. I was presently surprised to see the quality increase and am quite pleased. The art also looks sharp and crisp, nothing special, but is more than passable.Character: 7/10As really stated in the story portion of this review, Asahi Saiba is honestly just a one-toned “villain” who lacks any depth, and feels nothing short of a forced villain for the sake of providing a villain. Other than that, the character dynamics are essentially the same as the previous seasons, except for Erina, who finally is becoming more accepting and open to those around her, including Soma. This is nice to see happen, but unfortunately it is really the only sort of character development we've seen.Sound: 8/10The opening is cute, and catchy, but nowhere near as good as previous seasons. Again, however, is that in the sound department nothing has really changed from previous seasons. Lots of the same soundtracks are used, which are mainly pretty damn epic, and the voice acting is quite well done as well. Nothing really to say here so I’ll leave it at that as it is the same old Food Wars awesomeness.Enjoyment: 7/10Even though I have just spent a stupid amount of words regrettably bashing one of my favorite animes of all time, I still somewhat enjoy the episodes when I do finally bring myself to watch them as it is always nice to see a favorite manga adapted into an anime.Overall: 6/10As a fan who was soured because of this arc, I cannot give this season a high recommendation, but still give it slight seal of approval. However, with this is mind, if you have stuck with the anime all this time (as obviously everyone reading this review has) it is still worth a watch, and don’t let my idiotic ramblings deter you from watching this, especially if you are enjoying the season yourself.To end: Let’s all stay safe, and enjoy the foodgasms while we can :) With the knowledge that BLUE arc is widely considered as terrible it was going to be an uphill battle for J.C.

After that, some teacher comes to Totsuki Academy, his name is Asahi. He\'s a ugly bastard who are interested with Nakiri\'s oppai.... And then the last tournament ""BLUE"" begins.The story of Souma\'s momNow, what really caught the attention of the personal writer was the telling of the figure of Souma\'s mom. This is very interesting because in the previous seasons, the figure of Souma\'s mom has never even been...shown or even told, her figure seemed to have never even been thought of. So Souma\'s mom appearance in season 5 is very, very surprising.There are times when we feel hurt. There are times when we want to run from reality. There are times when we don\'t want to do anything. We can rest, we can stop but we cannot give up. If you can\'t get up, ask someone else for help. If we are already destroyed by our own mistakes, then wait for the right time to get back up. If you can\'t invite other people, walk side by side with them.This is the last season, I hope you can watch this final series and don\'t stop at the middle of the season. I know it is torturing you but an ending is not always tragic. If you already read manga, I beg you to don\'t miss this one, I know you are bored but to judge an anime before you watch it, isn\'t that weird? shown or even told, her figure seemed to have never even been thought of.

However, the BLUE arc from the manga failed so miserably, there is no other way for me to go about this review without looking at how the anime is trying not to end up in flames.POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEADSo far, the final season is actually coming along not bad. Story and character suffer mostly because of the source material; it\'d be asking too much for the anime to completely rewrite Asahi Saiba. However, the anime has already taken steps (and likely will in the future) to rectify the horrible writing.Story: 4/10tbh, the...premise of the BLUE arc is actually not that bad. Being able to see Soma finally surpass his dad or succeed at BLUE would\'ve been nice. However, I think it would\'ve seen more success if either:a) the 4th season didn\'t have such a ""finale like ending"" (originally, the author intended to end the manga here as well)b) more time was spent to build up into BLUE (pacing feels very off for something of this scale)c) BLUE is done as an epilogue type arc (OVA or whatever, doesn\'t matter)The main issue with this arc is the pacing. It feels like everything is coming out of nowhere and doesn\'t make sense. BLUE felt like it was just announced on the spur, when you\'d expect the entire cooking world to receive some precursor to the event being held again. Noir is an interesting concept, but was never hinted at or introduced early on; how can such a large organization, including Asahi, go unnoticed? Gin, Joichiro, and others are clearly aware of Noir\'s existence.However, I must applaud the anime for removing the Asahi/Erina kidnapping arc.  Instead, we only see Asahi attacking Totsuki\'s pride which riles up Erina. This is a wayyyy better approach thanks to all the character development Erina has gotten (this was thrown away in the manga pretty much) by making it about the friend\'s she\'s made and not herself. I also like the small adjustments the studio is making to the romantic plot of SomaxErina (balcony scene). If small changes like this keep getting made (and we get an anime original ending which I pray to god for), I\'d be willing to up this score to a 6 even. For now though, it\'s a 4 for being quite literally ""decent"".Art: 7/10Art is great, nothing new but nothing horribly done either.Sound: 7/10Not a fan of the OP, but voice acting and mixing is pretty good still. We still get those high quality orgasmic moans so everything is up to standard.Character: 2/10Another flaw coming from the manga, sadly. Asahi Saiba is such a horribly written character, there\'s no way to go around it. His motivations are cheap (basically designed to mirror Soma in a way). His victory over Joichiro is literally only so Soma can beat his dad through proxy. A ""plot sword"" so to speak. Soma doesn\'t need to beat his dad for the series to end; we\'ve clearly seen his character change from the start of the series (me beat daddy) to having more grand goals like being the top of his generation, beating Erina, etc. Asahi Saiba is just a really cheap end-all-be-all boss for Soma. The Noir chefs are really cheap characters too. As fodder, you shouldn\'t expect any characterization.Again, the anime cutting some dialogue and plot threads short hurts character development a bit, like Joichiro and Soma discussing the future of Yukihira and Soma\'s goals (this was at least done well in the manga). However, despite the anime\'s choice to have a BLUE preliminary competition to showcase all the characters, I felt that they could have elaborated a bit more on the improvements made by Megumi and Takumi to their cooking; aside from their status as MCs alongside Soma, their rankings within the Elite 10 make their feat of entering BLUE a bit weird to accept at first.The biggest character development to watch out for as the season wraps up is Erina; hopefully, they don\'t gut her character for no reason like they did in the manga.Enjoyment: 5/10Shokugeki no Soma ended almost a year ago in the shittiest way possible. Almost as bad as Bleach. Yet, this season gives me a sliver of hope of having a good ending hence the 5/10. Yes, Asahi Saiba is still a poorly written character. Yes, the pacing is still quite rushed at times. But for what they had to work with, the anime has made some reasonable adjustments to steer this series towards an acceptable end.Fingers crossed that character development is decent in the future, since that alongside good writing (and food porn/orgasms) was what made this series special. Watching half of Shokugeki\'s strong points get gutted and rushed to hell for the final arc ruined everything the last 8 years worked so hard to create. premise of the BLUE arc is actually not that bad.

In previous seasons, it wasn't like this, so I really don't know what happened. But, for some reason, this anime is FAST. In the manga, this season's plot was incredibly rushed, and it got criticised for it a lot. However, I don't think that's the case here. They're adding a lot of stuff, fleshing out certain parts so they have more depth and changing quite a lot of things. It's not the plot that rushed, quite the opposite. But, somehow, watching it feels...a little stressful. Important moments last literally 1 second, everyone is speaking so fast, the battle music is playing the whole episode, etc. You can literally get exhausted watching it. If they didn't add so many changes and details I would think they're just making the anime without realising what is important, what should they emphasize and all the other important things.But, I still enjoy it a lot. It's simple, I like the characters, and the story is entertaining. We have the old characters + Asahi. Fukuyama Jun makes Asahi great,and I'm loving his anime version honestly. There aren't many other new characters so most most of the time it resembles the previous seasons.And honestly, if you're watching this you've probably already saw over 70+ of Shokugeki no Soma episodes. If you liked those seasons, it means:- You liked the characters- You couldn't care less about animation (yes, it probably doesn't get any worse than this)- You like Soma crushing his opponents in cooking battles with cool music in the backgroundThen I don't see why you would not like this season. I enjoyed the story in the manga but this version is a bit different and so far, so even if you didn't like that I still suggest giving it a try.Also, both the opening and the ending are insanely good (this is unironically a very important point, actually).If you get used to the fast pace I'm going to recommend this. The 8 score is a bit weaker 8, but if you're a Shokugeki fan, you're going to enjoy this final season too. a little stressful.

I've been sad at ending like Gurren Lagann and Banana Fish but this hits different. I feel dismayed. After 5 seasons of food battles, foodgasms, and ridiculous characters, Food Wars felt empty at the end for multiple reasons. This season felt like it got rid of any goodwill the show had left for me after season 4 and it tried its hardest.Let's start with Asahi because holy shit, this dude was an awful villian. Say what you will about Azami but he at least looked villainous and had the backstory of a villain...but Asahi? Fuck this dude. His whole power is insane and one of the dumbest things I've seen in an anime and his overall reasoning of wanting to marry Erina is at first, just corny and then they just throw another twist at the end that just makes his plot seem disgusting in hindsight. He was a bad villian, his reason for being a villian is dumb and he was just the worst.Then we have the worst sin for me and that's the usage of side characters. Listen, I like Soma, Erina, Megumi, and Aldini but that's not the whole fucking cast guys. Seriously, most of the other characters in this show barely showed up at all. It's so frustrating to watch the same characters (no matter how likable they are) when you know that there's more fun characters being wasted, Seriously, aren't Ryo and Akira supposed to be rivals to Souma and they didn't do shit for most of the season. Fuck, I forgot they existed. It's ridiculous and their replacements are garbage.The underworld chef idea was pretty weird to have in a show about teenage cooks trying to be the best chefs ever but it doesn't help when the show decided to add fucking supervillains like a Sargent who uses explosives to heat their food up, a clown that uses fucking juggling to cook and that's not to say their designs are stupid because they are.Finally, there's the animation. By this point, I'm beating a very dead horse but it still stands to reason that the animation in this was sub-par at best. They fucking reused multiple moments from other seasons in the episode so blatantly it was. amazingly shitty. I also realized just how little JC Staff really gave a shit about this season in the final episode when there was no big animation moment that supposed to look and it was just the same sub-par shitty quality. Nice JC.In the end, I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. After how fantastic the first two seasons were, I was still excited for what the show had going for it. Then the third season happened and while it wasn't great, I still had hope. Even after Season 4, I was hoping that at the very least, it would go out on a high note. Nope. Not even that. It's frustrating, disappointed and just makes me sad. At the very least, I will hold those last two seasons in high regard. Thank you for that at least, JC Staff. Fuck this season though. but Asahi?

Had the anime ended with the 4th season, it wouldn't have been a fulfilling climax. I still get goosebumps while watching the show. The previous seasons have put in a lot of effort to make us fall in love with the characters and I will be brutal honest over here, I sometimes get so nostalgic and my eyes become watery with the emotions involved, and that never happens to me with any other anime.In the end, I would just like to say that food wars\\shokugeki...no soma ROCKS! no soma ROCKS!"", ""NO SPOILER REVIEWWow. This has to be one of the biggest betrayals. Shokugeki was doing so well until this season through the whole story into the sewer and then pooped on it more.The pacing in this season is horrendous, everything is rushed and you barely see any of the meals being cooked. All you get are rushed reactions, rushed plots, and every previously made notion of characters destroyed.Animation, horrible. Merely a bunch of flashbacks or panning shots.Soundtrack, not bad, it's sad that the OP was wasted on this trash season...Characters, the season throws away all but 4 main characters, taking away any development that had previously existed.DO NOT WATCH if you haven't yet. It is a complete waste of time, COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME, and you're better ending the show with the end of Season 4.

It is a complete waste of time, COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME, and you're better ending the show with the end of Season 4."", 'In my opinion, this is almost as bad as a concluding anime season can be.It was honestly bad enough for me to look back at all the previous season and wonder if they were actually as good as I remembered them to be. This is because this anime performs all of Shokugeki’s conventions so poorly that it almost comes across as a critique of the series. Let me break down how this season manages to critique by nothing other than poor execution.Let’s start with what Shokugeki is known for first, pornography.Whoops, sorry, I mean “Ecchi”. To be more specific, Shokugeki is most known...for its fanserivice during food reactions. I actually believe that this series (up to this season) is the best use of fanservice because it is used as a creative way to express how good the food is.I say “up to this season” because the fanservice in this season is lazy and visually unappealing. The ecchi reactions are typically a single pose of creatively uninteresting artwork. This applies to the entire season, as the animation relies heavily on still frames and the art is undetailed and uninspired.But the fanservice is even worse than that. Towards the end, it achieves something that I’ve never seen before and becomes “Fanservice Fanservice”. “Fanservice Fanservice” is when a show that typically uses fanservice for a creative narrative effect shows fanservice just because the audience expects fanservice.This occurs toward the end when literally every somewhat relevant character in the series shows up to a competition just for the purpose of fanservice. At that point, it quite literally BECOMES a parody of itself.Next, I will discuss he second thing Shokugeki is known for, the actual cooking.As I stated previously, the animation and art are both very lazy and uninspired. The cooking scenes are usually just a static pose of a character with some camera movement and a blurry background. They hardly show the actual cooking too. The cooking is over in about 10 seconds and they just describe how they cooked the dish while the judges eat it. It’s so lazy that I feel loke nobody who worked on this anime actually cared.But similar to the ecchi, these cooking scenes also manage to critique the series in general by making it abundantly clear how the cooking battles work. One chef finishes with a good dish. The second chef finishes with a good dish and makes one for the first chef. The first chef is blown away and the second chef wins. I think this was how every single battle went in this season and it ruins my perception on previous seasons as well.Honestly, I could go on and on about things I disliked about this season. I could write a whole 8 paragraphs about how awful the villain group “Noir” is and how they are a bunch of clowns larping as ninjas. I could write a whole essay about how the characters are so poorly written and how heir actions make no sense. I could dedicate my entire anime watching career analyzing how this season was unnecessary and actually left side characters at worse places than in the previous season. But I don’t have the willpower to do any of these things.I’m not strong enough. This anime has drained me.I suppose I should explain why I rated this anime a 2 instead of a 1. The reason for that is soley because the last three episodes were somewhat competent. The art and animation in episodes 11 and 12 were somewhat decent and had some nice tie-ins to Souma’s past. The final episode had decent breakthrough with Souma and Erina (although I still felt their love was too forced at the end).I also liked the Souma and Takami team up and that Souma’s dad kept a stubble beard after Souma saved him from his bearded depression when his wife died.That is literally all that I liked about this season, but it was just enough to push it to a 2. Yes, I really believe it is this bad. I know the source material was bad, but that does not excuse the lack of effort put in place by the studio. I’m just sad that a well-known and somehwhat respected anime like this was given such a bad ending.It is closer to a 1 than a 3. for its fanserivice during food reactions.

It\'s main issues, the writing and characterisation, drown out all of its potential and highlight other problems.Saiba Asahi - the main antagonist of the season - is often maligned for being a poorly written character who is badly developed, unlikable, extremely creepy, and inconsistent. All of this is true. Despite all that Asahi\'s main issue is that he\'s a clear example of Food Wars at its worst. His cooking skill is basically magical so you can\'t get invested in it, he only defeats previously established characters...to build up his own legend rather than actually going about and actually doing things that are impressive, and his actual writing is just typical shonen villain. It\'s just awful every time he\'s on screen and all of his shokugekis are just obnoxious to watch - though that\'s become the norm.Shokugekis also changed over time from chefs preparing things you could arguably make in your own kitchen to characters creating pretty looking food esque things out of absolutely nowhere. Because of this shokugekis are now absurdly quick to go through and theres no real ebb and flow to it. Just challenge, someone uses a dumb technique, then to the judges. This makes them rather boring to watch as you have no investment in them beyond their relevance to the plot. I miss back when we had reasonable things like eggs over rice and pork wrapped in bacon not ""food looking thing asahi made that was never named.""Music isn\'t memorable. The op is worth skipping. The animation looks fine.Unless you really like this anime and want to see then end: just save yourself the time. to build up his own legend rather than actually going about and actually doing things that are impressive, and his actual writing is just typical shonen villain.

The art, the sounds, the animation, the plot, absolutely everything is rushed and it feels like some mediocre trash.The series always felt repetitive and I was...fine with that because there was still a plot behind it but now they have just relied on the repetition alone for this season and it's absolutely failed.They reused a bunch of scenes from previous seasons throughout this season and it just shows how much they don't care about the series anymore. This is truly an awful season and one that I absolutely can not recommend to anyone.At the time of this review the series is rated at 7.37 (Which will definitely be going down over time). I don't believe this score is an accurate representation of the quality of the season. I believe this score is so high only because it's Food Wars. If the series didn't have it's audience and fans backing up the show, this would have scored a 5 or 6 because this season is an absolute fail.I can not express how sad and disappointed I am for this series. It just keeps getting worse after the 3rd season.**SPOILERS BELOW**The new character Asahi is an absolute JOKE. Up until now the series was relatively realistic and believable but this new character just touches kitchen tools and he somehow masters years of cooking skill and expertise from just holding it in his hand?

It feel like if Jojo's was a food battle shounen.Let me give an example to explain my weird point of view: chefs all use knives and other interesting implements to imbue their dishes with personality, right? Well, at the end of episode 5, a member of the villains appears with a CHAINSAW and SLEDGEHAMMER, wearing...military uniform.If someone has a reasonable explanation, I'd like to hear it.As a battle shounen, i don't think season 5 is objectively as good as the previous seasons, however, I found it much more fun to watch due to the absurdity of the show being cranked up to 11. military uniform.If someone has a reasonable explanation, I'd like to hear it.As a battle shounen, i don't think season 5 is objectively as good as the previous seasons, however, I found it much more fun to watch due to the absurdity of the show being cranked up to 11."", 'Top 5 Fastest Runners:#5 — Asafa Powell#4 — Yohan Blake#3 — Tyson Gay#2 — Usain Bolt...#1 — Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no SaraIt is it, congratulations.The fifth season is very, VERY rushed, differently from the others season, on this one you don\'t even see they making foods, it looks like as the food magically appears on the table, understanding what and why they are doing is the essential part of a food anime, imagine MasterChef without the making of, just the results, it is a bad idea, isn\'t it?

Season 4 would’ve served as a perfectly fine ending to the whole show and they could’ve just written in some unresolved plot lines like Erina’s mother into it.Instead they had to go and come up with this dumpster fire of a final that’s really made a mockery of everything that made Food Wars so good. Shockingly awful, just watch seasons 1-4 and pretend the...last one never happened last one never happened', 'Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara is the fifth and final season of Shokugeki no souma, a quite well-known show among the anime community. As you can see already it has its fifth season whereas many shows can\'t even get their second, this makes it clear that Shokugeki no souma is one of the popular shows which has seen great success with its previous seasons. Then what about its fifth plate?Being a fan of the show myself I expected the show to end on a good note but this season was a bit disappointing. The first problem was with the pacing. It was rushed as...much as possible to adapt the remaining chapters and this made the experience half-assed and incomplete. Comparing to its previous seasons this season\'s story itself was a problem. The story was not as engaging as it\'s supposed to be and had a lot of unnecessary additions which made the show go into a different path from being a cooking show. Its previous seasons relied on the characters, their cooking skills, information, and knowledge about ingredients, dishes, and cooking techniques rather than introducing unrealistic and superficial types of cooking techniques that pulled the show into a never-ending abyss. This show completely changed its course from being a cooking that had competitions and a sense of rivalry that made the show interesting. The characters got lost and had no roles to perform and obviously the term called ""character development"" does not exist here. The Shokugeki no souma I liked dealt with stakes very well and gave a sense of tension whereas this season\'s stakes are very silly tbh.The animation and art style was average at best and never showed us the best side of cooking that I wanted to see. The soundtracks were not used to its full potential. This season did not feel like the Shogeki no souma that I liked.Even with all these flaws, I cannot forget the previous seasons that brought me to this final last season of Shogeki no souma. I enjoyed the journey and it was such a good ride anyway.Like everything that starts always ends, this show ends with an average season and yet makes me feel nostalgic about the time I started watching it, and that brings a great feel of closure(for me at least).

Aahhh..man...it's just so boring. I can't believe they went this route of a generic edgelord villain who shows up out of no where and is suddenly OP. Oh yeah, and there's an Atatsuki wanna-be chef group who suddenly appears too. Aaaand I don't give a damn about them. Nothing about them is interesting. Nothing Asahi (the new villain) does is intriguing. He is the definition of a bland boring villain who has absolutely no layers. You know...what I did want?More development and stories on the current cast. Soma and his friends. His dad. Erina's family. Hell, I reeeaaally like the previous Elite-10. Would've settled for that. But instead everyone gets pushed aside for this new arc that is a yawnfest. Oh yeah- forgot to mention but Soma and Erina are dumber than ever too! Everything they went through in S1-4 means nothing. Erina immediately puts her chastity and life on the line against this villian who she had no reason to. Soma becomes like...okay he was always dumb, but now he's gone beyond even Luffy stupidity.In short, I dropped it and I dont' know if I'll pick it up again. I really only want to know if Som and Erina ends up together. They had shitty chemistry throughout all of previous season, so I wanted to see if the author could work some magic and actually make them a decent couple. But it's not worth torturing myself with the terrible writing to find out when I could just do a google search if I'm really desperate. For now, it's just time to move on to something else.

Sorry Shokugeki- but this anime's finale is trash."", 'Food wars is a great series. It\'s hilarious, compelling, and has you wondering what Yukihira is planning to do next. Great rivals and a solid cast to support the main characters. However, season 4 started to show the downhill spiral food wars would go on with several inconsistencies and flawed characters.Season 4 was a great way to end off the show. Yukihira finally gets the first seat, the gang is all in the elite 10, and most characters have been well developed and have shown no signs of any other issues. Season 5 does the most unnecessary shit in where they made up some random...bullshit in which the ""plan"" to save Erina from the despair of God\'s tongue was to gather a bunch of kids with potential to join the school. As if they\'re not supposed to do that every year. You know when Yukihira makes a dish with the weird-ass combinations, and the whole crowd goes ""HUHHHHH???"". That\'s how I felt the entire season. I legit almost cried at the end because of how disappointed I was.First of all, seeing Megumi win the qualifiers shows how inconsistent the show is. Yukihira is the first seat but lost half of his Shokugekis to Takumi, and they both lost this competition to a literal fucking meatball with soup inside it. While that happened, Asahi beat Yukihiras dad, a genius chef, and Yukihira would, later on, win against Asahi. Does this mean Yukihira is one of the greatest chefs in the world? Does that also signify Takumi is on par with Yukihira too? Would that also make Megumi is one of the elites in the world? Erina\'s mom had elite chefs from all over the world try making food for her, but no one could come close except for Asahi and Yukihira. There is no way in hell they\'re that good. I just had to get off my chest how illogical the level of cooking the characters are at in this show.The BLUE competition brought up the most pathetic fucking excuse for new characters I\'ve ever seen. The main characters are still good, but these Noir guys piss me off. Asahi\'s goons are uninteresting and veer from realism into this weird kind of fantasy shit with their knives, from the chainsaw to those claws. Asahi is awful too. His motives were because he was pissed that Joichiro left him to take care of his son because his wife fucking died. Yeah, maybe he was young, but there is no way you\'re that big of a scumbag to be upset about that. He also wanted to marry Erina because he\'s the only one who can satisfy her tastebuds. My man, first of all, you\'re related by blood. Second of all, you don\'t have to marry her to cook for her. Third of all, she\'s a teenager while you\'re over 18. If I were to describe Asahi, it would be an eccentric pedophile with the consistency of Megumi as a character. I hate him.This season acts as if though nothing happened in the last few seasons. Tsukasa and Erina\'s dad took over the school. At the end of season 4 when Central and the elites lost, they suddenly had a change of heart. I don\'t understand why. ""Oh, we lost? Well, I guess I\'ll suddenly changed all my views and just carry on with life and completely interact normally with the people who shared different viewpoints from basically everybody"". Maybe I just forgot, but I don\'t remember the characters making up. Like central did some fucked up shit, but all the characters were back to normal with them as if nothing happened.It\'s also so uninteresting and forgettable. As of right now, I\'m struggling to remember what happened. I binged the first four seasons of the series in four days or so. I took three days to watch these 13 episodes because of how uninterested I was. I was also disappointed that there was no romance in this show. If there had been, it would\'ve taken the next step. I was fine with there being nothing in the last four seasons, but they should\'ve done something this season. The ending was not satisfying at all either. It\'s why I feel it needed romance. The characters had such a strong bond that we want to see them in a relationship, as it only feels right as viewers. Then the boring-ass ending where Yukihira comes back suddenly after a 6-month absence to see the characters say hi. Like give them a better relationship, and don\'t do this boring-ass bullshit. I want something I can be happy about after watching 73 episodes of this.The animation is a huge step down from the other seasons. Especially in the last few, the CGI looks so shit. But I\'ll give the animators the benefit of the doubt because I believe it was during the Covid outbreak. The music is nothing special. I don\'t remember it being good, but it wasn\'t bad either, so I\'m neutral about it.This season was just atrocious. Coming in, I knew it wouldn\'t be good. The only positive of this show was that Yukiriha was still entertaining and remains one of my favorites MCs. Besides that, it\'s an absolute shitshow. I Wouldn\'t recommend starting this season, rather only watch the first 4. bullshit in which the ""plan"" to save Erina from the despair of God\'s tongue was to gather a bunch of kids with potential to join the school. As if they\'re not supposed to do that every year. You know when Yukihira makes a dish with the weird-ass combinations, and the whole crowd goes ""HUHHHHH???"". That\'s how I felt the entire season. I legit almost cried at the end because of how disappointed I was.First of all, seeing Megumi win the qualifiers shows how inconsistent the show is. Yukihira is the first seat but lost half of his Shokugekis to Takumi, and they both lost this competition to a literal fucking meatball with soup inside it. While that happened, Asahi beat Yukihiras dad, a genius chef, and Yukihira would, later on, win against Asahi. Does this mean Yukihira is one of the greatest chefs in the world? Does that also signify Takumi is on par with Yukihira too? Would that also make Megumi is one of the elites in the world? Erina\'s mom had elite chefs from all over the world try making food for her, but no one could come close except for Asahi and Yukihira. There is no way in hell they\'re that good. I just had to get off my chest how illogical the level of cooking the characters are at in this show.The BLUE competition brought up the most pathetic fucking excuse for new characters I\'ve ever seen. The main characters are still good, but these Noir guys piss me off. Asahi\'s goons are uninteresting and veer from realism into this weird kind of fantasy shit with their knives, from the chainsaw to those claws. Asahi is awful too. His motives were because he was pissed that Joichiro left him to take care of his son because his wife fucking died. Yeah, maybe he was young, but there is no way you\'re that big of a scumbag to be upset about that. He also wanted to marry Erina because he\'s the only one who can satisfy her tastebuds. My man, first of all, you\'re related by blood. Second of all, you don\'t have to marry her to cook for her. Third of all, she\'s a teenager while you\'re over 18. If I were to describe Asahi, it would be an eccentric pedophile with the consistency of Megumi as a character. I hate him.This season acts as if though nothing happened in the last few seasons. Tsukasa and Erina\'s dad took over the school. At the end of season 4 when Central and the elites lost, they suddenly had a change of heart. I don\'t understand why. ""Oh, we lost? Well, I guess I\'ll suddenly changed all my views and just carry on with life and completely interact normally with the people who shared different viewpoints from basically everybody"". Maybe I just forgot, but I don\'t remember the characters making up. Like central did some fucked up shit, but all the characters were back to normal with them as if nothing happened.It\'s also so uninteresting and forgettable. As of right now, I\'m struggling to remember what happened. I binged the first four seasons of the series in four days or so. I took three days to watch these 13 episodes because of how uninterested I was. I was also disappointed that there was no romance in this show. If there had been, it would\'ve taken the next step. I was fine with there being nothing in the last four seasons, but they should\'ve done something this season. The ending was not satisfying at all either. It\'s why I feel it needed romance. The characters had such a strong bond that we want to see them in a relationship, as it only feels right as viewers.

I Wouldn\'t recommend starting this season, rather only watch the first 4.', ""The hype surrounding the Fifth Season of the Shokugeki No Souma series was not nearly as high in comparison to its preceding seasons. As many of the series devoted fans already knew the conclusion to the story and hence the expectation going into the series was whether or not the studio would deviate from the manga. While there were many slight changes to the over-arching story, the ending still left an unsatisfying taste to a majority of viewers. Personally, the ending did not bother me too much as it tied in loose ends and gave us more character interactions that were not featured in the...original manga. To critique the Fifth season, it's important to look at both the good and bad moments and how that affected my personal time watching it.The GOOD:- The use of the original OSTs provided viewers with a sense of nostalgia, in a way it brought me back to why I loved the series. Food Wars has always been about interactions between characters through this concept of food. The Fifth season delivered on that by providing us several great character moments between both Erina and Souma but also the series supporting cast.- The animation quality was generally consistent though of course one could not help but mention that it has dropped in comparison to its predecessors.- The flashbacks throughout the battles really showed how far the characters have come and the difficult journey that they have experienced. Again taking us back to the how the original season started. Character development for this season is plentiful not only for the main characters that we have been devoted to but also the newly introduced antagonists of the season.- Some pleasant story changes that deviated from the manga made it so that the anime felt different which was a good thing. This meant that you could not always expect what's going to happen which helped build anticipation every week.The BAD:- It felt as though I was watching every battle at an incredible speed. This was particularly disappointing as some battles concluded in the span of five minutes which made it difficult to truly digest what had happened. This is mainly attributed to the fact that the season limited itself to 13 episodes and so a lot of story was crammed in each and every episode. This fast-paced continued on for the ending episode too as the series had to tie in as many things as possible in order to conclude its story. This meant speeding up certain story elements which I felt should not have been done. For example, the final confrontation between Erina and Souma should have been its own standalone episode. By speeding up such important moments within the story, it gave less meaning and depth to the final confrontation between the two characters that basically started the series.- The BLUE ARC should have definitely come in later but of course the mangaka is already finished with the series and so it had to be adapted into the anime. The premise is in good in a sense that we get to see different styles of cooking from a variety of new characters but also from different cultures as well. Adding diversity to the series. However, due to the constraints of this tournament type of story, it meant that certain characters had to sit out. While the anime gave a reason for why some characters were not present, the Blue Tournament should have been a much bigger event involving more of the cast. Seeing as it was heavily foreshadowed in the previous seasons as well.Overall not much could be done as most of us already suspected how the story would unravel. Regardless, it has been a very enjoyable series to watch and while the fifth season is clearly the series' weakest - it is still not as bad as most people think. Definitely should give the whole series a chance even if the ending may not satisfy your true taste. original manga.

The journey was long but still overall I give the anime a 9/10, the story was somewhat lacking especially during the 13th episode, like what happened to soma's friend when he left to go overseas? Does Nakiri Erina finally say that Soma's dish was delicious? What dish did Soma made to serve Erina during the ending? Did Soma finally beat his Father Joichiro in a cooking contest? That all kinds of question popping in my head. I know that some of my questions are found in...the Le Dessert Manga, but still its not a bad idea to make an OVA incorporating the Le Dessert Manga. I just feel like there is more to the story that was not included in the anime, it was a fun journey with this anime,  it was the start of my otaku life when I first watched this anime. I just wish there was more, cause I feel like it was lacking something. Thank You for the long and fun journey, I will miss watching  this anime.

Erina agrees to something early on that makes no sense for any human...much less for her character as it's been established so far.This whole season feels like the author had to write it in a week to hit a deadline.

Now I wish I didn’t watch the show and was not a really big fan of it, cause this last season is a nightmare to food wars fan. For a really invested fan to hate a series is no silly thing.I will say I started watching Food wars when season 3 was about to air, it instantly became one of my favorite show. It was a show I suddenly started to love, the characters, the cooking were so enjoyable.What was appreciable about the show...was it had a concept which I haven’t seen in a battle shounen before, this show made cooking f-ing interesting and cool. You get hyped when someone is cooking, it’s not that common.So I will just give my rating of the previous seasons to put it out of way,Season 1 – 8.5/10 – I freaking loved it. The arcs were so good; those types of arcs were the best arcs in food wars.Season 2 – 9 / 10 – the tournament arc – this arc was successful in keeping the pressure of who wins. We saw the characters trying to grow their skills with passing time.Season 3 – 7.5 / 10 – this is the turning point of food wars, the first half was good as usual, but in the second half, they introduced a villain for the show for the first time. Even though it was enjoyable I didn’t wanted the show to go that way.Season 4 – 7/ 10 the series definitely got a little weaker this season, in terms of production and the way the plot went. The show became too serious; the fun of school life was completely gone. It’s like there is politics inside the school.Now the final season:I really hated this season, I wish it didn’t exist. Also, I am one of those who already were informed the last arc was bad, but loving the show I was like even if it was bad, I don’t think I am going to hate it? But boi I was wrong.Main problems with the BLUE arc. (SOME SPOILERS OBVIOUSLY)•\tThe whole plot of the arc was dog shit•\tThe cooking battles were so degraded. For the previous seasons, we get to see them going and doing the process of making the food, but this arc was so rushed every match ended so fast. Even the final battle ended in 5 minutes, No pressure or buildup.•\tI don’t know where the mangaka found the so-called ‘underworld’ from. The distinction he added between people of the underworld and others felt like differentiating humans and outer space aliens. It almost feels like he found out about underworld from some Reddit comments or something, it was cringe to watch when the noir chefs just look down others like they are not even the same species. Even if some people are big criminals, we can’t separate them from regular persons this much, but here it was just chefs, how different is going to make where they work.•\tThe absurd types of cooking methods and tools introduced in this arc almost made me wonder if I am watching some “underworld” version of the show.The main antagonist of this arc has a superpower. If he holds other's cooking tools he can acquire their cooking skills in an instant, his brain works that way. If this doesn’t feel like some asspull fest, I don’t know what is.•\tEnding was missing so much, the soma as a character again failed to reach his goal. The focus was given to Erina even in the final battle, I understand at that situation she had some reason to win but we can’t just forget about our MC for a sudden brought up matter.•\tThe number of characters who just got demoted to worse than side character level was large. Most of the cast was just background characters for this arc. Characters like Hayama, Ryo just got butchered, they were not given growth even though these two of three finalists in the autumn elections.• Story 3 very badWas this intended to be a meme?The BLUE arc, just one arc just completely butchered the series. It was so bad that if it was intended as a parody series from start then this arc is a 10/10.The stupid superpowers, the ridiculous cooking (like using explosives), the lack of tension and buildup, demoting so many characters to background scenery, the ridiculous concept of underworld chefs as something normal people are so different to, etc. just made up this arc.• Art and animation 7 - goodArt and animation were weak in this season compared to the first 3 seasons. It doesn’t matter anymore cause the story side was already bad.• Matches or Battles – 5 not okthe matches were so short so that the cooking sequences were just only each person using their crazy cooking tools. Many important, even the final match was so short, the characters made their food in the background just in an instant. The blue winning food was not even shown to us• Sound 8 very goodThe osts were good like always.• Character 6 fineThis arc just threw away so many characters we came to love and focused on only a few which was not even done well when we reached the end.The number of characters who just got demoted to worse than side character level was large.

It may have something to do with the fact that I've been watching this anime for a long time, and I'm used to the style so at this point it isn't exciting, but I don't think that's why. The content of this season was way too outlandish. Food Wars! has always been surreal but never ridiculous, at least not on the scale it was this season. I couldn't get excited about the...food being made or the battles going down because it was all too absurd.The overarching story of the BLUE tournament was interesting enough, and the prompts for the Shokugekis were cool. The story that developed Souma and Erina was mostly well done, and the writing was mostly supportive of the ending. It did feel a little overblown and a little convoluted, but I still enjoyed watching the characters struggle and prosper.The ending of the series itself was what I expected based on the manga's ending that got talked about when it was first published. I don't know that this season was the best thing in the world for finishing out the characters. The goals they had throughout the rest of the series kind of got lost, and a different conclusion was presented that was supposed to account for every loose end. Unfortunately, that didn't work out that well. That being said, I was fine with what happened this season, probably because I wasn't too invested in the ending. This season didn't feel like the Food Wars! we started out with, but it was still fun to hang out with the characters one last time.

Farewell to Yukihira Souma."", 'In a first time, take in consideration that SNS is my favourite shonen, but i\'ll try to be the most objective possible about this season. In a second time, sorry if i\'m making misstakes (i\'m french ^^).I will make 2 parts in this review, one without any spoilers, and a second with spoilers.NO SPOILERS :Food wars was forever for me a fantastic tale of cooking and fights endlessly, with alot of strange sounds, that you can\'t watch that show with family (or you can, nobody will judge you), so when J.C Staff made an announcement on a 5th season, I was a little undecided, the...manga has been criticized a lot in the past and therefore the author rushed the end. So when I figured out that J.C Staff was definitely going to outdo the manga, I wasn\'t disappointed.This season is a good old shokugeki, but, y\'know, the characters introduced in this season are a lot less interesting than the previous ones, but that was to be expected considering that this is the last season and they will never have the time to develop in 13 episodes, this season is only fights in a loop with a touch of romance. So for people who haven\'t seen the season yet, there is no reason to go back, but don\'t think you will see the best thing of your life, or you will be disappointed.SPOILERS :- Story : 6/10The big problem in this season, i said before that the adaptation was better than the manga, but the readers know that the hotel arc with Megumi and Soma which would have been adapted at the start of the season has been replaced by an episode at the beach which we could clearly do without since it does little to advance the plot (except when Doujima announces the Blue, but they could replaced by a lot of other possibilities).Now the Blue arc, that famous arc which has been criticized a lot because he took all the season. I must admit that this is really one of the less good arcs in SNS if you want to see the plot move forward (like me). I cant talk too much about this, this is only fights but the really good thing here is about Erina, she\'s completely trapped between her mother and Asahi, everything was calculated, she cant admit too that Soma could beat him (even she know) because she\'s worried and she understood why her mother left with her ""superpower"".And for the end, I think that >90% of the people wanted to see an Erina x Soma, and a lot of people was disappointed. But if you take care of some sentences at the end, the studio did, for example Erina said that she will not lost against Soma for a loong time (i guess i dont need to help you more nah?) and in a other side from the 2 episode of SNS S1, Joichiro is talking about ""how to be the best chef"", the fact that a chef dedicates his cooking to the person he cares about the most, and that was exactly the same with Mana/Azami.I add too that the irradiation is really TOO MUCH in this season, when it was funny in the previous seasons.Tbh, J.C Staff couldn\'t catch up for all the mistakes made by the mangaka and they somehow limited the damage.- Art : 9/10Art style change too much from the first season but this is more and more enjoyable to see and i have not too much thins to say about it.- Sound : 10/10Anime : FoodBiggest quality : OSTReally, i said before that SNS was a fantastic tale of cooking, it was more because the sound can make us travel everywhere and with a lot of GOOD SONGS HELL YEAH.Personally, with Fairy Tail, SNS is the anime with the best OST because you can listen them in every situations, if someone tells me that there will be an anime with epic musics on an food anime that make orgasms , I will have run away from this individual.(""Dish of God"" is the best OST of SNS by far, and ""Rough Diamonds ~Starry Stagiaire ver.~"" can make me travel faaar away.- Character : 8/10I really like Saiba Asahi from the first episode, i knew that he was a bad guy but if you didnt watch the manga first, the antagonist is correctly introduced with the good people. But compared to Azami, he is really mediocre in the present, compared to his backstory. (But now Azami looks like a lovely dad)Now I will talk about Erina, because i have a lot of things to say about that girl. I didn\'t really like the character in a first time, but i started to like her (c\'mon i\'m talking about the character) since the 3rd season to become my favourite character of SNS. I think that she have one of the biggest evolution  in the history of shonen (take a look on the Ep2 of the S1 and the last episode, it looks like this is not the same character) and boi, she still have her horrible personnality since the start, and that\'s why i love this.In this season Erina begins to realize more and more the problem with her divine palate and starts to panic more and more about her mother because she knows she will not be able to satisfy her and start to bet on Azami because Erina thinks that Azami is the one who can satisfy Mana, but he wants to marry Erina because she is the one who can satisfy his cook (and Asahi is playing with that, that\'s why i did this repetition).Soma, the protagonist, didn\'t change but yes, this is Soma. We can notice that Soma have also more and more affection from Erina.- Enjoyment : 8/10Then, i remembered the plot but not how it was brought. I forget some scenes who was insanes and makes me hyped after all, that\'s maybe because this is my favourite shonen?I swear that if there was a confirmed ship with a kiss/confession at the end,I will have given a better mark because it looks like they brought it since s3 for not much in the end, a bit sad but not disappointed after all.- Overall : 8/10For me it was really not the best season, but i think that is the less good, however I think that you can\'t pass by this season after all.Shokugeki No Soma was one of the iconics shonens in this last decade, the best shonen of all time for me for all the feelings that this anime given to me.Now it\'s a page that turns to discover new animes. I need to thanks all the people who worked for the project.I hope that you approved this review, i tried to be the most objective possible. I also hope that i\'m not too bad in English too, thatk you for reading this far. manga has been criticized a lot in the past and therefore the author rushed the end. So when I figured out that J.C Staff was definitely going to outdo the manga, I wasn\'t disappointed.This season is a good old shokugeki, but, y\'know, the characters introduced in this season are a lot less interesting than the previous ones, but that was to be expected considering that this is the last season and they will never have the time to develop in 13 episodes, this season is only fights in a loop with a touch of romance. So for people who haven\'t seen the season yet, there is no reason to go back, but don\'t think you will see the best thing of your life, or you will be disappointed.SPOILERS :- Story : 6/10The big problem in this season, i said before that the adaptation was better than the manga, but the readers know that the hotel arc with Megumi and Soma which would have been adapted at the start of the season has been replaced by an episode at the beach which we could clearly do without since it does little to advance the plot (except when Doujima announces the Blue, but they could replaced by a lot of other possibilities).Now the Blue arc, that famous arc which has been criticized a lot because he took all the season. I must admit that this is really one of the less good arcs in SNS if you want to see the plot move forward (like me). I cant talk too much about this, this is only fights but the really good thing here is about Erina, she\'s completely trapped between her mother and Asahi, everything was calculated, she cant admit too that Soma could beat him (even she know) because she\'s worried and she understood why her mother left with her ""superpower"".And for the end, I think that >90% of the people wanted to see an Erina x Soma, and a lot of people was disappointed. But if you take care of some sentences at the end, the studio did, for example Erina said that she will not lost against Soma for a loong time (i guess i dont need to help you more nah?) and in a other side from the 2 episode of SNS S1, Joichiro is talking about ""how to be the best chef"", the fact that a chef dedicates his cooking to the person he cares about the most, and that was exactly the same with Mana/Azami.I add too that the irradiation is really TOO MUCH in this season, when it was funny in the previous seasons.Tbh, J.C Staff couldn\'t catch up for all the mistakes made by the mangaka and they somehow limited the damage.- Art : 9/10Art style change too much from the first season but this is more and more enjoyable to see and i have not too much thins to say about it.- Sound : 10/10Anime : FoodBiggest quality : OSTReally, i said before that SNS was a fantastic tale of cooking, it was more because the sound can make us travel everywhere and with a lot of GOOD SONGS HELL YEAH.Personally, with Fairy Tail, SNS is the anime with the best OST because you can listen them in every situations, if someone tells me that there will be an anime with epic musics on an food anime that make orgasms , I will have run away from this individual.(""Dish of God"" is the best OST of SNS by far, and ""Rough Diamonds ~Starry Stagiaire ver.~"" can make me travel faaar away.- Character : 8/10I really like Saiba Asahi from the first episode, i knew that he was a bad guy but if you didnt watch the manga first, the antagonist is correctly introduced with the good people. But compared to Azami, he is really mediocre in the present, compared to his backstory. (But now Azami looks like a lovely dad)Now I will talk about Erina, because i have a lot of things to say about that girl. I didn\'t really like the character in a first time, but i started to like her (c\'mon i\'m talking about the character) since the 3rd season to become my favourite character of SNS. I think that she have one of the biggest evolution  in the history of shonen (take a look on the Ep2 of the S1 and the last episode, it looks like this is not the same character) and boi, she still have her horrible personnality since the start, and that\'s why i love this.In this season Erina begins to realize more and more the problem with her divine palate and starts to panic more and more about her mother because she knows she will not be able to satisfy her and start to bet on Azami because Erina thinks that Azami is the one who can satisfy Mana, but he wants to marry Erina because she is the one who can satisfy his cook (and Asahi is playing with that, that\'s why i did this repetition).Soma, the protagonist, didn\'t change but yes, this is Soma. We can notice that Soma have also more and more affection from Erina.- Enjoyment : 8/10Then, i remembered the plot but not how it was brought. I forget some scenes who was insanes and makes me hyped after all, that\'s maybe because this is my favourite shonen?I swear that if there was a confirmed ship with a kiss/confession at the end,I will have given a better mark because it looks like they brought it since s3 for not much in the end, a bit sad but not disappointed after all.- Overall : 8/10For me it was really not the best season, but i think that is the less good, however I think that you can\'t pass by this season after all.Shokugeki No Soma was one of the iconics shonens in this last decade, the best shonen of all time for me for all the feelings that this anime given to me.Now it\'s a page that turns to discover new animes.

All the character development that Erina has in the previous seasons, season five is in charge of erased it.She starts as some vain girl who growed up thinking that she was the best in the culinary world because of his divine tongue. Despite of that, she doesn\'t enjoy cooking, she only sticks to the recipe and nothing more. When she meets Soma, the world she known it\'s turned upside down. She starts to enjoy proving new things, and...discover that not everything has to follow the recipe and the new things comes from ""breaking"" the rules, she even challenge his own father... and all that for what?? For nothing, because in the last season she is like a puppet again.In fact, this last path introduces an antagonist UNNECESSARY that doesn\'t contributes NOTHING to the story, and comes out of NOWHERE, he weren\'t even introduced by the story before lol disastrous. discover that not everything has to follow the recipe and the new things comes from ""breaking"" the rules, she even challenge his own father... and all that for what??

A ton of the more important aspects of the show have shifted from the cooking to outside of it. Suspension of disbelief is very important in shows like these, but that can\'t make you ignore a villain that was not only shoehorned in, but also provided no real payoff after building up...his character in a very short span, albeit not fully enough to satisfy a conclusion to his personal story. An underworld gang of chefs cooking for crime seems silly outside of this show, but the thought is never considered. The only shortcoming of the antagonists is the lack of true build-up beyond ""they are bad but we are good, so we must win."" The cooking itself still delivered, though in a much faster pace that rushed through the better parts that made earlier seasons truly shine. Many events take place off screen, including the fundamental part of the show; the actual process of cooking. The final product still provided a fulfilling description of the finished dish, but the cooking that led up to it was scarce at best. This wasn\'t the only thing glossed over during this show. The results and events of many IMPORTANT cooking battles were completely skipped over and mentioned in passing later on. The story drags the season down significantly compared to the earlier seasons, especially considering this is meant to end the series. The ending in particular left a lot to be desired, but my full opinion is full of spoilers and thus will only be posted at the very end of this review (you\'ve been warned). 4/10The art (excluding the extremely mediocre opening), while some argue dropped in quality, was overall the same. The backdrops may have lost some quality, many accurately comparing them to a PowerPoint presentation (I\'m looking at you, opening), but the bread and butter of the show, the animation of the food and characters, didn\'t noticeably diminish much if at all. It\'s still the same detailed, satisfying and attractive style I\'ve come to expect from the show. 9/10The sound doesn\'t require much discussion. Most is somewhat recycled, which isn\'t terrible, since it was good to begin with. The OP and ED are forgettable, and the rest of the music remains at the same quality that is near and dear to me and the hearts of many other fans. 7/10The characters are a mixed bag. Much of the main cast takes quite a backseat for the majority of the season, leaving only Souma, Erina, Megumi, and Takumi being the only ones to receive their share of growth. This growth was unevenly distributed and seemed to vary between situations. This, however, is not very noticeable, as the cast is as endearing as ever, and most if not all fan favorites received their deserved time in the spotlight. before the show wraps up. 6/10Despite my harsh opinion of the story, I enjoyed the ride up until the end (friendly spoiler reminder that the paragraph following will discuss it with spoilers). The battles were still climactic and I was always eager to load up the next episode. I enjoyed following the characters, laughed and guffawed at the boisterous, quirky, and oddball chefs and styles. Not once until the final episode of the show did I even consider disliking what I was watching. I still highly recommend this show to any fan of Food Wars! despite any shortcomings and will forever consider the series as a whole a personal favorite. 7/10WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD :WARNINGMy initial reaction personal opinion of the final episode is as follows:So is that it? I mean up until halfway through I was hyped for the epic finale, but man, I should\'ve just quit when she tasted Souma\'s dish. I mean, Erina wins OFFSCREEN, which is some sort of recurring theme in this season, but I\'m getting ahead of myself. Everything after Asahi losing feels extremely rushed, like I\'m skimming the pages of a book or reading the Sparknotes synopsis right before a test. Nothing really feels resolved.

A lot of Shokugeki no Soma's charm is how we see Soma and his peers/friends progress through their culinary journey towards the top. There's a large cast of characters, meaning that there's a lot of variety of the types of dishes and specialties that people produce. Despite this large pool of characters, I think the show does a great job at developing and...giving personality to these characters for the limited amount of screen time that they usually get. This is in large parts the fact that the unique dishes they make are made with their unique flair and personality, so even just a single cooking match will convey their feelings to a viewer/reader.I think that the cooking matches that the characters go through are an essential part of why the anime is great, and of course, that in part also includes the preparation for the upcoming matches. I definitely enjoyed how Soma and everyone else had to research and come to their own conclusion on what to make when given a theme. There's quite a lot of deliberation that they each have to put in their ideas, and how they come up with their dishes becomes a anticipation: after working through all their ideas, how are they going to execute on them? The fact that a lot of the dishes can be made in real life and how they're quite complicated make for a great cooking  show. There's a pleasure in watching how the chefs improve upon themselves with each food challenge they're presented with. Each dish that they prepare are fun to watch because it not only shows their progress, but their character.It's true that this show has a lot of fanservice than say, Yakitate Japan, and I'm not the biggest fan, but what can you do?Of course, everything I just said was good about the show is the reason why the fifth season is so bad. There's just a bunch of random people that show up, in which you have no idea about, just trying to fight against Soma and his limited pool of friends. Not only are there so many new challengers, but you don't even get to see the old characters face off. For such a large cast of characters that have been already introduced, there's only five people you know that compete in the blue competition. This was already a bad move, but the food challenges are rushed. There was always a lot of deliberation when it came to the food challenges and competitions that the characters go through, but there's not any of that present in the fifth season. You don't see any brainstorming, preparation of dishes, and self improvement. You kind of just see random dishes that get briefly explained, if any at all. I don't really feel invested in these dishes because I don't know how these characters came up with it, and I sure as hell don't know many of them. Plus, there's the supernatural aspect where the dishes they make are not able to be done in real life.Animation is noticeably worse, and there's a lot of seconds where it's basically still frames or they lack background. The food presentation also takes a hit, and the reactions as well. Everything is rushed, random characters are introduced, I don't really see the cooking process, animation worsens, etc. Plot is terrible as well.Shokugeki no Soma already had pretty bad plot, with Central arc and all, but this takes it up to another level. I won't talk about it that much, but it follows every cliche possible and doesn't even do it in a satisfying manner.However, overall, it's ok. Taking into factor the good earlier seasons, I still think it's worth a watch.

They took an anime from a manga that the author legit gave up on and did an anime-only ending that was good enough to an extent.Story:The story was magnificent for every single season besides this one. in this season it seemed as if there were no other characters besides Yukihira, Asahi, and Erina which makes the plot a little one dimensional. There was a clear goal for this season of food wars and it was for Yukihira to win BLUE, but as soon as they got to the final...battle winner takes all the climax of the entire season. They just flat out ruined it. They took a battle which should have been one of the best of the series and just didn't do it. There was no suspense on who would win and no cooking montage. But instead, they put a very food wars twist on the climax and made it a funny and jokey scene that honestly was fine with me. All the battles weren't enjoyable at all and quite frankly they were jokes besides the team-up battle and the semi-finals.Art:What can I say, there won't ever be another anime that makes me want to eat my screen as much as food wars did. A personal preference thing I had was the fact that I just didn't like the way some of the characters looked this season. Like Yukihira and Erina looked off-putting, but that is just a personal thing and I know they were supposed to look like they were older. Now animation-wise there was just something off about it that I couldn't quite grasp. I never could figure out what was so wrong.Sound:No complaints here. Every song they used shot a wave of nostalgia through my entire body like the slowed-down OP 1 they used at the end of episode 13. Of course, the cooking noises were on point. The foodgasms sounded as great as ever.Characters:Oh boy, where did I start? It felt as if they removed 95% of the cast that we all knew and loved for the last 5 years and replaced them with the main antagonist and a bunch of forgettable villains who have no other personality trait besides loving Asahi. I missed Alice and Kurokiba's shenanigans and the entirety of the Polar Star Dormitory. Why build up so many characters just to leave them behind?Enjoyment:Not going to lie to you guys. I'm extremely biased towards this anime. As it is my first ever anime that I sat through all 5 years watching so I grew up with it.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT:That being said I won't give it a 10 for enjoyment because of two main reasons. Yukihira never beats his dad and Erina never said his cooking was delicious. That is again a personal thing. NO MORE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT.Conclusion:All in all yes the ending isn't what we all hoped for, but nonetheless, it was a semi-satisfying way to end a really good series. The fights this season may have been absolute garbage and they may have thrown almost 95% of the loveable cast away.

But that still doesn't undermine the fact of how satisfying it was to finish the series. It made me reminisce of the years I spent watching it. It is like a satisfying ending that leaves a hole in you heart, yearning for more, yet knowing you won't receive it. But it leaves you with a heartwarming feeling of sadness and bliss. The series may have serious predictability problems, but the story is so so so good. Just empty your mind and enjoy the story instead of nitpicking on how predictable it is, take in the story, absorb the characters. End the...series on a positive note ;) series on a positive note ;)"", 'Overall: 6.8 / 10Unfortunately, we arrive at the last saga of this beautiful work, but with a satisfactory ending by the J.C. STAFF who did a good job implemented an ""original"" epilogue that matches quite well for its closure.Regarding the season in general, I have felt quite disappointed in a certain way, since in terms of the decline of the story and its development it has been announced with a plot that although it serves to finish tying up some more ends to the story, either It ends up being completely consistent and contributing much more than its prequel, in addition to losing that essence...when preparing culinary competitions or preparing the same dishes that gave a good bonus to the work.On the characters side it is similar, we have new members like the ""Noir"" with the same Asahi, but all this cast is used only to create an atmosphere of drama in the story, but the reality is that most of them are too flat and superficial. Perhaps what hurts me the most is that they show relatively little of Asahi\'s childhood and growth. At the same time, the same happens with characters that are no longer on the scene, such as Tamako (Souma\'s mother) who never just developed that childhood and mourning for both Souma and his father, which was a great emphasis to create a good ""feeling"" they waste it on the viewer.In short, I consider that it ends up being a fairly regular adaptation but with the plus of being the last installment and with that Happy end it masks a little more the shortcomings of the program.In Total quickly reviewing its seasons, I would dare to say that it is an anime that begins from highest to lowest in quality, but that despite everything continues to maintain that entertainment about the dishes and the kitchen that pushes you to continue watching it (and the shipeo of Erina x Souma of course this :p)..En Español:General: 6,8 / 10Llegamos a la ultima saga de esta linda obra lamentablemente, pero con un final satisfactorio por parte del estudio J.C. STAFF que hizo un buen trabajo implemento un epilogo ""original"" que concuerda bastante bien para su cierre.En cuanto a la temporada en general me eh sentido bastante decepcionado en cierta forma, ya que en cuanto al decaimiento de la historia y su desarrollo ah sido anunciado con una trama que si bien sirve para terminar de atar algunos cabos mas a la historia, tampoco acaba siendo del todo consistente y que aporte mucho mas que su precuela, además de perder esa esencia a la hora de la preparación de las competencias culinarias o la elaboración de los mismos platos que daban un buen plus a la obra.Ya por el lado personajes es similar, tenemos nuevos integrantes como los ""Noir"" con el mismo Asahi, pero todo este elenco no se utiliza mas que para crear un ambiente de drama en la historia, pero la realidad es que en su mayoría son demasiado planos y superficiales. Tal vez lo que mas me duela es que muestran relativamente poco de como fue la infancia de Asahi y su crecimiento. A la vez esto mismo pasa con personajes que ya no están en escena como Tamako (la mama de Souma) que nunca acaba de desarrollarse esa infancia y duelo tanto de Souma como de su padre que era un gran hincapié para crear un buen ""feeling"" en el espectador e lo desperdician.En fin considero que acaba siendo una adaptación bastante regular pero con el plus de ser la ultima entrega y con ese Happy end enmascara un poco mas las falencias del programa.En Total repasando rápidamente sus temporadas me atrevería a decir que es un anime que comienza de mayor a menor en calidad, pero que a pesar de todo sigue manteniendo ese entretenimiento sobre los platos y la cocina que te empuja a seguir viéndolo (y el shipeo de Erina x Souma claro esta :p ). when preparing culinary competitions or preparing the same dishes that gave a good bonus to the work.On the characters side it is similar, we have new members like the ""Noir"" with the same Asahi, but all this cast is used only to create an atmosphere of drama in the story, but the reality is that most of them are too flat and superficial. Perhaps what hurts me the most is that they show relatively little of Asahi\'s childhood and growth. At the same time, the same happens with characters that are no longer on the scene, such as Tamako (Souma\'s mother) who never just developed that childhood and mourning for both Souma and his father, which was a great emphasis to create a good ""feeling"" they waste it on the viewer.In short, I consider that it ends up being a fairly regular adaptation but with the plus of being the last installment and with that Happy end it masks a little more the shortcomings of the program.In Total quickly reviewing its seasons, I would dare to say that it is an anime that begins from highest to lowest in quality, but that despite everything continues to maintain that entertainment about the dishes and the kitchen that pushes you to continue watching it (and the shipeo of Erina x Souma of course this :p)..En Español:General: 6,8 / 10Llegamos a la ultima saga de esta linda obra lamentablemente, pero con un final satisfactorio por parte del estudio J.C. STAFF que hizo un buen trabajo implemento un epilogo ""original"" que concuerda bastante bien para su cierre.En cuanto a la temporada en general me eh sentido bastante decepcionado en cierta forma, ya que en cuanto al decaimiento de la historia y su desarrollo ah sido anunciado con una trama que si bien sirve para terminar de atar algunos cabos mas a la historia, tampoco acaba siendo del todo consistente y que aporte mucho mas que su precuela, además de perder esa esencia a la hora de la preparación de las competencias culinarias o la elaboración de los mismos platos que daban un buen plus a la obra.Ya por el lado personajes es similar, tenemos nuevos integrantes como los ""Noir"" con el mismo Asahi, pero todo este elenco no se utiliza mas que para crear un ambiente de drama en la historia, pero la realidad es que en su mayoría son demasiado planos y superficiales. Tal vez lo que mas me duela es que muestran relativamente poco de como fue la infancia de Asahi y su crecimiento. A la vez esto mismo pasa con personajes que ya no están en escena como Tamako (la mama de Souma) que nunca acaba de desarrollarse esa infancia y duelo tanto de Souma como de su padre que era un gran hincapié para crear un buen ""feeling"" en el espectador e lo desperdician.En fin considero que acaba siendo una adaptación bastante regular pero con el plus de ser la ultima entrega y con ese Happy end enmascara un poco mas las falencias del programa.En Total repasando rápidamente sus temporadas me atrevería a decir que es un anime que comienza de mayor a menor en calidad, pero que a pesar de todo sigue manteniendo ese entretenimiento sobre los platos y la cocina que te empuja a seguir viéndolo (y el shipeo de Erina x Souma claro esta :p ).', 'As someone on Crunchyroll commented, ""This whole season is the embodiment of why"". It\'s not that its horrible or unwatchable, it\'s just incredibly outlandish yet extremely bland at the same time. This season reeks of generic OP villains and almost every shokugeki can be predicted in the first two minutes. It\'s a disappointing departure from what was the fun, dorm-life, tournament-filled first and second seasons. This season focuses on Megumi, Takumi, and Yukihira which is a good trio but it\'s sad to see the other Polar Star students get cast aside for more than half the season so far.Shokugeki no Soma: The Fifth Plate...isn\'t inherently bad, it\'s just not what I was expecting from the fifth and final season of what used to be a great anime. isn\'t inherently bad, it\'s just not what I was expecting from the fifth and final season of what used to be a great anime.', ""As a reader of the Shokugeki manga a year ago, I'm not surprised that the anime would end like this. Judging from the first 3 seasons of SNS, this is comparatively worse, especially because it's obvious how rushed the story is, especially in S5. The pacing in previous seasons was OK and kind of hype-worthy. Any previous competition is better than BLUE, and that shows that SNS has been slowly butchered since Azami took over during the events of S3 and the introduction of Asahi.So, my final ranking for Shokugeki no Souma the anime:S2 > S3 (part1) > S1 > S3 (part 2) >...S4 > S5Series overall is 8-8,5.As much as the ending was butchered, it will still have a special place in my heart as one of my first anime and because of Nakiri Erina.Thank you Asahi, I hate you for ruining the entire plot.

Case in point Erina\'s main goal for winning BLUE which is in contrast to her in Totsuki arc right down to her methods and personality taken in this arc.Though LA will say this is again an Erina-centric arc once again with her taking centre stage even though she\'s technically awy for about half of the anime. But nonetheless Souma, Megumi and the rest of the new Elite Ten does have bit parts with Souma being in a more narrative focus role as protagonist this time. As for villains, we have Asahi as our main villain and he affects BOTH Souma and Erina in this arc, with Asahi being a former student of Souma\'s father and even beating his father, all the while he\'s the biggest threat to Erina in the tournament as well his own goals of culinary domination concerning Erina. Though LA sees Asahi as a step down from Erina\'s father from the previous season, his ""main culinary power"" is something that outshines Subaru\'s culinary mimicry to the point of absurdity. Nonetheless though the anime has some scattershot focus towards it\'s characters (mainly Souma and Erina), it is one part due to the weird tournament rules that caused that to happen.The animation from JC Staff is back and thankfully reduced it\'s panning shots once again but still noticeable sometimes. Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara\'s animation does have some odd derps here and there with it\'s quality but it\'s ""expected animation"" for Souma by this point and at least the food animation was and is still great to look at to amazing detail.The voice cast is back and really the only new addition to the Souma cast would be Jun Fukuyama who does a decent job as the smug snake like character of Asahi. Nonetheless Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara\'s voice cast is more or less back and overall..decent voice cast with the MVP easily going Hisako Kanemoto for her wide range of emotions throughout this arc.What LA have found out due to the shift in the cooking in this season is that due to many of the writers and staff for Shokugeki no Souma went on pregnancy leave and JUMP wanting one more arc to round off Souma, coupled together with the author needing to rush things, caused the anime to rush things with their battles even more apparent now more than ever and the cooking has focused on cooking styles over cooking techniques. LA can see it but the bigger question would be does the shift in this make this season better than the previous season finale or this one?, well for LA the previous season\'s finale was a GREAT finale and rounding things up, however this seaosn\'s ending and what it wanted to focus more on Erina was a nice touch as well as stitching how everything came to be for Erina was also good in this regard. Overall in comparison to previous season\'s finale and this seaosn\'s finale...the previous season\'s finale was GREAT, this season was GREAT...for Erina.So, what does LA think about this season?, it\'s not bad especially for Erina fans, but does LA find this season superfluous?, ehh not really either as LA said, this season gave MUCH more development to Erina more than anything in a similar method from the previous season did. LA liked Totsuki-hen\'s finale, this isn\'t.....that bad either.Meh?...nah more like this season\'s dish gave off a nice tangy finale with a rushed-like different style of dish from Totsuki\'s more meaty dish, not horrible just a good lasting after-taste. when they go throughout the anime, be it the main cast\'s camaraderie or internal character development or regression for the plot in order to do so.

After reading the manga and knowing how bad this arc is, I was skeptical of watching this season and for the right reasons. The first 5 episodes proved me right and it turned out to be one of the worst starts to any season. The pacing was not fast tbh, it was just like this in the manga. It is not the studio's fault. If you think the pacing is fast, it is because of the author, not the studio. Anyway, after coming to episode 6, you see glimpses of improvement. By episode 10, which...I just watched yesterday, this anime has made an epic comeback. The last 5 episodes have been AMAZING! They made the anime sooooo much better than the manga you have no idea. I got chills in the previous episode as the victor between Asahi and Soma was left on a cliffhanger. Overall, I would give it an 8/10 just because of the previous 5 episodes. It was at 4 in the start for me but it really has become amazing again. Just hoping for a change in the anime ending compared to the manga ending. Want a different winner since the winner in the manga didn't make sense. They shouldn't have won. I just watched yesterday, this anime has made an epic comeback.

When I’m still new to this concept, the amazing animation of the food as well as the creativity behind the reactions were refreshing to watch.However, during the first season I have noticed how quickly I found the constant explanation of the way the character made the food to be extremely irrelevant and boring. I’m no food aficionado, so most of these talking made no sense to me....I tolerated this for a while, but starting from the 3rd season I found myself spamming my forward key to skip over the explanations. It’s sad that I’m aware of the amount of research that the creators put into this show, but I just can’t help not giving a dime. At season 4 I pretty much only watch for the plot, and the food didn’t look that appealing anymore.Even worse, the story was a textbook shounen, which made the outcomes of 90% of the shokugeki predictable. Like for season 4 I pretty much predicted the outcome of every single match. I did find Soma to be fun and interesting, but he, like other characters in the show, weren’t that special.And then season 5 had some attempts to spice up the predictability of the show, but in the end it ended up being even worse than the previous seasons due to wasting its potential with a bland villain that’s bo different from other previous villains.Overall, people seem to like this show, but honestly I’m so glad that this repeated food stuff finally ended.1st plate: 7/102nd plate: 7.5/103rd plate part 1: 6/10  part 2: 6.5/104th plate: 6.5/105th plate: 4.5/10Overall: 6/10 I tolerated this for a while, but starting from the 3rd season I found myself spamming my forward key to skip over the explanations.

I came to know and like the characters, even the ones that maybe got the shaft in the development department as time went on, but even still. I think the fourth season would\'ve ended things the right way and season five does much to undo it. Sure, the basics are all still there, but it just feels like the fifth season was empty calories, to use a food analogy. Everything feels just so stretched out and aimless. I can\'t really point to anything specific other than a general feeling as I watched it that, ""this...has run its course"". I still loved everyone, but the fact that the story starts to feel contrived and stretched as well as the unsatisfying ending, I can\'t rate the fifth season as highly as I did the previous four. has run its course"".

If you are looking for an anime with a great plot, character development or a stunning romance this isn't it, but if you just want to watch a fun food porn anime you're at the right address.there are going to be some spoilers so be aware:first of all, I don't agree with everyone on how 'shit' this anime was. Let me firstly...clear one thing up. I'm not saying I liked Noir being added tot the anime, in fact the anime would've been so much better off if they just would've added something else then Noir, it was just plain shit. They didn't have a good motive, characters were garbage, and overall just garbage No underworld chef even cooks with a chainsaw or with exploding ovens it just was so dumb to even look at. And I believe 99% of people who saw this season will agree with me on that. The story also didn't make sense. After BLUE they suddenly tell stories about the illegaal goods, like i didn't even care anymore don't waste time on the last episode on these bullshit stories and just make a good ending how hard is it.Second of all, I don't know if people will agree with me on this one and I don't know if anyone's even gonna read this review, but here's one thing that really bothers me (with more anime btw). I really would've loved to see a future soma and Nakiri together, or even just a kiss. It would've made the ending so much better. Just a little more emotion, maybe a secret love rivalry between Nikumi, Nakiri and Megumi. Not in a harem way of course but to twist it up a little. I understand that this isn't the kind of anime you need to watch if you want such a story, but I believe there was a lot of potential there. Also, they could've made something way better out of the whole Asahi Saiba is the son of Azami thing. Like a kind of small drama thing. But again, this isn't the anime for that. But if they would've let the Noir bullshit thing go there'd be a lot of screen time left for other thing such as one of the ideas I just mentioned. but yeah overall I liked the anime as it brought me joy, but for me I would've liked more romance between soma and Nakiri, and less bullshit like Noir. clear one thing up.

Back then I didn't do a review, but decided once and for all to put my thoughts on paper. While this review, and the score I've given, is for the last season, being the finale of the series means that I'll be talking about the series as a whole in this review and my experience with it.It all started many years ago, in 2017. I’m not sure how, but I’ve heard about this Shonen about cooking competitions. Back then I wasn’t that much into cooking, since then I’ve watched some Masterchef...seasons, but nothing more than that. Yet, when I watched Shokugeki no Souma I was pleasantly surprised. The show made every cooking competition an epic battle full of action and it was a lot of fun to watch.The characters, while nothing too special, are a fun cast to follow through the seasons as they progress in their studies and hone their abilities, each and every one of them with different styles, techniques and personalities. As far as story goes, it has always been over the top. A gastronomy school where you can bet anything, including expelling, on a cooking contest? That’s nuts. But I don’t think anyone here would disagree that we can, and have, accepted weirder for the sake of entertainment.One of the main problems with Shokugeki no Souma is the lack of stakes. When you can put averything on the line, it becomes obvious that the protagonist won’t lose. That’s not a problem that’s exclusive for Shokugeki no Souma, tho, after all, do you really think Naruto would ever die in the middle of the series? He can’t die, without Naruto there’s no, well, NARUTO. The way to avoid this problem is to put side characters into danger and make the viewer fear for them, not for the protagonist. To be fair tho, Shokugeki no Souma managed to avoid this issue by having way more grounded situations, where the bets weren’t that big and the win far from guaranteed.The focus of the show has to be on the cooking. While not always realistic, the way they explain the ingredients, techniques, preparations and how everything comes together to make something bigger than the sum of its parts makes you believe that you could potentially try to replicate those recipes yourself. Even if the result is predictable, the curiosity to see what they will cook next is enough to make you keep watching.So, with all of that said, what happened? I adored this show, with Stagiare, at the end of Ni no Sara (Season 2), being, in my opinion, the high point of the series. From there, it only went downhill. As the series progressed, stakes got higher and, as such, the story got predictable. If the protagonist can’t lose, then the protagonist won’t lose.That leads me to the second problem, what a like to call the “Naruto effect”. As the series goes on, Souma becomes more and more the spotlight of the series, being the one to save everyone when things get rough, and when you finally think a side character will have its time to shine, it doesn’t come through. I really wanted to see more of some characters.The story as a whole became just too surreal. Like I said, it has always been over the top, but it becomes more and more ridiculous as time goes on, to the point where is hard to take anything serious.Finally, the cooking fights became rushed and dumbed down. We no longer had detailed explanations of ingredients, techniques and such, instead the characters cooked and the side-characters spend a whole bunch of time repeating the same lines over and over to show how good the dish was. With that, the fights became boring and uninteresting. I no longer wanted to see the next dish they would come up with.All of that is reflected on the score each season received. As of the moment of writing the user scores went, chronologically, 8.28, 8.19, 8.12, 8.06, 7.76 and 7.34, with a noticeable drop at Shin no Sara (Season 4) and Gou no Sara (Season 5). Season 5 in particular highlights everything that went wrong with the series. Character making ridiculous bets, minutes from each episode focused on repetitive character reactions and ecchi scenes, and a story that’s predictable from beginning to end.Overall, Shokugeki no Souma is a series I will always remember as a series that I loved, with 2 incredibly good seasons at the beginning, but also as the series that disappointed me with its final ones. It’s hard for me to recommend Shokugeki no Souma to new viewers knowing how it ended up, even if I know the first 2 seasons are amazing. With that said, Gou na Sara is a disappointment in so many ways and a horrible ending to what could have been a great series otherwise. seasons, but nothing more than that. Yet, when I watched Shokugeki no Souma I was pleasantly surprised. The show made every cooking competition an epic battle full of action and it was a lot of fun to watch.The characters, while nothing too special, are a fun cast to follow through the seasons as they progress in their studies and hone their abilities, each and every one of them with different styles, techniques and personalities. As far as story goes, it has always been over the top. A gastronomy school where you can bet anything, including expelling, on a cooking contest? That’s nuts. But I don’t think anyone here would disagree that we can, and have, accepted weirder for the sake of entertainment.One of the main problems with Shokugeki no Souma is the lack of stakes. When you can put averything on the line, it becomes obvious that the protagonist won’t lose. That’s not a problem that’s exclusive for Shokugeki no Souma, tho, after all, do you really think Naruto would ever die in the middle of the series? He can’t die, without Naruto there’s no, well, NARUTO. The way to avoid this problem is to put side characters into danger and make the viewer fear for them, not for the protagonist. To be fair tho, Shokugeki no Souma managed to avoid this issue by having way more grounded situations, where the bets weren’t that big and the win far from guaranteed.The focus of the show has to be on the cooking. While not always realistic, the way they explain the ingredients, techniques, preparations and how everything comes together to make something bigger than the sum of its parts makes you believe that you could potentially try to replicate those recipes yourself. Even if the result is predictable, the curiosity to see what they will cook next is enough to make you keep watching.So, with all of that said, what happened? I adored this show, with Stagiare, at the end of Ni no Sara (Season 2), being, in my opinion, the high point of the series. From there, it only went downhill. As the series progressed, stakes got higher and, as such, the story got predictable. If the protagonist can’t lose, then the protagonist won’t lose.That leads me to the second problem, what a like to call the “Naruto effect”. As the series goes on, Souma becomes more and more the spotlight of the series, being the one to save everyone when things get rough, and when you finally think a side character will have its time to shine, it doesn’t come through. I really wanted to see more of some characters.The story as a whole became just too surreal. Like I said, it has always been over the top, but it becomes more and more ridiculous as time goes on, to the point where is hard to take anything serious.Finally, the cooking fights became rushed and dumbed down. We no longer had detailed explanations of ingredients, techniques and such, instead the characters cooked and the side-characters spend a whole bunch of time repeating the same lines over and over to show how good the dish was. With that, the fights became boring and uninteresting. I no longer wanted to see the next dish they would come up with.All of that is reflected on the score each season received.

It started okay but as more of it came out it just ended poorly. After watching this show for years and reading all the manga, I can say that it's a let down. The ending at least was done a little better in the anime than the manga were they don't go over what the side characters did during Soma competing while the anime did. The ending was all over the place and left on a cliffhanger basically. I want a sequel manga were it's Soma older and maybe him dating Erina or something IDK but all...in all it was okay but ending was bad. in all it was okay but ending was bad."", ""Definitely the worst season.First 2 seasons were actually interesting, though I didn't like that much ecchi it had. Still it was something fresh and new.This season just shows that you can't keep such show alive. You just can't. They juiced the entire concept to the last drop and honestly? It seems like a repetetive show.In first 2 seasons you actually had food you could even cook at home. It had some common sense, it was partially funny and concept was amazing. As anime has been progressing, at was worse and worse until we got this season, which, I believe, is for many people just not...watchable.My positive points here are simply for good animation, art and music. But sorry, that's all. I think if anime ended sooner, it could be better ending. Even previous season would be probably enough as ending season. This is just a perfect material to destroy vibe from that anime. watchable.My positive points here are simply for good animation, art and music. But sorry, that's all.

Blood injections???? Claws??? What in the world man......

Also I really enjoyed food wars overall because it was a food anime and there aren't a lot of food anime only...based off food so I liked it besides the last season I just have mixed feelings about it, it was way to sudden on the last season in my opinion and the polar star dorm characters such as Marui didn't have a lot of screen time.

She will like give her as a prize for winning competition ?It's kinda bad twisted. Stupid plot with idiotic premise.She is not even close to her daughter and now she can decide that she will marry that man who wants her if he wins competition ?

I remembered when I watched those first 4 seasons, it always made me laugh and smile and the food always made me hungry and curious to try, and I remembered every time Yukihira was finished cooking I would always smile when he says ""Osomatsu"" or something like that. I remembered when the show was good and was equally about the food and about the characters.Unfortunately, this season was NOT like that.**SEMI-SPOILERS BELOW**From the very first episode, we were greeted with a new guy named...""Suzuki"" and it was obvious that he has something planned up on his sleeve, we would later find out that this guy is Saiba Asahi. A leader of the Noir. Now, I actually find the Noir to be an interesting bunch, especially the trio of Asahi, Sarge, and Don Kalma, HOWEVER; I can\'t say I was completely attached to them simply because they were not given ENOUGH screen time. At most Sarge was only given 2-3 episodes to shine, and Don Kalma was only given one episode to show what he was capable of. Asahi was given more screen time than the two but not enough to actually make me attach to him. Now let me also talk about Erina-sama. I actually liked Erina during the first four seasons, ESPECIALLY during seasons 3 and 4 where I found her to have a great character development. Unfortunately, this season threw all the development out the window. The Erina we see here is a heartless and whiny girl and it honestly made watching her unbearable for me. The introduction of her mother SHOULD have also been good but really we don\'t even get to know a lot about her sans the last 2 episodes. And can we also talk about Takumi Aldini? This show honestly continues to do him dirty. I want to root for the guy but he always gets treated as a side character and I feel like he never actually grows from his position. I also wanna say with all my heart that Yukihira had  great character development this season, but nah. I don\'t think he developed that much either.Regardless, what I disliked the most about this season was really the story. I felt like the story\'s pacing was COMPLETELY OFF. I think the fact that this season only had 13 episodes DID NOT HELP AT ALL. There were episodes were I felt like everything was rushed and honestly there were a bunch of episodes that I thought only took up space. The story also lacked what I loved about the first four seasons which were about the food. I mean the show IS called Food Wars. I felt like this season focused heavily on the drama surrounding Asahi and I am completely sorry to say that they were not able to pull it off. By the time this show ended, I felt nothing. Maybe a sense of nostalgia but I felt like none of the characters developed at all.Honestly, if I were to say it, the season 4 finale would have been a better series finale. Nonetheless, Osomatsu!

It wrapped up everything as nicely as it could and it was a fun time watching it even if the exaggerations became 10x more than usual.If there was anything I could wish for the season it would be that fact that they could have fleshed out some of the battles better or given more spotlights to the other...characters doing side work not related to the tournament. characters doing side work not related to the tournament.', ""The perfect way to throw away an animeFights, characters and plot in general developed very quickly.

The antagonist has made an appearance out of nowhere....Basically, nothing feels right, and the fast pace of the whole season adds to the problem and makes the experience worse.I wanted to enjoy the series but the whole vibe is off!

But to speak to this season specifically, while I don\'t think it is as good as some of the previous ones and the overall cooking aspect seemed to take a backseat to plot sometimes, it was still a very much enjoyable watch.I\'ve been watching this series ever since it started. Right around that time I was just getting into cooking and watching this show really helped push me further into the world of cooking. I can\'t quite place a finger on what exactly it was, but between trying...out recipes I saw on the show, using or adapting cooking techniques they showcased, or just adopting the mentality towards cooking it promoted, I have a large part of my love for cooking owed to this series.It is by no means a flawless show and it did have its dips here and.

I felt there was a lot less cooking matches this season compared to the ones in the past. The ending in terms of the BLUE was decent, a good way to end it. The ending scene back at the diner is why I really loved this season finale, It just hits you with nostalgia.

Since 2017 I have been stuck watching Food Wars, and now, with the final season, I am free. I realized about three seasons in that the show was not so much good as mediocre, and downright bad around Season 3, but I have that gene where if I start something and get well through it, I should finish it. COVID only delayed my ability to be free from this series when the season was moved to summer, but at last, I am finally free of Food Wars, and you know what?This season wasn't that bad. It's definitely not good, don't...get me wrong, but from what everyone had been saying, I expected much more of a shitstorm compared to what was actually presented to me. In fact, I enjoyed this season much more than the third season, as the latter half of that season was just a very boring, drawn-out tournament arc that had nothing spliced in between. But this season wasn't just a mere tournament arc. It brought in new characters, expanded on character backstories, and brought the series to an end. It was still mediocre, but it was refreshing to watch the different themed tournaments after I sat through the last season where I swear to God I watched the same show-off every episode. At least there was some variety in here.That being said, Food Wars is just...okay. I started to realize that the more I got into anime, and while I will still have fond memories watching the first season curled up in my bed during Christmastime three years ago, this season definitely helped solidify the fact that Food Wars is mediocre at best. I felt that as the seasons progressed (and this one was no exception) that many characters began to fade in the background and that the entire plot of the show became all the ways that Soma could suddenly twist a battle around at the last minute and win (like he always does).While I don't think any of Food Wars' seasons were spectacular, at least the first few introduced us to a plethora of fun characters. We got backstories, development, and heartfelt interactions between characters, as well as much more high-stake battles. Soma is not a perfect chef in earlier seasons. He struggles and has to work hard to perfect his culinary skills. By the time we get to this season, he never loses a battle, and it's boring to watch knowing that the outcome will be the same every time. No one is absolutely perfect, even with practice. Many of the characters we got to know and love in the Polar Star dorm became very minor background characters by this season, which was a shame, since they were so integral to earlier seasons. I am thankful Erina still gets the spotlight, as she is my favorite character from the show, but I can admit her arc was weak this season and that she loses some of the ferocity she once possessed in earlier seasons.So, no, I didn't hate this season as much as I expected. I hated last season much more. But having delved entirely into the world of Food Wars, I can say that the show is just...meh. I don't really recommend it, and i found the story got progressively worse as time went on. Maybe just stick to the first two seasons and give it a rest if you really have an inkling to watch it. I know that finishing this last season was more of a relief that I was finally freed from this franchise rather than a joy to see a series I once loved come to its completion. get me wrong, but from what everyone had been saying, I expected much more of a shitstorm compared to what was actually presented to me.

But this season wasn't just a mere tournament arc. It brought in new characters, expanded on character backstories, and brought the series to an end. It was still mediocre, but it was refreshing to watch the different themed tournaments after I sat through the last season where I swear to God I watched the same show-off every episode. At least there was some variety in here.That being said, Food Wars is just...okay. I started to realize that the more I got into anime, and while I will still have fond memories watching the first season curled up in my bed during Christmastime three years ago, this season definitely helped solidify the fact that Food Wars is mediocre at best. I felt that as the seasons progressed (and this one was no exception) that many characters began to fade in the background and that the entire plot of the show became all the ways that Soma could suddenly twist a battle around at the last minute and win (like he always does).While I don't think any of Food Wars' seasons were spectacular, at least the first few introduced us to a plethora of fun characters. We got backstories, development, and heartfelt interactions between characters, as well as much more high-stake battles. Soma is not a perfect chef in earlier seasons. He struggles and has to work hard to perfect his culinary skills. By the time we get to this season, he never loses a battle, and it's boring to watch knowing that the outcome will be the same every time. No one is absolutely perfect, even with practice. Many of the characters we got to know and love in the Polar Star dorm became very minor background characters by this season, which was a shame, since they were so integral to earlier seasons. I am thankful Erina still gets the spotlight, as she is my favorite character from the show, but I can admit her arc was weak this season and that she loses some of the ferocity she once possessed in earlier seasons.So, no, I didn't hate this season as much as I expected. I hated last season much more. But having delved entirely into the world of Food Wars, I can say that the show is just...meh. I don't really recommend it, and i found the story got progressively worse as time went on. Maybe just stick to the first two seasons and give it a rest if you really have an inkling to watch it. I know that finishing this last season was more of a relief that I was finally freed from this franchise rather than a joy to see a series I once loved come to its completion."", 'you know there\'s a reason why this show was one of the best ones i\'ve seen it was for 2 reason 1 expect the unexpected and 2 a steady characters development but after season 3 i think this show lost its touch it became very predictable and everything else got pushed back and only focused on 1 subject "" cooking "" .this weren\'t a bad thing if those matches were good no i\'m not talking about all those exciting matches that we used to get in the first 3 seasons but more like very predictable boring matches to the point i started giving the end...results before the end of them and this started to telling me one thing .this author ran out of ideas and started repeating himself with every Arc ( thats not a good thing ) i started to feel bored and started to skip a bit between matches to the end results because they were very clear very predictable and then this season came and not only kept this tone but brought the one thing i hate the most with it .using the main heroine to push the plot further is the most thing i hate in those kind of Animes because that\'s a clear hint about the author saying "" i have no clue where i have to go from this point so let me use this cliché tactic "" i felt like i\'m sitting and watching a Shoujo Anime good luck going through all that in a whole season .like dude what are you doing ?! your manga isn\'t Shoujo - isn\'t romance and for sure isn\'t about teenagers drama your manga is clear and simple it\'s about cooking focus on that if i want to see an Anime or read a manga about that crap i would go there and not come here .. sigh .overall this season was about unwanted drama - very predictable and boring matches and overall lost its main Theme completely after this im not even sure if i even want another season just end this already with just a movie to wrap things up and be done with it so a 5/10 is very generous in my opinion . results before the end of them and this started to telling me one thing .this author ran out of ideas and started repeating himself with every Arc ( thats not a good thing ) i started to feel bored and started to skip a bit between matches to the end results because they were very clear very predictable and then this season came and not only kept this tone but brought the one thing i hate the most with it .using the main heroine to push the plot further is the most thing i hate in those kind of Animes because that\'s a clear hint about the author saying "" i have no clue where i have to go from this point so let me use this cliché tactic "" i felt like i\'m sitting and watching a Shoujo Anime good luck going through all that in a whole season .like dude what are you doing ?! your manga isn\'t Shoujo - isn\'t romance and for sure isn\'t about teenagers drama your manga is clear and simple it\'s about cooking focus on that if i want to see an Anime or read a manga about that crap i would go there and not come here .. sigh .overall this season was about unwanted drama - very predictable and boring matches and overall lost its main Theme completely after this im not even sure if i even want another season just end this already with just a movie to wrap things up and be done with it so a 5/10 is very generous in my opinion .', ""so personally I liked itI don't know why some don't like asahi either.I think it's a shame that season 5 was so short and there is no longer any asahi content.i also loved the story of erina's mother and scenes from the past like souma's mother or erina's father.I wish there was moreespecially because i became an asahi fan and would have liked to see more of him.the drawing is great too...and the ideaI'm sad that the manga is already over<333and i will sen this and myanimelist say error xDDD aaark and the ideaI'm sad that the manga is already over<333and i will sen this and myanimelist say error xDDD aaark"", ""Food Wars holds a special place in my heart, it was the first anime i truly feel in love with and it helped open my eyes to the world of anime.

The show has been so far relatively grounded in the feat people pull, despite all the cloth explosions. And this brand new villain just feels like the author completely gave up on the idea of good old sweat and tears that makes a chef great, and pulled an isekai OP protag right into the story and called it a day.

As someone who has not read the manga, I headed to some online forums to see what other people had thought about the content that will be covered in the next season. Most of the reviews I read were negative, with people begging for the anime to change the plot. Now that I've watched the final season, I can agree. This season introduces absurd characters which don't feel like they fit...in with the Shokugeki cast we all know and love, and most of the characters are redundant this season, only appearing in 1-3 episodes. The plot becomes slightly harder to follow and doesn't seem to 'flow'.

The main thing this season has going for it is that it's the final one and that is has a good ending.The story is one where the cast is now in their second year. It starts off with some standard cooking battles/contests that are reasonably enjoyable. However the anime introduces a new antagonist who wants to marry Erina for no discernible reason. I want to stress this point, no reason is given for his obsession with Erina. However from...this point on the entire anime revolves around this guy wanting to marry erina. The other characters accept stupid shokugekis that create problems for themselves they could have avoided by simply y'know not accepting them. This creates a false tension created by stupid decisions which is annoying.Most of the anime revolves around the cooking contest BLUE and the underground cooking organisation Noir. The problem is that the cooking battles are very rushed making it feel like the staff just wanted to cram the final season into as few episodes as possible. After BLUE has finished, there is a nice ending that gives some extra information on the characters and why they acted the way they did in previous seasons which does make it nice to watch.The characters are somewhat similar as the previous season with the addition of the new antagonist, members of Noir and a new judge. The cooking styles of Noir seem over the top as in seasoning meat with a chainsaw over the top. It all pales in comparison to the new antagonist though who has Subaru's mimicking power without the effort which feels very scuffed.The animation, voice acting and music are all similar or the same as the previous season.Overall this isn't a great season.

I will start out with the small stuff because I want to save the story until the end.Art is the same as the last two seasons, it\'s nicely rounded out, and for being a cute/ecchi anime, the fighting scenes are better than expected, giving it a score of 7.I\'ve...always really liked the Zero no Tsukaima soundtrack and music cues, so although nothing but the OP/ED changes, I will give it a 9.Story was weird - I mean, it\'s built around the characters\' backgrounds, sure, and then we have the interesting development midway, but nothing is really fleshed out and the end of the season feels more like facing just another Robotnik boss after shoving Sonic through a million winding tubes in Hydrocity Zone. I wish the general war/story/etc could focus almost entirely on how it affects the characters because that\'s what ZnT is based around. This random plot in the third season doesn\'t really excite me at all and I\'d rather endure the agonizing fanservice. This gets a 3.Characters, right. So the main reason I did this review was the rant about the characters, so get ready.I seriously don\'t get why the makers of ZnT think it\'s all right to pull the same old romantic comedy junk without trying to develop the MAIN CHARACTERS one single bit.

How does a life-changing event NOT lead to character development?

The only thing that keeps me from dropping the character score down to a 3 is the Henrietta/Tabitha development, which could go so many ways, so good for us, and the Colbert coolness factor, kicking the character score up to a 7.Overall, I still did enjoy it - ZnT is mainly the anime where you get some smiles from the awkward moments and ""aww""s from the cute moments and perhaps little else. I say perhaps because Saito\'s harem has ridiculous potential to not only enhance the viewer\'s experience but even the plot, both relationship and general, which gave me motivation to keep watching this thing.

It seems as though there was an excessive amount of romance cliches which strongly detracted from the season, such as the overly emotional and volatile tsundere (ex : Louise zapping Saito as comic relief), ecchi fanservice (ex :...hotsprings, nosebleeds, yuri, breasts). Though the storyline does bring along some good results that are decent to the viewers such as the highlight of Tabitha's storyline, development of henrietta's character and Louise's insecure side and Saito shows his chivalry side.

More often than not, Louise and Saito bring out romantic moments which bring out a refreshing experience to the audience. Saito accompanies latterly his incredibly and heart-warming feats of courage and caring devoted and engaged in singularly towards Louise, while Louise introspectively loves him so, she cannot express it properly and openly until there is more character development.One of the best aspects of Zero no Tsukaima are the animations, the character designs are fairly decent visuals, and the illustrations successfully convey the character's expressions to the audience without a problem while adding onto the humorous moments.

I liked her better in the first season), and our hero seems to get some criminal expirience on raping (She said NO and he kept pushing her. I think he should be jailed). Other than that, it\'s pretty much the same as last season. Elf has a typical ""i\'m weak and I need a strong man (specific guy who has nothing to do with strenght, just the hero so she wants to sleep with him) to protect me!"".Enjoyment: Not very much (as a 7 would state). Could have been ALOT better.Overall: I really think they need to shape up and start copying from the second season. If this season goes on like this, I will regret seeing it.

For the regular fans of harem animu, I'm sure you're already watching this...For those of you who haven't seen it and are looking to see if you should pick it up this season -- There's a &quot;main&quot; plot and other stories to go along the usual fan-service and boy-beating (of course). But to be honest, I'm not sure it's worth it just for that.You're watching it for the same reason as ALL of us: Louise &amp; Saito... plus the other girls. You want...to see Saito (the main character) TRY to get Louise's love; You like seeing Louise kick Saito's ass in the castle, in the strip joint, in the restaurant, in school, in the dorms and everywhere else the animators care to  draw for us. And elftits. And panties.Apparently, in the book, they've consumated the marriage already. So YES, he's taken her home and had consensual sex with her in the missionary position, with the lights off, at night. (f**kyeah!)BUT It's the 3rd season. Don't kid yourself; the story is not going to improve. It's gonna be the same crap over &amp; over. YOU KNOW THIS. It's not going to mature into anything more. As much as you're hoping it would get better, it's not.  So skip the denial stage already and just try to enjoy the show.Anyways, I'm gonna keep watching this show till it ends.

Teh RIE"", ""Zero no Tsukaima is one of those rare romantic anime that actually allows the viewer some of the pleasures of romance that are rarely ever actually allowed in a series: actual physical contact. You see, most romance anime feature a boy and a girl and 24 episodes of them muddling through genre cliches and stuttering annoyances until finally, they get together in the end, and even then, only about 5% of the time, it ends in a kiss, which really blows my mind about romance anime in general, but that's another matter.Now, to be truthful, there's a lot that can be said against this show....The story is weak in itself, filled with more deux ex than can possibly be explained. It's almost like the creators just don't care about plot holes and rediculous assumptions. Not only that, but the original premise of Season 1 (where Louise is a magic student in a magical academy) has been completely abandoned. I think the academy showed up once or twice in Season 3 and the Professor showed up only in the last episode.However, somehow, all of the bad things that can be said about this show still gets pushed to the backburner because this anime is just downright fun! I could watch the episodes over and over because the characters are so well done and the dialogue and voice acting are top-notch and the relationship between Louise and Saito is just amazing. (Just watch the boat scene in episode 4 of Season 2 and you'll know what I mean. That kind of thing NEVER happens in romance anime, especially in the middle of the season, so I've watched it so many times, because I just loved it so much.)Louise is perhaps the most adorable character in the history of tsunderes, if not in all of anime. She hardly ever gets on your nerves like most tsundere types can from time to time, because in every episode you can see how vulnerable she is... how much she needs Saito. And unlike most tundere types, she breaks down quite easily in confessing what she doesn't want to: that she has feelings for him. That hits at the heart of what usually annoys most fans of romance: that it just takes too dark long for the characters to confess their love and that when it does happen, the anime is already concluding and we don't get to see any aftermath. Well, that's not the case with Zero. Louise and Saito confess early and often in Season 1 and after that, it's just more and more development, more and more physical contact that displays their feelings, and more and more love. It's actually amazing what a simple plot change can do when you do it right and let me tell you all: Zero no Tsukaima gets romance right!Other notables about this anime. The fanservice isn't the best, but its good. There's no nudity, but perhaps in this case, there's no need (although Louise naked would be nice, but that's just me *wink*). Louise's stuttering nervous voice is beyond adorable and I guarantee you'll fall in love with her the minute you hear it. Saito is actually pretty solid as a lead male in this genre and he surprises often. If I had to use one word to describe him, it would be &quot;realistic.&quot; Everything about him from his responses to his feelings is spot on and just makes sense. He brings balance to the anime.Anyways, overall, I would reccommend this to anyone who loves romance anime with strong harem theme, but isn't truly harem. I guarantee you won't find many pairings that matches the strength of Louise and Saito. From the looks of the last episode, it seems they probably aren't doing a Season 4, but luckily the last episode of Season 3 was magnificent.

As a third instalment, it is recommended to have seen the two previous seasons, else you may not fully comprehend some of the plot references or know the character's different pasts and backgrounds.The first &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; series was quite enjoyable, while not particularly extraordinary it offered us a nice romantic comedy with an ill-tempered flat-chested tsundere female lead who was one of the characters that would help launch the recent popular movement where plenty of series each season...feature that type of tsundere character. Many of those more well known tsundere female leading characters like Louise from &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; are voiced by Rie Kugimiya, a good seiyuu who plays those roles well but one has to wonder if she's not being typecast too much.While I enjoyed &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; it definitely felt like the least good season of all three, an impression that is enhanced by the fact it seems more like some sort of intermission or a stepping stone meant to introduce new characters and new villains before embarking on a new large adventure.In the previous season &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Futatsuki No Kishi&rdquo; we were treated to some more entertaining and gripping character development between Saito and Louise. That season also offered interesting developments and concepts about Halkeginia, where the story takes place.&ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; starts roughly where &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Futatsuki No Kishi&rdquo; left off, with our cast off on a search for a mysterious elf Saito and Guiche claim to have seen during the war with Albion. That elf turns out to be the kind, na&iuml;ve and ridiculously large breasted Tiffania. As one might expect Saito is easily enchanted by Tiffania's large bosom which leads to many jealous fits from Louise and oppai jokes abound in all of the following episodes.With Siesta already having served the role of the large breasted female who charms Saito with her bosom and makes Louise jealous with envy in the previous seasons, one could wonder if it was necessary to add another female character with an even larger chest to play on those typical jokes.Luckily they did not make Tiffania into another girl that is smitten for Saito, while she clings to Saito, it's clear she sees him as a friend. While still enough to enrage Louise, it never comes off as a true romantic pairing.As the opening sequence of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; suggest, this season does see another girl grow feelings for Saito, namely Tabitha.Most episodes of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; we see Louise doubt herself, he lack of magical abilities and Saito's feelings for her.Arguably, this occurred in previous seasons as well, with several plots where Louise overcame her insecurities and was able to grow from there but by now it starts to become quite tiresome. Even after all that happened between them, Louise still doubts Saito's feelings and is unable to make her own emotions clear to him, which only worsens things between them. You could say Louise carries that burden of insecurity due to her inferior magical skills, but then you would also start to wonder how Saito can keep on coping with her like that.For the sake of decent storytelling they really should move on from there and focus on other characters their development or other traits in Saito and Louise. Personally I had increasing difficulty to really enjoy the series with Louise's incessant insecurities, it seems to drag on for too long and is becoming a bit much to bear.Another new character we are introduced to is the happy-go-lucky blue haired Irukukwu, who is more than meets the eye. Alas she quickly comes off as mere fanservice to allow another moe large breasted girl to prance around in the series.Princess Henrietta is featured less this season, nonetheless her character shows the most interesting and subtle evolutions. In the earlier episodes it is suggested she too may have romantic feelings for Saito, in part triggered due to the loneliness her position brings with it and her envy of Louise, who she sees as a strong, moral person that can take independent action by her own power, something she herself can not. That and some of the decisions she is forced to make, show a more realistic and three dimensional character in a series that else features rather generic thirteen in a dozen characters.Most of the episodes are spent on Tiffania joining the cast, a new villain and his minion that come after Louise, and another few adventures. While there are enough events and action, it still feels like some sort of  intermission chapter, meant to bridge the previous story and set up the next.Animation by JC Staff throughout the series is decent, it never particularly excels or disappoints but is a solid average. More attention is spent on the cute girls and any fanservice scenes. The magic wielding action scenes in comparison, while still decent get less of a visual treat.Typical for the series are the vividly colored and crisply rendered characters, full of bright hair colors and outfits.There seems to be less effort in rendering the medieval backgrounds and world of Halkeginia on screen, which is a shame as such adventure filled series taking place in other realms can always excel by really immersing the viewer in their unique world.The soundtrack of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; is fair, it boasts an upbeat techno-pop opening song and generic tunes that accompany the series well but never really accentuate or help elevate it. Most goes largely unnoticed although the opening track manages to get you fired up and enthusiastic about the episode to come.In all I would mostly recommend &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; only to fans of the series and those who have seen the previous season and want to know what happens after those events. For the casual viewer, there are other series that would offer more laughs and fun. After this weak season, I ponder if I would pick up a fourth &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; season if (or when) it were to come. feature that type of tsundere character.

The story follows the return of Saito after a fatal battle with knights and dragons and such. Saito, Louise, and Siesta go in search of the beatiful and busty elf Tiffania that revived a fallen wound-stricken Saito. Why they are searching for her....I can't quite remember lol.Art: The art style is great and really modern....but that's just it. Although it looks good there's nothing about it that really helps it stand apart from other modern day anime.Sound: The sound is decent, although I'm not a...fan of the new intro and outro songs.

She's too damn squeaky and it grates my ears to hear her speak.Character: The characters are awesome and all develop well.

Saito gets into a sticky situation that turns into an &quot;ecchi moment&quot;,...Louise catches him in the act, claims to &quot;never forgive him&quot;, and then she ends up forgiving him if not by the end of the episode, then by the next episode. By a third season, I'd wanna see more of a good plot than things we've seen in the past two seasons. Besides, we know Louise and Saito love each other, so why go through so many (as in like 3-4 episodes worth) inconvenient situations for them? When we finally get a plot going after many episodes of fan service, we learn that Tabitha is in some sort of predicament and Saito, Louise, and some other recurring characters put their social status on the line to rescue her, as she has helped them many times before. Can't say how well that turned out since the season hasn't finished airing, but it isn't bad so far. :PArt &amp; Sound - Neither of them are bad. We get another decent OP and ED song as well as some bright and colorful animation. :PEnjoyment - Even though I like Saito and Louise together, the fan service episodes got repetitive and boring. I hope that now that the plot has officially gotten underway, we'll end the season on a good note. ^_^Overall, Znt: PnR is a definite &quot;must watch&quot; if you're a fan of the Zero no Tsukaima series, but you probably won't be as impressed with this season as you might have been with its previous seasons.

The first season was pretty good, the second one didn’t disappoint either (although season one was much better) and I’m somewhat happy to say that season three is pretty good too. “Pretty good” meaning that it won’t disappoint those who know what to expect – the fans of the series. Yes, Louise’s tsundere charm is still there and yes, Saito continues to get into seemingly perverse situations with other...girls, which makes Louise go gaga and punish him with her infamous whip.The joke may be old, but it’s still as funny as it was the first day. Hell, maybe even funnier! How is that possible, you may ask yourself? Well, it seems that the writers really raised the bar and improved overall writing quality of the anime, especially the funny, more lighthearted situations. The jokes seem funnier than ever and there are tons of situations and scene that will make you laugh uncontrollably throughout the season. The main storyline isn’t as good as it used to be, but that really doesn’t matter too much anymore. Most of us who continue to watch this anime don’t watch it for its awesome plot, but rather for the interactions between characters.Not many new stuff are introduced in Princess no Rondo, but we do get some new characters and a continuation of the previous story (even if it develops rather slowly). The most important new character this season offers is Tifania, also known as the forest fairy which saved Saito’s life back in season two. There isn’t much to say about her without mentioning her enormous breasts (which are even bigger than Siesta’s – imagine that). Obviously she’ll somehow get attached to Saito, which will lead to Louise catching them during inappropriate and this-is-not-what-it-looks-like situations, and before you know it Saito will be punished by yet another creative and painful way by Louise. There are some other minor characters introduced as well, but they really aren’t worth mentioning. I’ll just add that we’ll get to meet a new villain, who seems to be the mastermind behind all these ‘evil’ operations. Not a very impressive character, but he gets the job done.That’s about all I need to say about this season. It may not be the best in the series, but I consider it to be a fine improvement over the last season (Futatsuki no Kishi), which I consider to be more of a mess and totally out of balance (still good, though!). You’re definitely gonna enjoy this one if you’ve liked the other two seasons and even though there isn’t anything new to attract attention, it’s good enough to keep the story going and the entertainment pumping.

It may not be the best in the series, but I consider it to be a fine improvement over the last season (Futatsuki no Kishi), which I consider to be more of a mess and totally out of balance (still good, though!). You’re definitely gonna enjoy this one if you’ve liked the other two seasons and even though there isn’t anything new to attract attention, it’s good enough to keep the story going and the entertainment pumping. Have fun watching Louise unleash her rage on Saito (and some of it on the enemies as well)!', ""Zero no Tsukaima ~princess no Rondo~ is the third installment to the series where the story carries on from the previous 2 series, with saito and Louise now closer together but with more competition now from the other girls. The story reveals the presence of more than one void user and this is what the story revolves around.I must say that as someone who has watched the first 2 series of this show, it is a big letdown. The story does not develop very far until the last few episodes. And is very slow moving even for a 13 episode anime.While there is some progression,...much of the story is actually left open ended, and i presume a fourth series will be produced to continue from this. Also i feel that many charcters have been altered or bent  in terms of personanlity in order to fit this comedy filled anime. Of course this is a romantic comedy so romance and comedy are both evident, but i think that the producers tried too hard this time, but there are some good moments still so it still passes.The art was the same as the previous series with artwork leaning more to the cartoonic side to portray the comedy in this show. Nothing wrong with this area.Sound was actually quite good compared to the first two series, the inserts were timed nicely to bring out the atmosphere of the different moments in the story. OP and ED songs were more lively and actually hints a comedy show.The characters was another huge disappointment. As mentioned earlier, the characters have been altered here and there to the point that nearly all the girls go for Saito...it feels like this anime is becoming a harem more than romance. Louise is now some really over emotional girl who is quite dense(when you watch it you'll know what i mean) all the way through the show. Of course the characters were still as effective in portraying the comedy as the other two series had done but i felt no significance in the characters anymore. Depth was especially lacking in a lot of characters, i still give it a pass on the account of the comedy and romantic moments here and there in the show.Overall, If you have watched the first two series of the anime, don't expect anything better than the first two, it is a bid disappointment compared to them. The anime has become too emotional in some aspects and is clearly lacking in the romance genre as they have to create situations whereby louise gets jealous in order to keep up the love tension, they do this by altering the personality of some characters. Also the sheer number of characters has again increased which would explain the lack of depth in the characters. Hopefully, the fourth season would be something to look foward to...should there be one. much of the story is actually left open ended, and i presume a fourth series will be produced to continue from this.

And it is frustrating watching.Something that disappointed me most was that J.C. Staff seemed to be focusing on fan-service and the story didn't progress as much as it should done. And the story was very repetetiv.And the end of this season was far as saticfying as the two first season. If you love fan-service and some lesbian action you should enjoy this, but if you are like me that...only gets embarrassed watching fan-service then this should be a problem. only gets embarrassed watching fan-service then this should be a problem."", ""The following is true for all three seasons of Zero no Tsukaima. Overall there are over a million points to complain about, yet it was simply too much fun too watch xD. This review should be quite spoilerless, except for the very last line (which is a relatively small spoiler).==Story 7/10==The Story is quite straightforward up the point of sometimes even being downright childish. At some points during the series this can slightly distract from the story itself, however there is an overall plot binding everything together enough for it be worth more than just a 6. Still I would definitely not advise anybody to...watch it for any in-depth plot development.==Art 6/10==The art is fairly good in general, but at quite a number of points during the series cartoon like art is used (not sure about the name). Though this sometimes is enjoyable, I personally regarded this as being quite distracting at times. Still I would suggest you look for another review if you're concerned about the art.==Sound 7/10==... no clue... (I don't care about music) ... It felt slightly repetitive at times, but all the music had one single theme binding it together, which IMHO is quite a good thing.==Character 7/10==First of all the characters seem not to develop at all and the same situations are used over and over again. Despite of this one can not be stopped from loving and hating the characters at the same time. Loving because they are all adorable presented and hating them for reasons as messing up the main romantic relationship in the series and the main characters inability to stick with his choices. None the less the characters seem to develop over the course of all three seasons, so it wasn't as bad as I was fearing, though - if there is a fourth season - it would be cool to have a season without a fallback in character development, like the ones which happened at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd season.==Enjoyment 10/10==The best aspect of this series xD, while watching I simply had to have a smile on my face. At various points the series actually crossed the border of what I find enjoyable as far as ecchi stuff goes and I have hated the series for the nearly-harem aspect. Despite the fact that I am a boy, I more than hated it how the main character was kissing every single girl in the series, but still I can't deny that I more than greatly enjoyed the rest.

But this season was a major letdown for me. First of all, the overall story and art maintain the same quality as the last two seasons, but somehow the characters and subplots have gotten considerably worse this season.What follows is my personal opinion.Let's start with the good: I  liked the inclusion of Joseph, the new villain, what he want isn't clear, but that's the fun part! I have no objections to Tiffania, I like her personality and it becomes soon clear that she has no...romantic feelings towards Saito. Her interactions with Saito and Louise are funny and she's a generally likable character, if a bit generic.The Bad: In all honesty, Louise's treatment of Saito is getting old at this point. it's an overused gag for this series, and is only made worse when Siesta is involved.That brings me to Siesta. I really liked Siesta originally, she was a great balance to Louise, but I though that her interest in Saito would fade as Saito and Louise got closer. Unfortunately, Siesta has morphed into one of the MOST ANNOYING characters I have ever seen. She actively tries to interfere with Louise and Saito, and actively prevents any further development in their relationship. Her actions can only be defined as annoying. When Tiffania was introduced, I genuinely hoped that she would replace this eyesore.This season also tries to hard to become a Harem anime, but wasn't too sure how to do that. What resulted was no romantic development for most of the season. One does not simply switch genres. romantic feelings towards Saito.

No improvement like the last one . Basically it's the same thing like the last two is . Other than the story , everything is the same . Onto the review yeahhh......Story:8After the event of Saito , who himself face more than 70 thousand army . After some 'gruesome' battle , he supposed to be dead but nahhh . He was save by a fairy . After that , his rune on his left hand dissapear and that's...where the real journey begins . I won't tell much about the story plot because nothing is worth mentioning here .Art:8Like the other two seasons , same arts and animations . Does have some 3D animation which is kind of cool . Have some beautiful arts . And yet again , the character design doesn't change like the last two . I really wish they improve this one .Sound:9Same voice actor and actress . Nothing that make me stop or anything . The OP and ED were enjoyable especially the OP . Have some thrill feelings like the last one .Character:8Some characters here does have a background . Like the last two seasons , nothing change . There were a few new characters like Sheffield , the one that has a rune that has the same power as Saito rune except her rune is located on her forehead , Joseph , the one who kill Tabitha's father , Vitartial , the elf boy and many more . I can see that these new characters especially the female , have a lot in common with the old one . Huge , big , bodacious of boobs . Big is fine but if you make it THAT big , then it just look ridiculous man.....Enjoyment:7I thought when i watch the third seasons of Zero no Tsukaima , i will get the same enjoyment as before . I was wrong . I didn't enjoy this one much . The comedy is still there , the romance are by far worse than twillight , harem is a must in this one , fan service paradise hooray which i hate . Nothing enjoyable on this one except that i was surprise that Colbert is still alive . That one did make me happy . I guess dead people is a NO on this anime....Overall:7I am very dissapointed on the third seasons for Zero no Tsukaima . Because of this , i'm having trouble on trying to watch the fourth one . I can only hope that the fourth one has a surprise that can make me take my words back about this anime . If you like the other two seasons , try watching this .

Most of the people reading this should have watched the previous 2 season.What I wanted to say is - SCREW THE PERSON DOING THE GOD DAM ECCHI SCENE. HE MUST BE BURN IN HELL FOR @!%@%%@%./rantSorry for the anger, but it must be done, in 1 way or another.Season begins with quite an amazing episode which most will agree, with much pointless fillers as it continues, although I'm not complaining. The so-called plot begins around ep 7 where things actually start to get better, most of the time you will be see louise trying to get...hold of her feeling towards saito, it was good, I admit. Smoothly and nicely until ep11, which I think the snag came. IT WAS HORRIBLE. How did J.C. manage to ruin something as smoothly as a slide into a terrain full of F**K-lots of spikes? Watching ep 11 makes me feel that I'm sliding through lots of spikes. They had done it. They had you excitied for 10 episode and ruin you with the 11th episode. Well done J.C. staff, you just made me lost 95% of my interest in Zero no Tsukaima.But other than that screwed up episode, ZnT S3 is still considered enjoyable (as long as you don't think logically). Screw the plots cause theres never 1. Art is amazing, I admit, way more beter than the previous 2 seasons. I personally prefer this season's opening over the other 2, although not a great song, its nice to hear it every once a while (especially ep12 =P). Enjoyment is there, seriously, as long as you avoid 11 the value stays at 8 (but that would make 12 weird &gt;.&gt;).So in overall, I'm giving this a 8.

Have you ever had the feeling where you should have stopped a long time ago but you didn\'t and came crashing down from your peak? This is that crash.The story for the first half seems to throw out the window what was learnt in previous seasons and go on its own trail for the good of doing nothing more than adding a new face to the already horrific harem. It does however have an evil working in the background that has been doing so for longer than the viewers realize and only now comes to light. More so...even though the play of this series, it seems the villain isn\'t played out to their full game yet so they just filled in the rest of the season with more quickly blown over conflicts, cleverly concealed in what seems like a multi episode situation.Art has more or less stayed same same as the previous season and thus not much can be noted on that front. However animation of the ""larger"" characters is a lot more fluid and carefree in their bounciness.In the sound it lost the thrill of lengthy musical numbers and just became a lot of ambiance, whether that be guards chattering or a wagon strolling along. Which isn\'t bad, it shows they\'re doing something to fill is silence and for good reason too. The one scene of utter silence, when a character talks you can hear the background noise of the VA\'s lines and it\'s horrible!Character development went absolutely nowhere. The end result is exactly the same as it started with, only with more characters added to the harem of the main character that makes you want punch the creators over how thick you can make a person. Seriously if that was an award, this anime wins hands down every time.Enjoyment in the first 3 quarters of the season was dull. Same as season 1. However the last quarter seemed to up the ante a bit and get the viewer a little more interested. Even makes you laugh more than every episode prior. Then, much like the first season, when something interesting looks like it\'s going to happen, its all brushed over with in half an ep and you\'re left with a large sack of disappointment.

Yeah, Fanservice, that and an invented story, and invented personality for the characters (Saito is my favourite main character! And in the anime he\'s just a fool boy! In...the light novel he\'s a boy who fights for what he cares about, and have an adult mentality, in the anime he\'s just a fool teenager who loves to be surrounded by girls, how pathetic)I will only say you one thing, if you\'re interested in the plot of Zero no Tsukaima: Read the novels, you can find them easily in baka-tsuki or in nyaa torrent, no worries, they\'re translated into english so you can read it without problems. J.C Staff it\'s an unique studio yes, all the good works that they touch are inevitably turned into pure shit.Hope this review had help you to DON\'T WATCH THIS SERIES and to READ THE LIGHT NOVELS XDTo finish the review I\'ll say that Zero no Tsukaima is my favourte light novel and my favourite ""otaku thing"" to somehow call it, and yeah, i think that Yamaguchi Nobura is the people most closely to God for me XD. They are really good and if you had watch the Zero no tsukaima\'s ""anime"" and was deceived for his plot, don\'t worry, it\'s completely different of the light novels so read it anyway.Greetings.PS: Sorry for my bad grammar, i\'m not an english native nor a native english speaker so maybe I have some grammatical misspellings. the light novel he\'s a boy who fights for what he cares about, and have an adult mentality, in the anime he\'s just a fool teenager who loves to be surrounded by girls, how pathetic)I will only say you one thing, if you\'re interested in the plot of Zero no Tsukaima: Read the novels, you can find them easily in baka-tsuki or in nyaa torrent, no worries, they\'re translated into english so you can read it without problems.

After a really enjoyable first two seasons, we are getting the same, repeatable plot, that gets really weird as the season progresses and absolutely no character development. I really liked the Zero no Tsukaima series, because of the characters, but repeating over and over the same behaviors is just frustrating and gives nothing to the plot.Basically: Louise is still a despotic princess, unhealthy jealous of the Saito, despite everything...he did for her - absolutely no character development out there. On the other hand, Saito is still a philanderer. Every possible woman in range of like 100 miles from him is basically getting attached to him very easily, which pisses off Louise. You can get kinda annoyed by her actions. She's doing the same repeatable stuff to punish Saito. I get it, she's tsundere and all that stuff, but it is getting unenjoyable, because of her problematic personality. I know, it's harem anime, so it's expectable, but come on - because of that, the story doesn't progress at all. I kinda find Zero no Tsukaima more as an Ecchi/Romance, than Harem, as we clearly see Louise as Saito's main love interest.I am honestly impressed by the fact that the creators managed to milk this story that much. Sometimes it can be felt like nothing more can be done with the plot, but somehow they did 4 seasons out of that.The sound and art are decent, especially considering the fact that this anime has already 14 years. Fighting scenes are good. They are not really a big part of the series, but they are pretty enjoyable.Overall, I think the proper rating for this season is something between 6 or 7. It follows the story from previous seasons pretty well, although repeatability is very much exhausting for the viewer. I can recommend season 3, only in case, you're pretty sure you'll watch Zero no Tsukaima F. There's no sense to watch this season if you're not a fan of the series. It's just not worth it. Even though I'm planning to rewatch the whole series, I'll make sure to skip season 3. he did for her - absolutely no character development out there. On the other hand, Saito is still a philanderer.

If you missed the joke, all through the second season I felt like the show went out of it's way to constantly remind us that they were fighting a war. So that's done with now.There's an attempt to shift the status quo by making Saito a proper nobleman because of his war time heroics. Because he's no longer a commoner the super thirsty queen suddenly thinks that's her cue to horn in on her childhood friend's lover, attempting to use royal justification for seducing him away. It'd be more forgivable if she wasn't just the worst. I'd...sooner prefer he get with Siesta than that absolute thot of a queen.Saito's harem in general seems to be growing every season. He's got the elf girl and Tabitha now chasing after him just as much as Siesta. I still think Zero will probably win out just by virtue of being first girl best girl, but she's got her work cut out for her.

Actually there's just one thing I loved about this anime that is the fairy Tiffany and her voice ( same voice as Himegami Aisa, Ichinose Kotomi ,Oshizu ) aaa...gomen gomen, I got a little carried away .Anyways, If you are suggested to watch this anime, say nai nai nai and instead go for Shakugan no Shana if by any chance you haven't watched it.. The story is a little bit more interesting than this one at least.I've just finished all the seasons hoping it will get me some interesting stories,unfortunately I got too bored that I want to delete all the episodes. Well, if you are a boring anime lover this one's just for u ^^."", 'This review assumes you have seen the first 2 seasons. This review may also reference some content in my reviews of this series. This review will contain spoilers.The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses is S3 of this anime. While i got why the 2nd season was called what it was, here? S3 has no right to call itself by the name of Rondo. (A musical note fyi) and doesn\'t make sense. (Unless there is a hidden meaning like in the names for example) But putting that aside I have to say that is the LEAST of the problems with S3... first let me get...this out of the way, this season does some things right, while doing MANY things wrong. Lets start out with what it does right.1. Louise gets SOME character development (Emphasis on some btw)2. They brought back Kirche & Tabitha (Charlotte) and made them MC (main characters) again, unlike in S2 where they were made side characters, sadly this isn\'t until the 2nd half so yeah...3. They intro\'d 2 new MC girls whom you\'ll prolly like, I did. They also intro\'d a bunch of new side characters too whom imo, you could remove them from the anime and nothing would change much.4. While I won\'t say, we get some surprises you may not see coming, really happy for one of those involving a certain character.5. While the MC of S2 were made side characters in S3, they don\'t feel like we lost anything from them, well, that\'s how it feels to me anyway.6. Reveals some plot points of whats been going on since S1 and also tries to tie up some of the plot points from S1 & S2 that were not finished.All those points above sound super great right? Yeah, I\'d say so, but even though i had a smile on my face a moment ago, I now have a frown because I know what am about to type... Here is what S3 botches... due note some spoilers will be mentioned, my apologies but I cannot do this review properly otherwise, however I will try to for as much as I can, still be vague, but some stuff i have to specifically point out what happens... hop out now or risk getting spoiled.S3 picks up where S2 leaves off... except somehow time has passed (8 months though I forget if that\'s since the war started or since it ended as the Princess mentions one of the two) yet at the same time apparently not becus some plot points that one would discuss ASAP, rn\'t discussed either at all or till later... Yes for those who hated the war in S2 its done, over, ended off screen. So, DUMB. Like i myself didn\'t like some stuff that was just forced in S2, like the marriage (fyi, never mentioned here, but shown so it did happen) and how Saito became a murderer for the girl he loves which just felt so bad and forced in that scene where he asks that question. The flower wilting meaning he died yet somehow came back to life got explained here and imo, was done poorly, more so because Guiche also died in S2 (off screen, shown only through him telling what happened) and he made the same story of how he was saved as Saito did, yet Tiffa had to use her ring to save Saito and she isn\'t able to revive anymore because the ring lost its power. Based on what was said and shown, it seems like the ring was a 1 time use only item, so here we have a plot hole involving Guiche. I read a review that the anime is its own adaptation, while the LN are different, I can certainly believe it and that would explain the plot hole here as it was just teasing Tiffa in S2 which was still dumb. I dunno if the LN and anime are different or not, but I cna honestly say I have no intention of reading any book form of this series, though am not into books anyway but yeah, S3 really burned me here. Anyway, with that out of the way, let\'s get onto the other problems this season has... which are significantly worse than what i just wrote... before that, almost forgot, the flowers from their wedding are never shown or mentioned again besides maybe in a flash back.So, in S1 you know I loved Saito\'s personality because he was respectful to women, shy, reserved, would look away if a woman was naked in front of him. S2 however made him gawk and stare at breasts, clothed or not. ... S3 however... *sigh* let\'s just turn him into a cheating bastard shall we? Oh? Let\'s also make him a bigger perv than he was in S2 while we\'re at it! :D ... >:( I lost my respect for Saito in S3, Louise called hima  water flea in S3, but me? I call him scum. It was just Saito I lost respect for. The Princess (Henrietta) lost my respect too. In S2 she only forced herself on Saito to fool the guards searching for her, while she wore plebeian\'s clothing. In S3 I won\'t say what leads to this, and i GET and understand admiring someone and wanting to be like them and i also get loneliness BUT! You crossed a line Hime and worse, Saito also crossed a line and legit straight up cheated on Louise, where as before it was mostly just staring, this one went FAR too far. Oh and, Saito already cheated by fondling breasts out of lust when he was asked too and ofc they weren\'t Louise\'s breasts. Saito is scum, and an absolute idiot. His excuse in soem of these sitches is ""I may never get a chance too"" and I don\'t give a CRAP, I actually feel sorry for Louise in this season, mean while Saito gets near everything he deserves in this season, what scum. Side note. Though i harp on him and others/plot point I mention/am about to mention, keep in mind I don\'t hate the characters, I just hate how they were handled in S3 and so on.As if that wasn\'t bad enough, there\'s not much plot in S3, certainly not interesting plot... and that plot doesn\'t even come up till episode 6 or 7... the ""plot"" b4 that is just setting up new charcters, not bothering to explain why Elvs are hated and feared and ofc, pointless fan service. There is some comedy here, including a whole episode almost of yuri (You\'d understand why it can be funny if you saw it, the sitch that unfolds is well, something lol) but then we still get inappropriate stuff like asking if Tiffa\'s breasts are real just because they\'re ginormous, which elads to her asking if they\'re real herself (I dunno hun, you tell me, you should know best after all, they\'re your breasts ya know :P) and crap like that, is just so dumb. Tiffa is not an idiot btw. So that sitch shouldn\'t have happened.Ultimately there\'s more I am sure i could mention including the last episode\'s BADLY tacted on and forced plot to try to make the episode more interesting and strengthen bonds which could\'ve been handled and done MUCH better without that, but I\'ll end it here. S3 ultimately has some good points, has some character dev and so on, but the bad things I mentioned here and how it ruins some characters for me are why i have to rate The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses (S3) a 4.0 out of 10.0Onto the specials and S4 for me, here is hoping for better... this out of the way, this season does some things right, while doing MANY things wrong.

This season of the show has a different vibe than the previous season. It is a mixture of adventure in season 1, with a sprinkle of risqué element in season 2, and topped with a slice-of-life theme. The show does not have a major overarching narrative, instead, we see the lives of the characters on a daily basis, with hints of a bigger story for future seasons.The supporting characters who were the side characters in Season 2 take the limelight more...often and it gives an entirely new perspective from the usual focus of the main duo. Their subplot is also addressed, which makes them less of an underdog. On the other hand, the relationship of Louise and Saito is sometimes a bit boring and tired, their interactions gets predictable and charmingness is gone.On the positive side, the comedy does not disappoint, it keeps us laughing, but when it comes to some of the characters’ behaviors that become monotonous, it can spoil our mood a little. Luckily, the additional performances by the whole crew contribute to the spice of the show. Furthermore, this season doesn't hesitate to showcase some revealing outfits and sensual scenes, making the story a bit spicier.In a nutshell, this season was a good watch for me. I have to admit that I enjoy the move to a more casual everyday tone, which is great for the characters. On the other hand, the excessive use of some of the character types as well as limited narrative development may become a bit too boring for some of the viewers.

Which I kind of understand because Louise at this point has opened up about her feelings yet still refuses to be anything but...extremely abusive and crazy.

The OVA (ep 6.5) for a moment turns into tentacle hentai, and Tabitha's dragon ends up being sexualized as well (turns into a busty anime girl), a f*ing dragon, need I say more? Actually one more thing, ALL sexualized characters are underage, oh Japan...The writing also isn't nearly as decent as in previous seasons, they straight up bring back a dead character with a very bs reason, in the end it just substracts from the low quality the anime already has.I'll skip the final season, it was a huge trudge to just finish this one. extremely abusive and crazy.

And what was my surprise here? I am actually impressed with myself for getting all 12 episodes through.All seasons were already just below average, but this season was lacking in every area. Although the first two seasons had at least a solid conclusion, this was not the case here. Fan service has been turned up even further than before.The point that scares me the most are probably the two protagonists at the time. Louise goes through...no change and is the same melodramatic crying habit and chews the same thing over and over again. Even if you add sad music to it, the scene doesn\'t get more emotional. The characters have no real depth, nor are their dialogues well written. In the last episode alone they just talked in the sand for almost 4 minutes.And then there is the protagonist Saito. Not only that he has already confessed his love to Louise 10-20 times, no. He lets every woman close to him running forward, starts everybody on the breasts, feels aroused as soon as any girl jumps in, and doesn\'t get rid of here. But in retrospect, he wonders why the two pro episodes have a relationship crash twice. And honestly, we used the scene in the Louis explosion or both of them bitch, we\'ve already had countless times. Individuality is a foreign word here.Certainly, as long as you reduce your demands FAR, you can be satisfied with the work. He also has one or the other highlight moment when I thought ""Ok, that was actually amusing / cleverly written"" but these moments are in a massive minority.StoryNo lie, the plot is still there. But it has been pushed into the background so fragmented. 90% of all scenes are balanced either by comedy or by fan service. The plot amounts to 5% per season. And one cannot speak of a great plot so far anyway. However, there is at least potential behind it.Animation/pictures Nothing changed since season 2 and stayed mostly dull. You still go to great lengths to animate your breasts like excellent jelly. I can still see where the budget is going.CharactersThe new character is also superior to the protagonist duo. Basically, each supporting character is a much more interesting character than the two actual protagonists. And it was the same with the new elf. However, nothing has changed in terms of the characters, it\'s the same result as before.MusicThe Osts stayed the same. The intro was very weak this time. The first two seasons had a slightly more individual intro.ConclusionBelow-average performance no matter how I look at it.

Quite frankly, far from it, but from my personal perspective it\'s a corrective...experience to many things I felt were wrong with this anime.So, to the details:STORY (this will be longer than I usually give for a section):I\'ll minimize the spoiler for the previous season as much as I can, but I\'ll assume you already saw it so odds are you\'ll infer what I\'m talking about. If you don\'t want anything that could remotely spoil the previous season (keyword: PREVIOUS. No spoilers to this one) please skip to the art section.Sadly I didn\'t feel this season that there was an event that left me shocked like the event in the end of the episode where they entered the academy trying to burn it, but I\'ll admit, they improved. The story has a bit more depth to it (despite some irritating borderline-filler moments in the middle, more on that in the ""enjoyment"" section) and in hindsight the introduction of the key character in FnK\'s finale seems like a smart move, despite appearing controversial in the first half of the season.The main characters seem to act a lot more like an ensemble which I personally liked, because it seems to shed a light on some of the supporting characters as well and makes them crucial to the story. More on that later.The villains are still a bit boring compared to other anime of the same genre, however I do think that after the quality drop in season 2 they seemed to partly recover. It doesn\'t make up the fact they\'re boring and their scenes are boring to watch, but there is improvement and I hope it will improve even more in the final season.Another thing that bugged me is that this season, for the first time, there are minor plot holes. There are a couple of counterintuitive and counter-logical (if that\'s a real term) decisions made in this season that some viewers may find to be bizarre and annoying. And yet, somehow, despite the plot holes, many other things suddenly seem to finally make sense. One being the character of the relationship between Saito and Louise.Season finale is not very impressive this time, sadly didn\'t recreate season 1 properly, but considering the fact this probably builds up to the final season, I see it as a fair step.7/10.ART:I don\'t really see a big change excluding the one expected due to the season being released later in time. The sakuga isn\'t anything extraordinary here, but their background and location animation mildly improved.I gave the previous seasons 7/10, and even though there was slight improvement here, it\'s not enough to be worth an extra point this time. So 7/10 it is.SOUND:Kinda worsened. The voice acting of most characters is as great as usual, which is definitely a plus, but some side characters are kind of a let-down. Fortunately their screen time is extremely limited.I prefer the OP+ED songs of the previous seasons over this one\'s.The soundtrack in general was fine, but I had higher expectations. In season 2 they seemed to nail the soundtrack pretty well, and this time, in some very specific scenes, this pattern was sadly broken. They literally reuse the same BGMs as in the rest of the seasons and I myself could tell that a song didn\'t match.I may be generous here, but due to the mostly fine voice acting and bearable soundtrack I give this a passing grade. 6/10. Hope it\'ll get better next time.CHARACTER:Alright. It\'s very easy to impress me when it comes to characters after the clusterfuck that was season 2, but I genuinely can\'t understand why people don\'t see character development here.Let me start off with the characters that pissed me off the most last season - Siesta. It seems like it was at this part of writing the story where it was realized that the writer/s made a big mistake with Siesta, and now they seem to have not only gradually toned down her overly thirsty season 2 mentality, but also mix it with the storyline more elegantly.I LOVE where Saito and Louise are heading, both together and individually. Each one of them seems to reach some important conclusions they should have reached far earlier, especially Louise.Finally, unlike last season, the characters we know and like from season 1 are crucial again. I\'d even go as far as saying that aside the obvious couple leading the anime they seem to be a moving gear for the story. One character we\'re all familiar with goes through a huge development.The reason I decided to give this 7/10 is because I look at it in comparison to past seasons. It\'s not far better than season 1, but characters\' behavior seems to make sense overall, and even end up being relatable.In fact, maybe 7 is just a little bit too low, though 8 is too high in my opinion despite the great relationships and finally some sparks of depth after two entire seasons without it. So imagine it being sort of a 7.5/10.ENJOYMENT:I can\'t believe I\'m saying this, but except for the very unnecessary episode 6, I enjoyed this season a lot! I can\'t help it, despite the flaws it was just really fun to watch. Episode 7 was probably my favorite this season due to very nice combination of story elements, drama, and humor. Speaking of which - The humor is great this time and laughed more than in the past two combined which is extremely weird when taking into consideration that this is the most story-above-comedy oriented season yet.9/10, and they\'re lucky to not lose more points due to the uncalled for yuri-fest in ep6 (watch the last few minutes of it though, they\'re important).IN CONCLUSION; This season felt like it was trying to patch the wounds from season 2, and even though it has its weak spots and they\'re not hard to notice, the dots seem to finally start to connect, and the stage is ready and set for the finale.Final verdict - watch it, and if you\'re pessimistic just approach it with the thought that it\'s there to set the stage for the ultimate conclusion.Update after starting season 4: WATCH IT. IT\'S WORTH THE 4TH SEASON experience to many things I felt were wrong with this anime.So, to the details:STORY (this will be longer than I usually give for a section):I\'ll minimize the spoiler for the previous season as much as I can, but I\'ll assume you already saw it so odds are you\'ll infer what I\'m talking about. If you don\'t want anything that could remotely spoil the previous season (keyword: PREVIOUS. No spoilers to this one) please skip to the art section.Sadly I didn\'t feel this season that there was an event that left me shocked like the event in the end of the episode where they entered the academy trying to burn it, but I\'ll admit, they improved. The story has a bit more depth to it (despite some irritating borderline-filler moments in the middle, more on that in the ""enjoyment"" section) and in hindsight the introduction of the key character in FnK\'s finale seems like a smart move, despite appearing controversial in the first half of the season.The main characters seem to act a lot more like an ensemble which I personally liked, because it seems to shed a light on some of the supporting characters as well and makes them crucial to the story. More on that later.The villains are still a bit boring compared to other anime of the same genre, however I do think that after the quality drop in season 2 they seemed to partly recover. It doesn\'t make up the fact they\'re boring and their scenes are boring to watch, but there is improvement and I hope it will improve even more in the final season.Another thing that bugged me is that this season, for the first time, there are minor plot holes. There are a couple of counterintuitive and counter-logical (if that\'s a real term) decisions made in this season that some viewers may find to be bizarre and annoying. And yet, somehow, despite the plot holes, many other things suddenly seem to finally make sense. One being the character of the relationship between Saito and Louise.Season finale is not very impressive this time, sadly didn\'t recreate season 1 properly, but considering the fact this probably builds up to the final season, I see it as a fair step.7/10.ART:I don\'t really see a big change excluding the one expected due to the season being released later in time. The sakuga isn\'t anything extraordinary here, but their background and location animation mildly improved.I gave the previous seasons 7/10, and even though there was slight improvement here, it\'s not enough to be worth an extra point this time. So 7/10 it is.SOUND:Kinda worsened. The voice acting of most characters is as great as usual, which is definitely a plus, but some side characters are kind of a let-down. Fortunately their screen time is extremely limited.I prefer the OP+ED songs of the previous seasons over this one\'s.The soundtrack in general was fine, but I had higher expectations. In season 2 they seemed to nail the soundtrack pretty well, and this time, in some very specific scenes, this pattern was sadly broken. They literally reuse the same BGMs as in the rest of the seasons and I myself could tell that a song didn\'t match.I may be generous here, but due to the mostly fine voice acting and bearable soundtrack I give this a passing grade. 6/10. Hope it\'ll get better next time.CHARACTER:Alright. It\'s very easy to impress me when it comes to characters after the clusterfuck that was season 2, but I genuinely can\'t understand why people don\'t see character development here.Let me start off with the characters that pissed me off the most last season - Siesta. It seems like it was at this part of writing the story where it was realized that the writer/s made a big mistake with Siesta, and now they seem to have not only gradually toned down her overly thirsty season 2 mentality, but also mix it with the storyline more elegantly.I LOVE where Saito and Louise are heading, both together and individually. Each one of them seems to reach some important conclusions they should have reached far earlier, especially Louise.Finally, unlike last season, the characters we know and like from season 1 are crucial again. I\'d even go as far as saying that aside the obvious couple leading the anime they seem to be a moving gear for the story. One character we\'re all familiar with goes through a huge development.The reason I decided to give this 7/10 is because I look at it in comparison to past seasons. It\'s not far better than season 1, but characters\' behavior seems to make sense overall, and even end up being relatable.In fact, maybe 7 is just a little bit too low, though 8 is too high in my opinion despite the great relationships and finally some sparks of depth after two entire seasons without it. So imagine it being sort of a 7.5/10.ENJOYMENT:I can\'t believe I\'m saying this, but except for the very unnecessary episode 6, I enjoyed this season a lot!

IT\'S WORTH THE 4TH SEASON', ""Bwahahaha that pretty much sums up my feelings after the final episode. I've been following this series since the first season and let me just say this season has by far been the most funny if not the most irrelevant addition to the story line yet.Story- To understand where we are and everything that's happening you must have at least watched the first two seasons otherwise you'll have no idea about the whole atmosphere of this season. In terms of what this season added to the series...near nothing we moved a little forward.Art- I think well drawn and well animated I love the way magic...looks in this series and I love how we get a combination of new age and old age technology.Sound- Probably my least favorite opening and closings yet but it still has what I love best and that would be the killer voice acting which got me addicted to this series to begin with.Character- So we had some more character development this season which was good I always wanted to know more about some characters not to mention we had some new character introductions which in my opinion only made this season better.Enjoyment- If we're talking about how I enjoyed the comedy, romance, and drama of this season a ten would be my score however if we're talking about my enjoyment in terms of what was added to the storyline and how I felt things progressed a seven would be my score. This season was hilarious.Overall- I give this season an 8 although you didn't give me much to add to a storyline you more than did your part in making me laugh and reminding me why at first I thought this series was so funny. looks in this series and I love how we get a combination of new age and old age technology.Sound- Probably my least favorite opening and closings yet but it still has what I love best and that would be the killer voice acting which got me addicted to this series to begin with.Character- So we had some more character development this season which was good I always wanted to know more about some characters not to mention we had some new character introductions which in my opinion only made this season better.Enjoyment- If we're talking about how I enjoyed the comedy, romance, and drama of this season a ten would be my score however if we're talking about my enjoyment in terms of what was added to the storyline and how I felt things progressed a seven would be my score.

The formula still remains same in Zero no Tsukaima series with also some action packed scenario.What I liked about Zero no Tsukaima is the light-hearted mood it took, lots of indecent jokes and just the hilarity of its own stupidity. However, the third season of the series went just too far ... with everything.[STORY] 4- Probably the worst story in the series is really explained in only later 4-5 episodes whilst the others are mainly fillers or some pretty unnecessary stuff. The...thing about the story is that ... it\'s plain ridiculous, predictable and pretty annoying at the times. I won\'t talk much about it in fear that I might spoil something, but regardless, if you\'re a guy/girl who wants at least a decent story in an anime, run away from here. Seriously, run.[ART] 6- Art is actually fairly solid; it\'s the same as in previous seasons, but it does the job. Being probably the best aspect of the series, the fights are decently animated, the characters are different from one another, there are some beautiful sceneries and stuff like that. All in all, fairly decent.[SOUND] 5- Even though the opening and ending songs aren\'t much of my taste, they were quite good actually. Aside from that, there are some great background music which sometimes hits the mood and ... well sometimes it just fails. However, I found that the voices of the characters were immensely annoying (especially the one from Louise). I don\'t know whether it\'s just me or not, but it\'s like that.[CHARACTERS] 4- I\'m really not sure what kind of characters to expect when you embark yourself upon a journey for watching harem anime, but this show fails a lot in that aspect. The relationship between Saito and Louise was all cute in the season 1, bearable in season 3, but it\'s plain RETARDED in season 3. It\'s obvious that they\'re just dragging the series out to their maximum proportions, but that brings such failures to the light that you can\'t overlook them even if you want to. The characters might appear even worse than they are due to the story they\'re set in. Saito\'s harem keeps growing even though it shouldn\'t, he still likes big breasts, kissing every single girl he can, but, somehow, he still loves Louise. There\'s a silver lining called ""sense"" when creating a harem story and characters, but this Anime simply forgot that. Yes, most of the luvy-duvy situations are plain stupid and senseless. And those ""cute moments"" where we finally expect some kind of closure are just a waste of time for my eyes. They\'re on it like 2s and then someone comes knocking on without any apparent reason. I really wanted to like the characters, I really did, because in previous seasons they were quite fun to watch. However, all that “servant-master” thing had worn out even during the second season. It’s just plain stupid in this one …Don’t get me wrong; there are some likeable characters. There are few great developments regarding other characters, but the focus of the show, Saito and Louise is just embarrassing (and not as in “embarrassing to watch because of the awkwardness” … just embarrassing).I doubt I’ll force myself to go through the final season anytime soon because it’ll take some time to wash things out from this season.[ENJOYMENT] 4-You’d think that anyone could enjoy harem anime simply because it’s funny, right? Well, you’re wrong. Compared to the first 2 seasons, this season of the anime is simply stupid. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I failed at it – THERE’S ALMOST NOTHING TO GIVE YOU JOY. Maybe there are few moments with half-elf, later on with a dragon and its master, but that’s about it. It’s the same all over again – Louise and Saito seem to finally get things started, girl pops in, she leans her breasts on Saito, Saito blushes, Louise treats him like a dog – all through the 12 episodes. You can enjoy that, let’s say, in the first 2 episodes, but considering that that formula has been done in the past 24 episodes of the show, it’s really … bad. Up to this season, Zero no Tsukaima was one of my favorite (if not the favorite since I haven’t watched that much harem shows) harem anime and I deeply regret watching this season. I’ve read many reviews here that state that this is the worst seasons in the entire run, and I really have to agree. I can’t see how this show can get any worse … third season lost all of the anime’s charm, that goofiness and light-hearted story, and simply overdid the formula that was already overdone.[OVERALL] 4-I wanted to give it a higher grade, I really did because there were some really fun moments in the show, but it was impossible. Those few moments can’t make up for the rest of the show. There are only like 2-3 characters that I actually like now in the show (and one of them is the bad guy …), story is plain stupid, characters come back to life like in DBZ (again …) and the anime follows the same stupid formula that it had during the first 24 episodes of it. God damn it … it really makes me angry. The show could’ve been far greater if they only changed some things. Like, at the end of the second season, they could’ve emphasized the fact that Saito and Louse ARE MARRIED, they could’ve created a show where one fights for the one he loves without her harming him more than any of his foes. Bah … maybe those are just my expectations, but I really can’t understand why are there so many harem anime if they all use one formula. Cute or not, this season is by far the worst of the series. You can simply skip it and move onto the fourth one – I hear it’s a bit better than this crap.

Slayers Great,https://myanimelist.net/anime/868/Slayers_Great,"['I\'ve talked about The Slayers\xa0franchise twice before. Once with the first film and again with Slayers Return. Thus far, it\'s proven to be a solid franchise. Let\'s see if it can maintain that with our third look at one of their instalments.Story:We open with our heroine, Lina Inverse arriving at a town where they build golems with her frenemy, Naga the Serpent. They save a young girl from a rampaging mechanical bull and she insists on repaying them after their aggressive insistences that she doesn\'t need to do anything for them in return. The pair quickly find themselves caught up in a squabble between two...lords who both want to rule the city.The biggest issue in the film is probably that a lot of the ""twists"" are pretty obvious. But this is also one of those works where the plot isn\'t all that important. The japes and sense of humour are the main draws.Therein lies the strength of the film. The humour is pretty spot on. You can generally predict where the plot is going to go but the gags that are going to go with it aren\'t so readily pinpointed. Which does result in a viewing experience that\'s generally compelling, entertaining and pretty damn funny.Characters:One of the strongest element of these early instalments in the Slayers franchise\xa0is pretty definitively Lina & Naga\'s dynamic. The whole idea of them being not so friendly rivals who still journey and work together until it suits them not to leads to some really good comedic moments. They also do a good job of making the characters who exist solely for this film quirky enough to add to the entertainment without spending too much time with them and bogging the whole thing down.Art:The film looks quite nice. The characters are well drawn. It has strong visual gags. The action sequences flow really well. There are some nice details in the backgrounds. The only thing I\'m a bit on the fence about is that the more fan-servicey gags might be a bit much in this one to the point where they arguably cross over from jokes into just being fan-service.Sound:This is one of those works where you\'d have to have atrocious directing to go wrong with the cast. Hayashibara Megumi & Kawamura Maria reprise their roles as Lina and Naga. They continue to be fantastic. Our major supporting characters are voiced by Koyasu Takehito, Inoue Kikuko & Katou Seizou. All of whom do a great job. The soundtrack is also quite good. Particularly the ending theme tune, Reflection. Which, like most tunes n this franchise, is sung by Hayashibara Megumi. And, like those other songs, it\'s going on my MP3 player.Ho-yay:There really isn\'t any. I\'d make a joke about how Lina and Naga should just stop being tsundere towards each other and have lewd relations, but their relationship legitimately doesn\'t come across as being like that. Not that I\'d mind if their relationship was like that since the eventual ""romance"" we do get is kind of bad and that might be more palatable.Final Thoughts:Slayers Great\xa0is, ultimately, a very entertaining film with a strong sense of humour, great acting, great artwork & animation and strong comedic characters. In the end, I\'ll give it a solid 8/10. If you\'ve tried and enjoyed any of this franchise, this is for you.

I thought I might write a review for this anime, since nobody else has.Slayers Great is the third Slayers movie (and the fourth Slayers installment to feature the voluptuous Naga overall), and I must say that while I feel the movies and OVAs didn't capture the magic in the same way the series did, this movie scratched an itch...at least for me.The story has the same hilarity and spectacle as a typical higher-tier Slayers story. Two golems, one modeled after Lina and one modeled after Naga, duking it out? You better believe it's a classic.As for the...art, I feel the art was pretty good on this OVA. The fluidity has stepped up since last time, so that's a step up. I would give a decent score to the art.When it comes to the sound, I loved it. I especially loved the hollow, jazzy music that played at the start of the aforementioned golem fight. The rest of the soundtrack is very whimsical as well. The non-musical sounds, such as the ambient bird sounds, were worthy of praise too. All around, this anime was an aural pleasure.What do we have for characters? Well, we have Lina and Naga, who are funny as always. When it comes to the unique characters, we have the timid Laia, who takes delight in the madness all around her. We also have Laia's father, a golem sculptor, and her brother, also a golem sculptor. Watching the two clash might hit home for some viewers, but the two are idiots and not that different from each other. There's also these two kings, and I won't say much about them, except that they looked like they walked straight out of a circus.All in all, this is a fun romp that is a microcosm of Slayers at its best. The golem fight, which I know I keep bringing up but it's the focal point of the entire movie, captures all the high-flying action and gut-busting hilarity we know and love.If you have the time (it's only an hour), I would recommend checking this one out. It really lives up to its name, because it's pretty great. art, I feel the art was pretty good on this OVA. The fluidity has stepped up since last time, so that's a step up.

It's completely detached from reality; we got to a point where the gags happen for the sake of gags and the plot progresses just because it has to. You can clearly see it in the designs and the dialogue too; there are no real stakes or motivation. Hell, I'd rather have Rezo show up again, at least he had a motivation and a proper goal! Flawed as it blalantly was, they used it to the show's advantage! Nothing so far, in terms of writing, has been used to enrich Lina's world or...to at least create a one-shot movie that can stand on its own. Being unrelated to the main story is not enough, any movie needs to be complete in terms or writing and by that I mean that the characters must be realistic and humane, otherwise any story quickly becomes dated at best. The only human characteristic Lina and Naga have are their unsatisfiable greed; everything else was written to make nerds giggle, not to move people in any way.If I had to compare it to anything it would be Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus. Both are fun and colourful films, but both feel like the franchise had lost plenty of steam by that point.This also came out a mere MONTH after The End of Evangelion. I'm only bringing this up since they decided to parody mecha this time. Asuka fighting the mass production EVAs has NOTHING compared to the grand duel in Slayers Great! And yes, said duel takes up roghly the second half of the movie.Can't really complain since I've wanted to see Slayers for the longest time and hey, about time I did it! I'm only disappointed the movies have turned out to be subpar so far. The second one I wouldn't mind rewatching (especially if I was a kid) and maybe the third one every other year (only if I was a kid), but so far only the original show seemed to stand out to me. What it lacked in animation made up in superior writing; it wasn't the best anime by a long shot and it may seem dated or cliche to some folks, but I think it held up well and it was fun! So far, the movies leave quite a lot to be desired. to at least create a one-shot movie that can stand on its own. Being unrelated to the main story is not enough, any movie needs to be complete in terms or writing and by that I mean that the characters must be realistic and humane, otherwise any story quickly becomes dated at best. The only human characteristic Lina and Naga have are their unsatisfiable greed; everything else was written to make nerds giggle, not to move people in any way.If I had to compare it to anything it would be Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus. Both are fun and colourful films, but both feel like the franchise had lost plenty of steam by that point.This also came out a mere MONTH after The End of Evangelion. I'm only bringing this up since they decided to parody mecha this time. Asuka fighting the mass production EVAs has NOTHING compared to the grand duel in Slayers Great!

Smile Precure! Movie: Ehon no Naka wa Minna Chiguhagu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15307/Smile_Precure_Movie__Ehon_no_Naka_wa_Minna_Chiguhagu,"[""Time for Smile Precure to tell another fairy tale with its movie, and what an enjoyable one it was!After a mysterious girl called Nico appeared, the main cast from this entry end up visiting the picture book world, a place where stories like Cinderella or Momotaro can be seen and experienced from the perspective of the characters. However, things start to get weird in their stories, and it's up to the girls to discover why and deal with that.The main focus of the story is on Nico and the protagonist of Smile, Miyuki, and the connection they have with each other. Even if I think...that Nico isn't that developed (which is totally understandable considering her position as a character from a picture book, mostly focused on giving a moral for the story, something she has) this movie still delivers hard with the emotional value of their bond, providing moments deserving of some tears. The rest of the girls get their fair share of screentime but aren't given memorable scenes (other than showing that they love Miyuki, who doesn't?) Meanwhile, poor Candy is just there.Art and sound are the standard of Smile, providing nice songs and moments of great animation between the always solid look of the series.Overall it was a fun movie with unexpected extra feels and well worth watching alongside the TV series, 7.5/10 from my part and I can easily see myself rewatching this in the future. that Nico isn't that developed (which is totally understandable considering her position as a character from a picture book, mostly focused on giving a moral for the story, something she has) this movie still delivers hard with the emotional value of their bond, providing moments deserving of some tears.

The issue was that Nico\'s story (of being trapped in the Demon King\'s castle) was unfinished (the pages were torn out), so Miyuki decided to finish the story but apparently gave up after being unable to. Back to the present, the Cures go to a Picture Book Festival which just so happens to be in town and see a movie about Nico. She comes out of the movie with some demons,...which fight the Cures with a huge bag that sucks stuff up (literally), but the girls fight and rescue Nico. She rewards them with a trip to the World of Picture Books, and....honestly, this honestly feels REALLY contrived, seeing as there\'s already a HUGE crossover between picture books and fairytales, but there\'s even more mythological and fairytale references in this movie than the series itself. The issue is that most of them might not be well-known enough to the west; for instance, Akane becomes ""The One-Inch Tall Man,"" Nao becomes Urashima Taro, and Reika becomes Momotarou. I\'m not sure how wide the crossover between ""magical girl fans"" and ""ancient Japanese fairytale fans"" is, but I\'m guessing....not that high, considering this series is aimed at little girls, who likely wouldn\'t even know those stories to begin with, let alone that they\'re essentially being parodied. Eventually, the stories begin to fall apart, with the real protagonists of the respective stories appearing in the wrong stories; they become angry at and blame the girls, who wind up in a conveniently five-way connected open desert-like ring. Also, Cinderella is GIANT for some reason. Nico appears, revealing she\'s the antagonist responsible for causing everything. But not really. It\'s actually Miyuki\'s fault you see, for not finishing her fairytale. Because the word of a five-year-old should always be taken to heart, yes....Anyway, she uses her angst of being trapped in the castle with the Demon King to justify tormenting the girls, since Miyuki\'s refusal to finish the story apparently set off a chain reaction that dismantled the logic of other fairy ta-You know what, this is the suspension of disbelief. I don\'t even know if I can believe in the main conflict anymore; either that, or Nico did all of this as an act of petty revenge to ""take away Miyuki\'s smile"" and hate her. Miyuki\'s friends give her a pick-me-up speech and convince her to apologize and get Nico to forgive her. Honestly, I think both of them should be apologizing over how little this plot was even explained; it wasn\'t even mentioned why the pages were ripped out, why the books were being put for charity, or why Miyuki seemingly forgot about this entire plot for about 9 years. They have a fight against all the story antagonists in the Demon King\'s castle (who grows stronger and is possessing Nico), though they\'re helped by the ""Cow King"" from a story I can\'t remember the name of and Miyuki gets to apologize to an unwilling Nico, saying Nico taught her to remember how to smile. It\'s nice but it doesn\'t exactly do the plot justice. Eventually, she realizes Miyuki\'s true feelings just in time for the Demon King to betray her and attack Nico. Miyuki pulls a Tuxedo Mask and saves her at the last second, getting herself injured as Nico mouths ""I love you."" Since the Royal Rainbow Burst failed, everyone uses their MacGuffins Miracle Lights to power up Miyuki into ULTRA MIYUKI, aka Ultra Cure Happy. She saves the Demon King with her friends, who reverts to a little shadow-like form seen earlier, and he gets to live in harmony, with Nico apologizing and telling Miyuki she loves her again. (Miyuki was unconscious the first time.) Miyuki cries and we get a nice happy ending...Except not really. A lot of the things in the movie were left unexplained or weren\'t really given the amount of detail they deserved, and the Demon King should probably be reworked completely in my opinion. It wasn\'t the worst movie I\'ve ever seen, but for Precure, I somewhat had my standards high for this movie, and I suppose that was my mistake. Nevertheless, while I did appreciate the references to various fairytales, many of these references would likely be lost on western viewers, unless one was either raised in Japan or actively researched to learn about these fields. Overall, in my opinion, the movie is too niche in order to fulfill the impact it likely wishes to create. 6/10! which fight the Cures with a huge bag that sucks stuff up (literally), but the girls fight and rescue Nico.

Last time I seen this movie was four years ago, it was amazing movie to watch. Especially with Nico, Nico looks amazing character with great potential, even Miyuki/Cure Happy's Movie-exclusive powerup was amazing to see! I definitely recommend this movie.Story was all good about children's picture books, Miyuki was a cinderella, Akane was one inch boy, Yayoi is Sun Wukong, Nao was Urashima Taro and Reika was Momotaro. The story was fun to watch for the movie, If you watched Smile Precure then this movie will make you feel enjoyed around! ""]"

No real story, terrible writing AND so many plot holes ???I feel like they tried to make every character have some sort of character growth, but in the end they didn\'t address any internal problems everyone had, except for the main character.And also why does this have the tag of ""slice of life"" that makes no sense.Something that also bothers me is that this anime had 15 episodes and half...of them where just fillers to make ""memories"" for characters so they could somehow make an emotional ending. terrible ending by the way.Anyways, the characters are still cute and the concept of buddhism/spirit/magic/underworld is cool too. of them where just fillers to make ""memories"" for characters so they could somehow make an emotional ending. terrible ending by the way.Anyways, the characters are still cute and the concept of buddhism/spirit/magic/underworld is cool too.', ""This isn't even the real 'the daily life of the immortal king'. What can i say? When you want to make 'Justice League' out of 'Courage the Cowardly dog' then you will get abomination like this. Dude i read the novel and it was nothing like this. Yes, you don't need to follow the original but you still can't change your root completely and this was just that.Let's list the cons*There is no romance in the novel, or should i say not so early. Even if there is romance, it will be brushed away in a comedic undertone. That's how it should be. Man,...do they even know what slice of life means? They made 'star wars' in 'simpson'.* The original Wang Ling cares only about keeping his powers check and his noddles. And the story revolves how the adversary keeps poking mc, only to get squashed and that results in more pain in the neck for mc, all in a comedic undertone. And they made this 'romeo and juliet' somehow.*This story somewhat follows upto the six assassins part after that all made up. Even those parts are poorly done. They rushed through the main punchlines like the frog summon or frog test, the novel was hilarious there. Also the limited sword part, they changed the original to mama Wang buying a cheap one. The real one was way more funny, go check no spoilers.* Character? Like i said, Wang ling only likes his noddles and he doesn't care about nakama bullshit. And they made this shounen which is a disgrace. Lotus sun or the heroine is kind in rivalry with mc, but they made her a direct romance target from the start.*Lot more can be said about how they changed the theme altogether. Even if i ignore the novel, the work is not done well that much either. For example, what is 59 or 60 high school? How this happened? Assuming that's the plot, and 59 and 60 being rivals how did 59 get 60's data instantly as if they are the main organization overseeing the data. And what about sword spirit? Why did they introduce it when they weren't used that much at all. Only the class president's were used. I can nitpick more but that's the gist without mention the novel.Art is good like all Chinese animations. They had budget unlike most poor cheap ass Japanese productions. But the industry is shallow because of their inexperience and greed. Do you think people will jump into an unknown anime if they didn't hear about the novel first?

Because it is near impossible to follow and you need to throw your sanity away to care.The show throws in the idea that this is basically suppose to be a comedy with extreme magic. With all personalities over the top except the main character. However, it\'s played off poorly and it just ends up with the other character\'s personality is only...praising him for literally no reason. Which makes no sense as the show sets it up so that no one knows he\'s ""powerful"" and if they do he memory wipes them.[ For example, the main girl fell in love with him for no reason except he touched the side of her face and was zoning out in class. ]He shows disinterest in everything, but doesn\'t ever put any effort into avoiding things. The whole show is basically following a boy with op powers just cause? The most he\'ll do is just some memory wipe. But even that doesn\'t work cause the characters will mention it again in the future.----All in all:This anime can\'t figure out its own guidelines for the characters and the story.

How can i tell that they ""pretend""? Well ez: they say things like ""If you want something similar watch Saiki K."" (Truthfully one of my most favorite and objectively best anime ever with some of the best Comedy in all of Media.)The start: the anime starts out like Saiki K. It has an overpowered protagonist that doesnt want/need his power. At first mainly the animations hooked me to this point. It clearly does a worse job than Saiki...K. at establishing his character at this point of the story as Saiki as an example doesn\'t really need his power AT ALL. He is in a world of humans. He is also not a god but has just a plethera of abilities that just make his life boring. Yare yare..But let me shock you all by making a 180° turn: this anime but shines in all the aspects Saiki K. just brutaly failed. To this conclusion i only came to after the 14. Episode of this anime.To further make my point without spoiling too much i wan\'t to point out to what conclusion i came after talking about this show with a friend.There are a lot of overpowered Main anime leads out there. Most of the people that watched this specific show will also probably have come across at least a handful of these. They all are similar in the way that the one super special girl is in love with the lead but he is just too motherf****** powerful for his life and just either doesn\'t care about his entourage bc his purpose is above their existence or his life - to which they belog - is just overall too boring. Btw the whamen is always in love with this neutral-hearted dud bc he just ignores her at first sight.This anime starts out as exactly that. If it weren\'t for the tasty af animations up to the last 3 episodes one would probably not even stick around for that long.That leads me to exactly .. the point that makes this Anime all the much better. Wait. for. it. In a way there IS a real similarity to Saiki K. That would be that it takes on it\'s genre fellows. But not in a comedic way as Saiki K does it .. or Gintama as the most iconic example .. but in a serious way. If i may throw this in: just as MAGIC GIRL MADOKA !! Also one of the objectively best and one of my favorite shows out there.The essence of these anime is not something like overall insane Stories. It\'s not that they pull out a theme insanely well like what you\'D say about GOT for example. No it\'s much rather that they manage to get.. serious. Serious and that not right off the bat .. but progressively.. rather surprisingly. Basically it\'s a to the ground taking unexpected turn of events that comes in an unexpected manner because it takes place in a genre where it\'s just so unusual. Actually numerous of my favorite and objectively best shows do something like that. Madoka, this anime, Re:Zero, overly cautious hero, Watchmen (the movie o b v i o u s l y). There are probably many i don\'t know, some i forget and of course, i leave out all the cemodic approach anime.I don\'t want to stick around the point for any longer. But it is essential bc it is the reason some of the top comments just wont get in my head. How can one even COMPARE this anime to Saiki when it\'s approch is completely differen??So now i just want to spill out a couple of amazing or a bit bugging things about the show in some flow without major reasoning about them or so:the characters are decent which is even better for the climax, the audio is .. weird at best as it\'s often times not really ambient which jap anime seem to do a much better job at, the animations are too gorgeous - i could talk about some specific scenes which completely blew my mind as if it were a movie -, i very much enjoyed the kind of out of nowhere scientific approach the anime had from times to times (which further enhanced the serious aspect of the show and made even more.. close to the heart.. or feels.), the end feels weird in a way where you would expect a 2nd season but i very much doubt this shows has an even greater climax in store for us, the soundtrack is awesome but could be a bit less generic outside of the fight-scenes and last but not least i loved the anime but only after the 14th episode which can either mean that it was all the more great story telling (my opinion and.. pretty much indubitable) or you could make the point that it\'s maybe a bad thing because some of the audience might\'ve dropped at that point.If you red this all.. wow. I just wish one could comment down below the reviews whichever you want to debate on.. but eh. This might reach someone. Have yourself a wonderful day or whatever time :D.

This one makes it feel like chinese animation is really making strides, and that they can make good quality animation if they wanted to. Im really impressed with the animation.

The voice acting is pretty good also.

But if you don\'t follow wuxia or xianxia, it might be hard to understand some of the jokes that are made.', ""Generally I really like series that have an insanely OP lead, because they usually make for some cheap and simple entertainment. This show did the very opposite of entertaining me, and from my own experience I would give it a 3. However, I realised I watched a very shitty sub so, assuming the original version and other subs have coherent sentences, I'll raise that to a 5. On to the actual review.Story: 3The idea is pretty good, but the execution is terrible. The story is completely filled with plot holes and irrational decisions just to move the story forward: Let's seal this defeated demon king...up under a school, yep that sounds like a great decision. Oh, and let's use him as an entrance exam! Great way to show how OP the MC is - but WHO THE FUCK would ever do that. A teacher of the opposing school almost killed a student who then literally disappears before their match in some kind of tournament? Sucks for you, guess that opposing school is going to win because that's definitely not something they'll be disqualified for, or the tournament will be cancelled for. Nope, the show must go on or our dumb plot wouldn't work out. There's a bunch more dumb shit like this, so if you're easily annoyed by randomly pushing the plot forward, you're in for a treat.Characters: 4The MC's main 'thing' is that he either doesn't want to or can't use his insane powers - which, IMO, is a weird call. The main attraction of a show with an OP lead is that character being badass - making him do nothing whenever he could do something to help is uhm, not a great way to make a likeable character.Apart from this, character development isn't nonexistent. A total of 4 characters have some kind of character development (the side characters definitely don't). Some of this is decent, but there's so much irrational forced behaviour that it still doesn't deserve a passing grade. Especially when some girl completely falls in love because a dude touches her hair deserves an award in this category. No, I'm not talking a crush, she'd die for him. Yeahhhh, sure.Art: 7Nothing special, but definitely not bad either. I'm honestly not too good at ranking the art, but it didn't bother me.Sound: 7Personally, I am not used to Chinese yet, which made the sound somewhat annoying for me. Disregarding my very subjective opinion about that though, the sound is , just like the art, not bothersome but also nothing special.Enjoyment: 4At the end of the 13th episode I'd have given enjoyment a solid one, but the ending was actually pretty cool so it ended on a good note: +2. I also raised it with one more because I probably found the most infuriating sub there exists for this series.Overal: 5I definitely did not enjoy watching this series. If you're into OP characters, consider if one somewhat epic scene at the end is worth suffering through 14 episodes for. If you're not at all bothered by weird rationale and a plot that just does whatever, you might as well give this a shot. If you don't speak Chinese definitely do take your time to find a decent sub though... up under a school, yep that sounds like a great decision. Oh, and let's use him as an entrance exam! Great way to show how OP the MC is - but WHO THE FUCK would ever do that. A teacher of the opposing school almost killed a student who then literally disappears before their match in some kind of tournament? Sucks for you, guess that opposing school is going to win because that's definitely not something they'll be disqualified for, or the tournament will be cancelled for. Nope, the show must go on or our dumb plot wouldn't work out. There's a bunch more dumb shit like this, so if you're easily annoyed by randomly pushing the plot forward, you're in for a treat.Characters: 4The MC's main 'thing' is that he either doesn't want to or can't use his insane powers - which, IMO, is a weird call. The main attraction of a show with an OP lead is that character being badass - making him do nothing whenever he could do something to help is uhm, not a great way to make a likeable character.Apart from this, character development isn't nonexistent. A total of 4 characters have some kind of character development (the side characters definitely don't). Some of this is decent, but there's so much irrational forced behaviour that it still doesn't deserve a passing grade. Especially when some girl completely falls in love because a dude touches her hair deserves an award in this category. No, I'm not talking a crush, she'd die for him. Yeahhhh, sure.Art: 7Nothing special, but definitely not bad either. I'm honestly not too good at ranking the art, but it didn't bother me.Sound: 7Personally, I am not used to Chinese yet, which made the sound somewhat annoying for me. Disregarding my very subjective opinion about that though, the sound is , just like the art, not bothersome but also nothing special.Enjoyment: 4At the end of the 13th episode I'd have given enjoyment a solid one, but the ending was actually pretty cool so it ended on a good note: +2. I also raised it with one more because I probably found the most infuriating sub there exists for this series.Overal: 5I definitely did not enjoy watching this series. If you're into OP characters, consider if one somewhat epic scene at the end is worth suffering through 14 episodes for. If you're not at all bothered by weird rationale and a plot that just does whatever, you might as well give this a shot.

Quan Zhi Gao Shou. enough with the animation.the only anime that i like chinese. Quan Zhi Gao Shou.', ""If you've ever read any of my anime reviews, you'll know how they usually go. But this one is gonna be slightly different. Kinda because of how bad it was, and kinda because I am lazy.The main problem with this anime lies in the animation, the plot devices, and the characters. Which is basically the whole anime. If you don't know the gist of this anime, its basically the OP MC genre. And I've watched hella OP MC anime. I enjoy OP MC anime. But this particular anime really just doesn't offer anything story wise. So lets go through that.1. Plot devices- The...main plot device, and one that I hate after watching this, is the MC's forgetting art which basically forces the people around him to completely forget that he is extremely OP. However, while this provides some logical backing to the other characters not seeing how OP he is, it really is infuriating that the MC has to do this, essentially making every plot movement redundant and as if it never happened. Without any movement, the story doesn't go anywhere and you get an extremely boring story. Even in other generic OP MC anime there's some form of plot advancement, usually centered around the OP MC slowly being recognized as overpowered. However, with this forgetting art plot device, there is none of that in this particular anime. Which for me constitutes a huge problem in how the story is allowed to flow: its basically not.2. Characters: The characters themselves are also relatively bland, and the MC himself is a prime example of this. The fact that he has to keep his powers sealed (despite them leaking out) makes for a very poor character as there is again, no movement with his character. The supporting cast is entirely static, or makes little progress in terms of character. The MC himself is also poorly done, a completely nihilistic and unlikeable MC.3. Art: although the art is relatively good, the colors sound (albeit slightly bland), the animation and action scenes are sparse and poorly done. One thing with OP MC anime is that they do get carried by the animation and really good fight scenes because OP MC anime already have pretty basic storylines, thus they have to appeal to the audience in different ways. And of course, one of the things people like to see with these types of anime is how the MC is going to smack down his opponents. However, there is almost none of that in this story, which leaves the audience feeling empty without it and makes the story visually boring.Other notes:- The music is good, nothing to write home about though.- The world-building is pretty good though, the city and the back story is good.- the fourth wall breaking humor, although slightly overdone, is not too bad and is relatively good taste.- This anime is done completely in Chinese, and as someone who speaks Chinese, this didn't bother me in the slightest. However, worth noting if you're expecting JP language.- This was so unenjoyable in fact, that i watched this in 1.5x for about 10 episodes. unfortunate for someone who really does enjoy the OP MC genre.OVERALL: 4Grading this, it would be 2 for world building +1 for art and + 1 for comedy for a total score of 4.I would avoid this anime, or at the very least be very apprehensive about trying it. It does hook you in well, but after the 2nd episode it does nosedive in quality and enjoyment. main plot device, and one that I hate after watching this, is the MC's forgetting art which basically forces the people around him to completely forget that he is extremely OP.

However, I enjoy the cultivation genre overall so I make sure to keep an eye out for new releases. Out of all the Chinese anime I've seen so far I can say this one certainly has come the closest to traditional Japanese anime in how they handle production. No crappy 3D, and the drawing is up to a level where it doesn't hurt your eyes to watch. Voice acting still leaves a lot to be desired but I can chalk this up to not being used to listening to...Chinese voice acting yet. My only main complaint production wise is for the subtitling,I've checked several sites online but from episode 3 onward there seems to be a consistently terrible subtitling on the episodes. If you can get around this then the series may be worth watching.I dropped the series when I saw the terrible subtitles however I feel as if I would've dropped it anyway regardless. The series got a few giggles out of me here and there but overall it just didn't grip me and it seemed to get less interesting as time went on. HOWEVER, what really made me drop the series was plain and simple. I suddenly realized that the cast and characters and even the setting minus the cultivation world - as well as all the gags were simply Chinese renditions of Saiki Kusuo no Psi Nan. I decided then and there that it wasn't worth my time. As for what you do with your time, that's up to you to decide. Chinese voice acting yet.

I wish I could take back my time to have completed a different show.', ""This review contains spoilers.I don't know where to start with this review. In all honesty, I enjoyed the first episodes and found it humorous. I've seen numerous of reviews claiming it to be very similar to The Disastrous Life of Saiki-K which is what got me originally invested in this show. But unfortunately, this is not even remotely close Saiki-K.The first episodes of this anime were really enjoyable and fun to watch but as you progress more with the show, you get less invested because it feels as if you were lied to. The humor in this show is more or less forced and...in one episode, they repeat the same joke throughout the whole duration of the episode. I'm talking about that one episode where the MC went on a date and was protecting his classmate.Most of this show has MC very stagnant and not doing anything. Episode 9-11 are a great example of that. I get it, the MC is trying to avoid problems and is pretending to be the weakest character, his seal is also damaged so this is why he has to be extra careful however his actions barely make any sense. He could have come up with more clever ways to avoid that tournament and get in less problems. He could have been more careful with his seal, if he knows what damage could be done to the world. He can also use his communication skills to communicate with others and at the very least hint that he's a demi-god. In general, the MC of this show is pretty dumb for being a demi-god. It's also hinted that he can read other people's minds, I only understood that part in episode 11 where he said that he couldn't read someone's mind. Honestly, it would be great if the show did less ass-pulls and revealed all his abilities at the start. It feels as if they're making up his powers as they go.As for the plot, there is very little substance to it. The only story that is being told in this anime is perhaps the one where the girl (I don't even remember her name despite watching 11 episodes as of writing this review) is being targeted by professional hitmen. Everything else is just slice of life with pseudo-humor and mediocre action. It's also noticeable that they're trying to pan out the run time of each episode, because there is no story to tell and if they were trying to tell the aforementioned story, it could have been done in 3-4 episodes.The characters of this show are really, really bad. There is little to no character development whatsoever. It's established very early on that the main character is a demi-god and there is no one stronger than him. He tries to avoid any problems by faking and making it look like he's the weakest person. This is where a lot of the viewers draw parallels to Saiki-K but they're missing one important detail. Saiki actually does something all the time. To avoid getting in any problems, he has to come up with insane ways of helping his friends and/or distance himself from them. Saiki is an introverted character and dislikes contact with people, he enjoys spending time by himself. This cannot be said for the main character of this show, because the main character lacks any sort of personality and is just the strongest. He doesn't do anything and remains stagnant for almost the entirety of the show. The other characters are there as comic reliefs or just to progress the plot. There are many times something happens for the sake of happening without any actual reason. The girl has fallen in love with the main character for almost no reason. The only reason is that he looked at her and helped her like once or twice. The others became friends with him because he helped them out.Another annoying thing I've noticed in episode 10-11, is the fact that they start randomly telling the antagonist's backstory about her and her relationship with the teacher. That felt unnecessary, boring and forced. The authors/writers/whoever came up with this garbage of a show have put almost no effort in writing their characters, let alone the villain. We don't get any prior knowledge about the villain, why she wants to kill the girl or anything like that. Maybe the writers of this show could have put a little bit of effort in at least writing a half-decent villain that doesn't follow all the standard villain tropes. It honestly feels that the villain is just evil for the sake of being evil. And that comes from a person who's watched 11 episodes of this show. I mean sure, you could have a mysterious villain who pulls all the strings but make sure to at least write it into the show.I get it, it's supposed to be a comedy type of show but it honestly feels that the show gets confused whether it wants to be a comedy show, an action show, a romantic-comedy show or whatever it tries being. Usually, when mixing such genres, you need to be very experienced in all the three of these genres to make something really great and enjoyable. The enjoyment in this show is dreadful with nothing of importance being done or shown in each episode. In the beginning, I thought this would be similar to Saiki, a demi-god human who has to hide his powers and his identity I could see the similarities but alas nothing more than that similarity at the beginning of the show. You can't really mix action, romcom and just comedy, fail at all three and them claim it's a comedy only show.What I really loved in this show was their effort of world-building. They have put a lot of thought in making a futuristic society with magic & tech being combined and used in their daily lives. The smaller details such as swords and such being used as vehicles and means of transportation is also genius and very creative.One thing that is enjoyable in this show though is the art. The art and animation really amazed me. The character designs are really good and don't follow your standard anime template. I was impressed with the art and animation because this was produced outside of Japan, this is a Chinese anime. I really like their visualizations of demons, magic seals and artifacts. The sound is however pretty meh.Overall, I didn't find this show as enjoyable as I thought I would. I felt lied to after watching 7 episodes. I waited and waited for it to become somewhat similar to Saiki, with the outlandish and eccentric characters, with the very clever humor and everything that made Saiki great. But that didn't happen. Instead I got a show that is boring, lacks any comedy despite being a comedy show and a really thin story with poorly written characters. I admit, I expected too much by thinking it was going to be like Saiki, not everything can be great. in one episode, they repeat the same joke throughout the whole duration of the episode. I'm talking about that one episode where the MC went on a date and was protecting his classmate.Most of this show has MC very stagnant and not doing anything. Episode 9-11 are a great example of that. I get it, the MC is trying to avoid problems and is pretending to be the weakest character, his seal is also damaged so this is why he has to be extra careful however his actions barely make any sense. He could have come up with more clever ways to avoid that tournament and get in less problems. He could have been more careful with his seal, if he knows what damage could be done to the world. He can also use his communication skills to communicate with others and at the very least hint that he's a demi-god. In general, the MC of this show is pretty dumb for being a demi-god. It's also hinted that he can read other people's minds, I only understood that part in episode 11 where he said that he couldn't read someone's mind. Honestly, it would be great if the show did less ass-pulls and revealed all his abilities at the start. It feels as if they're making up his powers as they go.As for the plot, there is very little substance to it. The only story that is being told in this anime is perhaps the one where the girl (I don't even remember her name despite watching 11 episodes as of writing this review) is being targeted by professional hitmen. Everything else is just slice of life with pseudo-humor and mediocre action. It's also noticeable that they're trying to pan out the run time of each episode, because there is no story to tell and if they were trying to tell the aforementioned story, it could have been done in 3-4 episodes.The characters of this show are really, really bad. There is little to no character development whatsoever. It's established very early on that the main character is a demi-god and there is no one stronger than him. He tries to avoid any problems by faking and making it look like he's the weakest person. This is where a lot of the viewers draw parallels to Saiki-K but they're missing one important detail. Saiki actually does something all the time. To avoid getting in any problems, he has to come up with insane ways of helping his friends and/or distance himself from them. Saiki is an introverted character and dislikes contact with people, he enjoys spending time by himself. This cannot be said for the main character of this show, because the main character lacks any sort of personality and is just the strongest. He doesn't do anything and remains stagnant for almost the entirety of the show. The other characters are there as comic reliefs or just to progress the plot. There are many times something happens for the sake of happening without any actual reason. The girl has fallen in love with the main character for almost no reason. The only reason is that he looked at her and helped her like once or twice. The others became friends with him because he helped them out.Another annoying thing I've noticed in episode 10-11, is the fact that they start randomly telling the antagonist's backstory about her and her relationship with the teacher. That felt unnecessary, boring and forced. The authors/writers/whoever came up with this garbage of a show have put almost no effort in writing their characters, let alone the villain. We don't get any prior knowledge about the villain, why she wants to kill the girl or anything like that. Maybe the writers of this show could have put a little bit of effort in at least writing a half-decent villain that doesn't follow all the standard villain tropes. It honestly feels that the villain is just evil for the sake of being evil. And that comes from a person who's watched 11 episodes of this show. I mean sure, you could have a mysterious villain who pulls all the strings but make sure to at least write it into the show.I get it, it's supposed to be a comedy type of show but it honestly feels that the show gets confused whether it wants to be a comedy show, an action show, a romantic-comedy show or whatever it tries being. Usually, when mixing such genres, you need to be very experienced in all the three of these genres to make something really great and enjoyable. The enjoyment in this show is dreadful with nothing of importance being done or shown in each episode. In the beginning, I thought this would be similar to Saiki, a demi-god human who has to hide his powers and his identity I could see the similarities but alas nothing more than that similarity at the beginning of the show. You can't really mix action, romcom and just comedy, fail at all three and them claim it's a comedy only show.What I really loved in this show was their effort of world-building. They have put a lot of thought in making a futuristic society with magic & tech being combined and used in their daily lives. The smaller details such as swords and such being used as vehicles and means of transportation is also genius and very creative.One thing that is enjoyable in this show though is the art. The art and animation really amazed me. The character designs are really good and don't follow your standard anime template.

The entire story revolves around the MC with zero personality.  He just wants peace and strives for nothing.  He has no goals/motivations/purpose.  Any development that happens... gets reverted back.  So much for development.  Maybe there is development after 9 episodes, but I got more disappointed and upset after every episode.2. Characters: 2/10The main female protagonist pisses me off.  She falls in love with him because of a simple magic dispersing spell that left her breathless....I understand this is bias on my part because I try hard to get a girlfriend, yet this MC does basically nothing and has this beautiful female lead drooling over him.  The teachers piss me off the most.  In episode 9, they have the most retarded role.... they do nothing against the out of control villain.  They just stand there and watch?  In the last two episodes, they were hyped up as this strong powerful and righteous teacher....3. Art: 7/10The art is good4. Sound: 0/10.  Although most of the sound is okay, some of it is unforgivable.  For example, when they cast magic and thunder or fire strikes, I expect an exciting sound.

While Saiki is one of my favorites, and a hilarious episodic anime that gradually develops its characters, Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo focuses more on drama, emotions, and the fighting aspect of its xianxia genre. I am certainly not accustomed with cultivation and chinese mythology, but I still found this donghua to be enjoyable.STORY: The entire story feels relatively drawn out of context.

The show hits typical shounen tropes: special main character with world destroying powers; powers supressed by a seal; gains friends that changes his outlook; school battle arc.As the main character has to supress his emotions to supress his powers, it's hard to root or even find him likeable. You don't feel a connection with the other characters either. You also don't get a sense of a story as events just kind of happen. The inconsistencies...stops you from feeling invested and it's hard buy the bond or friendship that is supposed to develop between the characters. The characters just all feel a bit wishy-washy and underdeveloped.That is until the last few episodes when it does get good.

And it felt quite out of place, and I may not be an expert, but even though it was Chinese-produced I felt like they were emulating a lot of Japanese vibes and styles. Out of place I would put it.

But, I suspect in China this tv show was significantly more popular.Overall: 7/10Nearing the end of 2021 (almost 2 years after release), this anime still looks a heck ton better than other anime out there. Which was expected from the art cover. But better does not always equate ""great"", it looked fine, it got the story rolling which really mattered. The motions and timing, mainly for mouthing, are slight off at times or just really low frame rated I suppose, cuz it got ugly at times. Sometimes it would seem the animators got lazy and got characters speaking with their mouths closed. Noticeably, I must add. For me, it\'s the little things that matter.Art: 7/10I have to say, the opening theme sounded and looked quite nice. The storyline was alright, the pacing could perhaps been adjusted for the sake of context, but I was at the mercy of a terrible sub to begin with, so it\'s whatever. It doesn\'t take much thought to piece parts anyways. Most of it did felt quite filler. However, there were moments that made me laugh and some that I would zone out into daydreaming thoughts of existential crisis. Both of which were enough for me to hit that ""play next"" button.Sound: 6/10Story: 6/10That said, I think this is an anime that one should binge watch or allocate into periods rather than view an episode per week. It definitely felt shorter, because it is: 20 minutes including the intro and outro, so about 16-17 minutes of actual content viewing. But the quality in its art was well done.Character development is alright with me. Pretty meh overall. Ironically, that just the attitude and mood the protagonist emits. But in particular moments it was executed in such a funny way. Arguably, one find it quite relatable. I guess the only lack in character development or understanding for that matter, was in the main antagonists for their sudden, well, desires. Kinda important, you know. However, a show like this is more tailored to reactions than actual (and understanding) development in characters. But I think the character development that they should\'ve addressed in the least was that spirit frog in the beginning. I mean, come on, from world domination to summoning pet, you gonna explain that leap (pun intended). You know I ain\'t gonna search the web to read a Chinese light novel or the like (not that I\'m your tailored audience to begin with).

I would\'ve at least expected a cool or funny trigger from dropped noddles, but was not the case. What was the point of such a deepen relationship to begin with?Character: 5/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 7/10Overall, I would watch more of this, and am, since the second season is currently airing (surprise) with a striking low of 1254 users, and about 30K members. Just wow. I think that is way too low because the show is quite good. I really think that if this was done in Japanese, just setting aside the English dub option, this would have been praised in the category of ""notable anime shows of that season"" at least. I really do, because I have seen far worse anime that had overall ratings above a 7.3, but it is what it is. I giving this a rating of 7, but that\'s just because I typically set high standards for about all my anime. I am tempted to give it a higher rating just because of that overall score, but nah. Heck, I would probably watch a season 3 at this point. Even if the second season so far (3 episodes in btw) feels like a repeat of season 1 content recycled. And noddle ads, which is kind of funny. It\'s like the Chinese replacement version of an isekai without, well, it being an actual isekai, it is quite better to watch. Honestly kinda sad they just didn\'t throw in there a single katana, you know? It\'s a weird line they drew but basically all this is just nitpicking at this point. I presume they based it off the light novel or whatever form of content it originally came from. But the story was interesting and the art looked appealing enough for me to give this a view.

While the speech could be a bit too grandiloquent, at times, you will be rewarded with a nice looking anime, for starters. Speed effects and combats scenes are a must-watch, at least for a chinese anime. A lot of efforts have been put there, along the opening theme and the few actions scenes dispatched through this anime.Of course, this is not exempted from flaws and weaknesses, and the anime in its whole is far... from being *even close to a masterpiece*. For example, the contrived solutions the MC came up...with to hide his strenghts are quite annoying at times, when not utterly idiotic (this is supposed to add to the comic aspects of the show, but unfortunately it's clearly not working everytime). The overused clichés works well within most episodes, but the lack of creativity that ensues keep reminding the viewer that there was a lot that could have been done instead. For example to answer this question : how far this supernatural being can go to protect his lifestyle when any moves he makes could take epic proportions ?Still, while the anime seems to cut some corners and takes shortcuts to the final episode, it's doing so without too much damage to its potential and the viewers pleasure (well, at least mine was there) to watch this show, which makes it, from the chineses animes I know (but I doubt I've seen them all), one of the best I've watched this far.If you love your OP character NOT being an arrogant and overconfident jerk (which is usually a trademark of chinese animes), then this anime is for you and I'm gladly recommanding it.

It takes itself too seriously to be considered a gag opera, like Saiki.Plot: 0Nothing is explained. Events just happens and that's it. Seems like the author makes up stuff on the spot, and forgets in the next episode.

Typical apathetic or socially inept MC, propped up best girl who falls for MC, and 2 male classmates mostly used and developed for comedic means.

An easy-going slice-of-life comedy with some action scenes was perfect to binge on a Sunday afternoon.Overall: To sum it up, the mix of Magic, High Schoolers, and Slice of Life is executed well enough, I guess.  Many reviewers have compared it to Saiki K, which I have not seen. At the end of the day, the show does not do very well at delivering a captivating action-packed action anime nor an enchanting slice of life show.

It's kind of a messy story line to be honest. I think the part where the narrator says that his emotions are the control of his powers should of been mentioned in the beginning so it would kind...of complement his character in a way rather than be implied.However, I like the art style of the characters, particularly Ling Wang and Su Rong (Main characters) and their somewhat of an existing relationship. To be straightforward, I think they  are a cute couple and definitely think they would make a great couple in a slice of life aspect. Regardless, the event that caused the ending hit me hard with the feels.There was a lack of character development which was the result of the poor story telling, but I believe this anime has potential if the story was rewritten and if things were more clear to the audience. Characters were very linear, I think the creators attempted to though.

Of course hot girl doesn\'t do shit when confronted by people with guns but she was saving MC in first episode from bullies.It\'s shit, just blatant plain old shit. Nothing makes sense, everything is predictable and two dimensional. Plot convenience is everywhere and ruins everything, except for voice acting. Dear lord voice acting is atrocious. That\'s the only reason why it can\'t be ruined, because you can not kill that which has no life. It\'s at asking random dude on the street to scream like Tarzan level of bad. I kid you not you haven\'t heard screams this bad ever.Just run away and thank me you didn\'t have to suffer through this. How this ""show"" got 7.33 score is beyond me. This must mean zombie apocalypse happened and there are no entities with functioning brains left who watched this anime and gave it higher than 3.', ""CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS!! Check the last para if you don't have patienceLike almost every other review, I'll start by comparing this with Saiki K. By looking at the premise and a few episodes in, you can't help but wonder if it is a rip off. But there is still a world of difference between the two. First of all, Saiki is a powerful psychic in an otherwise ordinary world, who frequently uses his powers to manipulate everything around him and still somehow fails to lead an ordinary life. On the other hand, Wang Ling is literally an omnipotent god, whose powers have been limited with...an amulet (somewhat similar to Saiki's limiters) and manages to stay under the radar except for a handful of situations, which is still a monumental feat given his powers. The female leads are however very similar, they both fall in love with the MC because of their indifference towards the prettiest girl in the school. Maybe it is just me, but I felt that Sun Rong (the female lead of Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo) had a better reason for falling in love with Wang Ling, when compared to Teruhashi, but still is not compulsive enough for the audience. In the case of Wang Ling, it was actually a little frustrating to watch as he doesn't use his power a lot, much to the disappointment of the fans of this genre.Coming to the drawbacks of the series, almost everyone must have felt that all the characters, including the MC were pretty bland and had no real depth whatsoever. While this is true, it could be interpreted as if we, the audience, perceive all the scenarios through the eyes of Wang Ling who has little to no emotions because of the said amulet.  You will understand what I am talking about once you complete season 1. The overall story is decent, but the execution is not up to the mark and does have some plot holes.TL DR; However if you like OP MC genre, this could be worth it as long as you have enough patience to complete it. If not for my OCD, I would have never completed this series xD. But I am glad I completed even though I was a little bit confused after it ended. I can't stress this enough, but if you plan to watch it, do it till the end and you wont regret it as much. If not for the last couple of episodes, I would have hesitated to give this series a 6/10. I wont spoil it, but I am sucker for the type of ending this series has. an amulet (somewhat similar to Saiki's limiters) and manages to stay under the radar except for a handful of situations, which is still a monumental feat given his powers.

A tiny minority of its characters occasionally manage to be likeable and some of the action in the last few episodes managed to invest me enough to make me wonder at least a little how it was going to play out; that's all of the nice things I have to say about this unoriginal, lazy, hackish mess.In short, there were a couple moments that were enjoyable, but if I wanted to watch something painfully mediocre, I'd find something better than this. "", ""Daily life of an Immortal king is clearly a webnovel that took inspiration from works like Saiki K. When I read the novel myself, it was clear that there were a lot of parallels from Saiki K.What makes something like Daily life of an Immortal King and Saiki K good? In my opinion, it's the fact that there's a lot of focus on the MC that's OP, monologuing all the events, and the contrasting reactions from his classmates and peers. The unexpected dissonance of perspective between the main character's point of view and everyone else's point of view makes for a pretty hilarious comedy.I do...admit that I think Daily life of an Immortal king was a few pegs down compared to Saiki K, but that doesn't really mean I hated it. It was watered down, but I still read it.When this anime came out, I definitely made a mental note to check it out. But, what a surprise, the adaptation of the work didn't meet my expectations. What's missing. The animation was pretty mediocre, CGI was liberally used, and a lot of still backgrounds and scenes were repetitively used as well. While there seemed to be combat, it tried to abstract away any sort of need to use any sort of actual fighting schemes, to keep costs low.I don't particularly think this was the main problem, though. The problem was absolutely the monologue. How many times did you get to see what the main character was thinking. ZERO. ZERO!!!! What the hell is the point of this adaptation of the star of the comedy: the monologue disappears? By creating a show without omniscient perspective, the comedy doesn't exist. More than half the gag setups are through the monologue of the MC. I just...what? I really don't care if there are certain things that changed, and trust me, the show did not follow the novel closely at all, but whatever. But the core component needs to stay the same.For all of you wondering why the original was good: it was the monologuing. Without it, it's just a poorly crafted cultivation slice of life with an OP MC! And that is exactly what this anime is. It's as if it's a different work or somethingRemember what I said about this show being similar to Saiki K? Well, try to imagine Saiki K without Saiki's monologuing.

However, in this case, the anime took the comedy route instead of a shounen route, especially (for me that is) it seemed to take the gag genre route. When combining an overpowered main character who is trying to live a peaceful/ normal life among his peers does it not remind you of a certain pink hair boy with psychic powers (lol).For those of you who might be put off by how this Chinese anime is essentially being a “copycat” of...another anime, I will probably mention that it does hold its own unique traits that it does not display elsewhere. Typical traits used are parodies of pop culture from both Japan and China e.g. an episode where a student summons an SSR of some gacha and the occasional breaking the 4th wall. However, one unique trait which is different from Japanese anime is that it is heavily Wuxia-based. For those who have not heard the term I would recommend you to read it up or (really recommend this) watch a Wuxia Chinese drama and hopefully you can understand the culture and terminology used in this anime (as well as many other fantasy genre Chinese animations).I enjoyed it as a typical gag anime but if you felt that the last few episodes feel a little off and strayed from it well... I can't deny that and yet it can be still explained as a gag anime (debatably). Though, it was clear that this anime wanted to take a more serious turn near the end. How serious? I don't know. I think reading the original material (i.e. manhua or web novel) would contain the information in regards to that topic in which the anime hasn't adapted yet.Although, I have not read the original material I recommend reading either one of them to see if the anime has adapted this work well or not. In the end, all I can say is that I enjoyed the anime adaptation BUT the last few episodes may need some clarifying somewhere (probably a future season?).I would recommend and hope you would at least watch the whole anime. Unless Chinese dubbed anime is not to your liking (which may take getting used to) but I would still encourage you to give this a go when you have spare time.

The debate about what actually even is an anime is quite honestly, rather overdone. If the defining trope of anime is the art style than shows like Avatar count as anime and shows like Panty and Stocking don’t, yet according to MAL, you’ll find that many people, myself included, will find the opposite to be true, because they value a show’s nationality more than its artistic direction. For me personally, this is because I find that the art style of any given show will change from person to person...and whether the difference is as obnoxious as an atomic bomb, or as subtle as a Where’s Wally, it’s present nonetheless. I don’t really care about what is an anime in comparison to other forms of animation because at the end of the day if it’s good I’ll like it and if it isn’t I won’t. The most defining thing about anime to me, in contrast with “cartoons” is the Japanese national identity and the ways in which it is imbued into the show, whether or not that is on a macro or micro scale.I bring all of this up because I recently was looking for some generic anime to mindlessly consume and upon browsing the anime section of Netflix, I found The Daily Life of the Immortal King. This show is a pretty standard power fantasy anime, following the One-Punch Man set up of the protagonist is really overpowered but nobody knows except us *wink wink*. Combine that with a magical high school setting and you’re looking at one of the most generic anime ever made. Except it is not an anime. Just like most of what you own, it’s made in China.This knowledge hit me like covid hit the world, with the distinct language being used by the voice actors making me realise…I’m actually watching a Chinese cartoon.As far as cartoons go though…this is a pretty good show. If you’re really craving some generic power fantasy than the fact that I was able to pretty quickly marathon both seasons despite normally dropping shows like this by episode 5 should tell you that this series actually has some heart to it. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that this show is actually funny with a genuinely strange sense of humour. Like how when they present just how overpowered the protagonist is through this overpowered baby scene in episode 1. While this is obviously just set-up for having the super-special awesome main character be overpowered, the fact that the show was willing to go so over the top with this explanation was genuinely endearing.This charm is present throughout the majority of the show. One of the later episodes of season 2 is an obvious piece of filler where the cast interact with the animators of the show. They learn how anime is made. They talk to the animators. The narrative stakes of the episode revolve around how understaffed the team is so the characters have to help draw their own show or the world will end. This is a genuinely unique way of breaking the 4th wall that, dare I say it, actually made me like the show more.At the end of the day The Daily Life of the Immortal King is hardly anything special, but it never tries to be. It tries to be a fun show, and provides a unique experience with its wacky sense of humour to help elevate the show to be something worthy of your attention for a rainy day when you don’t care too much about finding a masterpiece, and just want to have some fun.This Review is actually the script to this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O344625fo3QCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it. and whether the difference is as obnoxious as an atomic bomb, or as subtle as a Where’s Wally, it’s present nonetheless.

Overall by itself the anime is ok, not amazing but not bad. The main thing that has me torn is the fact, that it is considered an adaptation of the novel, while it is so drastically different that it might as well be considered a new story. The anime and the novel have some similar plot points but the tone and the focus are very different. the novel is basically a comedy with misunderstandings and kinda slapstick comedy. TBH the best way to describe the novel is its chinese version...of one punch man and the anime adaptation is now a regular shounen anime with some same plotpoints. I may be biased but i will state that overall it was a bit boring as well as not meeting expectations.If you are looking forward toward this because you read the novel, then i recommend you throw those expectations out, because its best to think as them not even connected together, then you will be able to enjoy the anime for however good you may think it is. If you go in with expectations of it being similar to the novel its going to be a major disappointment.TLDR: Anime vs novel - very different tones, different focus points, characters have been changed up. basically totally different stories, only have some similar plot points.Recommendation: watch if you havent read the novel or if you can get the bias of the novel/not associate this anime with the novel. of one punch man and the anime adaptation is now a regular shounen anime with some same plotpoints.

I only just (2021) found it on Funimation, and the dubs surprised me, being in Mandarin. The protagonist is overpowered, and this story takes place in an alternate world of sorts where magic exists, but it is essentially a story like many magic highschool action/adventure sagas that we have seen come out over the past few years. The critical difference is that this is a parody anime. It has at least one parody thrown in from almost every major anime that...they could manage. I have seen quite a few anime, and I’m sure I still missed a few references.The first episode may seem to disappoint in voice actor enthusiasm, but the full series actually pulls together pretty well and the anime is a cut above that of some of the competing equivalents of late (especially in animation quality). It pays homage to anime from Angel Beats, right through to the Animatrix and Dragon Ball Z. In terms of shear quantity of references, I have only seen one other anime that compares (sadly can’t remember the name at the time of this review). Haoliners also goes so far as to parody their own works in the opening, referencing Hitori no Shita: The Outcast more than once. I was very impressed when I realized that both the opening and the closing sequences seemed to be entire parodies, music included, (and pretty well done at that) of other anime. Realizing that really helped my enjoyment of the show. It doesn’t stand well on it’s own in either category (action or comedy), being unable to draw out the full value of the Angel Beats’ ceiling break (not enough comedic pause or build-up), as well as some of the other references. I would say, however, that it hits the realism of high school testing and the lack of excitement that most feel at having their scores evaluated next to others while pretending to not care (ah, high school) square on the head, possibly better than any anime I have ever seen in the fiction genre.The VA’s take some time to get used to, and I wouldn’t rate the sound quality very high, but I also found that they did get better onwards from episode one, which may be on purpose to emphasize MC development. What really hit home in the first episode was how well they captured the nuances of certain points of high school. While the comedic timing is sometimes hit or miss, this anime actually did hit some notes of anime like Charlotte towards the end.That being said, the world building is non-existent, and the character development is silly. It is very hard to fit into the comedy genre and still hit the highs and lows that bring with them the rolling emotions, however I did really enjoy the moments towards the end, and I think there were a few more references thrown in when the protagonist tries to logic-break. Of course, the whole thing is a parody, so some may feel their eyes roll back in their heads as their foreheads feel the weight of the spacebar, but I enjoyed it. Unlike in Misfit, where the VA’s made the show barrable (maybe), while the animation quality felt like Arifureta, this show may be criticized for VA’s lack of ability to bring out characters’ value, sometimes sounding like they were trying to record next to a grade school classroom in session.

[6/10]I went in blind on this one, it's a Chinese anime, chanime? with mixed length episodes non reaching 20 mins in length,as for the art style its lacking in detail but its watchable.The MC and his bunch are very bland i almost thought his friends were background characters until they kept showing up, hell the damn dog is the best character that should say enough.Best thing about the show is the last few episodes, they feel very rushed but were still entertaining even introducing new characters and elements far more interesting than everything else in the shows beginning, those...last few episodes along bumped the show up 2 ratings for me.all in all, only watch this if u like guilty pleasure shows, and go in with low expectations for maximum enjoyment. last few episodes along bumped the show up 2 ratings for me.all in all, only watch this if u like guilty pleasure shows, and go in with low expectations for maximum enjoyment."", ""This is a lot like saiki K in some ways, doesn't take itself too seriously all the time until the ending with an op guy who wants to hide his powers. It's goofy more than it's some kind of shonen in the beginning but towards the later episodes it takes on a different flair and becomes more shonen-like, until the end when it became all serious. I found that, being used to japanese, the spoken chinese was a bit weird in the beginning. They use very short sounds for what seems like longer words and because of this I found it quite troublesome to find...out who just said what, this took some time getting used to but 3 episodes in and you get more and more used to it. Some people didn't like the ending but I quite like timestopping spacetime shit and time travel so I didn't mind. out who just said what, this took some time getting used to but 3 episodes in and you get more and more used to it.

Do the creators even know the basics...of creating any type of entertaining media? Find a niche and dig a groove. Not try and be five different things at once.

I haven't watched many Chinese anime, yet I continue with the 2nd season and also the 3rd is already announced.I found the art and animation pretty good as well as the opening and ending songs for both seasons but the rest, I'd say they're just ok for example the sounds in the battles are nothing special and nothing memorable. Same goes for the storyline and dialogues, as well as for the characters.They are a little shallow, there's an op bored mc who shows almost no emotions except...when it comes to the gf so it's boring for us too with no particular character development.The next season seems to be going somewhere but it keeps going with the same pace so in my opinion it's a 6 and I wonder why it got higher scores. I don't think I will change it in both seasons and the main reason is, that there some interesting moments with the enemies and some funny ones between the classmates, which are those that I enjoy and keep me continue watching it. when it comes to the gf so it's boring for us too with no particular character development.The next season seems to be going somewhere but it keeps going with the same pace so in my opinion it's a 6 and I wonder why it got higher scores.

But there was no useable translation for it, so it was on my plan to list for a long time. I think I put it there when I encountered an ""epic"" part of it in an AMV.So about the anime. It was kind of hard for me to get used to the Chinese voices. But for the last episode, I kind of ended up starting to like the OP.The story for me was not used by the full mean it could have been. There were a lot of gaps when the story could...have taken a better turn but they tried to insist on this comedy storyline. The ending was confused, they packed together everything that was possible to make it ""SUPER EPIC"". But it had the opposite effect. For once it was a watchable anime.

Maybe because I wait for a long time to check it, my expectations became too high for this anime to jump it.', 'Just finished watching S1 and I seriously needed to get my thoughts of this out there. A lot of it will seem negative, but I did somewhat enjoy the show, it just irritates me that any potential I saw in this show was instantly shot down with so many amateur mistakes. Particularly the pacing/story. Also, this is a pretty long critique of the first season, but i think it gives a good idea what to expect, especially if you don\'t mind spoilers and read the last part. I think i had more fun writing (ranting) this than i did watching the last episode lol.I had...some hopes for this show, seeing the promotional art and a short clip in some video had me interested, because let\'s be honest, China knows how to do some damn good animation when they want to, heck i think some newer japanese anime outsource some of the animation there.The animation is good in this show, but they also cut corners or just come up short at times. Be it backgrounds, fight scene movement, impact, etc. Not terrible, just underwhelming honestly. The bigger problem is everything else. REALLY, every time i was having fun with this show one of the other issues or a combination of them reared it\'s ugly head within 5 minutes.(SPOILERS AHEAD!! Not really anything interesting though. SPOILERS ARE AT THE BOTTOM, the directing/pacing was the main thing i wanted to review/critique, but since all the spoilers are in that portion, and given it\'s the longest part, I moved it to the bottom. So if you don\'t mind the ending of S1 and a couple very minor things being spoiled, skip ahead to the bottom and see why I loved and hated watching this show.)Let\'s go down the list:OPENING/ENDING:-i really liked the opening actually, it definitely tried a bit to hard with some of the silhouettes of some characters seeming like they\'re badasses when they\'re more comedic relief that anything. and Side characters too. But i really liked the song for the OP and the whole thing with walking and fighting on the side of the ferris wheel. But it definitely got a bit weird when they\'re throwing out all these beams and fighting, seemed a bit of an overload but ok. It also ends slightly abruptly but i still think it was good overall.- same for the ending honestly, i really liked the song and the vibe of the ED but why does it go for 2? maybe 3minutes long?ANIMATION/CHARACTER DESIGNS:-Like i mentioned above, the animation isn\'t terrible, it\'s generally pretty acceptable and in some cases i actually quite like the way they do some minimalistic/budget backgrounds. There\'s a particular one in the last few episodes of the season with an autumn-like tree that was my favourite. That\'s not to say all backgrounds all the time are budget-like but it does happen here and there, though it\'s not massively noticeable most of the time since you\'re probably busy either turning off your brain to enjoy the show or trying to figure out why the story and pacing is all over the place and hating it lol.-The character designs are honestly really bland, still anime, but really bland. Oh we have the buff dumb tough guy who\'s got a shaved head and wears a tracksuit.... A girl with black hair, big eyes and a hairpin who wears a uniform with a tracksuit jacket.. A Chubby guy who also wears a uniform with a tracksuit jacket. MC with basic template mc face, normal black hair and ofcourse..who also wears a uniform with a tracksuit jacket. Obviously i\'m meme\'ing a bit because that\'s their uniform, and it wouldn\'t look that bad if they didn\'t wear them practically all the time. Especially when they\'re representing their school in events and stuff, it\'s just boring. I don\'t need some super flashing character designs and outfits but every main character in this show looks like an extremely minor character in most other anime because of it.SETTING/WORLD BUILDING:-practically non-existent honestly, i don\'t think this is even worth bringing up. I\'ve never really understood the whole Cultivation/Xianxia system or fiction. I don\'t know if it\'s because the translation to English just never quite makes sense or if it\'s actually meant to be that vague or if it\'s a ""you should already know this"" type of thing. Oh and all there powers are really generic stuff, weak too. Doesn\'t help that it doesn\'t seem like there\'s any actual \'magic\' system in place. If i had to say, it\'s more like a soft magic system but even for that it\'s still really vague.SOUND/VOICE ACTING:-Sound on it\'s own is generally fine excluding 2 or 3 very very short scenes in the last 5 episodes where they forgot to tune some sfx down or just didn\'t think about how obnoxious and overbearing it was. But yeh generally fine.-Ok this is probably the 2nd biggest issue i had with this show, but i could overlook it since for the most part it was passable. The voice acting is seriously lacking in so many ways. 1: The main cast, the side cast, everyone lacks any impact in their voice. They all seem so damn softspoken even when they\'re supposed to be angry and yelling. Though idk if this is due to lack of experienced voice actors or if it\'s something like a lack of hard consonants in Mandarin. IDK i\'m not a linguist. 2: Seriously, how many characters were voiced by the same 2 old guy voices? I swear they just hired 3 or 4 voice actors for anyone that was an actual side character, so main cast (classmates/friends) and rivals (enemies) excluded. But even among those characters there was still 1 or 2 that sounded identical. Oh, also like, every time i remember a character yelling it ended up sounding like a really weird sound. For example, there\'s a point where the FMC has a flashback to her younger self and it\'s definitely the same VA but, they tried to sound younger. Which is fine, but for whatever reason they did this quick pokemon evolve thing where it flashed between her old self and current self as their both yelling/charging and it sounded out of sync but one half was even more high pitch than normal, cos of her flashback to her younger self, resulted in a kind of ""yAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyA"" sound. And another character that laughed like ""Y\'hoyY\'hoyY\'hoyY"" or something for only one scene like it was completely normal. VA must\'ve got hiccups the day he voiced that line.THE BIGGEST ISSUE, DIRECTION/PACING:-All over the place. This show can\'t decide whether it wants to be a comedy or serious action, one episode is comedy, joking about how the MC is OP and nothing and nobody will be able to do anything, the next it\'s serious because his classmates are in trouble, and sometimes even making it seem like he\'s the one in serious danger. I swear there was a point where he kicked the ass of a character in a comedy episode and the next they tried to raise the tension by making it look like that very same person was a threat to him (obviously not because this guy is basically fuckin god, yeh really, that op.) Sometimes it was the other way around, serious threat in a comedy episode, and an absolute joke in a serious episode.-MINOR CHARACTER SPOILERS BELOW--This part is gonna be lengthy and a bit hard to follow, but it\'s actually just that nonsensical when you watch it as well, the character change happened literally within 30mins of screen time (not excluding op/ed\'s), 5mins at the end of one ep, the whole next episode, and the first 5mins of the one after that. Oh, all in the first 4 eps too btw.The FMC goes from being some snobby, proud and looking down on everyone (MC Included) rich girl character, to accidentally having a ""Trick"" (the naming sense in this show bruh, maybe it was just a poor translation) backfire on her when she tries to charm/seduce everyone in the school and the mc accidentally pulls the uno reverse card out making her seduced by him.She seemed to have some awareness of the fact she was charmed, but then the next day when she sees him she\'s head over heels and sweet with seemingly no idea of the spell. He realizes right away and gets rid of it by brushing his hand against her face and she comes back to her senses (yes, really) though she\'s a bit shocked and embarrassed it seems.AAAAANNNDDD immediately the next episode she\'s being all sweet and respectful to him, not hiding her crush on him at all and asks him on a date?!! This still doesn\'t make any sense to me lol. He says yes (a whole misunderstanding on her part but he ends up forced into it coz comedy), she\'s still all lovey dovey and sweet. At the end of the date some shit happens and she sees his real strength, but out of respect for something she did, instead of erasing her memory (which he\'s already done on a couple occasions by this point) he makes a pinky promise pact with her so she can\'t actually tell anyone about him.After that she\'s always sweet towards him and obviously in love with him even though it makes no sense how we got to this point, but what\'s even crazier is that you can\'t even tell if she\'s aware of how strong he is. Like sometimes she\'s ""OH NO! Please don\'t be hurt MC!"" from something like getting hit by a weakass punch, to ""This is MC we\'re talking about, he\'ll be fine"".-SEASON 1 ENDING SPOILERS--Okay, this is my last example of the direction/pacing and I tried to keep the details to a minimum but if i left any out i feel like it\'d actually be more nonsensical than it already is.So the show continues on with there being zero progression between the MC & FMC, and the ""amulet"" holding back his powers and emotions breaks, which seems to make him almost have a panic attack which would destroy the world (lol) but because she\'s there with him, he\'s fine. Somehow he fell in love even with his emotions subdued, but only realises when they\'re no longer subdued (my brain actually hurts just thinking about the logic and explanation in the show, it\'s the first of a few majorly pointless and sudden occurrences in the ending).But whilst this happens, even with all his power, he can\'t sense some small fry (compared to him at least) coming up from behind aaannnnd.... the FMC\'s soul? is killed? IDK, either way she\'s dead.Man instantly snaps and starts yelling and wailing on the antagonist but comes back to his senses and realizes he can still save her. Oh but turns out he can\'t, because ""you can\'t revive someone who\'s already dead"". >.>So ofcourse the mc decides he\'ll reset the timeline by cutting the fabric of time and space around the world lmao. Nope, doesn\'t work, still dead. Okay, how about destroying the current world to create a new one (reset the timeline essentially, seriously, no fucking difference aside from the visuals of it, the effect of what he did before and what he\'s doing now is the same damn thing). He\'s told there\'ll be consequences, but what the consequences are isn\'t mentioned.He goes off into god meditation mode with like energy lasers and shit around him whilst he\'s destroying and using the energy of the current timeline/world to create another identical one, which it does the usual trope of ""MC\'s alive in this world but feel\'s that something\'s missing"". ACTUALLY, the world he\'s creating, doesn\'t have the very person he was creating it for nor does his counterpart in that world even remember her. It\'s the same damn failure as the previous method with the same damn effect, so much for being a god like being.Whilst that happens, the FMC\'s soul is shown in the underworld (a place never mentioned nor shown before) where the administrators/leader of the underworld quickly send her soul back to her body before the world is destroyed (OH, so you CAN revive someone that\'s dead, just not the most powerful being in the universe, the same being who can destroy the same underworld that resurrects her. BRUH).She comes back to life in the dying original world which is basically just a cosmic rift around the platform they were on originally, where the MC\'s familiar\'s explains the situation to her. The FMC who has always been utterly weak compared to the MC, is somehow able to fly, deflect and dodge all these laser beams coming from his cosmic meditation form state thingy and stabs his cosmic body, which somehow makes his counterpart remember her and return/fuse? with his cosmic self back in the original world. Yeah, utterly nonsensical, and not in a good way.So now the MC, FMC and his 2 familiars are just hanging out in the rift of the destroyed first world, have this little cute moment of ""oh, so will you wander the rift for eternity?"" ""that wouldn\'t be so bad, as long as we\'re together"" (you\'d think they were in love for 500 episodes or some shit). Then the same familiar that asked that says ""well, yada yada this spell that spell somehow created two thingies, one that can control space, the other time (a power the mc was literally just using so wtf does it matter if there\'s now a magic ring that can do it?) so you can make the world back to the way it was or merge them or some shit"" BUT ""the consequence for it is the FMC forgets everything that happened from right before she died.""They do another ""cute"" little thing of ""oh as long as we\'re together, we\'ll figure it out"" or some shit and everything goes back to the way it was before but obviously with her forgetting the whole cosmic world rewriting crap and that she died or that he feels the same way about her.The problem with that is though..... One, she already knew he was really powerful. Like maybe not on that level but what does that matter? and Two, he\'s literally been rewriting and erasing people\'s memory all fucking season, hers included sometimes, so how the fuck is this a consequence? let alone the fact that it\'s an insignificant consequence considering he just blew up the world and reset it like 10,000 times.Okay okay, that was a lot, and it\'s not like all that completely ruins the show, but my point stands. The directing and pacing is nonsensical. some hopes for this show, seeing the promotional art and a short clip in some video had me interested, because let\'s be honest, China knows how to do some damn good animation when they want to, heck i think some newer japanese anime outsource some of the animation there.The animation is good in this show, but they also cut corners or just come up short at times.

The directing and pacing is nonsensical.', ""This show was appearing in my Netflix's watchlist. I thought it was Japanese anime but it turned out to be Chinese. I found this show very entertaining and worthy of a binge watch. The protagonist is a literal God trying to hide himself among humans and if he unleashes his emotions, the world might get destroyed. Characters are very likeable. Short but enjoyable character arcs make this show fun and entertaining. Animation quality is also very good.Bonus: This show also has a tournament arc and few moments of comedy, tropes and parodies sprinkled here and there.My score: 8/10 "", ""I did try to watch a donghua before (seven scissors i think) but can't get past the first episode. Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo is the first donghua i was attached to. Honestly, this donghua felt like a combination of One Punch Man and Saiki-K to me. The humour is comical, and the story is pretty light. Perfect watch while enjoying my biscuits in between study breaks.[SPOILER]On the downside, I am not really attached to the characters. Personally, I don't like how Wang-Ling and Sun Rong's relationship was built. I can't feel their chemistry thus the whole love story kinda ruins my enjoyment....I cringed a little when Wang Ling went berserk for deceased Sun-Rong because I can't feel the depth of their relationship. yea....

Being the first chinese anime I completed, what I found was something I didn\'t expect.The best comparison to this show wold be The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. In both you have an OP protagonist that hides his superpower and tries to lead a normal life, which leads to funny moments and great jokes. I enjoyed both of these shows, yet The Daily Life of Immortal King stuck with me for something different than Saiki K. While Saiki focuses mainly on the comedic element of the premise, Immortal King tries to do...something more. It hides in a disguise of comedy and delivers us one of the most deppressing stories I ever saw.Because while Saiki K. goes by with the premise that Saiki himself chose to lead a normal life, Immortal King did not. This show explored what exactly could it mean for such an amount of power to even exist on Earth, while also showing us the person affected - our MC, who unwillingly, out of obligation uses seals to limit his spiritual energy, together with his emotions. As such he cannot function as a normal member of society, can not live a normal life that he longs for.This is one of these stories saying ""Great power comes with great responsibility and great costs.""So while our MC is overpowered and basically a demi-god, he isn\'t even aware of his own emotion and feelings, that are sealed away. But when the seal come undone, his true feelings start flowing out, with him realizing them. That is, until he is forced to have them sealed away again, for the sake of mankind and the world.Okay, so now that my rant is finished, let\'s talk about other aspects of the show. Characters are enjoyable, music is surprisingly good and oh boy did the animation surprise. Surely was on completely different quality than what I expected. The comedic aspect is good - it\'s the absurdity of the jokes that will get you.Overall a great watch for sure, mainly for those looking on a bit different take on similar premise. something more.

In fact, this show is a great indicator of how to NOT write a compelling show story. There are no stakes, the characters aren\'t even two-dimensional, and nothing of value is learned (despite the show insisting that there is). That being said, Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo is an interesting show because of the potential that it demonstrates.The premise of the show is that an extremely powerful boy must conceal and suppress his godly powers or risk ending the world. This is actually quite a refreshing take on the overpowered MC: his character...is most interesting when he is trying to hide his power. Unfortunately for us, this also means that the main character has no character traits (his one trait is liking crispy noodles). The show tries to, quite cleverly, address his lack of character in the end. Even though their reasoning is sound, this doesn\'t really make up for the big fat nothing character-trait burger of the entire season prior to the reveal.We might assume, then, that the promise is in the side characters. Not so. Even in 15 episodes, we somehow learn nothing about each empty character. We see plenty of flashbacks that will say the same thing over and over e.g. ""be a man"", ""be upstanding and rich"", ""be a fatty"". These quotes are demonstrative of the characters - there is no further fleshing out. Oh, and there\'s also a frog-dog that is reminiscent of Naruto.In fact, one thing this show is full of is references. Reaction faces, sound effects, visuals - nearly every episode can be counted on to cram in some pop culture. I remember one particularly jarring instance of an Assassins\' Creed leap of faith reference that made me do a double take. I am curious how dated this show will seem even five years from now.At this point, it may seem like I hate the show. It certainly is awful. The plot is at times indecipherable, the pacing strange, the characters near meaningless. Yet I can\'t say I hated it while I\'ve hated far better executed shows. Why then, did I actually enjoy the show? Perhaps it\'s the flashing lights and colors that numbed my brain into oblivion. If TikTok was an anime, this would be it. It flies along at a breakneck pace, without stopping. It constantly feeds you action, humor (references), and failures of emotional moments. The animation captures your attention and nothing can get stale because nothing is developed.If you have ever watched a Youtube video aimed at kids - the one\'s with overacting, yelling, and strange sexual refences (Spiderman and Elsa, anyone?)- then you\'ve seen this anime already.

It adopted a far more interesting and complex meaning. To me, it's a commentary on emotional repression. The main characters keeps his feelings in and throughout the series he is slowly nearing his breaking point.

Clearly, there are many other things that can be pointed out, but overall, I tell you that you...will probably be bored.Well, despite the bad things already said, lack of explanation for several things in the anime, super convenient powers that save the protagonist, the Chinese dubbing and animation that leave a lot to be desired and the fact that until the last episodes, the script is weak , you can have fun, and even though the ending may have displeased a lot of people, for me it was the highlight of the show, and you really can feel excited.In the last episodes of the anime, there is indeed a great use of exaggerated overpowering abilities, but honestly, the ending leaves you so hyped, that even with all the mistakes and flaws, the ending manages to make your eyes shine, for that reason alone, I think It makes everything else forgivable and made me want to write this review and recommend it to other people.In short, the anime itself is far from being a masterpiece, but it has its good moments, and the ending makes it worth it.

I’m not sure if this is what it feels like for the Japanese...viewers for normal anime, but holy fuck does these translation suck.

Sure it’s still a edgy power fantasy, but it’s one of those lighthearted shows that you can watch for fun. It’s not a masterpiece by any means, but it’s certainly misrepresented in the eyes of western audiences.In conclusion, if you don’t speak Chinese, you probably shouldn’t watch it.

The first 3/4 of this show are really good but when it gets to this tournament arc at the end it really loses me.

The art varies greatly in quality from industry standard to Bezerk CGI to brief glimpses of high-quality work. Towards the end of the show, they drop all the aspects of the comedy and this really highlights the weak points of the show.

The Operation Victory Arrow OVA (see what they did there? ... never mind) is the first stage in the continuation of the saga, but rather than tell the story after the Battle of the Bulge, this miniseries is positioned between season 2 and the movie, focusing primarily on the European members of the 501st (and Charlotte, the sole American, I mean, Liberion member).Episode 1 features the German, I mean, Karlslandians Minna, Gertrud, and the Hartmann twins, with a couple of...scenes featuring a new face from the movie, Heidemarie. But Heidemarie is a minor character here-- the main drama features Ursula Hartmann and the Me-262. Sakura Nogawa got a workout here, and always the professional, she delivers a great performance for both Erica and Ursula. Those who watched season 2 would understand Erica\'s objections to using the jet, and yet those who understand the history of fighter aircraft would understand why the turbojet engine was so important to air combat. The copious amount of technological research done for this episode went right into Ursula\'s dialogue, which was hilarious.""Are you saying I\'m not a lady, Herr Field Marshal?"" -- Edita NeumannEpisode 2 features Charlotte and Francesca, as well as Field Marshal Rommel and Hanna Marseille. There is a complex conflict here that I rather like, layering Francesca\'s objection to a mission that would destroy an island full of historical artifacts and memories upon Charlotte and Hanna\'s rivalry. The mission in this episode culminates in a jury-rigging reminiscent of A*Team and MacGyver. This episode is the only time thus far that bombs are dropped by any Witch in the animated canon, so that\'s cool.

In essence, it is three standalone episodes about former squad members in different areas. You get Erica, Trud, and Minna in the first episode; Charlotte, Francesca, and Hanna-Justina in the second episode, and finally Perrine and Lynette. Each episode features a small narrative that eventually builds to a small skirmish against the Neuroi. It's a pretty easy watch with decent entertainment value for veterans of the series, though obviously many of...the Witches aren't featured in this OVA.Animation:It sure has been a long time since I saw this franchise but the look and feel of the OVA is still consistent with what I remember. The show is drawn in a saturated palette with vibrant scenery and some really nice sky scenes. The background is a bit inconsistent though as not all scenes get the same treatment. There is also noticeable CGI usage, though it doesn't distract too heavily. The main characters are as they used to be though there are a few new additional supporting members.As in the parent show, you can expect a fair amount of time in the air with the witches, and likewise a fair amount of long range weapon exchange. Effects are fair overall but nothing particularly memorable. There are also the expected levels of ecchi associated with the impractical nature of having propeller engines on your feet. There are some bath scenes with topless nudity, in case the skirt-less upskirt wasn't enough for you.Sound:The show has a new OP, which is fair but nothing particularly special. Each of the episodes has their own ED with the featured characters singing. The BGM is orchestral and fitting with both the setting and previous seasons. Some tunes in the BGM are still familiarly borrowed from previous seasons.The VA cast is as strong as ever with plenty of talented veterans. Chiwa Saitou still gives Francesca a particularly unique voice and Miyuki Sawashiro still excels as the proud Perrine. You even get Shizuka Itou voicing the Star of Africa too.Story:I give the show props for coming up with interesting scenarios in each episode, with allusions to WWII no less. The first episode features the Germans testing out jet engines with the Witches, fittingly named the ME-262; and fittingly with the ace in the room (Erica) strongly opposing its adoption. The second episode centers on a Neuroi that has captured an island around Tunis, which happens to be particularly important to Francesca. The last episode features a bratty orphan caught in something vaguely like Operation Market Garden.Each episode was well executed and had occasional comedy, especially the last episode. It was surprisingly good overall compared to my experience with the main shows.Character:Though there isn't much to be developed here, you do get a bit more on each featured witch's personality. Most memorable were Perrine's leadership, which is something that wasn't featured in any of the main shows. The interactions are fairly good though, again, a large portion of the witches get cameo appearances at most.Value:This is much more bang for your hour than any other Strike Witches work out there so far (not the movie yet). If you have a fair amount of the franchise under your belt, this is a no-brainer. It's a fun but short escape back to a show I had almost forgotten. the Witches aren't featured in this OVA.Animation:It sure has been a long time since I saw this franchise but the look and feel of the OVA is still consistent with what I remember. The show is drawn in a saturated palette with vibrant scenery and some really nice sky scenes. The background is a bit inconsistent though as not all scenes get the same treatment. There is also noticeable CGI usage, though it doesn't distract too heavily. The main characters are as they used to be though there are a few new additional supporting members.As in the parent show, you can expect a fair amount of time in the air with the witches, and likewise a fair amount of long range weapon exchange. Effects are fair overall but nothing particularly memorable. There are also the expected levels of ecchi associated with the impractical nature of having propeller engines on your feet. There are some bath scenes with topless nudity, in case the skirt-less upskirt wasn't enough for you.Sound:The show has a new OP, which is fair but nothing particularly special. Each of the episodes has their own ED with the featured characters singing. The BGM is orchestral and fitting with both the setting and previous seasons. Some tunes in the BGM are still familiarly borrowed from previous seasons.The VA cast is as strong as ever with plenty of talented veterans. Chiwa Saitou still gives Francesca a particularly unique voice and Miyuki Sawashiro still excels as the proud Perrine. You even get Shizuka Itou voicing the Star of Africa too.Story:I give the show props for coming up with interesting scenarios in each episode, with allusions to WWII no less. The first episode features the Germans testing out jet engines with the Witches, fittingly named the ME-262; and fittingly with the ace in the room (Erica) strongly opposing its adoption. The second episode centers on a Neuroi that has captured an island around Tunis, which happens to be particularly important to Francesca. The last episode features a bratty orphan caught in something vaguely like Operation Market Garden.Each episode was well executed and had occasional comedy, especially the last episode. It was surprisingly good overall compared to my experience with the main shows.Character:Though there isn't much to be developed here, you do get a bit more on each featured witch's personality. Most memorable were Perrine's leadership, which is something that wasn't featured in any of the main shows.

Steamboy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/565/Steamboy,"[""Steamboy is intended to be one of those grand adventure stories set in fantastical world with pure hearted heroes and nefarious villains.  It certainly has high production values and some incredible CGI effects and action.  But in the end it fails to really deliver those ambitious goals.The plot of Steamboy is really nothing all that original.  If you've seen any adventure stories before then the overall premise is going to feel very familiar to you.  The story centers around the boy Ray Steam, who is an inventor from a family of inventors.  After he receives a mysterious package from his...grandfather he soon finds himself chased by villains who want it for themselves.  The story has lofty goals but by the time the movie ends, I found myself  confused about what actually happened and what the purpose of the whole thing was.  Also it didn’t feel like any of the villainous characters ever really faced any consequences for their actions and the only people hurt were the innocents they stepped on throughout the story.  Maybe I am being to idealistic but I want the bad guys to get their just deserts, and Steamboy didn’t leave me feeling that they had.There is a lot of very good action in Steamboy however.  Fans of action will have a lot to like here.  The battles and action scenes are marvelous to watch and the CGI effects are wonderfully embedded within the animation.  The movie also does a wonderful job in building a Victorian Age fantasy with amazing steam powered machines of all types.  It reminds me a lot of a Jules Verne style story.Ray Steam is an adequate leading character.  He is heroic and idealistic and very much a standard and predictable character type for this kind of story.  There just isn’t enough development of his past or personality to make him all that compelling or memorable.  Scarlett is even less interesting as we learn almost nothing about her either.  I did not find her to be all that likable nor did I care much about what happened to her.  She’s spoiled and arrogant and cruel to animals.  She seems to make a little progress as the story unfolds but not enough to make me actually like her.  Steamboy's villains are not anymore interesting.  While they don’t fit the black/white stereotype that one often seen in these characters for this story type their motivations are obscure and not well defined for most of them.  The ones that are just don’t give you enough reasons to dislike them and cheer on our hero.While the animation was really top notch in most cases, I did not care for the character designs.  Particularly that of Scarlet as she looked more like a cross dressing boy than a girl.  As I mentioned the animation for the various steam machines and action was amazing.  The level of detail and fantastic designs were definitely a highlight.  The music and acting was all very good though.  The background music did a lot to build the grand scale of the movie.Steamboy is overall though just an average adventure story. I certainly didn’t dislike this movie at all, I've just seen a lot better.  Still I don’t think anyone would dislike this so if you enjoy fantasy and adventure stories, Steamboy will be well worth your time. grandfather he soon finds himself chased by villains who want it for themselves.

The dub is actually really good, and this is coming from a guy who hates dubs.  But in a story like this where its set completely in 19th century England, it would be too strange to hear Japanese voices, so the heavy Manchester and cockney London accents fit very well with what's going on.  Yeah, an anime set entirely in...19th century England, with no Japanese characters, weird already.And damn if what's going on isn't bloody amazing.  I actually think this is a two act story which is very interesting and unconventional.  For any laymen to cinema theory reading this, most common films have three act structures, but Steamboy is basically Setup and then Resolution.  Maybe a bit of an act 2 is floating around somewhere in this strange anime, but you'd be hard pressed to find it, as it moves so quickly from a beginning that feels deceivingly generic: a regular boy-receives-package-and-goes-on-run-with-it scenario that doesn't follow all the clichés of the past thankfully, but instead saves us the trouble of watching the story lull then pick up then lull over and over again.  No, Steamboy just keeps going from the first chase scene and doesn't let up until the destructive climax.But what a climax.  There are images in this anime that are purely breathtaking.  Images you've never seen before.  Katsuhiro Otomo's eye for apocalyptic action is second-to-none; no one can do it better than him.  Seeing it in action in London is a treat.  His direction, especially in action sequences, gives you scope to all the mayhem, his pans and tracking shots are perfect.Its all complemented by humour in the form of a bunch of weapons buyers on a tour of a gigantic weapon of mass destruction, unwittingly being involved in the 'demonstration', to sly observations of Londoners’ reactions to horrific disasters unfolding in front of them, it's never forced but very quirky and funny.Steamboy can be criticised for its two act structure and may lead people to believe it's all style and no substance, and I wont even try to defend it's attempts at philosophising on the purpose of science and technology, as the two characters that keep spouting their speeches gets old very quickly, but this anime is simply unlike any other out there and for that reason alone it deserves your full attention.There are so many things going on in Steamboy, from the surface narrative of a boy being dragged into an ideological quarrel between his father and grandfather, to the philosophical implications of steam technology on the 19th and 20th century, and most interestingly of all: that this was actually the origin of a superhero which just made me grin big time. 19th century England, with no Japanese characters, weird already.And damn if what's going on isn't bloody amazing.

Those who cannot conceive this genre will most likely be displeased with this anime, those who have no idea what steampunk is will have varying views & opinions, however to those who know & in a way like steampunk then this anime is definitely 4 you.The only down-side to this anime I see is that it is very generic steampunk but I also see this as its bet asset to those who are interested in understanding this genre. "", 'First, let me say that I wasn\'t expecting much going into this film. Seeing as how it isn\'t directed by Miyazaki and I hadn\'t heard much of anything about it, I didn\'t plan on being impressed. Well, much to my surprise, I really enjoyed Steamboy. Sure, it wasn\'t anything miraculous and magical like Spirited Away or Howl\'s Moving Castle, but it had some of that ""wonder"" to it.Some of the decisions the characters made were a little too ""that wouldn\'t happen"", but aside from some of those, I really, really enjoyed the story.Biggest gripe I had with the movie was the animation. I couldn\'t...see about 20% of the film because it was too dark. Quite a few scenes are nearly pitch black and unless you have some crazy contrast, you\'ll miss what\'s going on.All in all, definitely an enjoyable watch. I\'d see it again, but I wouldn\'t place it as high as a Miyazaki piece. see about 20% of the film because it was too dark.

Many times actually, Ray just couldn't keep a hold of it. [oh snap, a pun] *ahem* I'm still not really sure what they were trying to do with the story. Apparently the kid's father had some skewed view on science and decided to start a war with Britain. There wasn't much of a lead up to this, it just kind of happened at some point. There are far too many obstacles for Ray. Each time he...is tasked with doing something some random person or thing gets in his way. Yeah, obstacles make the story interesting and all, but not when they are so ridiculous and far fetched... and numerous. This is a retelling of history and this is an anime, but the inventions were just too much. They didn't seem believable in the least bit which is kind of disappointing when they're such a big part of the movie. The story just was not interesting at all.Art: The art is pretty much the only thing this movie has going for it. It's extremely detailed and just beautiful. Some of the larger scenes, such as the beginning of the festival, are filled with such grandeur that you almost forget that you are watching something so terrible. The London Exhibit, Crystal Palace, is another prime example of the beauty in this series. I've seen it in other series, but in this movie it is just wonderful. The last ten minutes or so are especially gorgeous.Sound: I didn't find myself noticing too much of the regular music, it was a bit bland. The pieces during the more action packed sequences and the ending were superb. They fit extremely well with the scenes and were just phenomenal. The sound would have gotten a ten, but like I said, the music during regular scenes was just average.Characters: None of them were very well done. I didn't feel any sort of connection with a single one. The main character, Ray, is just a typical good boy and that's pretty much it. Then there is the Miss Scarlet character... I don't get her at all. She was made out to be extremely stuck up and terrible in the beginning, she even abused her poor dog!, yet she somehow turns out to be the romance interest of Ray. Her character was just bland and had no depth, just like their relationship. The other characters didn't have anything going for them either, they were fueled by greed, misguided philosophies, and various other cliche driving forces. The father was one of the worst as well; changes in heart after being a complete douche are just lame.Enjoyment: This was one of the first movies I considered dropping in the middle of it. The story and characters were just so bad that I almost couldn't keep watching. The only thing that kept me watching was hope that it would somehow redeem itself in the end, a hope that was completely wasted and silly. I can't say I enjoyed this at all really.Overall: Well, if you want something really nice to look at for two hours I'd say give this movie a watch. If you're looking for a good story.... I'd seriously recommend watching something else. The lackluster story and characters, the far fetched inventions, and the ill placed obstacles completely ruin this movie. This is definitely something that should be passed by unless you are willing to sit through two hours of crap just for amazing animation.If you don't find this review helpful, please send me a PM or leave a comment as to why you feel that. is tasked with doing something some random person or thing gets in his way.

Sadly, they should have put more effort into perfecting the script for this ambitious anime.The attention to detail sets this anime apart from all others. Each cog and gear are intricately animated in the many inventions in the movie. The architecture of Victorian London is duplicated perfectly. The CGI used was so seamless, I didn\'t notice. The sound track is grand and befitting of the time period.The anime has no clear message and is clouded by characters whose purpose is ambiguous. The...protagonist is faced with a situation where he must side with either the word of his father or grandfather. No evidence is presented to the viewer as to which character is more credible besides the father looking more diabolical as he was disfigured in an accident. Next enters Miss Scarlet, a young, spoiled heiress. Is her character supposed to be comic relief or an analogy about society being blissfully ignorant to scientific advancement used to further war as long as profits are made? Finally, during the second half of the movie, massive destruction of property occurs, and you would assume loss of life. The movie takes the ""no one ever dies in a children\'s movie"" philosophy. I feel that if there had been consequences in the movie, the message of the anime might have shown through instead of being buried in the interpersonal struggles.While Steamboy offers breathtaking animation and the voice acting of Patrick Stewart, the story telling definitely runs out of steam. protagonist is faced with a situation where he must side with either the word of his father or grandfather.

Unfortunatly, the story and characters were not of the same high quality.  An enjoyable enough movie to watch, but it fails to capture the magic of a true classic. ', 'With nearly 9 years of production time and a budget of 2.4 billion yen (over 20 million dollars), Steamboy is the most expensive Japanese animation ever to be made.And oh boy you can see that. Large-scale views of London, with tons of people, details of the fictional machines, and, especially, the steam - everything is done perfectly, creating an amazing world that instantly swallows you in its depths of this future-in-the-past scenario.The story of goes back to the 19th century England, when steam still was the main source of power. One day, a young child Ray Steam, working as a maintenance boy in a factory,...receives a package with an ingenious device called ""steamball"", born in an experiment of his grandfather, Lloyd Steam, and his father, Edward Steam. Just after that, mysterious people appear at the front of his door, and they insist on handing them over the device. But Ray has inherited the inventor genes of his ancestors, and it is not an easy task for the villains to get him...The character design is great, from the mad scientist family of Steams, desperate in their ways, but still kind to their offspring, down to the colorful and proud upper-class girl Scarlett, holding herself for extremely important, but still not egoistic in any way. I especially enjoyed seeing, how Scarlett\'s naively stark pride makes her fully forget her fear. There were moments, where I would have fainted, if I were her (I can\'t handle the heights, but there were more).All in all, this is a professional artwork, which immediately became a must-see classic on my list. As expected after 9 years of production with a budget of over 20 million dollars. The only thing, that dragged my enjoyment down to 9 and the overall mark with it, are the pitch-dark action scenes, in which I hardly saw anything and could only hear something happening. But I guess this could have been caused by the poor quality of the transmission, the sound was very low too, so I had to max out the volume.And don\'t turn it off right when the credits begin to show up. The background images represent an epilogue to the story, and each picture has much more in it, than it could seem at first. They masterfully fill in the lack of character development, which is a problem movies are usually doomed to suffer from, in comparison with anime series. receives a package with an ingenious device called ""steamball"", born in an experiment of his grandfather, Lloyd Steam, and his father, Edward Steam.

I happen to be more analytical. This movie is for those that are creative and Imaginative. The movie progresses in a path taking adventure. Each path has its pros and cons. While the main character has his path already marked the anime forces the viewer to reflect themselves to see where they stand. In my view both sides were the same with slightly different agendas, making the siding choice hard. I am an adult i can only imagine it would be harder to make as a child(the main character). If that wasn't...hard enough a loved one was on both sides.Would i change anything if given the chance? No. Sure, this movie wasn't always riveting in excitement it did a good job at illustrating their main points. From cover art down to the ending. In the cover art for example the main character is basically begging the viewer to partake in his adventure. To see if he could do a better job. As for the color choice of red it perfect as well. Red represents fire which can be seen as frustration and passion. Both of which have a heavy impact in the show.Although, while no 'pipe' or 'valve' was in the red zone this movie failed to get an emotional rise from me. For each character had an evil side to them. How is a good moral person like myself expected to side with a character who doesn't abide to what he sets out to do? In other words the character is not dedicated but hypocritical.If this movie was meant for deep thinking and debating. Well done.

So this is not a overly professional critic's review.First off all, I bought this straight on DVD the moment it got released, so my experience with audio/subtitles etc. Can be a bit different then the people who watched it from fansubbers.The fact that I bought it on DVD is because people who worked on the hitmovie, Akira, also worked on Steamboy for several years, noticeable from the drawing style.We'll go right further with that. The animation in Steamboy is really amazing if you ask me, the steam itself, the...fast scene's on the steamball and Ray's own invention are truly fascinating, I missed most of the original story, just to be amazed by the animation. (May this be a warning to people who love the work of animation)The story itself is good too, in my opinion, I won't write a small summary here, since someone already took the liberty to add one to the series page, (probably somewhere above this review). The plot takes out pretty well, it's starts in an exciting way with an amazing escape and a chase throughout a part of the city and nearby fields.As for the animation, the art's a big and important factor of animation and of course the movie itself. Most of the art was just like the previous project Akira, only improved. The characters were &quot;standards&quot; and yet unique for they're way of movement, talking and thinking. You won't be bored here, but you won't be too suprised either. The introduction of the characters is well done in different ways either, yet again, not to suprising scene's.The sound (on DVD ofcourse) is set with a few options, DDS versions etc. Nothing new, but the sound's pretty good, the voice-actors, the machine sounds and most of the backgrounds music is really good.I rewatched this movie several times since I bought it, and although it's highly enjoyable at start, the few times after it stays the same. For an anime movie, this is pretty good, I don't rewatch alot of animated movie's.So there's a 9 for the story, 10's for the Art, Sound and Enjoyment, and an 8 for the characters. Which I calculate to a 10 overall. fast scene's on the steamball and Ray's own invention are truly fascinating, I missed most of the original story, just to be amazed by the animation. (May this be a warning to people who love the work of animation)The story itself is good too, in my opinion, I won't write a small summary here, since someone already took the liberty to add one to the series page, (probably somewhere above this review). The plot takes out pretty well, it's starts in an exciting way with an amazing escape and a chase throughout a part of the city and nearby fields.As for the animation, the art's a big and important factor of animation and of course the movie itself. Most of the art was just like the previous project Akira, only improved. The characters were &quot;standards&quot; and yet unique for they're way of movement, talking and thinking. You won't be bored here, but you won't be too suprised either.

Regardless it is visually stunning and a joy to watch.The main character follows the standard Hollywood track of an unlikely hero trying to save the day. However the story structure is new and kept my interests through out. By the second act you really do care what will happen to the characters. Great characterization with an original story line.Steam boy has great voice acting as well as  super musical score of the film. The Manchurian lead boy genuinely sounds Manchurian. Plus the score fits and...helps set the atmosphere.My only strong criticism of this film is that I personally would not watch it again; there was nothing spectacular enough to make me want to watch it again. Nevertheless I would recommend seeing once as it is a fun film, that is visually pleasing, interesting and original. helps set the atmosphere.My only strong criticism of this film is that I personally would not watch it again; there was nothing spectacular enough to make me want to watch it again.

It's stuff like this that makes me feel that anime is the true successor to classic Disney animation, not this 3D animation garbage that's so popular now.Okay, the bad news: the story starts off well and explores a very interesting theme of how inventions in the wrong hands can be used for evil, especially by the military. Everything goes swimmingly halfway into the movie, and then things get very confusing and hectic by the time we get to the Crystal Palace. Things go from bad to worse...in the last act--it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on...and just when you think it's over, goes on and on and on some more until your eyes glaze over or you start looking at your watch.Also, the grandfather character, who had started off being so cool, becomes a ridiculous figure. He spends the last half of the movie running around in rags like the Wild Man of Borneo.So, verdict--an okay anime, just not a great one. in the last act--it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on...and just when you think it's over, goes on and on and on some more until your eyes glaze over or you start looking at your watch.Also, the grandfather character, who had started off being so cool, becomes a ridiculous figure.

It challenges us to define a purpose for science; do more violent machines mean more war? Does the ability to innovate come without responsibility? Should the weapon makers be held accountable for their massive “collateral damage” or are they accountable only to their corporate shareholders? This little steam-punk anime is set in the mid-1800s. Funny. I just returned from seeing Iron Man. It’s set in the 21st Century yet it asks the same questions... I liked “Steamboy” even though it made the father and grandfather...out to be raving lunatics. Still, it leaves open a discussion of child as father to the man.

There were lots of things moving throughout and it definitely held your attention.  I liked how the ""family of geniuses"" was concentrated on.

I love Victorian England. So, when a legend like Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of ""Akira"", does a film based on that subject in that setting- you get ""Steamboy"".

You get a boy genius, family conflict (involving 3 generations), actual conflict with steam punk technology, and off we go on our journey where it\'s up to our boy genius to save the day! It serves the film fine, but it\'s nothing I haven\'t seen before. Good not great.

Because it takes place in England it makes more sense to watch it in English and when you add three mainstream actors like Alfred Molina, Patrick Stewart, and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin in the lead, it makes it a no-contest in favor of the English cast.

But, having them play pretty generic characters like a boy genius, like a mad scientist, like the old man warning against the dangers of certain applications of technology, makes it a waste of their talent.

Cheers!', 'The most British anime with an alternative Victorian-era war setting and surprisingly, it\'s by far the best steampunk-related “animation” I\'ve ever watched. Well, kind of.At first, Steamboy seems promising with its philosophy of science versus science as the nation\'s military forefront plot, whereby scientific achievement is acknowledged as a scale to maximizes power. Those two very distinctive beliefs are stimulated by Dr. Eddie and Dr. Lloyd which also happened to be the main character Ray\'s dad and grandpa. Dr. Eddie believes that science as mankind\'s modern God should have been used for military purposes while at the same time, Dr. Lloyd believes that science should...be used for the greater good and not for the greedy shareholders in the capitalist world.But as time progresses, the debate between those two characters is getting really really reaaaallly boring. It felt like the film is suffocating me with its never ending midpoint plus their lack of emotional build ups, and to be honest if its not for their highly detailed “animation” i’ve mentioned earlier, i would for sure click the stop button cuz holy schnitzel i legit wanted to punch my laptop screen. To think that at first i thought Dr. Eddie is the antagonist made me wanted to punch both my face and my laptop screen (again) simultaneously cuz in the end it doesn\'t matter, both Dr. Eddie and Dr. Lloyd is just a bunch of sick delusional boomers that are blinded by their judgments. And when it finally gets better in their ""rising action"" act, the film somehow shifts its attention into a hero concept film by using Ray’s child innocence, sigh. But oh wait it gets worse when you hit the climax. The only way i can explain it into words without giving any spoilers is basically like listening to Vivaldi\'s The Four Seasons Summer in Presto opening that goes on and on but twice the speed with no ending at all.The only interesting part i find from this film is their character placements. By placing three very different generations as their main focus and Ray as the center, it perfectly explained of how different their own generation view science can give a huge impact to mankind during the Victorian-era war. But to be honest that\'s it. I really tried to like this film tho, my expectations were very high specially this was Katsuhiro Otomo\'s film after Akira and Memories, which for me are two of his Magnum Opus.So to sum it up, in the end im dissapointed and i don\'t think i\'ll ever try to rewatch it.

It\'s suffocating and tiring, really.', ""Warning possible SpoilersSteamboy is one of the very few anime's that is set in my home country, the UK, during the Victorian era and for a movie, which concentrates on steam and the power of invention it was definitely an entertaining 2 hours.Story (10/10)The story concentrates mainly on James Ray Steam or just Ray, his father and grandfather have found something called a Steamball, a device that can provide any steam powered machine with unlimited power, but keeping his grandfathers warnings to mind, Ray tries his best to keep the steamball away from any evil doers who wish to exploit it's power.For a movie/film about...steam, I was really surprised how action packed this was, true there are some points where it cools down like when Ray gets captured and is being introduced to the Steam Castle, but there is a lot of explosions and stuff going on most of the time, however this wasn't a bad thing, in fact it kept me on my toes throughout the whole thing.Another really good part about the story, was the many points where Ray didn't know who should have the Steamball, until he came to the conclusion that no-one should have it, because no-one should have this power, because they will use it to conquer others, this is a message I really liked since it shows how devastating technology can be, if used in the wrong hands.The pacing was done really well too, it gave us a good amount of action, the characters backgrounds and reasons for what they are doing were really done well and it ended in a good way too, much like most films the good guys win, although there was a lot of destruction left behind.I also liked how the credits even gave us a snippet of what Ray's adventures were in the future and if anyone actually tries to do it, it would be a good idea for a TV series really, although it would be difficult considering how much money went into this movie/film.Characters (9/10)The characters were done really well, although there are a few here and there that didn't make me completely like them.Ray as a main character was done very well, he has a smart and observative personality, but he can also be very courageous, since a lot of the stuff he does in this movie/film would make a lot of people piss themselves. He didn't seem like a bad person either, you wanted to stick up for him throughout the whole situation and also making sure he gets out of it alive.Ray's grandfather and father were both really good characters too, both had good reasons for Ray to support them, making it difficult for him to choose who to go along with, this was definitely a family conflict you wouldn't want to get in the middle of, unless you know how steam works.Scarlett St Jones is the only weak link when it comes to the characters, for a main female protagonist she wasn't the best and came out more annoying than likeable, especially when she would keep yelling peoples names a lot, plus she didn't really add anything to the plot either other than being the daughter of the man in charge of the evil corporation, I will however give her credit for walking into the middle of a battlefield not giving a single fu*k.Art (10/10)If there is one thing I can say about this movie/film, is that it looks absolutely amazing. The way Victorian Britain has been created looks fantastic and spot on to the tiniest detail, well apart from all the new steam inventions like the steam castle and whatever Ray made to outrun the villains in the first encounter, however this doesn't ruin the whole feel of Victorian Britain, it just makes it look more badass.Speaking of inventions the different types of vehicles and other steam powered devices looked really incredible, definitely something that could've existed during this time, if madmen decided to put their minds to it.The visuals looked goddamn amazing too, just looking at the background had me in awe, so if there is one thing that Steamboy got completely right was the art.Sound (9/10)The soundtrack was pretty damn good, I can't remember too much of it, but it did give me a sorta superhero type vibe especially when Ray was whizzing around in his steampunk jetpack.Extras:The action was very well done and what kept me glued to the screen, it was also surprisingly more devastating than I was expecting too, I mean people died, a lot of people died at some point and it makes you think about the harsh reality that having technology like this can be a very bad thing, especially if this technology was put in the wrong hands.Another that I have to point out is the dub, now I know people have their crutches against dubs, but this is definitely one to watch in dub, because they actually have (mostly) British actors and actresses for the characters, which is extra points for trying to make it more realistic and believable, plus they had Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina, that's Professor X and Doc Octopus in the same movie/film what more could you want.Enjoyment (10/10)Overall (10/10)Overall this is a visual masterpiece of a film and is damn entertaining from start to finish, so if you're looking for an anime film/movie to make your mouth drop at the sight of it while also having some kickass steampunk action then you'll definitely love this. steam, I was really surprised how action packed this was, true there are some points where it cools down like when Ray gets captured and is being introduced to the Steam Castle, but there is a lot of explosions and stuff going on most of the time, however this wasn't a bad thing, in fact it kept me on my toes throughout the whole thing.Another really good part about the story, was the many points where Ray didn't know who should have the Steamball, until he came to the conclusion that no-one should have it, because no-one should have this power, because they will use it to conquer others, this is a message I really liked since it shows how devastating technology can be, if used in the wrong hands.The pacing was done really well too, it gave us a good amount of action, the characters backgrounds and reasons for what they are doing were really done well and it ended in a good way too, much like most films the good guys win, although there was a lot of destruction left behind.I also liked how the credits even gave us a snippet of what Ray's adventures were in the future and if anyone actually tries to do it, it would be a good idea for a TV series really, although it would be difficult considering how much money went into this movie/film.Characters (9/10)The characters were done really well, although there are a few here and there that didn't make me completely like them.Ray as a main character was done very well, he has a smart and observative personality, but he can also be very courageous, since a lot of the stuff he does in this movie/film would make a lot of people piss themselves.

Steamboy came in the form of a steampunk adventure within an alternate timeline around 1860. In many ways, it shares similarities to Akira mixed within a Victorian-Era compared with something directly out of an H.G. Wells book. It certainly has countless original ideas and a compelling story to go along with it.Immediately, the story opens around a young man named Ray receiving a package from his grandfather. Then, villainous men show up to get this package and thus begins the adventure of constant running away....This package contains a “steam ball” which can perfectly store steam power under immense pressures. In this time, steam has become something like nuclear technology of today, and the science behind it runs everything. This created an incredible steampunk environment and atmosphere for the story. The escape scene Ray must go through just to keep this new invention away from the bad guys is both hilarious and edge-of-your-seat action. It goes from Ray escaping on an invention like a messed-up vibrating unicycle to an epic train scene being chased by this steam powered death tank. It all fits nicely at the start. Inevitably Ray gets caught and taken to where his father is. News flash, his father is bad and wants to use the steam ball to power a machine of mass destruction.Steamboy has amazing artwork setting an amazing tone of how mankind relies solely off of machine technology. Unfortunately, because everything is in this Victorian-Era and steam oriented, this leads to the colour pallet of a grey sky in Germany during Fall. It means that the entire film is very dreary and bland. The voice acting across all languages from English to Japanese and even German, are outstanding at least. However, the characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part. It’s not a flaw worth docking points, but the main female character in Scarlett is an odd one. She is the rich daughter of the O’Hara Foundation which wants to utilize the steam ball and sell the death machine to the highest bidder. Her character is the worst. Simply put, she is spoiled, selfish, and very naïve to the point where the viewer hopes something would shut her mouth. All the members of Ray’s family have their place, but really this anime film is about the adventure.The film does not have much for depth other than a steampunk love story. It is one retro-futuristic invention after another with crazy action sequences taking up the majority of the movie. At one point, a third of the way through, we get steam powered armour suits murdering soldiers and these super robot soldiers roll their way through the defences. Moments like that make for either a fun action adventure, or a repetitive battle of pointless explosions depending on who is watching it. Anime fans will likely see the first.In the end, Steamboy and its incredible production value does not bring the most in depth story or characters.

The cities of Manchester and London are portrayed quite well in this movie and some of the artwork is just gorgeous; however; where Steamboy really shines is in it\'s use of 3D, and we know that Sunrise 3D is quite choppy sometimes, but this is barely...even noticable and you are able to admire the intricacy that this movie has, but... there are a few bad points unfortunately.The story\'s kind of weak, but it\'s enjoyable; however; the movie felt kind of... empty at parts and sometimes the animation wasn\'t at it\'s bed and seemed very juddery, but this was mostly in the beginning and wasn\'t even noticable in the second half of the movie. It wasn\'t much of a bother but I did think my disk was broken at once.The soundtrack\'s pretty good, it\'s mostly orchestral; however; in the English cut version, it\'s completely different and goes more well with the whole ""England"" feel, but I like my anime to be untouched and as it should be.And finally, the character\'s in this are quite good too. From a steam-obsessed boy to a man with a cyborg eye, this movie is pretty impressive, but nowhere near as good as Akira, but don\'t be biased and skip this movie.

Not that much more positively, mind you.Steamboy is, if the title didn\'t already imply, a Victorian England Steampunk movie. I have no hate against Steampunk, but no love for it either, and Steamboy, I feel, falls flat on the premise of having awesome steam-powered machines fueling the action. They\'re there, but only on a small scale.The premise of Steamboy is that two famous father-son inventors have discovered a marvelous steam-powered machine part which will change the future of mankind. The grandson gets involved...in the plot, thinking that his father is dead, and his grandfather has entrusted to him the most prized of their proprietary inventions: the Steamball.Steamboy does a few things right, but far many more things wrong. The O\'Hara foundation, who is funding the Steam family\'s research, is interested in harnessing the power for weapons of war. Their English opposition, on the other hand... is... also, interested in harvesting the power for weapons of war? Taking place in 1866 England, the American Civil War has already passed, so not only does and English vs. American war seem out of place, but the idea of warmongering for either country seems mismatched.This isn\'t really a fault of the movie, though, since the ideas are much more generalized: should science be used to advance the military prowess of powerful countries, or not? Does humanity suffer from the advancement of military technologies, or does it merely allow the most powerful countries to assert their culture as the proper and right culture and enforce their beliefs onto the less powerful, or does the creation of man-annihilating machines simply allow the powerful to decimate their opposition?Unfortunately, Steamboy only dwells on this issue for about 15 minutes of the two hour runtime. The majority of the film revolves around the grandfather-father-son dillema of who is right - the crazed father or the righteous grandfather? This conflict could have been more dynamic, as we see in earlier scenes that the father has been writing home consistently even though it\'s been censored by his company, but later on it\'s revealed that he\'s insane anyway, so the point becomes moot. The movie does try to stick it to the industrial-military complex at points, but this seems mostly childish, as evidences by the main proprietor / opposer of those ideas, namingly, the spoiled O\'Hara child.Steamboy could have succeeded on a philosophical and emotional level, but it wraps itself too much around the conflict of the ridiculous situation at stake: a giant steam-powered floating island which is about to crash into London. Considering that I haven\'t heard about the ""great crashing of the steam castle into London"" in history books, I can\'t say I was too intrigued by what the outcome was going to be. There is definite potential in Steamboy if you\'re a fan of the Steampunk genre, but don\'t expect more than is on the surface. in the plot, thinking that his father is dead, and his grandfather has entrusted to him the most prized of their proprietary inventions: the Steamball.Steamboy does a few things right, but far many more things wrong.

Does humanity suffer from the advancement of military technologies, or does it merely allow the most powerful countries to assert their culture as the proper and right culture and enforce their beliefs onto the less powerful, or does the creation of man-annihilating machines simply allow the powerful to decimate their opposition?Unfortunately, Steamboy only dwells on this issue for about 15 minutes of the two hour runtime. The majority of the film revolves around the grandfather-father-son dillema of who is right - the crazed father or the righteous grandfather? This conflict could have been more dynamic, as we see in earlier scenes that the father has been writing home consistently even though it\'s been censored by his company, but later on it\'s revealed that he\'s insane anyway, so the point becomes moot. The movie does try to stick it to the industrial-military complex at points, but this seems mostly childish, as evidences by the main proprietor / opposer of those ideas, namingly, the spoiled O\'Hara child.Steamboy could have succeeded on a philosophical and emotional level, but it wraps itself too much around the conflict of the ridiculous situation at stake: a giant steam-powered floating island which is about to crash into London. Considering that I haven\'t heard about the ""great crashing of the steam castle into London"" in history books, I can\'t say I was too intrigued by what the outcome was going to be. There is definite potential in Steamboy if you\'re a fan of the Steampunk genre, but don\'t expect more than is on the surface.', 'Fantastic art, beautifully rendered animations that feel very fluid. For a movie titled ""Steamboy"" I strongly expected steam punk aesthetics throughout the movie and was met higher than my expectations. Character designs and artwork regarding its historical setting was contextually very accurate, and made for a very swift immersion for audiences into the world and beginning of the plot. Easily the strongest aspect of enjoy-ability from this movie.The several chase and action scenes of the movie involving lots and lots of Steam powered machinery was very fun.Most flaws lie in the writing of this movie, and it is rare for me to rate a movie...above a 5 with lacking writing as it is arguably the heart of any movie.Firstly, the introduction, usage, and portrayal of the MacGuffin of the movie, the Steam Ball - was very uninspired and bland. The movie never really goes into the whys and hows of the Steam Ball, which would\'ve made it more interesting/easier for audiences to consciously care about. However its just shrugged off as this ""important thing"" which has insane amounts of steam power and is juggled between the several parties for the remainder of the film. It\'s very easy for writers to use any form of MacGuffin as a shortcut to avoid detailed exposition, but the Steam Ball was a clear example of how NOT to use it.Scarlett\'s role, in the context of the story is very VERY important. As a literary character in the movie however, was severely lacking. She didn\'t really serve a purpose and fell into the sad trap hole of forgettable supporting female characters.The Steamboy himself. I felt as though his most important scenes were all done and dusted by the starting half of the film, and towards the end he simply served as a ""fetchboy"" of the Steam Ball without having any influence whatsoever in the events that occurred, despite the heavy foreshadowing and possible implications. Of course him carrying the Steam Ball around and stopping the antagonistic powers of the movie from abusing it was what he ultimately did, BUT it doesn\'t mean that the way he did it was interesting or clever.An enjoyable movie for first time watchers, and the animation and art throughout is very satisfying to the eyes. People who love steampunk will really enjoy this film. People who don\'t like steampunk, will still gain interest through this film. However, the aforementioned flaws are too apparent to enjoy this movie for a second or third time.Final Wording: GEARLTY PLEASURE above a 5 with lacking writing as it is arguably the heart of any movie.Firstly, the introduction, usage, and portrayal of the MacGuffin of the movie, the Steam Ball - was very uninspired and bland.

"", '(This review goes to all parts of the movie series.)Now, here’s a thing that I never noticed in most recent anime before and that is called the Movie Series……now this is definitely different from the term “OVA” as in movie series are released theatrically while OVAs are direct-to-video. Many examples of anime movie series include Kara No Kyōukai (or The Garden of Sinners), Broken Blade & Mobile Suit Gundam UC Unicorn. The film series is directed by Umanosuke Iida, known for directing anime such as Devilman, Vandread, Hellsing (the original one), Mobile Suit Gundan: The 08th MS Team & Shangri-La. Unfortunately, before the movies were...released, he passed away of lung cancer at the age of 49 in 2010, and that’s the same year that Satoshi Kon passed away from pancreatic cancer..…..OK, let’s just get to the review.In a futuristic Tokyo, unique human beings who have awakened distinct powers are being hunted by a secret organization named Custos. Known as ""Attractors"", these exceptional humans are joining forces to defend themselves. They are led by a boy named Quon, an idealist who is determined to save all the Attractors he can.Now here’s the thing about these films: They are quite reminiscent of the dark superhero genre and mostly the X-Men franchise, which are the majority of which they are parallel to, such as, ordinary people who have these powers that they can’t control, which have affected their past and scarred them for life and they are being taken in a facility, much like Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters to an extent and like that, they are being hunted down by a secret organization that wants to do them in. Yeah, this idea isn’t exactly wholly original but it’s an interesting concept and premise and I can say for that reason alone, it works on paper and it does work on the big screen.As for the characters, they are actually very stock characters with hit or miss qualities about them with having powers that can cause consequences and mostly regret. The main character, Quon, who has lived over a millennia, from witnessing his family being slaughtered and wanting vengeance ever since. Now I say Quon was some similarities to Wolverine but here’s the difference between them….Wolverine has more charisma and personality than Quon as that character seems unmotivated most of the time but he is not the all-mighty God-mode being that most people would suspect as he gets his ass kicked a lot in fights but he does manage to heal himself after.  There’s Yuri, the flirty but competent attractor whose powers aren’t exactly developed but can maintain it; Kiri, the innocent young girl whose gift is her voice and with it, she can only use it to heal or to destroy and I got to admit, that trait is close to being the character Rogue. Tei is the telepathic woman who can communicate with others from many distances but can relive painful memories of the past. Miu is the young girl that can communicate to animals but her limiter enables her to speak normally and also the animal’s language. Takao is the smart-alecky, lazy, but complacent attractor who talks shit sometimes but not so much to be an asshole.  Yuma is the boy whose power is to erupt colored orbs from his body whenever he’s upset or angry and the antagonist Genji Kamishiro is the class-A comic book-style villain who wants to control all the Attractors and to gain order……so, yeah, he’s the typical villain and last but not least Towa is Quon’s younger brother, who is believed that whoever contacts him will have their powers increased.As for the animation, I can safely say that BONES did an excellent job on this, especially the fighting animation where it feels so fast-paced and often gritty sometimes and that goes to the art style of the show, too, especially with some scenes that would be gruesome for younger eyes. The main theme for the show called “Reckless” by LAZY is somewhat thrilling and yet unintentionally funny for every time I hear, “Feel Rock Emotion, Burning Rock Emotion” because I know they use Engrish in some of the lyrics, but it still feel silly once you heard it so many times.For the dub by Sentai Filmworks, I can see why I said that Quon had no charisma and that’s thanks to Corey Hartzog and his lackluster performance as Quon sounds too chill, even in a tense situation, but I will say that, I’m pleased with the rest of their performances including Jessica Boone as Yuri, Emily Neves as Kiri & Monica Rial as Tei.FINAL VERDICT: After seeing some lackluster titles from BONES (No.6, Ghost Slayers Ayashi), this is an improvement and the kind of quality that BONES should have put in most of their shows. It’s a concept that seems foreign to Japan but if handled well, it can turn to be pretty impressive.

There\'s a new Attractor (super-human) in town with the power to control flowers and their fragrance, which also has the power to evoke strong emotions and insanity in humans.The first half of the episode is presented in a pseudo-detective manner. Two of the rookie cyborgs working under Custos (a secret military-like organization set out to destroy all Attractors), Kazami and Asuka, use the advanced technology at their disposal to investigate crime scenes that have been popping up around the city. They suspect an...Attractor at work behind the serial murders, and follow up on leads related to the flowery tableaus left behind. Meanwhile, Quon is also trying to find the culprit.While interesting, the story never really coalesces into anything great. I enjoyed the detective aspects, but they were short lived and never fully realized due to the shortness of the episode, and the director\'s need to showcase as many of the characters as possible. I believe the main problem holding this show back is the extensive cast of characters - there are simply too many to focus on, and the show seems to want to develop most of them at the same time. Most scenes are short and cut to another character before much happens. This has an effect of keeping every character fresh in our minds, but little else.Despite a general lack of character development, the new flower Attractor introduced does manage to come across well throughout the episode. His struggle, represented metaphorically by the struggle that flowers face living in a world dominated by humans, is the struggle of all the Attractors at large, and drives across the point that societal outcasts have a hard time, and can lose all hope and even themselves in the face of a cruel and uncaring world.Even though this show doesn\'t carry the heavy maturity of other shows, Towa no Quon 2 is a darker and heavier adventure than the first episode. The murder scenes are actually rather brutal, and we are presented with the sad reality with which our hero Quon must grapple - he cannot save everyone, and every time he fails, it means that another life is lost forever, regardless of whether that person was \'good\' or not.The animation and sound remain top notch, with a lot of very beautiful scenes involving flowers. The fight scenes in this episode aren\'t as thrilling as the last outing, but the final fight is physically much larger in scale and the flower Attractor is extremely good looking in full bloom. In place of Quon/Insania performing any fancy moves or defeating the enemy, the episode chooses to focus his fighting on revealing more of his powers, and hinting more at an unpleasant past.This episode aims to present us a tragic view of the world, and in that aspect it succeeds.  We are able to gain a deeper sense for the life-or-death struggles the Attractors face. Unfortunately in terms of character development we don\'t see anything deep - the detective work done by the cyborgs feels pleasant or interesting but not meaningful. We are given something with Quon, and another main character Kiri keeps developing her powers and struggles to control them, but it all feels like just a taste - a bare minimum.Even with all that said, I believe the episode was approximately as good as the first, and will not disappoint those who enjoyed the first episode, except somewhat in the action department.  However, it is still promising enough to continue to the sequel. Attractor at work behind the serial murders, and follow up on leads related to the flowery tableaus left behind.

World Dai Star,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53698/World_Dai_Star,"['Just as a small part here: The review was written preliminary after the first 6 episodes, but overall, all I wrote back then still holds true after having watched all episodes. With the addition that I really enjoyed the character moments in the second half even more than I already did in the first half. They really nailed the ""show-don\'t-tell"" storytelling aspect in this show.World Dai Star is a very good combination of your general Cute-Girls-Doing-Cute-Things genre with the profession of acting. The main character Kokona wants to become a world famous actress, but is missing what people call ""sense"" and is therefore being rejected...after most auditions. She is encouraged by her friend Shizuka to still try and is finally able to perform well during an audition joining the SIRIUS theater where she learns to improve her acting while also having fun with the other actresses.I don\'t want to go into more details of the plot, because there are a lot of potential spoilers here, but there are interesting aspects that keep the story engaging, ranging from understanding the abilities of the different actresses (the ""senses"") that are all describing different acting styles, but also the understanding of the problems that come with this kind of style. For example, one character is able to read the thoughts of the audience and is therefore able to adjust their acting so the audience enjoys it more. But that also leads to her acting too much for the audience and going against the original plan. All of that is combined with fun moments between the girls that strengthen their friendship.Where I think the anime is very strong is in its presentation. The animation is some of the strongest of the season when it comes to the acting scenes. The movements are so fluid that most shows can\'t even compare. This helps to show small details in the acting through which the characters define themselves but more importantly their role. The second part of the presentation is the fact that the show is not afraid to leave things up to the viewers. Episode 1 for example has a big twist at the end that is not put into the forefront too much. It shows that the show trusts their viewers to pay attention and not needing to explain every small detail. Which is also why a lot of people actually missed this twist (as you can see by checking the comments for that episode).Therefore, I recommend everyone to give the show a shot for at least 1 episode. You can probably gauge if you like the show or not after that first episode and its twist. But I think, the show deserves to at least get this chance, because the passion in this project, especially when it comes to the acting scenes and the fluidity of the movement, can be felt like in no other anime of the season. after most auditions.

Dai star is a somewhat fresh take on the CGDCT formula and offers some of the most fluid animation I’ve ever seen.While it’s definitely a very anime-y take on stage acting and not the most realistic, Dai star shows us just how competitive the top acting troupes can be and takes us along on a journey to become a professional actor. It was one of the most under appreciated shows of the season as well.If you’re anything like...me, you probably know very little about theater. While not an expert after this, I feel like I could at least have a conversation with someone about it now and have a newfound appreciation for the medium thanks to the lengths this series goes to in order to teach you about the business aspect, the hard work that’s required and the pressure of being an actor. It’s no Oshi no Ko, but it is a really fun and cute experience.The main strength of this show lies with the characters. I think Kokona and the other girls are really interesting. Seeing their various motivations for wanting to succeed was nice, but I particularly liked the multitude of approaches to acting. Everyone’s acting style is an extension of who they are as people. This manifests itself in the form of “senses” which are basically superpowers that the best actors have. Allowing them to fully lose themselves in the scene and script. The different abilities were fascinating to me.The relationships between characters were satisfying as well, particularly between Kokona and Katharina, the two main rivals in this show. All of their interactions were fun and they pushed each other to new heights as actors. I loved seeing Kokona grow over the course of the show from a timid and mediocre actor to one capable of taking on the biggest roles in the biggest projects. Her emotional development feels natural and rewarding.This show has some of the same staff who worked on idoly pride involved as well, and if you’re at all familiar with Idoly Pride, you know it had some of the best animation for its idol performances. Same holds true here. The character motions are buttery smooth during the acting scenes and really engrossing.I think if you’re looking for a new CGDCT to watch or just want to learn more about stage acting, this is a really good option. Story is not going to blow you away, but the animation and characters are great. It’s certainly worth a shot. Sad this is ending, but looking forward to the gacha game.Dai-Star gets 8, out of 10 me, you probably know very little about theater. While not an expert after this, I feel like I could at least have a conversation with someone about it now and have a newfound appreciation for the medium thanks to the lengths this series goes to in order to teach you about the business aspect, the hard work that’s required and the pressure of being an actor.

Mixed Media Project Slice of Life shows with too many girls based around some niche hobby/industry always end up the same way. Be it Cue, Extreme Hearts, PuraOre, and now this. The fundamental issue is that, even with a main character at hand, it always ends up pretty mediocre around the middle and my interest in the project just completely fades less than halfway through.World Dai Star has some interesting things going for it initially at least. You got Takahiro, you got a schizophrenic hallucination that is a product of the main character. The problem is that they never really...do anything interesting with it. The MC's tulpa manifests physically, then she disappears, then reappears at the end again. Not much is done to explore this, or how inexplicably every theatre actress has superpowers (and I mean real superpowers, not chuuni delusions) that only come to life on stage.

Instead, World Dai Star is just pretty boring for the most part with overused character archetypes playing off of each other to some nice animation and music.

It\'s studio Lerche and director Yuu Kinome back at the helm once again, for another round of Idoly Pride! Except, what\'s the plan for the ghost story plot this time?Shows about theatrical tropes are nothing new, if you refer to the chunk of AniManga content about the thematics of performing arts that has come out in the last 5 years. Shows like Summer 2018\'s Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight (which I still stand by my review that the show is the gold standard, even for its time) and Summer 2021\'s Kageki Shoujo!!, which focuses heavily on the actual all-female Takarazuka...Revue references in its own right. World Dai Star on the other hand, created by author Takahiro of Akame ga Kill!, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru and Mato Seihei no Slave fame, is a mix between both Revue Starlight and Kageki Shoujo!!, embodying the former\'s extreme attention to detail and everything else about the latter, from the theatrical to the core foundation and presentation aspects.As is the foundation for all shows, there is a newbie in town to audition for some of the greatest talents there were, and in the case of this show, it\'s 16-year-old Kokona Otori auditioning for the Sirius theatrical troupe in the hope that she\'ll become a World Dai Star, representing Japan to reach out to the globe, which has seen countless Dai Star performers burst in popularity and perform wonderous acts to acclaim.As we all know, auditions for prestigious troupes like Sirius have a high bar to follow from generations past, and the key to becoming a world-famous actress is through this ability called ""Sense"". In retrospect, ""Sense"", like a person\'s DNA, is unique to each and every one of the actresses\' abilities, which can range from reading and adjusting the audience\'s mood, to reeling in others and putting the one using her Sense in control of the play onstage. But in fairness to Kokona, she doesn\'t have any of that, even though her accompaniment is in the form of Shizuka, a girl whom Kokona met when she was young, and only she can see her. On that note, if you watched Idoly Pride back in Winter 2021, you would immediately know what\'s up.Even though Kokona faces a tough road ahead in her acceptance route into Sirius, with Shizuka\'s backing, she is able to cross that bar, but each and every member and staff team in Sirius are talented and distinguished in their own right: director Shamo Yamabuki, manager-cum-current World Dai Star Noa Hiiragi, and the growing potentials of Yae Niizuma, Chisa Sasuga, and Panda Yanagiba. One look at them, and you can tell that they have experience that gives them an advantage. And along with Kokona, comes foreigner Kathrina Griebel, whose family also stems from the World Dai Star treatment, with Kathrina migrating from Germany to Japan to start her road to stardom in that Sirius branch. It\'s a competitive world out there, and no less committed is Sirius to fleshing out potential candidates to stand out as the best of the best. Every girl competes for the top position (just like in Revue Starlight) and respects the crafts behind the fictional plays (just like in Kageki Shoujo!!), and it\'s once again another interesting fiction story for the main girl to stand out and realise her dream to be a top actress, starting from scratch. Other than that, it\'s akin to the same CGDCT tropes, but in the performing arts aspect.To be expected, this is Lerche back at it again with the idol themes it once carved from the days of Idoly Pride, and the animation at certain times is stunning. Probably not close to the levels of said show, but when director Yuu Kinome decides to ramp up certain scenes in this show, it really hits you in the feels. The devil is in the details, and World Dai Star has it for the hook and wink of plot twists. Music is rather OK; though grand, I don\'t find it memorable, sadly.If you still have the pension for more Idoly Pride stuff, World Dai Star will fill that gap, until whenever Lerche and director Yuu Kinome want to make more of the same-same-but-different derivative of the one original show that did wonders for them.

Wu Geng Ji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33758/Wu_Geng_Ji,"['Wu Geng Ji ReviewStory (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+The Story of Wu Geng Ji starts off just like the Manhua as we see through the perspective of Zi Shou as he reigns his Kingdom and the struggles that come with it. There really is not that much of a difference when it comes to the adaptation from a story standpoint I think is fine although the fact that this is a ONA not an actual Dong Hua and only runs for 15 minutes at a time does feel a bit more fast pace than the Manhua, as you know usually the...first chapter of any Manga, Manhwa or Manhua are usually the largest and for reason. Seeing as chapter one of this is quite heft this first episode doesn\'t cover all of it if someone was leaving with first impressions they can be hindered because of such a decision when it comes to how much that adapted per episode, even with that being said it\'s the only con I can think of the actual content as far as I can see has not modified so it\'s still very good from an adaptation standpoint.Art and Animation 7/10 (Good)CG Quality at it\'s best (9.50/10) GreatCG Quality at it\'s worst (4.50/10) BadSo this section is the absolute most controversial section in this review and with reason... COMPUTER GENERATED ANIMATION... If you couldn\'t tell already I am giant Feng Shen Ji fan (probably the biggest you\'ll ever find) and when I found out this existed and was in CG I was ready to punch a baby. After watching episode one I was disgusted by this adaptation asking myself ""How could this happen?"", ""I was waiting for FSJ to get animated for so long and I finally get one and it\'s this CG piece of shit!"" trust me this went on for about a week in a half of my just disappointing in China/Hong Kong for shitting on their chance to make FSJ known positively. I still watched it because I am a fan of the series and I feel like if I call myself a true FSJ can I have to see this through. So animation quality of episode 1 (because of how I went there I didn\'t like it) but by every episode I watched I came around slowly but surely. And by episode 5 and especially 6 certain scenes actually look gorgeous and I can\'t deny that. Now it\'s not consistent as just like the scenes I considered gorgeous (The Zi Shou Phoenix Unleashed vs Tian Kui) there were small scenes I felt were still either cringe worthy to look at or just mediocre. So I\'m going to have to average this out because trust me although I still today hate that this is CG, it is FAR better than the CG in Berserk, Kingdom, Knights of Sidonia and Ajin (yes I know KoS and Ajin are both made by the same people but u get my point). If I had to rate the CG quality as a whole for the other anime I named above it would be Berserk 5, Kingdom 4 and Kos/Ajin 6, and with that being said if that\'s what I would rate their CG quality I would put WGJ\'s at a 7 as I\'m taking the amazing scenes and cringe worthy/mediocre scenes and averaging them out. I think this cringe worthy/mediocre scenes are still better than Kingdom\'s but not that better so I\'ll give that a 4.5, the gorgeous scenes in my opinion are right below the quality of the CG quality you see from Final Fantasy: Advent Children, Kingsglaive or Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary and I think those 3 have a CG quality of 10 so I give the best CG animate scenes in WGJ a 9.5. With all that being said 4.5+9.5/2 gives you 7 which is something I can agree with as I stated before I think WGJ\'s CG animation Knights of Sidonia and Ajin which I gave a 6 so a 7 sounds about right to me taking everything I\'ve said into consideration. LASTLY I have to point out that China just recently started doing CG animated Dong Hua so they are still learning while Japan has been doing this shit for years and the stuff still doesn\'t look that good, so I gotta give them some what of credit for doing something better than Japan who\'s been doing this shit for years upon year.Sound (8/10)More Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+Now the sound section for this is actually very good. The music I feel matches the many many hype moments that this series brings to the table, the Chinese voice acting is very good and the opening and ending songs I\'ve taken quite a liking to by the time episode 6 came out they are quite unique and catchy as I don\'t really hear Chinese music that often in my usually day.Characters (9/10) GreatMore Specifically (9.25/10) GreatAll of the characters that I\'ve seen so far are being adapted 1-1. Which is a good thing. But there are a few characters they have changed the actually character design behind them and it urk me more than I thought it would. The first one doesn\'t bother me that much only because it they didn\'t change that much plus it actually looks a bit cooler in this Dong Hua and that\'s Tai Ji who they changed his hair for white to red with a bit of fire which was cool it really showed their fire effects which look phenomenal so I give him a pass. But the other character I can\'t let ride out what so ever and that\'s Shi Xing, in the manhua he\'s is the big buff red skinned, white eyes and white haired beast who easily caused the most trouble through out FSJ1. When I first saw him in this Dong Hua adaptation I didn\'t even recognize him. They turned him into this slimmer version of himself with purple armor and purple aura around him with light purple hair and red eyes. Honestly it\'s a big step down in my opinion and the making Tai Ji look cooler doesn\'t balance out how bad they made Shi Xing look. Don\'t get me wrong he as a character design doesn\'t look bad but I think it\'s bad when you put Shi Xing\'s name behind it, if you know how important everything that has to do with Shi Xing is to the overall story of FSJ then you should understand my pain. With all that being said none of them actually break character and acted differently but looks are something that mean a lot in FSJ in my opinion and changing them is changing the character to an extent. Other than that everything else seems spot on and I\'ve review all the manhua and I gave this section a 10/10 so with these to new changes, changes are made to my score also. (Also if there are any more characters in the future that are changed trust me I\'ll come back to this review and change it accordingly also!)Tai Ji (+0.25/10)Shi Xing (-1.00/10.25)This gives you a (9.25/10)Enjoyment (8/10) Very GoodLike I said before my first impressions of this Dong Hua was quite bad as going in know it was CG, Episode 1 only being 15 minutes and the hand full scenes looking mediocre at best for episode 1 and 2 as far as I can remember my enjoyment for it was around a 6. But over time as I got used to the CG and the story, characters and music are still very good my enjoyment rose episode by episode and the fact by episode 6 the good CG scenes outweigh the bad CG scenes by quite a lot. As of right now my enjoyment for this Dong Hua is an 8, it\'s something I actually can say I look forward to watching bi-weekly when it releases.Overall (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.35/10) Very GoodOnly 6 episodes in need I say and it has changed my opinion immensely. I say give it until that before you make a fair judgement of this series seeing as the episodes are only 15 minutes each it shouldn\'t take that long to get there, episodes 1 and 2 I don\'t think are a fair representation on what to expect from the entire series I believe episodes 5 and 6 are though. I\'m surprised that I can give this above a 7 right now with all of the hatred I still have for it being CG. But this is my putting all my subjective thoughts to the side and rating it objectively. For one of China\'s first CG animated ONAs this is very good I guess and it is indeed getting better by every episode that releases. first chapter of any Manga, Manhwa or Manhua are usually the largest and for reason.

The latest seasons of Japanese anime have been nothing short of boring and unpalatable. Not to mention the 2D persona charecters we have today, intense pandering, intense fan service, annoying main and side charecters, plot armor too thick I can't evenNot that Chinese anime are perfect, they are far from perfect.But this anime exceeded all of my expectations. The main charecter is someone who was once the son of...a great King and a God. But he has since gone thro many troubles and decided to take revenge against the gods for what they did to him, family and his kingdomWell it's good stuff everything about it was a masterpiece so go watch it a great King and a God. But he has since gone thro many troubles and decided to take revenge against the gods for what they did to him, family and his kingdomWell it's good stuff everything about it was a masterpiece so go watch it"", 'After watching several Chinese anime, I was about to give up on it. But then I stumbled upon Wu Geng Ji and after watching the first 2 episodes I was hooked. The story is much more nonlinear than Japanese anime (after episode 10) in a very refreshing way. The first 10 episode battle is the greatest of any anime that I have seen, and I have watched plenty. It is epic with a good sense of moral.Although the first 30 episodes are just the beginning, I enjoyed all, and cannot wait to see the rest. I am looking forward to more anime like this. ', ""The Legend and the Hero S1 ReviewThe gods in Wu Geng Ji are overexerting beings that control humanity from behind the scenes by enslaving prisoners of war and citizens to collect blood crystal, a rare ore consumed by the gods. The shang Dynasty, one of the great powers in the world of Wu Geng Ji rejects the overbearing gods orders to open a new blood crystal mine which leads the gods to destroy the Shang Dynasty. Zi Zhou, the King of Shang Dynasty experienced the struggles in the mines and decided to fight against the gods for the people of his Kingdom. He and...his younger brother Zi Yu fight to the death against many gods; However, even with the power of a Pheonix one of the most powerful Celestial beings Zi Zhou loses when Tian intervenes killing him. Wu Geng discovers his mother is a  goddess, who shares her dying breath reincarnating him into another body to follow fate and end the gods ruling.Story: 6/10The story starts off with great promise. The first impressions are that Zi Zhou is a tyrannical ruler by rejecting the gods messenger in the beginning. However, as the story develops and more details are revealed to us it becomes apparent that the gods are exploitative and have been for many generations. Zi Zhu's rebellion is a spark that will start a war between the gods and the humans eventually leading the war is Zi Zhu's son Wu Geng. However, in the first season we only see the character training arc and world building through the enslaved miners.The story shows a lot of promise and is actually very structured from the beginning despite being generally focused on combat aspects more than plot and character development.This fights in this series feel dragged out, the beginning fight alone lasted almost an hour, you're crazy if you think I'm going to watch back and forth fighting for that long - it does this several times in the season which is ridiculous.Art & Sound: 6/10This series was released almost 4 years from now which is a surprise. The details and animation are pretty good for an older series. Series as old as this tend to have cheap rendered CGI and character rigging but I seem this is an exception.The sound effects and music design are average.Character: 4/10Killing a lot of the main characters and even the MC in the first few episodes is very bold of Wu Geng Ji. It feels like this series doesn't really value character development unless its the main character otherwise everyone else serves as stepping stones for MC to get out of sticky situations. A few examples is when Wu Geng saves the ogre he fought and treated him like a friend yet he is on his deathbed at the entrance of the mines and Wu Geng does nothing to preserve him. Or the old guy that is worried for Wu Geng's health when he leaves the sleeping chambers - Seems like it could have been omitted or elaborated instead of just being an add on character scene. These gaps in character development are noticeable and distracting dead ends that I hope are fixed in the future of the series.Overall: 6/10I might stick around on this series because I hear there is a lot of praise in the later seasons. So far, this might be a series like Battle Through the Heavens where it gets much better in the latter seasons because of change of art and story approach. his younger brother Zi Yu fight to the death against many gods; However, even with the power of a Pheonix one of the most powerful Celestial beings Zi Zhou loses when Tian intervenes killing him. Wu Geng discovers his mother is a  goddess, who shares her dying breath reincarnating him into another body to follow fate and end the gods ruling.Story: 6/10The story starts off with great promise. The first impressions are that Zi Zhou is a tyrannical ruler by rejecting the gods messenger in the beginning. However, as the story develops and more details are revealed to us it becomes apparent that the gods are exploitative and have been for many generations. Zi Zhu's rebellion is a spark that will start a war between the gods and the humans eventually leading the war is Zi Zhu's son Wu Geng. However, in the first season we only see the character training arc and world building through the enslaved miners.The story shows a lot of promise and is actually very structured from the beginning despite being generally focused on combat aspects more than plot and character development.This fights in this series feel dragged out, the beginning fight alone lasted almost an hour, you're crazy if you think I'm going to watch back and forth fighting for that long - it does this several times in the season which is ridiculous.Art & Sound: 6/10This series was released almost 4 years from now which is a surprise. The details and animation are pretty good for an older series. Series as old as this tend to have cheap rendered CGI and character rigging but I seem this is an exception.The sound effects and music design are average.Character: 4/10Killing a lot of the main characters and even the MC in the first few episodes is very bold of Wu Geng Ji. It feels like this series doesn't really value character development unless its the main character otherwise everyone else serves as stepping stones for MC to get out of sticky situations. A few examples is when Wu Geng saves the ogre he fought and treated him like a friend yet he is on his deathbed at the entrance of the mines and Wu Geng does nothing to preserve him. Or the old guy that is worried for Wu Geng's health when he leaves the sleeping chambers - Seems like it could have been omitted or elaborated instead of just being an add on character scene. These gaps in character development are noticeable and distracting dead ends that I hope are fixed in the future of the series.Overall: 6/10I might stick around on this series because I hear there is a lot of praise in the later seasons.

Its like loading up a 90s era version of Final Fantasy set in China and not having to actually play the game as you watch 14 minute cutscenes.The story line for me is very good, straight up fantasy about per-warring states China and about the people trapped in serfdom, a charismatic leader, a spoiled prince with naive and arrogant outlook on life, his caring queen ma vs...a controlling god king n gods that demands the world and dehumanizes humans. There are good tense moments and twists, the characters can seem a little OP at times but the fights are somewhat entertaining.There is also decent character development which can seem sudden at times but its also understandable given the circumstances and pressure some of the characters are under.The voice acting is well done, I don't really take issue with the soundtrack but I think it would have been better with more funding and longer episodes. Also theres a fair few homages to some manga and other media.Also WEIBO?????????????????????? chill .I will watch til the end and maybe update this review.Thanks for reading. a controlling god king n gods that demands the world and dehumanizes humans.

Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48471/Tsuki_to_Laika_to_Nosferatu,"[""Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut. Just the title lets you know this is going to be a weird one. I went in having absolutely no idea what to expect, but I was still somehow disappointed by this one. I’m going honest and upfront. This isn't very good.Brought to you from the director of Cutey Honey Universe and a first-time writer, this is an alternate history version of the space race told through the perspective of the Soviet Union. Isn’t that literally just the plot of Royal Space Force? Gainax already did that shit in 1987 during the Cold War. Irina adds one new element to the...formula by adding vampires. What do vampires have to do with space exploration? Absolutely nothing. However, Irina wants to preach a message about racism and does so in the most tone deaf, incompetent way possible.When we first meet the vampire girl Irina, she is being used as a test subject by the Soviets. She has fangs and must sleep in a coffin, so you would think the portrayal of vampires will be somewhat traditional. Instead, we learn that vampires don’t have any magical powers. They don’t attack humans or drink blood. They’re just a hated and oppressed ethnic minority who happen to have fangs and sleep in coffins for no reason. During the Bubonic Plague, vampires were falsely blamed for poisoning wells and were hunted down in pogroms. After that, the vampires lived in isolated communities and over hundreds of years many racial myths and negative stereotypes were created about them. This is seriously the route the anime goes in! They basically just made the vampires a stand-in for Jews. It's not subtle about this at all.We’re told that vampires are just a harmless minority early on, but the same researcher who tells us this still hates vampires for no reason and is completely ok with killing them in medical experiments. In the world of Irina, the leading Soviet officials and most of their scientists still believe medieval era myths about the vampires for some reason. Myths that any semi-educated person would have stopped believing centuries ago in a world where vampires are real. That would be like in our world if all the Soviet Union’s top scientists in 1960 believed that Jews have horns and that’s why they wear yarmulkes.Despite showing the space race from the Soviet POV, this anime is Red Dawn levels of anti-Soviet. Every Soviet character besides “nice male MC harem lead” is an evil bastard. They want to use Irina as a guinea pig and make her the first person in space, then kill her and send an ethnic Russian into space. This is not only stupid, but incredibly tasteless and insulting to the first cosmonauts who risked their lives for human progress. Why would you shit on some of the greatest heroes in history?The answer is simply to tell a monster girl story. Remember Monster Musume and how it tried to have this shoehorned anti-racism message? Only the MC is nice to the monster girls, while everyone else is ridiculously horrible to them. Elfen Lied is also kind of guilty of this admittedly. This would be fine in a purely fictional setting, but Irina goes out of its way to use real historical figures where only 1 letter in their name is changed and directly reference real historical tragedies like the Nedelin Disaster of 1960. It wants the audience to think this is basically a 1:1 retelling of the space race only Soviet minorities have been replaced with monster girls.This is especially problematic since the CIA ran a propaganda campaign in the 1960s that the Soviets constantly went through cosmonauts like tissue paper and only achieved historic firsts because they cruelly threw away the lives of their explorers. To back this up, an Italian plant produced faked recordings of Soviet cosmonaut death screams that he somehow recorded off a ham radio. These were later found out to be forgeries. It is absolutely true that the Soviets rushed frantically to achieve their goals and covered up 2 high casualty events that were only discovered later, Nedelin being one of these. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not purely innocent. However, they didn't constantly go through cosmonauts, which would be highly impractical considering the time and resources required to train them. The Soviets also never put a self-destruct bomb into their landing capsule in order to prevent the Americans from discovering the easiest part of space exploration and kill their own guys in the process. They also didn't use fatal medical experiments on ethnic minorities. On the other hand, NASA was very confident about survival data such as the exact time humans can survive in zero pressure. That's because NASA had some pretty bad dudes working for them such as notorious war criminal Hubertus Strughold. A man whose best friend was executed at Nuremburg for doing the same experiments.While the Soviet Union did a LOT of bad things during its history, the Soviet space program was one time they were actually the loveable underdogs. They used their own scientists unlike the US, who kissed some a-SS and made a deal with the devil in order to win. The Soviets started from behind and had a small fraction of the money and resources, but miraculously achieved some of the finest feats in the history of engineering. Yet, here we have an anime that wants to repeat propaganda from the Cold War, completely ignore all wrongdoing by NASA, and portray the Soviets as stupid, brutish monsters. All so it can tell a Monster Musume style love story. Fuck this anime.When it isn't being clumsy and totally pointless propaganda, Irina does have some sweet moments. If you like Monster girl stories, the romance between Irina and Lev is serviceable. There are some sweet scenes here and there like Irina going ice skating where the anime is allowed to be kind of good. The show also makes a last-minute decision to reveal some of the Soviet scientists were good guys and have them rebel against the Kremlin. So, in the last episode, it decided to not character assassinate Sergei Korolev. The source novels aren't actually finished BTW, so this was an anime original ending. Whoever wrote the anime at least made a last-ditch effort and I'll give him credit for that. I even raised my rating by 1 based on the last episode alone.Sadly, as a space exploration story, Irina really isn't very good. It's not even comparable to an anime like Royal Space Force or Space Brothers. Both of which are excellent. The monster girl romance detracts from the space focus and the series often veers either intentionally or through sheer ignorance into pretty hateful territory with its historical portrayal. As a monster girl story, it also doesn't work because it's weighed down by its need to tastelessly reference real life tragedies like the Nedelin launch failure that killed around 300 people. It's not quite as bad as when the writer of the Sonic comics tried to tell a 1:1 Holocaust parallel with overly sexualized echidnas, but it's pretty tasteless.So, would I recommend Irina? I'm going to have to go with no. I thought the premise was unusual enough that it had some potential. I don't normally watch seasonals while they air, but Irina hooked me with its bonkers plot alone. As I've covered in this review, the execution leaves much to be desired. It's possible a lot of the problems present in this 12 episode anime aren't quite as bad in the LNs. I've not read them, so I can't say who is to blame for Irina's issues. Unfortunately, this rocket never quite achieves orbit. formula by adding vampires.

You have to put in a lot of work, a lot of sweat, and have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin”-  Yuri GagarinThe Cold War lived between two opposing blocs, the beginning of a space and arms race, the dangers of a possible nuclear war and its end in the early nineties inspired many writers, artists, cartoonists and the media to create different works that sought to explain,...real or fiction, what was happening at the front (and in secret) between the United States and the Soviet Union. And although this war ""ended"" more than 30 years ago, many current works are inspired by some elements taken from the two political models, or from the occasional conspiracy theory that is usually drawn in this regard...Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu (Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut) tells the story from the point of view of Lev Leps, a young civil servant who would have been punished and relegated from his position as a candidate for cosmonaut after disobeying and beating a superior and, However, he is granted the opportunity to work as a tutor for N44 (whose real name is Irina Lumidesk): a vampire who was forced to leave her home to pursue her dream of going to the Moon.Irina, who is going to be subjected to mistreatment, discrimination and strange looks from officials in charge of the space race (Except Lev and Anya), shows at first with indifference to humans and then progressively becomes a more sentimental and emotional person with around him (And especially with his own tutor).This simplistic and perhaps silly premise is what perhaps some may not digest very well because it seems far-fetched. I mean, what\'s so special about adding vampires to a story about space travel? And what makes it interesting? Well, the point here is that the entire setting of the series is inspired by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (abbreviated USSR or Soviet Union) which leads many to want to see to what extent this program can satirize this state and the how can this be mere ""anti-Soviet propaganda"".However, this is neither satire nor propaganda.Irina is not trying to show us only negative aspects of this representation of the Soviet state, nor is it that you are looking for something more to it. However, what we will see are some real historical references within this fictional universe; includes the falsification of real information about the space mission, an explosion at a rocket factory, some names/aliases that would indirectly make references to different operations of the space mission, we could say that the discrimination towards Irina is barely 1% of what It was the Soviet repression of minorities because it also had concentration camps similar to the German one (This includes also Jews, homosexuals and people who was considered ""mentally ill""; that it was actually an excuse for the Soviet government to incriminate and torture people who sought a reform or change in the communist model of the time), even if by the 1960s the gulags were abolished and replaced by psychiatric centers.Since its American equivalent, Arnarck\'s United Kingdom isn\'t shown here (in name only), we\'ll avoid talking and comparing ""objectively"" what the United States was compared to its Russian rival...Ahem… However, it isn’t only historical data and politics that is shown as the main topic. That’s in the background. Instead of an Orwellian story about totalitarianism, use that historical context to tell us a romantic story between two people whose origins and classes are quite different. It is like listening to the song ""Nikita"" and being delighted to know what happens with that forbidden love between two people who shouldn’t be related, and this is what happens in Irina.The main thing here is that the series combines and intersperses between drama and comedy (With romance in the middle), seeing how these two characters spend it together in the tests, walking around the city, drinking lemon soda, etc. An entertaining aspect of this is the main character Irina himself, who is often the subject of jokes between Lev and Anya (the scientist in charge of Irina) whose tsundere side will make the viewer amuse the ""cute"" side of the character (Prepare for some funny faces that this vampire will do in every episode of the show). However, she doesn’t remain an object of jokes, we will also see a development of her personality and background as information about her past, myths about vampires and the different situations that Irina has to go through with characters like Rosa, Ludmilla or the Vice-Director. Despite the fact that at first she shows to be indifferent to these mistreatments, we will see later how this affects her psychologically.And that is where Lev comes in, who in charge of Irina\'s life must also watch his back before any declaration or action he takes within the space mission. A kind and calm boy who seeks the integration of Irina with her comrades. However, it’s very remarkable and understandable how he, who committed a serious offense earlier, feels unable to help Irina when she is spun on one of the testing machines or when she is hit with a garlic necklace and insulted by the Vice-Director. There are people who can treat this character as soft and weak, however, would you be able to raise your voice to a high-ranking official in a country that is defined as authoritarian? Remember Franz when you watch this show.Despite that, Lev makes an effort to get to know the vampire more and show his support for every challenge she faces on her way to space which sometimes puts him in danger of being taken to a prison (Not to say gulag…).The romance between these two is beautiful, first of all because they both begin to talk naturally to each other progressively, which leads to both of them smiling and feeling the need to be closer together each time. Second, because they both begin to put aside their differences when it comes to where they came from (For Lev, that Irina was a bloodsucking vampire whose weakness was crosses and garlic; for Irina, that Lev was a disgusting human who would kill vampires). And thirdly, because the script of the show is made to sympathize with Irina. It’s clear that the show will develop a story based on the character, with which the viewer will say things like ""I don\'t want Irina killed!"" while the heart beats as the deadline for space flight approaches.Animation adds that special touch to the show. Although it doesn\'t stand out as much as other current productions, the sets and some details (like the Northern Lights) are well done and are a good sight for the eyes. Let us highlight, for example, the scene in which Irina dances on ice. However, not everything is perfect and that is why there are times where the animation seems to decline in the less relevant moments of the series. It can be strange that the best scenes have a high quality of animation while in scenes with only dialogue we see some inconsistencies in the movement of the characters or proportions. Fortunately, this is not necessarily a problem for the entire program.One thing that I would highlight is the soundtrack. Except for the Opening and Ending, the music used fits well into the sixties style, it feels relaxed. Outside of that, I would like to say that I was fascinated by the Opening Hii no Tsuki by ALI PROJECT whose composition and style closely resembles that used in the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni remake. The ending Arifureta Itsuka by Chiima is more of a pretty chill and cute pop ballad.Despite many notable things about Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut that it may have (and that it goes unnoticed in the anime community), there are also negative aspects with it:I really appreciate the elaborate worlbuilding done in this series, as I said above, I really like the settings and environment where Lev and Irina live. However, something that I could hardly understand was the alphabet used in this program (which is obviously inspired by the Cyrillic alphabet). Of course this is to add aesthetics to the show, but I wish it had a translated subtitle as well. It’s a minor problem, however, there are times when this alphabet is highlighted in some scenes, such as in a diagram where they show the connections of all the anime characters for example. The viewer may not understand what the text is saying if they are interested in knowing what it says there.Another aspect that the viewer may not be able to follow is the slow beginning of the program, uninteresting and somewhat boring, especially when at times it shows more politics than the main characters. Fortunately, over time, as we learn more about Irina and the space mission, we begin to understand and become interested in what may happen later. And another aspect, I repeat, is the animation that sometimes loses consistency in some scenes (Like the Vice-Director hitting Irina with a garlic necklace)...As you can see, Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut is not exactly a totally perfect historical fantasy series and sadly goes unnoticed compared to other more popular anime. However, Irina isn’t satisfied with that and takes the most it can to make us enjoy each moment between the main characters in the story. I honestly had high expectations with this show because it was inspired by my favorite part of history and I’m satisfied with it. The voices of Megumi Hayashibara and Kouki Ichiyama performed very well and added essence to the personality of their characters. I didn’ notice anything else in their performances and their roles felt natural.So if you like the story, you can probably be offended by using an extinct country as the basis for a romance story, its inaccurate data, or something that sounds like ""propaganda"" to you. However, for those who also like history will be entertained by a romantic sixties-style story, historical references and nastoyka.So, comrade, prepare your uniform that Irina goes to the Moon! real or fiction, what was happening at the front (and in secret) between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Let us highlight, for example, the scene in which Irina dances on ice. However, not everything is perfect and that is why there are times where the animation seems to decline in the less relevant moments of the series. It can be strange that the best scenes have a high quality of animation while in scenes with only dialogue we see some inconsistencies in the movement of the characters or proportions. Fortunately, this is not necessarily a problem for the entire program.One thing that I would highlight is the soundtrack. Except for the Opening and Ending, the music used fits well into the sixties style, it feels relaxed. Outside of that, I would like to say that I was fascinated by the Opening Hii no Tsuki by ALI PROJECT whose composition and style closely resembles that used in the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni remake. The ending Arifureta Itsuka by Chiima is more of a pretty chill and cute pop ballad.Despite many notable things about Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut that it may have (and that it goes unnoticed in the anime community), there are also negative aspects with it:I really appreciate the elaborate worlbuilding done in this series, as I said above, I really like the settings and environment where Lev and Irina live. However, something that I could hardly understand was the alphabet used in this program (which is obviously inspired by the Cyrillic alphabet). Of course this is to add aesthetics to the show, but I wish it had a translated subtitle as well. It’s a minor problem, however, there are times when this alphabet is highlighted in some scenes, such as in a diagram where they show the connections of all the anime characters for example. The viewer may not understand what the text is saying if they are interested in knowing what it says there.Another aspect that the viewer may not be able to follow is the slow beginning of the program, uninteresting and somewhat boring, especially when at times it shows more politics than the main characters. Fortunately, over time, as we learn more about Irina and the space mission, we begin to understand and become interested in what may happen later. And another aspect, I repeat, is the animation that sometimes loses consistency in some scenes (Like the Vice-Director hitting Irina with a garlic necklace)...As you can see, Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut is not exactly a totally perfect historical fantasy series and sadly goes unnoticed compared to other more popular anime. However, Irina isn’t satisfied with that and takes the most it can to make us enjoy each moment between the main characters in the story. I honestly had high expectations with this show because it was inspired by my favorite part of history and I’m satisfied with it. The voices of Megumi Hayashibara and Kouki Ichiyama performed very well and added essence to the personality of their characters. I didn’ notice anything else in their performances and their roles felt natural.So if you like the story, you can probably be offended by using an extinct country as the basis for a romance story, its inaccurate data, or something that sounds like ""propaganda"" to you. However, for those who also like history will be entertained by a romantic sixties-style story, historical references and nastoyka.So, comrade, prepare your uniform that Irina goes to the Moon!', 'Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu a.k.a Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut is a show that if you\'d ask me how can I recommend this series to anyone, I would say this: ""Imagine if the actual ""Man of the Moon"" historical feat never happened with the US of A\'s Neil Armstrong\'s iconic ""That\'s one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" sentence. The Space Race during the Cold War happening between 1955 and 1975 is instead won by the USSR a.k.a the Soviet Union in the same but alternate historical time period, using not just animals but vampires instead."" And this is exactly what...novelist Keisuke Masano had in mind when he penned this sci-fi fantasy light novel, that sadly went under the radar, only to be forgotten and swept under the rug when this is all said and done.It\'s a shame really, because this series is actually quite unique, and something that I don\'t really remember seeing before on a wide spectrum, much less authors going out of their way to create something different rather than sticking to the run-of-the-mill stories that we see many too often these days. Really though, props to Keisuke Masano for being the one-in-a-million author to have a work that truly stands out in an intriguing fashion. And truth be told that Keisuke Masano actually did research on the whole Space Race topic of the conflict between the US and USSR, even going as far as to validate the point that mammals were used before sending humans into space, case in point: the US using monkeys and apes, while the USSR used dogs, specifically the first dog that was successfully deployed into space: Laika (that\'s where you understand why Laika exists in the title).And that\'s where the story begins: the space race set in the same time period of the 1950s between the alternate US vs. USSR (United Kingdom of Arnack vs. the Republic of Zirnitra a.k.a UZSR) to see who can get their subjects to space first, and their spaceflight experiment dubbed the Nosferatu Project, lies with their trump card: a test subject in the form of the vampire N44, otherwise better known as Irina Luminesk. And in order for her to sustain the growth of trainings until she\'s of perfect use, the human candidates going after her will supervise that growth, and one young cosmonaut by the name of Lev Leps is assigned to be her handler from start to finish.If you know anything out how the USSR a.k.a the Soviet Union operates back in this time period, it\'s that anything and everything goes in order to proclaim their superiority in any shape of form. And in this case, it\'s the usage of test subjects like Irina the vampire as their statement piece, and once they\'re done with them, their existence is wiped off the earth in favour of humans achieving their prosperity instead. It\'s definitely a cruel world to imagine how people were like living in the Soviet Union, much less if you\'re one of the military and/or candidate that witnessed the horrors of going all lengths to prove the possibility of making radical ideals. And Irina being a vampire, the popular legend that vampires prey on humans for their blood only solidifies those who abhor her presence, going as far as to have mitigating measures like cloves of garlic hanging around them to repel Irina\'s presence away from them. You can\'t really blame these people for having that claustrophobic mindset of a racist superstition in a time such as this, but harming Irina because of her vampiric roots is just going too far and being too harsh on her. And Lev overseeing her development for the Nosferatu Project is just like what a gentleman should be, protecting the girl from harm in whatever situations and circumstances.If anything, watch this show for the character development, because it\'s really engrossing. The main vampire lead Irina is a really nice character if you can dismiss most of her intended shortcomings. More than being a test subject, she is undoubtedly human as well, that is if you attach Lev to her side and showcase all of her vulnerabilities and obscenely cute and sweet moments between each other. Irina\'s origin lies that her parents were both killed in the World War, and that she has always been fascinated by the moon (Tsuki), and from there on, volunteers for the (Nosferatu) project because like the mammal counterparts (Laika), she also has the dream of being the very first being to reach space, even before humans do, at the cost of her own life.It\'s for this reason that her decision to enter the project comes at the price of being scoffed at by most of the military who deems her existence as a forlorn entity, and that\'s where Irina\'s dream would be substantiated by the young Lev Leps, who\'s a lieutenant in the UZSR\'s Air Force, whose dream is to fly as well. And oh look, the Nosferatu Project has a position for him to achieve his dream, and thereso sets the crossing of paths between vampire and human. Lev has a strong sense of justice and rebels against unreasonable things, which explains the irony of him protecting Irina when she is being forced to go on unsubstantiated training procedures that are deliberately set to push her limits to the breaking point. That same sense of justice is what is truly lacking in a lot of MCs in this day and age, and Lev really earns my thumbs up for standing up to the cruel amounts of abuse that she got, just because she is a vampire first and foremost.The 3rd party is Anya Simonyan, Irina\'s right-hand girl who is a researcher at the Biomedical Research Institute, who specializes in studying the biology of vampires, such as with the case of Irina recording her data to the further implementation and uses of the research institute. I know I shouldn\'t call Anya a 3rd party, but being the winggirl would be the best description to fit her stance because more than checking up on her, she can understand Irina and is not afraid to treat her in a friendly manner. It\'s like she\'s a comedy character meant to splice in-between the growing relationship of Lev and Irina, and for that alone, I really greatly appreciate her inclusion to break the mold even for a fair bit.I also know that I don\'t always try to pair ships in shows, but this is also yet another reason why this show is also quite good and deeply satisfying to watch. Watching both Lev and Irina be paired together from the start, there\'s lots of tulminous nervousness of how a vampire would react to a human that she has never seen before, only for the same baby steps to reconcile the mindset of the cooperation-turned-relationship between both vampire and human. Irina feels harsh from the get-go because of the preconceived microcosm legend that humans were the ones who burned vampires on the stake, and it largely affected how she would get along with someone like Lev, whom she didn\'t know would be an ally with or an enemy against her in the venture towards outer space. Thankfully, Lev\'s sense of justice keeps her afloat even at the worst of times, and seeing this relationship grow to expose Irina\'s vulnerable-but-sweet side of her to him is just an absolute delight. Examples like lemon soda (or seltzer) telling of the fact that she finds it salty, or that her constant pouts of jealousy that Lev isn\'t treating her like he should, Irina is just a sweet soul-satisfaction of a vampire girl that even Lev knows what triggers her innerd soul when it comes to love: blood-sucking, the equality of mere humans\' tendency akin to kisses. Seriously though, Irina is a demi-human waifu worth protecting, and may the love between Lev and Irina last forever till eternity.The other characters which are the higher-ups of generals and majors all are just plot devices to reinstate the importance of getting Irina up in space by hook or by crook, no second chances are given if it fails, because the love for the motherland is priority before self indulgences. There\'re too many to account for steam-rolling around the central characters, except for some like Lev\'s comrades also vying for the position to be the first cosmonaut in space, so less importance is weighed on them until the time they\'re needed for action.This is Arvo Animation\'s second venture as a sole studio outside of the Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai a.k.a We Never Learn series, and while Summer 2020\'s Monster Musume no Oisha-san just looked incredibly cheap and mediocre, Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu is the exact opposite with the same decent animation but gorgeous visuals to boot, especially for such an unique series like this one. The visuals may look dull as heck, but the artwork is just on a whole other level that reminds me of how the modern day Soviet Union a.k.a Russia would actually look like, especially with scenes that point towards the sky out of symbolism. Really though, respect for the amount of work put into this work that\'s full of originality. Sound design is really well done too for the most part with ALI PROJECT\'s OP that gives a Final Fantasy-esque sound vibe to it, and Chima\'s solemn but blissful ED that just nudges my heart from deep within.When it call comes down to it, Keisuke Masano\'s Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu is a work of art that unless and heavily recommended, it\'s the epitome of a blasphemy of a total unknown. You most likely won\'t even budge an eye to see what is this series all about, even more so that the light novel itself hasn\'t really been fan-translated yet (I\'ve heard that an English translation will come soon, but don\'t get your hopes all too great) and the target audience really wearing thin.

I think that this anime is the dark horse of the season. An anime about the space race is definitely something that I have not heard of before. Add the vampire tag and you have a recipe for a distinctive anime.Story 8/10:I really like the story for this anime. A race between two enemy nations to get a manned spaceship into orbit. Put this together with the main duo of the series Irina Luminesk and Lev then you have a story about 2 people bonding over their love for space and desire to get to somewhere special to them.Art 7/10:The...art and animation for this anime is quite pleasing to look at. The characters have been drawn well and a lot of attention has been given to each one of them. The animation of their movements is also very fluid and well made especially during training drills they do in the anime such as parachuting or zip-lining. The background art and attention to detail of the subject and surroundings of each scene are also well made and extrudes an aura of high quality.Character 7/10:The characters for this show are decently portrayed but the key stars are Irina and Lev as they are the protagonists. Lev is an ex astronaut candidate whose dream is to go into space and those feelings he has for space are well shown as he helps Irina train her hardest to be fit for space travel. Since he himself is not able to go to space anymore due to an incident that caused him to be demoted, in a sense, it seems like he is pushing his dreams onto Irina so she can get to space for the both of them. Irina herself is also a spectacle. She is a vampire who has been captured and forced to become an astronaut to the launched into space as a test subject in order to see if space travel is suitable for humans. At first it seems that Irina is just a slave that is ordered to obey their commands but the more you look at it you realize that she herself has a strong desire for space. She obediently does what she is told and forces herself to go through hellish training all for a dream that she has.Enjoyment 8/10:I really enjoy this anime. It is definitely an underrated show that has been overshadowed by bigger names this season. There is a lot to enjoy about it. It is informative about a lot of things to do with space travel and the preparations astronauts have to go through. It also gives small accounts of historical fact about the history of humanities interest with space.Overall this anime is the definite dark horse of the season in my opinion.

You should give it a go if you enjoy this type of historical anime with a fantasy twist."", ""This a show that is taking a bit too much to lay all its cards on the tablebut people are losing their patience and hype because of thatbut yes WEINE CLONE WAIFU IS NICENow look the entirety of this anime season is pretty wack, a vampire going t space is surely a concept that will pique your interest one way or another , BUT as with all anime this anime can also be easily distinguished with the tropes it plays :-Demi-Human waifu who you wish to proteccca little bit of racism (cant blame em the already hat black people , they would probably...do the same for Pale vampires with weird ears)And a generic protag kunSo far the show has thrown around hints and tidbits that may be interesting, like the whole political situation between the two countries (strikingly similar to the cold war so much so that UZSR is basically USSR and UK is the USA)Or the whole ordeal of why Irina etc but much of this has only been teased and we have been playing mostly waifu simulator since episode 1.Now from here on I can take either take an it-gets-better-later route or the fuck- everything-else-waifu-FTW route we can only wait and seeAs for the reviewThe story so far has been blue balling at times its just Slice of life with occasional vampire Q and A I genuinely do not know where they will decide to go from here since SOL in the first couple of episodes is not a bad idea it helps us get used to and like the charactersVAs are great but its mostly been three characters so far who have had any real dialogue, THe OP is pretty unique and quite a surprise the ED , not so muchART is standard and what you would expect of a 2021 anime , there is a bit of very noticeable CGI at  many places but it shouldn't be bothersome and only be used in nonkey animation.its a very jarring start but from what i have seen so far it does have potential but  I will probably only recommend with greater confidence once mor episodes come out do the same for Pale vampires with weird ears)And a generic protag kunSo far the show has thrown around hints and tidbits that may be interesting, like the whole political situation between the two countries (strikingly similar to the cold war so much so that UZSR is basically USSR and UK is the USA)Or the whole ordeal of why Irina etc but much of this has only been teased and we have been playing mostly waifu simulator since episode 1.Now from here on I can take either take an it-gets-better-later route or the fuck- everything-else-waifu-FTW route we can only wait and seeAs for the reviewThe story so far has been blue balling at times its just Slice of life with occasional vampire Q and A I genuinely do not know where they will decide to go from here since SOL in the first couple of episodes is not a bad idea it helps us get used to and like the charactersVAs are great but its mostly been three characters so far who have had any real dialogue, THe OP is pretty unique and quite a surprise the ED , not so muchART is standard and what you would expect of a 2021 anime , there is a bit of very noticeable CGI at  many places but it shouldn't be bothersome and only be used in nonkey animation.its a very jarring start but from what i have seen so far it does have potential but  I will probably only recommend with greater confidence once mor episodes come out"", ""Recommendation: A cute love story filled with nostalgia and old Soviet aesthetics, it's nothing revolutionary but a very pleasant watch overall.Story: The Soviet Union analogue USZR is going to be the first to send a person to space, but desperately wants to avoid international embarrassment by having them die in an accident with the world watching.  Their solution is to send a vampire prisoner, Test Subject N44 AKA Irina Luminesk, into space first as an experiment, since she is near-human in physiology but considered closer to a dog than a human, so no one will miss her if something goes wrong.  Lev Leps,...a cosmonaut candidate who was demoted for righteously hitting a superior officer, is assigned as her handler and trainer.  Irina hates and distrusts humans for very understandable reasons, but eventually opens up because of Lev's pure heart and their mutual love of space and the moon, and thus begins their romance.It follows a predictable-but-not-in-a-bad-way path, there really aren't a lot of surprises here, but the story is well told and Lev and Irina's romance is sweet and you'll be rooting for them to overcome the obstacles in their path.  The romance in particular has an almost fairy tale quality to it. It's prone more to big, romantic set pieces, like ice skating under the aurora borealis while love songs play in the background, than a more grounded or typical romance series.  If you're allergic to corniness, you might roll your eyes at some of these scenes, especially the ending, but it's a treat for pure romance lovers.Audio/Visual: The music is absolutely wonderful. The ED is one of the best of the season, the soundtrack is nice and jazzy in a comfortably nostalgic way, and the insert song selection is always perfect for the scene it's highlighting. The VA work is strong throughout as well, especially Hayashibara Megumi's work as Irina.Visually, inconsistent would probably be the best way to describe it. The direction is nice, if a bit *much* at times (Yokoyama Akitoshi really loves unnecessary camera rotations for dramatic effect apparently).  The character design is mostly strong and the show looks decent, but it's very apparent that they were struggling with the budget. The CGI Earth when they're in space does not look good, and there's a lack of attention to detail that leads to embarrassing mistakes in some parts, like a scene where Lev rides off in a motorcycle but leaves his mouth floating in the air behind him.  It's not as though it looks awful and many of the errors are small little easter eggs that you won't even notice unless you're looking for them, but it definitely could have been better.Characters: Lev and Irina are the main focus here, and their dynamic is very sweet and makes show work as well as it does.  It's much easier to tolerate the corniness when these two are so perfect for each other.  Lev's boyish naivete is his defining trait, he's just a big kid who wants to go to space, and he sees Irina simply as a fellow space lover and bonds with her over that while everyone else in Laika, the secret military town where the space program is being developed, is afraid of her or hates her. He quickly gets over his fear of vampires based on the propaganda he's heard and treats her as a human even after explicitly being ordered not to because he's simply incapable of treating her coldly. Irina, by contrast, is a full on tsundere.  She talks often about how she hates humans and is only going along with this because she wants to beat them to space and tries to keep Lev at a distance at first, with little success.  She's the good kind of tsundere though, where the gap between what she says and how she acts only serves to highlight her cuteness.  An example is a scene where Lev gives her a bouquet of flowers, and Irina criticizes him for including too many different kinds and overwhelming her sense of smell, all while being unable to stop smiling in delight.In terms of the characters, there are only 2 real critiques I have here.  One is the lack of focus on Lev's fellow cosmonaut candidates.  What we get of them is good, and it feels like there is a lot left on the table in terms of developing them and getting to see them interact with Lev.  At times it can feel like the focus on Lev and Irina is so powerful that the rest of the cast gets left behind.  The other issue is Anya, who is fine for the role she serves in the story, but including a pink haired loli scientist with twintails in an otherwise pretty realistic setting feels incredibly out of place, and some scenes with her that are meant to be dramatic end up feeling kind of slapstick instead, like when a soldier slaps a pair of ice cream cones out of her hands. a cosmonaut candidate who was demoted for righteously hitting a superior officer, is assigned as her handler and trainer.

I\'ll be giving you all the necessary information about a show in just a few sentences and a following recommendation.Today featuring: Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu (TLN)First and most important to know: TLN\'s main purpose undoubtedly is meant to be round earth propaganda. The female lead is a cute tsundere vampire.The story plays in a cliche anime version of the USSR. It picks up antisemitism in a metaphorical way. I felt twilight vibes even though I haven\'t seen any movies or read books about the series which felt awkward. The show being a drama has an ok dramatic...narrative. Featuring a ""love that is not meant to be"" story. The plot has as many deep holes as the moon has craters. The story is flat and unentertaining because there are no visible tension arcs. Progressing overall doesn\'t feel rewarding.The main characters lack ... character because:Irina is a generic female lead due to her cliche tsundere characteristic with extremely predictable behavior and development.- She however has a somewhat fleshed-out backstory.- As well as a reasonable and understandable drive and determination.Lev is by any means not a good character because:- His actions and traits cant be traced back to a backstory or specific attributes.- He is as stiff as a tree. He barely changes throughout the season.- He acts explicitly as it is expected in a bad, lame kind of way.The Character and world design are not fitting to the setting and narrative. It\'s too clishe anime\'ish.It features a high quality OST that makes some scenes really enjoyable.Recommendation?: Not my cup of tea, but I can see some points that might make the show likable to the right audience. Particularly the original narrative. However, I do not recommend it unless you have a tsundere vampire fetish.My score:Story: 2.9Characters: 3.8Animation: 5.2Sound: 8.9Enjoyment: 3.5Overall: 3.9(Also refer to my profile for scoring criteria) narrative.

Something so wonderfully stupid just had to be entertaining. On some levels it was, but it really dropped the ball in the second half.Let\'s look at our main characters first. Protagonist-kun wants to go to space, and that\'s where his character development begins and ends. But, and here\'s the twist, the vampire girl also wants to go to space. Stunning and brave. I really thought they\'d be able to come up with more for these characters to do or some more personality traits beyond the bog standard rom-com...couple is forced to spend time together doing something they both enjoy and we\'re somehow supposed to be surprised they fall in love. These cheesy setups are fine in isolation, I just would have liked too see something a little better suited to the ludicrous tone of space vampires. It\'s played so straight for something that should be so silly.The ending is where it really lost me. They played up that blonde lady as being some sort of big bad the whole season and the old communist leader guy as being a communist, so you know... evil. When they have a sudden change of heart at the end about vampires and humans living together it seemed too jarring. These guys are clearly evil so what\'s their angle? Why would an evil communist regime suddenly be preaching open borders for vampire immigrants and racial equality for our new bloodsucking allies? Why would they want to dilute the gene pool of the nation\'s populous with such a volatile race of potentially violent heathens.The more I thought about it the stranger I found it that the government wanted one of their star cosmonaut candidates to spend practically all of him time isolated and alone with a cute vampire girl around his age who shared his passion for space. They had to have known exactly what they were doing, essentially creating a breeding program for race-mixing with vampires by setting the wheels in motion for this romance to form. A government that views it\'s citizens and especially it\'s military as nothing more than objects, subjects to be used and then tossed away, would surely have no qualms about manipulating emotions in such a way. When viewed from this angle the show suddenly becomes an incredibly based indictment of real world communism and how quickly it turns to globalism, establishing itself as progressive while seeking to subvert society and mix races down to a single homogeneous and inferior kind with no culture and no history, and therefor no future. A mutt race that is neither human nor vampire, inheriting only the worst traits of each until there is nothing of value left all the while a secret elite ruling class maintaining it\'s own selective breeding to foster a false sense of superiority over the ones which they deem to control.But, uh... where was I? Oh yeah the anime. All that is obvious head-cannon brought on by my jaded outlook on real world politics, I don\'t think the story had nearly that many interesting things to say, but coming up with that bit of fiction as I watched the final moments of this hot dumpster fire of an anime was far more entertaining than just going along with the boring ending they lined up. But the fact that I was able to view this art and extrapolate that silly story out of it maybe means that it\'s a secret masterpiece? I don\'t know, I\'m going to go with my gut and say it\'s nothing special. 7/10 couple is forced to spend time together doing something they both enjoy and we\'re somehow supposed to be surprised they fall in love.

Both genres are like oil and water, genres that aren't supposed to be mixed together.So after saying all that, is this anime that unique with a rare genres combination? Not really. It's pretty much has the same beats as other 69420 romance anime.What's the point of watching this then? Well, I can at least say that watching this anime won't waste your time.The story is decent but it's unique, like I said before, having sci-fi elements and vampires. But it's mostly a sci-fi anime about the first vampire who goes to...space (step aside Yuri Gagarin, we now know who the actual first person to go to space lol).It's romance element is predictable but it's pretty well-done in my opinion. There was build-up and satisfaction for their relationship, so it's not bad.There's also some well-done themes about discrimination, although it was handled well at the beginning, it was kinda thrown away to the sidelines during the latter half of the season. Which really hampers down the potential of this anime because it really cheapens the overall tone of this anime. A shame really.Moving on, the characters are also decent. Some of the characters got the short end of the stick and got shoved to the sideline and had their development done either rushed or off-screen. The main cast though, while not the most well-written nor well-developed, are good characters. Especially Irina who developed so much in this season.The animation is decent. It had some good animation sprinkled out there, but the majority of the scenes have some really iffy off-model characters here and there. The art is good though.The music is good. Especially the ost. The opening and ending are decent.Overall, it's a decent romance anime. My only real gripe (aside from the characters) is that it should've another episode and not just ending it in 12 episodes. It was pretty rush and it's a shame. Still an anime that I recommend though.(6.2/10) space (step aside Yuri Gagarin, we now know who the actual first person to go to space lol).It's romance element is predictable but it's pretty well-done in my opinion.

However the way it all comes together forms a grounded and well rounded show.Story: What I immediately found interesting was the setting, the 60's in the totally-not-Soviet Union aka UZSR. Oh and it's about a space race. With a vampire. It sounds absurd but in reality the execution is well done. It has more of a serious tone at times; it makes a point to emphasize the inequality and how poorly vampires are treated. This is balanced out by our...main duo: Irina the vampire and Lev who's in charge of training her for space. Their dynamic lightens the mood and it's very sweet. Another impressive part is the scope of the story, it's not just about Irina and Lev. An example would be a cabinet meeting involving the officials of the UZSR which contributes to the sense of urgency and distrust in the country. Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu also rewards people who know the history of the space race due to the details it impressively manages to squeeze in. As for individual elements: I thought the comedy is good but not a focus and while there is fan service every now and then it's not extreme and jarring. 8/10.Art: Probably what holds back Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu the most is that it doesn't have insane production values. That being said there is some impressive, colorful, and well animated scenes. I also enjoyed some of the backgrounds which can be simple but pleasing to look at. I thought the storyboard and directing was good and at the very least it uses interesting angles throughout episodes. There were times when I felt the animation struggled to keep up with the ambition but rarely. The CGI used was pretty good as well. I am quite a fan of the character designs too. 7/10.Sound: I think the voice acting has been good but have yet to notice a standout performance. I feel like the OST and insert songs were well thought out as they fit scenes perfectly. I don't have much of an opinion on the OP or ED. 7/10.Character: While not completely one tone, Irina and Lev individually aren't all that interesting. There's room for growth but I don't see the characters becoming very unique or intriguing by the end. I wouldn't call them bland because they do have their own motivations and backstory. How they interact together is the more enjoyable part. The show strays away from giving other characters depth or much screen time as well. 7/10.Enjoyment: I think Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu can attract different groups of people: whether you love a Cold War era setting or want to see the main duo's sweet moments and development. I enjoyed both of these and every episode left me wanting more. I'm not sure if it has a high rewatch value yet but if it continues with the quality so far I can see it becoming a very solid, memorable series. 8/10. main duo: Irina the vampire and Lev who's in charge of training her for space.

I like how it treats the space race between the United States and Russia very well. It's a good compilation of history and they put it together with a vampire girl who wants to be an astronaut. I love how they handle the story the main character as you want, you love him, you want everything in life to go well for him. The animation quite well and the soundtrack also the character design is well done. I would have liked it to be more romantic because there are scenes where you say, tell him that you like...him and give him a kiss, they end this suffering. But hey taking that out is a very entertaining and cute anime.En español:El anime es re lindo y tireno. Me gusta como trata muy bien la carrera espacial entre estados unidos y rusia. Es una buena recopilacion de historia y la juntan con una chica vampiro que quiere ser astronauta. Me encanto como manejan la historia el protagonista principal como lo queres, lo amas queres que todo en la vida le salga bien. La animacion bastante bien y la banda sonora tambien el diseño de personajes esta bien hecho. Me hubiera gustado que sea mas romantico porque hay escenas donde decis dale decile que te gusta y dale un beso terminen con este sufrimiento. Pero bueno sacando eso es un anime muy entretenido y lindo. him and give him a kiss, they end this suffering.

What?' It's a concept that one may think it's crazy, and might be a random anime that is thrown together, and doesn't connect well with it's audience. But honestly, this show can be more seriously sweet then it seems. That's mainly down to it's main partnering main cast members, that really drive the show forward, and it's sweet of how their relationship is.Like imagine, being scapegoated, as nothing by a tool by most, seen as such by most. With the idea...of you being a test subject for a space project. Looked down upon all because of what you are, rather than who you are. Yet, you're given more likely, the most caring, and decent person to guide you. Seriously. Lev and Irina's whole interactions and relationship is what really hits home when it comes to this show. It's truly heart-warming of how much Lev trust respects and supports who, despite what she is. But honestly, there are times where it doesn't even feel like she is a vampire in his eyes. She's a normal person like you or I, and I think that is really sweet and charming.Both aren't just either hiding themselves, or letting their issues get to them in a closed off sense either. Lev truly does stick up for her, and Irina has normal fears like any regular person would have, but doesn't let it get it past them. Two really strong characters, that drive the show so much. Which is brilliant.Most of the other cast members are just plain jerks and bigots. Not even caring on who Irina is, and more just treating her badly, all because of her being the test subject vampire. It's really eye rolling. Though there are some good honest loving people despite this. One example is Anya, who is just a delight.The story itself really fills that itch of a build up to a space like ideal goal. While sure, part of it could come under political gain, but the adventure towards something, can be quite the fun and interesting journey. As we follow Lev as he helps train and guies Irina towards her eventual mission, all the while we learn about her more and more. Some great stuff there.The Art style is really cool and wicked too. It honestly feels like a age right as tech was coming in, and the whole presentation of it all looks great. It really feels like you are on a snowy base, and the colours of it all, really add to it all, to make a really good looking product in general. The sound also does a great job of complimenting that. There are a few scenes that use both together, that just make for some great moments.I feel like this sow is a bit of a surprise package. Not that it was going to be bad, more that you may not expect to enjoy it this much. I look forward to watching it, week in, week out, and you should too! of you being a test subject for a space project. Looked down upon all because of what you are, rather than who you are. Yet, you're given more likely, the most caring, and decent person to guide you. Seriously. Lev and Irina's whole interactions and relationship is what really hits home when it comes to this show. It's truly heart-warming of how much Lev trust respects and supports who, despite what she is. But honestly, there are times where it doesn't even feel like she is a vampire in his eyes. She's a normal person like you or I, and I think that is really sweet and charming.Both aren't just either hiding themselves, or letting their issues get to them in a closed off sense either. Lev truly does stick up for her, and Irina has normal fears like any regular person would have, but doesn't let it get it past them. Two really strong characters, that drive the show so much. Which is brilliant.Most of the other cast members are just plain jerks and bigots. Not even caring on who Irina is, and more just treating her badly, all because of her being the test subject vampire. It's really eye rolling. Though there are some good honest loving people despite this. One example is Anya, who is just a delight.The story itself really fills that itch of a build up to a space like ideal goal. While sure, part of it could come under political gain, but the adventure towards something, can be quite the fun and interesting journey. As we follow Lev as he helps train and guies Irina towards her eventual mission, all the while we learn about her more and more. Some great stuff there.The Art style is really cool and wicked too. It honestly feels like a age right as tech was coming in, and the whole presentation of it all looks great. It really feels like you are on a snowy base, and the colours of it all, really add to it all, to make a really good looking product in general. The sound also does a great job of complimenting that. There are a few scenes that use both together, that just make for some great moments.I feel like this sow is a bit of a surprise package. Not that it was going to be bad, more that you may not expect to enjoy it this much. I look forward to watching it, week in, week out, and you should too!"", ""Going into the Fall 2021 Season, I would have never thought an alternate history fiction about a Soviet Vampire going to space will be my Comfy Anime of the Season, but here I am. In spite of its oppressive setting, or maybe even because of it, Tsuki to Laika has been a light and enjoyable viewing experience.One thing the show makes it abundantly clear even in the first episode, is that the Vampire/Dhampir are a catch-all for assorted prosecuted races and ethnicities in the Soviet Union/USA. The show being hard historical fiction with relatively accurate depictions of the Soviet Space program came to me as...a surprise. The show doesn't shy away in its depiction of racism, but I would still say it does a reasonable job at portraying its setting without being overly heavy handed.The plot is nothing special, it really just is the early days of the Soviet Space Program with some liberties taken here and there to account for the romantic drama between Lev and Irina. But what truly sells the show are its characters. Placing an otherwise typical Boy-Meets-Girls type romdram inside the Soviet Union does set up a lot of interesting situations you don't normally see in other similar shows, and seeing how the main characters work around or work within the constraints of an oppressive setting such as this makes you root for them even more. And it really is surprisingly comfy despite all this. Not everyone is a monster and the characters all have multiple facets to them, and it is heartwarming to see the team warm up to Irina's successes despite her ethnicity. The moments of respite that Lev and Irina have together are all the more valuable because of the setting, when they have to put up a front almost all the time, it makes the few genuine moments where they can be themselves all the more important.While the show is really lacking on the visual department, and it can look rough a lot of the time, it more than makes up for it with its stellar soundtrack. Special note goes to that jazz piece that plays during all the romantic moments, and that one vocal piece they play occasionally in the plot important moments.Tsuki to Laika is a cute romance, but being set in such an underused setting allows it to distinguish itself from most romantic dramas out there. Do give it a shot if you want something different in your romances, or if you're itching for some early Cold War historical fiction.6/10 a surprise.

On one hand, at its core, its really not that special. The story is based on real event, except it takes place in an alternate universe/world/reality where the alphabet and names of everything are different, but factually everything is exactly the same as the cold war era. Well, aside vampires (that are also different to normal vampires in most regards). The documentation of soviet cosmonaut training and launch isn't something too exciting, unless you're a space and/or history nut, and isn't handled too well here either, despite the addition of a semi cuudere and...tsundere immature vampire waifu.Some more things that where added are the discrimination against said vampire and the vampire race, a PROPER non positive portrayal of the soviet union for what it was (an oppressively, dictatorial regime where people could disappear if they said something against the government, etc), and a double launch, which is also not within the realm of possibility because due to the document purges, there may have been many more cosmonauts that where lost and we'll never know, just like many more things from the period. Speaking of document purges and vampires, through them it also mentions the various PEOPLES purges the soviet union did... Though i'd feel it'd be better done without vampires in the mix.So, if the story isn't exactly special, too memorable or impressive, what makes it any good then? Well first of all, as i mentioned before, the negative portrayal of the soviet union, which is something very welcome in a time where communism/socialism is on the rise, is being whitewashed and has been growing in popularity for decades despite being a murderous regime one could argue rivaled the Nazis. And i say that as a Russian, who heard and collected plenty of facts and stories both from historical documents as well as their friends and family. +1Secondly, it deserves credit for its historical and cultural authenticity, which is something i see in anime very rarely outside of the things related to Japanese culture. I don't know if they fished for it all bit by bit when they made this show or the source material, or called some actual Russian people to be consultants, or the writer themselves is part Russian, but pretty much everything on screen falls in line with my youth in Russia, my family's stories, and old soviet films to a very impressive degree (maybe aside how well they where fed, but that's negligible, it also didn't quite show the relative poverty and deficit of EVERYTHING people faced, but that wasn't really the subject anyway nor where normal people's lives touched upon), to the point it'd make a Russian feel somewhat nostalgic, even if they do hate the Soviet union and/or the current state of Russia (if they don't live there). +1So that totals out to 5.3+1+1, final score - 7.3. But objectively it might deserve a little less because i realize i can be somewhat bias on the historical and cultural factors being from my country of origin and its past, still, not by much (7-7.1) since i do believe cultural and historical accuracy is quite a great thing because you get to see differing habits, rituals, realities and cultures, making things quite different and adding extra flavor, as well as breaking the staleness of Anime (and other media) being culture locked to its own country's habits, tropes and ways. Not that you see THAT much of that here (certainly not behavioral differences), but enough of everything else to be impressiveStill, overall it wasn't too special nor memorable, and just SOMEWHAT entertaining, so only SEMI recommended. tsundere immature vampire waifu.Some more things that where added are the discrimination against said vampire and the vampire race, a PROPER non positive portrayal of the soviet union for what it was (an oppressively, dictatorial regime where people could disappear if they said something against the government, etc), and a double launch, which is also not within the realm of possibility because due to the document purges, there may have been many more cosmonauts that where lost and we'll never know, just like many more things from the period.

But fair enough for other side characters to be involved, but like what I\'ve said character focus is on the two main characters.Enjoyment 10/10- Vampire cosmonaut is the dessert of my evening course during monday. After watching first the interesting, lighthearted comedy merouko followed by a drama heavy Moshouko tensei, and ends with Vampire Cosmonaut will help you sleep at night because of the calmness of the ambiance of the show.Overall 8/10- Very good anime, although underrated as it\'s overshadowed by the Giants of the Season which are Jobless Reincarnation, Meruko, Komi and 86. it a 6 since most of the character development mostly focus on Irina and Lev.

MC is her instructor and is cool dude. He tries to get her safely into space and back, while also trying hard to make sure he's the first human in space.Did I enjoy it?It surprised me. From beginning to end it kept me entertained and wondering what would happen next. It's sad that the romance aspect of the show wasn't travelled more, but it is nice as it is. It ends on a good note where, while it could continue,...it leaves me perfectly satisfied as to where it left off. it leaves me perfectly satisfied as to where it left off."", '""The Vampire Cosmonaut"" has a very high purpose from the moral point of view: a reflection on the importance of equality and the absurdity of the concept of race, creating a parallelism between people considered ""inferior"" and the vampire species, despised and segregated due to the negative propaganda they suffer from humanity. The purpose has been objectively achieved: during the show we see that our protagonist is abundantly denigrated, so much so that she is considered a simple object on which to experiment, and, subsequently, some merits are recognized, as in any story about episodes of racism. . From a human point of view, however,...the story completely lacks those characteristics that are necessary for the transmission of ideals, such as empathy with the characters. In the next paragraphs, the reasons for my criticisms will be adequately explained.STORY (6/10):The story takes place within a communist-style dictatorial system, similar to the former USSR. We can therefore imagine the abuses that are made to keep power stable within this state: in addition to this the state is in strong contrast with the Kingdom of the United States, a state with a strong capitalist imprint, and both are involved in what we now consider the ""space race"". To advance with the progress, Zirnitra decides that an ordinary soldier, assisted by a young specialist, must train a vampire to secretly prepare for the first launch with an intelligent living being in space. Thus begins the vicissitudes of the show, letting us know the ambitions of the characters and the evil of hatred: however, unlike what we can expect, these are the only aspects within the story, as everything else is completely neglected and/or left to the viewer\'s imagination. With the continuation of the story, however, the theme of politics and its morality is developed, through intrigues hidden from all to the last and their unlikely consequences. Despite this, history proposes realistically, the difficulties and attempts that have been made by all those who, in reality, have contributed to this eternal enterprise.CHARACTERS (5/10):The big lack of this anime is the empathy with the characters. They, in addition to being flat, have an incomprehensible mentality, as if their actions were created for the sole purpose of continuing the plot, which follows a rigid order of cause and effect, and is not performed by their own choice if they had been real. The possible love affair, which could have been an immense mine of possibilities to create a minimum of interest in continuing this show, is practically abandoned to itself, to the point that it is left incomplete and almost completely hidden. However, some secondary characters can skillfully move the ranks of the story, maintaining a certain level of suspense until the last episode, in which different plots are revealed.ANIMATIONS AND SOUNDS (6/10):The drawings are well done and manage to convey a certain realism, even if the music is not particularly impactful.OVERALL AND TO WHOM I RECOMMEND IT:The anime was developed superficially from the point of view of the plot and the characters, despite the beauty of the historical background that is associated and the important themes discussed: I was quite disappointed with the final results, as can be seen in the length of this. review, which is synonymous with little interest.

Not everyone can achieve such a feat and this premise is bound to turn people off. It was not an issue for me as I have learned anime can get a little wacky and hey! So long as all the craziness is provided right at the start, I am willing to give it a go!If you can overcome that obstacle then you will be surprised at how closely this series follows real events of...the space race. This adherence to facts is made clear in the first episode as we are told the true fate of our unfortunate dog Laika who perished early on in her Sputnik-2 voyage. These little details are not limited to this fact however and if you play close attention to events and characteristics of certain individuals then you will find there are startling similarities to their real-life counterparts and events making this a series most suitable for space anoraks who are aware of all the finer points in the space race.As such outside some big creative decisions this is largely a hard science fiction story so don’t expect any glaring departures from reality outside the big elephant (vampire?!) in the room. Due to this realism a lot of the early episodes in this show are devoted to Irina’s cruelling training regimen that as time progresses gets increasingly harsh. Again, many of the events seen here are stuff the real cosmonauts did before flying into space.Now the concern many will have with “training” episodes is they are often dull affairs that are a necessary evil to watch before getting to the good stuff. Fortunately, this isn’t the case here as much of the training is used effectively to capture Irina’s growth and subsequent development for she doesn’t just grow physically but mentally as well as the trials and tribulations cast a spotlight on her various strengths and weaknesses.This arduous journey also enables her main handler to slowly develop a teacher-pupil relationship that naturally goes from a relationship of relative distrust to that of mutual respect. It happens slowly but is done in a convincedly manner as the way Irina overcomes her weakness is tackled in a believable way adding potency to the budding relationship.Naturally as the big day slowly approaches the drama escalates as a number of events are thrown in adding a sense of unease to the overall show. On top of that, various ominous hints concerning certain characters are dropped. All of this is then underscored by the fact many of the characters vying for glory are ruthlessly competitive to becoming the top space cadet. This combination of events means we are left wondering over the fates of not just Irina but also Lev.This all culminates in the natural big event when Irina is shuttled into space and we are left pondering not just the outcome of her mission but also the ramifications that come from it. What comes next is perhaps the part when the drama reaches its final crescendo as we learn what is the ultimate fate of not just Irina but also her compatriot Lev. Emotions run high as not only are we left guessing on the motives of some key individuals; we are also unsure how even Lev will react to the unexpected situation he finds himself in.These loose threads, even though hinted at are never really resolved until the final moments in the anime when it decides to throw down all its cards. It is in many ways breath-taking and is likely to stun people. I personally thought it was brilliant but then I could see this rubbing people the wrong way. What I can say is it is no ass pull ending as all of the actions in this final scene had been hinted and foreshadowed in earlier episodes. It is cleaver and is a clear case of keeping tabs of on-going events and never make any rash judgements.Animation/music:This series draws heavily from the Soviet Union’s Vostok space program with the rockets and capsules depicted being an exact copy from its real-life counterparts. Most of these pieces are represented in CGI but it is done in a way where it fits well with the rest of the animated scenes. Computerised imagery is also deployed in some of the motorcycle and training scenes but again this is done with a degree of skill so it is never an eyesore.Character models are good and this was used particularly well in conveying the various emotions of Irina who, I must admit was the star of this show. This means of conveying emotion was also effectively used on other characters adding a greater impact to various key moments. The opening and ending animation sequences are both strong also. As for the music, the opening and ending where both decent but I found the ending song ""Arifureta Itsuka"" by Chima to be the stronger of the two although ""Hii no Tsuki"" by ALI PROJECT was also a good effort.Summary:This is a hard sci-fi series that while taking some extreme liberties in certain areas does follow the events of the space race with a remarkable degree of accuracy. If you are space buff who is well versed in events then you will get an extra kick out of seeing the similarities between the anime and the real Vostok space program. Saying that these accurate subtleties are not key to the plot so people less versed can still enjoy the story for what it is. And what we do get are a good number of strong points.The plot, on the whole, is very strong as whilst things do not get off to a flyer, things get better as the stakes slowly increase and this all culminates in a strong finish that will leave many very satisfied. Better than that though is the strong mains of Lev and Irina who are both strong individuals with a great drive that is easy to admire. They don’t fall under the classic anime tropes and the fact neither falls into the Mary/Gary sue archetypes either means we are not rolling our eyes on how perfect they are. It is this great yet flawed characterisation that makes them such powerful characters that it is not only easy to root for but also makes it effortless to understand how the various side-characters can appreciate the manner and type of goals they pursue.If you are a fan of realistic sci-fi stories with a good dose of romance then there is a very good chance you will like this. To me, it is one of the surprise hits of the autumn 2021 that I would recommend viewers to see. Good plot, great characters and lots of enjoyable moments make this a breeze to finish!Story 7.5– The outlandish premise got me interested but the good story got me hooked. The sense of realism of actual events was a big boon but the definite strong point comes in the second half of the series when all the drama goes up a notch. The strong ending ensured this series left a lasting impression.Character 8.5 – It is not often that the two romantic pairing are both as strong as this. While we could argue Irina does have some tsundere tendencies her tenacious nature and ability to follow her dreams regardless of what people say or do is admirable. Lev also comes to his own which is a welcome change to the spineless male MC that are so pervasive in anime. The supporting cast are also strong adding an extra oomph to the story at all the right moments.Animation 7 – Character models are strong and the various expression of the characters was often amusing particularly for Irina. The CGI used for the various rockets, motorcycles and infrastructure whilst noticeable is done well enough. This is accompanied by some pretty solid opening and closing sequences in both the animation and musical department.Overall 8 – Biggest stumbling block is the wild vampire premise in an otherwise realistic space-based plot. If you can overlook that bombshell then you will likely enjoy this series especially if you have a penchant for science and romance. Lots to like here and with the good ending I feel many people will enjoy this series. One of the silent hits for the 2021 autumn season. the space race.

I\'m only a working guy stressed at work and enjoy watching anime to relieve stress.Also dont expect me to name the characters, as I loved giving them my own term.I decide to watch this anime adaptation of a light novel series from Gagaga Bunko, and as of now it was licensed by Seven Seas Entertainment for an English release next year, around mid-2022.That made me interest on this series.StoryVampire, and...outer space. The concept is new for me and also kinda weird but its the taste that made it interesting (against all those isekais)One of the pros of the story is, yes, the vampire who dreams to go to the space or moon, whatever. She was trained and used, and through out the course, she had develop relationship with the main dude who also dream going to the space.But behind those dreams are some bloody history of her kind. A certain faction on the government where she live, killed her kind. That made her resent the other kind, aka humans.And by that, the main dude which also the very best good guy in the training regimen of the ""cosmonauts to be""was  assign to her as her coach because the guy was demoted (he is a good guy hinesty sometimes makes shit happens), and this become his way of salavation to be part of the ""cosmonauts to be""I dont know if you enjoy that part of the story, but its the one that carry it all along with the...Politics, I can say this is a side dish of the story. I really dont get it but in the end, I find that there\'s 2 faction, pro and anti vampire. Some want her to be killed after the mission, which I think the other country wants to do. And the pro ones are those who just go along in the end. The first cosmonaut was a vampire, hurray!Ps. I can accept if they can drink a room temperature carbonated water in that cold water but eating ice cream, for real? Its already freaking cold.CharacterI can say both main characters guy and the vampire, somewhat grow but there\'s nsome immaturity in the last episode.If there will be a season 2, it would be good to see the vampire talk to other humans, but i dont know if we will have some.Also the side characters carry the high school trope, where the other ""cosmonauts to be"" bully he main guy and the vampire and they did change after the main characters able to do their goal.Art/AnimationThe fact, I like the anime visuals compare to the light novel illustration. Theres no problem with the visuals as we dont need sakugas whatever.The studio did well for the Soyuz, on how it took off and how the first stage disengage when you see it from the ground, it creates the cross like the real one.And the vampire is cute during funny moments, that made her a lovable character though her tsun- is always given.For the use of CGs, its the always the odd one for me like the moving vehicles.Sound/FX/VAsAll voice seems natural except for the vampire but I given up and accept its the way used to be. As she doesn\'t interact with the other kind for so long. Which make the voice sounds robot like and angry.For the soundfx, its passable.Enjoymenr/ConclusionI enjoy the flow of the main dish, but not the side dish yet the main characters pulled it well, except for the last episode. I need season 2 if theres any. I gotta used of thay vampires voice, that made her characterization shines enough, ""oh its the vampire""I don\'t know if there\'s some romance here, but i didn\'t expect it. I only expect the unexpected like the guy getting killed during the mission or the vampire getting killed after.The story and the characters push the story that both of them will experience the outer space but not yet the moon.Hoping if it\'ll will have some and make some changes in the history. First vampire in the moon.This is worth watching if you like rockets and into nerdy things like space exploration and stuff ....as well vampires. outer space.

The little bit of music they play just screams the 60\'s. It meshes perfectly with the setting and I find it pretty neat. Other...than the bumper and ED though, the music was pretty much average, barring a nice insert song they used once.I also think there was definitely a good idea behind this project. A space race oriented anime is a pretty unique idea, and one I would have loved to see more realized. Vampires don\'t necessarily have to be a part of it, but I\'m sure you could work them in somehow. Despite my praises of the concept, I think it really suffered in its execution, which I\'ll elaborate further later on in my review.The art was honestly a mixed bag, I think the colors were pretty fine (the orange they used for the space suit really popped and was quite nice), and the characters didn\'t look horrendous, and the animation was fine. Nothing really wowed me all that much, and I feel they really missed an opportunity, because I\'m sure you could do some cool aesthetics with a Soviet setting. There were a few details I noticed in the design of some elements being clearly based off of Soviet designs, such as the busses and rockets, but I don\'t think it went that deep.The main thing I\'d have to say about the characters is that they are just kind of cliché, which is a common theme throughout most of this show. Lev, the main character, is your average nice-guy protagonist, and other than being Russian and an astronaut has little actual backstory or character elements. He also doesn\'t really get any development, making him even more boring. Irina is slightly better, but only because she gets some development, because otherwise she just fits the ""tsundere"" archetype to a T. She also is given way more of a backstory, but none of it\'s really explored, so it doesn\'t add much to the show as a whole.The next thing on my list of things is the story. It really wasn\'t that impressive, it\'s a storyline that has been told 1000x before, albeit in different circumstances. 2 people love each other but some force doesn\'t want them to be together. This plotline is pretty average, and only feels even remotely unique because of the backdrop of the Soviet Space Race. The romance itself isn\'t even that good, with it feeling kind of underdeveloped and rushed. Furthermore, they don\'t even kiss once in the whole show, so the relationship never really gets farther than the ""I love you"" stage.Now on to my final point, which is both critique and speculation on what could have been. I feel one of my most prevalent feelings with Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu was how cliché everything felt. Their depiction of the Soviet Union is just really generic, and this setting never really ties into the story other than to say, ""We are the evil government and we kill people we don\'t like."" It really just feels like the most boring and surface level setting ever, barring a few specific details they include in a small number of scenes. I think this show would have been way better if they focused more on the unique setting and made a more historically-accurate show, that is more about exploring the USSR during this fascinating time. You could keep the vampire if you want to (she was cute after-all), but I think a more informational focus could have really made this show stand out as not just unique, but good too.This show was disappointing, while I never really hated it, it was certainly far from being good. There were still some good ideas at play, but they we\'re outnumbered by the number of less good aspects, leading to an overall pretty mediocre experience. than the bumper and ED though, the music was pretty much average, barring a nice insert song they used once.I also think there was definitely a good idea behind this project.

Only a few series have been able to pull of the vampire genre and not made it turn into a mishmash of cringe and cliche. Additionally, anime about space, the cold war, the ""UZSR"" and 20th century politics does not gain my attention. I solely watched this because of a cute vampire girl.So how does ""The vampire cosmonaut"" handle the vampire genre? Mehr. Honestly, you could have replaced vampires for any other oppressed group and it would have worked. 99%...of the time I forgot that she was a vampire, but perhaps that\'s her mysterious vampire allure at work?Getting down to the actual review, the show was alright. It was a bit rigid in places and the whole premises is nonsensical but disregarding that, I give this an 7/10.The characters were average, Irina (the vampire) carried the entire show without a doubt. I\'m not going to break it down like others, that isn\'t my style. For me this does not have re-watch value, just because of how stale it can get. of the time I forgot that she was a vampire, but perhaps that\'s her mysterious vampire allure at work?Getting down to the actual review, the show was alright.

Vampires are an oppressed people group in the UZSR and one is used to test their new rocket that supposedly can make it to space. The ending is heartwarming and a great example of how those with privilege are often the ones who have to push society forward by leveraging that privilege. Without Lev, Irina would have been disposed of and forgotten about, but because of him, she gets to remain in the space program and she gets remembered for her first ever space flight. As...much as I loved this show, I do think that the concept is a little more interesting than the writing, but I really like how they tied everything up in the end. much as I loved this show, I do think that the concept is a little more interesting than the writing, but I really like how they tied everything up in the end.', ""Disclaimer: I have not read the light novel (LN) of this series, thus I am unsure of how accurate the anime adapts from the original source. Therefore, most of the comments here will be analysing the anime as an original show rather than an adaptation of the LN.Story: The story is set in an alternate reality of Earth where the events are similar to the Space Race period. The story is self-explanatory based on the idea that the Space Race is about whoever gets to reach Space (in the context of the anime) first. As a result, there is little world-building required and the story...mainly concentrates on the characters and their interactions highlighting their different personalities which concentrate on the theme of human connection. Hence, the main selling point of the story is by adding a character that is different from everyone else (i.e. a vampire) would human connection still apply and where will it take them if it does happen. As such, the story focuses on the connection between the human main character (MC), Lev Leps, to the vampire girl, Irina, using the Space Race as a commonality between their race (and relationship). The story was enjoyable and simplistic since it is quite predictable that the interaction between the MC and vampire girl will lead to a direction where trust becomes a focal point leading to a possible romantic relationship (or some undertones of it). Preferably, I felt that some world-building on how the vampires came into being and some more cultural connection between them to Space will give the connection between humans and vampires as well as the common goal of going to space to be more impactful. The way the story ends is somewhat unsatisfactory but if it follows how the LN ends then I cannot say anything more than that.Character: All the characters have simple personalities with little characterisation to them which makes sense considering the theme of the story is about the human connections to others (especially to species other than their own). Therefore, these simple personalities just further highlight the connection between the MC and the vampire girl as well as the unity they have towards achieving the same goal. This makes sense since the main point is to focus on the connection between the MC and the vampire girl.Sound and Art: The art and animation were well done. As for the sound and music used in the anime, it was quite repetitive on using the same insert song over and over (although I am aware that this was intentional, I wasn't just a fan of that music). The OP was enjoyable, wasn't expecting ALI PROJECT to be singing it, though it does fit and the ED was fine as well.Overall: A very simple story based on events that are similar to the Space Race in the 20th century. Although, there could have been more on the backstory between vampires and humans as well as the connection between vampires to Space (or maybe the moon) it does not fundamentally change the story. Although the connection between the MC and vampire girl had a predictable outcome it still was enjoyable to observe what events need to happen in order for them to form the bond. mainly concentrates on the characters and their interactions highlighting their different personalities which concentrate on the theme of human connection.

Lev Laps is part of a cosmonaut candidate training program, who was demoted to a backup candidate due to insubordination against a superior officer. Needing to test how the conditions of space would affect human candidates, Lev is tasked by the Zimitran government to train a teenage vampire named Irina Luminesk to be used as a guinea pig for testing out how humans would fare...in a space expedition. As Lev becomes acquainted with Irina through their time together, the two come to confront their prejudices toward one another and become closer as the series progresses.As commented on in my opening paragraph, Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut is meant to be a sort of historical fiction anime as the two major world powers in the space race within the series are obviously made to represent the real-life Soviet Union and United States, the former being given prominent focus through the Zimitra Republic. For the most part, the series is fairly accurate to depicting the historical times within 1960 Soviet Union with the government\'s oppression, purging, and censorship of anything that makes its country look weak to the world at large, is critical of the government, or threatens said government\'s authority and influence. Other elements of the country like naming, food, technology, and environmental conditions are also pretty accurate to the time period as well. There are some inaccuracies with elements to the anime\'s depiction of the Soviet Union through Zimitra that are mostly minor, but one glaring inaccuracy that stuck out was Zimitra having a female cosmonaut candidate with Rosa when this did not occur until 1961 with the Soviet Union months following Yuri Gargarin\'s launch into space. But whether or not you fret over such minor changes will depend on how fickle you are with the details of Irina\'s historical accuracy.Setting aside the details of historical accuracy, Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut is largely focused on its main pair of Lev and Irina, and the series is largely pretty typical fare with how their chemistry plays out with Lev the ""nice guy"" and Irina acting largely like a tsundere. The series devotes a good amount of exploration on their characters with how both got to their present situations and how both overcome their personal prejudices for their different kinds and has its amusing moments with the chemistry between the two as Lev works to break through Irina\'s seemingly cold personality. The two become closer as they come to care for the well being of each other, with the series implying things are getting to a romantic point yet the series ends inconclusively before getting to such a point with their relationship developments. While the chemistry developments with the two are nothing new as far as anime titles go, the series still devotes enough focus and fleshing out of the pair to have you come to care for Lev and Irina.As far as other characters go within the series, they are kind of hit and miss. Many exist to fulfill roles to aid in or deter the efforts of Irina and Lev in their training as test subject and cosmonaut candidate respectively. Some like Anya and Rosa do have development or fleshing out with their characters in regards to how they view their relationships with our two lead characters. Anya\'s developments come off genuine with the chemistry she has with the two characters and the effort she goes through to aid them. But Rosa\'s focus in a later episode comes off feeling kind of sudden as her character didn\'t have much in the way of fleshing out throughout the series beyond being antagonistic toward Lev and Irina in her occasional interactions with them.In short, Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut comes off feeling like a mostly solid series with the largely faithful historical accuracy of the space race between the Sovi... er, Zimitrans and Arnaks. Lev and Irina are pretty typical as far as characters go, but there\'s enough fleshed out in their chemistry and developments to have you care for them. Supporting characters, for the most part, don\'t have much to them beyond largely fulfilling some sort of role to aid or deter the two lead characters. While not breaking new ground to a good degree as far as plot and character developments go, I was still entertained with Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut for the most part and have interest in seeing a potential second season, as the title\'s light novel source material has yet to be fully adapted and recently wrapped things up with its story from what I gather. in a space expedition.

I did have my doubts when i started it but at some point I started warming up to every bit of entertainment it had thrown at me from the storyline, to the character developments.I loved every bit of this anime, though this is from my own view. I do recommend this anime to anyone who is curious. I am eagerly waiting for a second season.The whole story is actually written quite well, shit might be kinda ""i know where is this going"" or Cliché. But when its Ep 10 plus things took quite a surprising turn. It...isn\'t that good but its also isn\'t that bad. Its just well, a fine mix id say? I don\'t know what im talking about at this point. There may have some friendly moments that feels like romance but Ep 12 showed me its just Comradeship or just pure Friendship. isn\'t that good but its also isn\'t that bad.

Zoids Shinseiki/Zero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/764/Zoids_Shinseiki_Zero,"[""I don't know what it is, but I've been reliving my childhood a lot lately. Maybe, as college approaches, I want to remember all the good times I had as kid. I got into anime in the fourth grade via Sailor Moon (didn't everyone?), and once Toonami started airing anime all the time, I got hooked. I don't know exactly when I discovered the wide world of anime outside my TV, but if it wasn't for Cartoon Network bringing it over, I probably wouldn't be such an avid member of the anime fandom.One show that Toonami aired was Zoids: New Century Zero, or, as the...dubbing company named it, Zoids. I loved watching Zoids after school, it was definitely one of my favorite series. So I picked it up again, torrented the dub, and watched it start to finish. Serious blast from the past.The plot of the show works rather well, and it's very fun to see the Blitz team pull out one victory after another. The Backdraft group is a little cliche at the beginning with their, &quot;oh ho ho, we're the bad guys and we're going to beat you do-gooders into the ground&quot;, but as the series goes on, the members of the back-draft group get a lot more fleshed out and become interesting villains. Still, some remain stale, with little to no explanation of their motivations except &quot;I wanna be powerful, lol&quot;.Sometimes, though, I felt Bit and the Liger were too powerful. I can only remember one instance of the Liger losing, and with twenty five plus battles, you start to get annoyed by the Liger's uber skills. In the beginning episodes, the other characters hardly get any action at all, and powerful warriors like Brad and Leena even start to seem like hindrances to Bit and the Liger. However, as the series goes on, this remedies itself, with Brad getting a tricked out Shadow Fox and Leena blasting away opponents with her Gun Sniper. Jamie even gets a share of the action in his flying Raynos.To tell the honest truth, I think this series needed to be longer. Brad doesn't get his Shadow Fox until Episode 20 out of 26, and Jamie only gets one or two episodes to totally kick butt as the Wild Eagle, his alter ego. The show gets a lot of fleshing out too late, in my opinion.But what I've written makes it seem like I didn't enjoy the show. Quite the contrary, Zoids is a great series, despite its slow build-up to the uber awesome. Every character is fun to watch, from the fun-loving Bit to the &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; Leena. Brad's misery behavior is very funny, and Jamie shows off more than once that he is the most mature of the team, despite being the youngest. Steve Torros' impulse buying of things that are &quot;big and shiny&quot; is always chuckle-enducing. Harry Champ is also hilarious to watch -- he's desperately in love with Leena, but she refuses his advances (probably due to the fact that he's a total dork).The writing, I will admit, sometimes dissolves into the classic shonen anime &quot;long stare off into the sky with determined expression&quot; cheese. But some passages of dialogue are very funny. So it's a mixed bag.The art of this series is actually one of the things that makes it stand out. For 2001, the art is really clean and polished, and the amount of detail is astounding. All the Zoids are animated in full 3D CG, which makes for some pretty stunning battles. Watching the action on this show is hardly a bore -- everything is animated beautifully, and all the Zoids are designed fantastically.The music is also something that sticks out. In short, it kicks ass. You WILL find yourself bopping up and down to some of the tunes, especially the &quot;uber dramatic action&quot; songs that got me bopping my head. Whoever did the music handled it VERY well. I watched the dub, so I didn't hear the Japanese opening theme/ending theme, but the American ending theme isn't so awful. No singing, just some cool rock music -- a good choice, in my opinion.As for the dub, I can honestly say that Zoids is probably one of the best dubs I've seen. A few of the lines are little &quot;whut?!&quot; but for the most part, across the board, the acting is good and the voices all fit great. They did a bit of editing (Bit walks in on Leena in the bath -- they disguise it as Leena being mad because Bit took her scheduled time slot) but it really wasn't annoying. I mean, I'm not the sort who goes, &quot;OMFG there shuld b more cursin!!1 lol&quot; so I think whatever edits they did were appropriate and non-obtrusive to the storyline.Really, I watched around eight episodes of this series in a row. It's that good. Definitely will keep you entertained, and probably get you invested along the way. dubbing company named it, Zoids. I loved watching Zoids after school, it was definitely one of my favorite series. So I picked it up again, torrented the dub, and watched it start to finish. Serious blast from the past.The plot of the show works rather well, and it's very fun to see the Blitz team pull out one victory after another. The Backdraft group is a little cliche at the beginning with their, &quot;oh ho ho, we're the bad guys and we're going to beat you do-gooders into the ground&quot;, but as the series goes on, the members of the back-draft group get a lot more fleshed out and become interesting villains.

I'm talking the abominations that became Bleach and Naruto.  The laughable (but cherished) memories of DBZ and Ronin Warriors.  All Anime that when aired in America...were utterly ruined by abysmal voice actors and edited scenes all to hell.When i sit back and look at Zoids for what it is, an American Dubbed anime, i am left in awe of it's prowess.  The voice acting was actually something i felt little shame for.  The plot was fun and amusing, but it incorporated enough twists, revelations and...serious scenes to give it a good blend.  A whimsical and light anime, the characters stand out with their sarcastic wit.  I had to give it extremely top marks because of the impact it left on me. serious scenes to give it a good blend.  A whimsical and light anime, the characters stand out with their sarcastic wit.  I had to give it extremely top marks because of the impact it left on me."", ""Overview:Time to review a blast from the past! Zoids Zero was a popular show on Cartoon Network's Toonami block in the early 2000s. The show largely existed to sell awesome toy models, much like Hasbro's Transformers from the 1980s, but it was still a decent show and not just a glorified toy commercial.Plot: 6/10The plot is that piloting giant robots and fighting in epic team battles is now the most popular sport on Earth, or whatever the hell planet this takes place on. The main team is called the Blitz team and in the tradition of sports movie cliches goes from a bunch of...complete losers to being the champs in dramatic fashion. The Blitz team is led by Bit Cloud and the mysterious Liger Zero Zoid. The Liger can transform into several other forms with the help of attachable battle armor including the lighning fast Jager, the heavy fire power Panzer, and the well balanced Schneider. This show had a bizzare fetish for German names. The most powerful Zoid in the whole series is a T-rex called the Berzerk Fuhrer (not kidding). Although they did change the name to the Berzerk Fury in the US and German dubs for censorship reasons. The plot heavily resembles other fighting robot sports series like G-Gundam and Robot Jox. Only instead of fighting to control the world, it is simply a sport for entertainment. The plot honestly isn't as important as the EPIC battle scenes and awesome robots. This was a great little shonen action series that is worth checking out for that reason alone.Characters: 4/10The characters are honestly pretty bland and generic. Bit Cloud is funny at times, but doesn't really have any character depth or anything that makes him memorable. The other characters are even less developed. This isn't really a series you watch for the great characters though.Art: 7/10Although it looks a tad dated now, the CG was amazing when it first came out. Combining CG with traditional animation was difficult in the late 90s and early 2000s, and often it came out looking like complete horse shit. Zoids is one of the better examples of an anime with heavy CG from this time period.Sound: 6/10I wouldn't rush out and buy the soundtrack, but it had some catchy toons and fit the action of the series quite well.Enjoyment: 7/10It has been quite a while since I last saw Zoids, so obviously my review is tinted a bit by nostalgia. I did find it quite enjoyable back in the day, and would think that current generation anime fans in their young teens would also probably have some fun with it.Overall: 6/10This is a series that really isn't brought up much anymore. This is kind of a shame because it is a LOT better than a lot of current day shit like Rail Wars! I'm not saying that Zoids Zero is a classic in the same vein as Cowboy Bebop or anything, but it was and is a decent little series that deserves a tad more love than it gets. complete losers to being the champs in dramatic fashion.

In Chaotic Century, Zoids were strictly used as weapons of war, but in New Century Zoids are used for sporting competitions where no one dies and even if you lose you can just get back up and try again. There's much less tension and drama in New Century which I really like because I never took...Zoids that seriously, I mean come on when this show was on TV it ran to back with shows like Pokemon.The character's are also much better is New Century than is Chaotic Century. Bit has a much more carefree attitude than Van did and Leena is a total Tsundere which I just find hilarious. New Century has a lot of funny characters in fact: Leena's dad is just a big kid, Dr. Leyon was such an incompetent villain, and everything Harry says is funny. Of course, don't get the wrong impression, this anime is still packed to the roof with explosions, fight scenes, and cool Sci Fi Mecha stuff so it isn't just a comedy.New Century does have kind of an over-arching plot like Chaotic Century did, but, kind of like in Chaotic Century, a whole lot of exposition is crammed into last episode and isn't really that important. However, like I said at the beginning, its a Shounen, every episode is basically just another adrenaline fix with a few laughs thrown in for comic relief. A lot of fun to watch, though!

A lot of fun to watch, though!"", 'So get this. Here I am, on a ride home from a local Smash Bros tournament with a fellow weeb friend, and I bring up Zoids, the semi-popular show of our childhood. I bring up the idea of rewatching it and he\'s like, ""Nah, I know it\'s gonna be bad if I look at it now"".To have this mentality toward a show you watched and loved as a child is fully understandable, but it is my humble opinion that no show subverts this stigma better than Zoids New Century/Zero. This review will cover why I firmly believe that.First, a bit of history. Like the rest...of the few people who still remember Zoids, I watched this during Toonami\'s ""golden era"" in 2001/02, and it was one of those shows I\'d rush home to catch, even more so than classics such as DBZ and Gundam. At the time, I wasn\'t nearly as invested in Chaotic Century (the 6am timeslot didn\'t do much to sell me either) as I was Zero, so Zoids more or less disappeared off the face of the earth.Fast forward to early in my senior year of high school, I\'m spaced out at my desk and randomly remember the show, so I decide to marathon it over the course of a week. For about two months over that, I had a resurgence of my Zoids obsession. I finished Chaotic Century, played a few of the games... but that more or less faded when there was, simply put, nothing left to do. Fuzors sucked, Genesis was meh (and never got a dub), so Zoids mostly served as a gateway for me to get back into anime.Now, a few months ago, I decided to rewatch it yet again. So, how\'s it hold up?Story:One major criticism that Zero is constantly hit with (mostly by fans of Chaotic Century) is that it has no plot. While compared to CC, Zero is largely episodic, to say it has none at all would be selling it short. For the uninitiated, Zero revolves around Zoids, a race of biomechanical giant animals (think Gundams, but animals instead of humans) piloted by humans in a competitive sport. Teams of Zoid pilots battle it out under a competitive ruleset to rise up through the ranks and qualify for tournaments. So yeah, the whole show is essentially one big tournament arc.But it goes so much further than that. While I do consider the story to objectively be Zero\'s weakest point, it\'s not nonexistent. So many wildcard factors are thrown in that the Zoids Battle Commission eventually has to step in and intervene. First and foremost we have the Backdraft Group, our main villain faction. These guys essentially go around challenging high-ranking teams to ""unsanctioned battles"" with either no rules, or rules that favor them. They\'re the typical criminal organization, stealing Zoids, taking over battles, etc. Honestly, these guys are pretty mediocre as far as villains go. They have their moments, like when Altiel drops his facade and has a very humbling experience as soon as the higher-ranking guys show up, and Stoller is a fantastic character, but I was far more invested in Dr. Layon, a half-serious, half-comic relief villain who specifically antagonizes the Blitz team, all over a misunderstanding regarding a romantic endeavor. This guy steals the show by his second appearance.Other things show up here and there, but it\'s fairly formulaic in nature until the last few episodes. Nothing was Fuzors-level of dumb, and thank goodness.While plot armor is occasionally in effect, battles feel strategic in nature, as a competitive battle should. Every battle the Blitz Team wins is earned through coordination and smart moves. The warriors are always thinking on their feet, and even lose a few times, proving they aren\'t invincible.Art:The first thing you\'ll notice about Zoids is that all the mecha themselves are rendered in cel-shaded CGI. For 2001, this looks very crisp and high-res. Some hate this feature, I personally love it. Models are very accurate to the toys that Zoids were based on. Animations are tight, and they really went all out with the battle scenes.The characters are drawn in traditional anime style, and I really like what Xebec did here. The first few episodes look somewhat awkward in regards to faces, though. Proportions are really off, especially when the characters turn their heads. Thankfully, this doesn\'t take long to improve. I have to say, I honestly like how faces are drawn in later episodes. Something I\'ve realized in recent months is my incredible disdain for animation styles that reduce noses to a single black dot that you have to squint to see (read: KyoAni, most overrated studio in existence), and this show definitely forgoes that for more realistically sized eyes, noses, etc.Sound:Even if you hate this show, you have to admit they really put their heart into the OST. Few action anime have songs that get me pumped as much as tracks like ""Brad Hunter"" and ""Strike Laser Claw"", and ""Twilight of Planet Zi"" fits the melancholy moments to a T. The ending, ""No Future"" is also fantastic. I don\'t need to say much else here.I\'m definitely a fan of the voice acting, too. Being the one person on MAL who isn\'t a whiny sub elitist, I think the dubbing here is pretty great. Fans of InuYasha and Ranma 1/2 will recognize Richard Ian Cox as our main protag, Bit Cloud. Other than him, I haven\'t heard of a lot of the voice cast, other than Samuel Vincent (Double D) as Brad Hunter, and Scot McNeil (a whole lot of characters) as Stigma Stoller. The screaming does sound a bit silly, but it\'s also greatly toned down from CC.Character:This is the point where I think New Century wins over Chaotic Century... and a lot of other action anime, if I\'m being blunt.To explain why, let me get something out of the way: I don\'t like kid heroes. As an adult, I just don\'t enjoy them and I certainly don\'t identify them. Let\'s be honest here, it\'s a played out concept. I recently started watching Hunter x Hunter, and it\'s barely taken me 5 episodes to realize how much I identify with Leorio rather than the rest of the main cast.What\'s my point, you ask? Simple: the majority of Zero\'s main cast are... what? Fully self-sufficent adults who act like adults?! An unheard-of concept, I know, but it makes the show so much more believable. Our MC, Bit, starts off as a simple junk dealer who wants to build Zoids. We know his career and mindset, which helps set the stage when he sneaks into Blitz Team\'s hangar and has to explain himself.A lot of people don\'t like Leena Toros. ""She\'s annoying"". Personally as someone who usually despises tsunderes, she\'s one of the few I actually enjoy. She\'s a very believable character for the most part, and has a unique design to boot.Brad Hunter rounds out the trio as a laid-back mercenary who repeatedly claims not to be an ""official"" Blitz Team member. Outside of battle, he rarely raises his voice and frankly, gives no fucks unless money is involved. He\'s one of those types who cares a lot about his team\'s safety, despite not projecting this outwardly often.The dynamic between these characters as well as Steve, Jamie, and the other recurring cast is where this show shines through. Those who pay close attention to the conversations and interactions they have outside of battle will notice how ""real"" it all feels. The lines almost feel improvised at some points. I\'m very impressed at this show\'s ability to realistically present a group of 4 people who have to work as a team despite not exactly the best of friends. Early on, you\'ll pick up on how often they insult each other or pull childish pranks, and how that happens less and less as the series goes on. When giant mecha cats, wolves, and dinos aren\'t blowing each other up, character development is happening left and right.Enjoyment:I could easily sum up my enjoyment in one sentence: I wish this show was longer.CC got 67 episodes, Genesis got over 50, Zero was relegated to the standard 26. Can\'t say I\'m a fan of this decision, but at least the show didn\'t leave a lot of loose ends open, not that I can think of anyway.This is a show I wholeheartedly enjoyed both as a 9 year old child, and a 23 year old adult. Yeah, it has the typical shonen tropes of characters screaming the names of their attacks and such, but that\'s the only childish element at work here.Overall:Zoids: New Century/Zero is perhaps one of the most criminally underrated and forgotten anime to air. I never hear it mentioned in the slightest outside of actual Zoids communities or comments on videos. What happened? Everyone remembers Dragon Ball, Gundam, Sailor Moon, and the rest of Toonami\'s old lineup, but not this hidden gem? To be fair, Zoids hasn\'t been remotely relevant in the US since like, 2004, but this is one franchise in need of a revival.Behind the guise of ""just another kids show"" is a wonderful cast of three-dimensional characters, great comedy, and of course, action packed CGI mecha battles. of the few people who still remember Zoids, I watched this during Toonami\'s ""golden era"" in 2001/02, and it was one of those shows I\'d rush home to catch, even more so than classics such as DBZ and Gundam.

However, the plot is very lackluster at best, it makes for an excellent series to just pick up a random episode and start watching. "", ""So, if you're thinking about Zoids New Century Zero hopefully this will help you decide. I have only watched Century Zero all the way through, and only the first few episodes of the original. You do not need to watch the others to understand this one. The story is easy to follow. But the thing is, is that it's more for people who want to watch cool battles between giant robot animals controlled by skilled pilots. The dialogue is fairly good, but it gets a bit silly and/or dry at times. But that isn't the purpose of this show. This show is meant to showcase...how awesome the Zoids are. It revolves around team battles, and it's kind of like a buffed up version of Pokemon. If you want a version of this that focuses more on character storylines, I suggest watching the original.But with that being said, I actually really like the main character plot-line with Bit Cloud. I can tell you that you are most likely going to like him best, which is good since he's the main character. You might find the other characters charming in their own ways, or you might not. But that's not why you should watch this show.If you're going to watch it, it's for the awesome action scenes. And if the idea of giant, piloted,  pokemon-like machines with customized weapons battling each other (usually on teams) sounds cool to you, you're probably going to enjoy watching New Century Zero. And I don't want to give anything away, but the main Zoid in this show is pretty epic. how awesome the Zoids are.

It's so boring to see him like that in every episode.Very different from...the initial Zoids series which had a definite storyline and goal, namely finding Zoids Eve, in Zoids Zero there is no definite storyline goal for the MC.There is only Battle and Battle over and over again.I don't really recommend the Zoids Zero anime, because the story is too boring to watch. the initial Zoids series which had a definite storyline and goal, namely finding Zoids Eve, in Zoids Zero there is no definite storyline goal for the MC.There is only Battle and Battle over and over again.I don't really recommend the Zoids Zero anime, because the story is too boring to watch.""]"
