Doraemon Movie 19: Nobita no Nankai Daibouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2664/Doraemon_Movie_19__Nobita_no_Nankai_Daibouken,"[""My overall take: Not boring, but founded on a house of cards.In this movie, Nobita and his friends encounter pirates while searching for treasure in the Caribbean Sea. This is the first Doraemon movie made after the manga author's passing, and we're off to a rough start. The story here is filled with convenient coincidences: Nobita just happens to pinpoint the exact location of hidden treasure on a world map, the main characters and most of their allies all happen to get caught by the villain independently after the party is separated and they all happen to get locked in the same cell, the only...two pirates who have not yet been captured happen to stumble into the villain's hideout and happen to knock out a guard on the way in, and so on.Moreover, the characters make some bizarre decisions. For example, the reason Nobita and his new friend Jack (the son of a pirate captain) get captured is that a dolphin brings them inside the villain's hideout after rescuing Nobita from drowning. However, the ending reveals that the dolphin is actually a member of the time police who was investigating the villain, so why it decided to take two lost children into the heart of enemy operations is unclear. At one point, the villain also monologues his plan and motivations to the main characters for no apparent reason other than presumably to provide exposition for the audience.I'll give credit where it's due: I didn't get bored watching this movie, every main character contributes at some point, and it features several pretty cool-looking monsters. However, seeing as there are other Doraemon movies that have similar achievements without the problems of this one, I'd consider Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas one of the most skippable entries. two pirates who have not yet been captured happen to stumble into the villain's hideout and happen to knock out a guard on the way in, and so on.Moreover, the characters make some bizarre decisions.

Captain Tsubasa J,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1674/Captain_Tsubasa_J,"[""Made in the mid 90's, this anime is fun to watch, just like the original. For those who've seen the original, you can pretty much skip to episode 35, since the first 33 are recaps and episode 34 is quickly summed up in the first few minutes of 35. If you're new to the anime, watch the whole thing, and if you want more detail, go to the corresponding episodes in the original.Now, from episode 35 on is pure bliss, because the character development of this fantastic newcomer, Shingo Aoi, is well done. If you can get a dub or sub, do it, since...the dialogue is actually pretty important. This is unlike the original, which could have had no dialogue whatsoever and still been pretty much understood (except for a hilarious backhand smack that NEEDED dialog for effect, but I digress).The entire series is only 46 episodes long (45 in some dubs; I've seen the Arabic and Spanish ones), which means only a dozen new episodes total. But that dozen is absolutely fantastic- namely the internal feud at training camp and the epic match vs. Thailand.The music, in an absolute sense, is great, but compared to the original, it's somewhat disappointing. You just don't get the same feel. For comparison, if the original is DBZ, than Captain Tsubasa J is DBGT on steroids. Make of that what you will. The animation, however has me torn. It's different than the first series, but it's more pronounced (crisper) in both a good way- brightness, lack of blurriness- and a bad way; the original is easier on the eyes. I gave it a 7/10.All in all, this is great marathon fodder. It does leave you at a sort of cliffhanger, though, which is universally bemoaned, but at least it's good while it lasts. Here's hoping the next remake (aired 2001-2002) clears up that distasteful part of this anime for us. the dialogue is actually pretty important.

Doraemon Movie 32: Nobita to Kiseki no Shima - Animal Adventure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11053/Doraemon_Movie_32__Nobita_to_Kiseki_no_Shima_-_Animal_Adventure,"['My overall take: Conceptually appealing, but sad to say, one of my least favorite Doraemon movies.In this movie, Nobita and his friends travel to the 22nd Century to visit an island that has been converted into a preserve for extinct animals. As both a paleontologist and a Doraemon fan, by all rights I should love this movie. Furthermore, one of the protagonists\' new allies in this film is a younger version of Nobita\'s father who has been displaced in time, an interesting idea! From a conceptual standpoint, this movie shows a lot of promise.Sorry to say, however, I like very little about Nobita and the...Island of Miracles. To start off, there\'s the premise that the extinct animals on the island preserve are sustained by the ""life force"" emitted by an immortal golden beetle that lives there. (No, this is never elaborated on any further.) The existence of this golden beetle drives much of the story, and yet it simultaneously feels wholly unnecessary. As an explanation for how the extinct animals can live on the island? That could have been chalked up to 22nd Century animal husbandry. As a source of wonder for the protagonists? One might think seeing extinct animals alive would have been enough. As a target for the villains to go after? The movie would have worked just as well if they\'d wanted to poach the extinct animals.Then there\'s the fact that the entire story is built on contrivance after contrivance. The reason Nobita\'s father ends up in the 22nd Century as a child comes down to a series of accidents and a robot employee from the animal preserve being incredibly incompetent at his job. Doraemon sends all his weapon gadgets away for maintenance, and then the plot still has to devise ways to make most of his remaining gadgets unusable. (Why did he try hitting a charging Elasmotherium with the Anywhere Door?!) Right when the heroes need to fight a giant mech, Doraemon happens to rummage out his Big Light, which happens to turn on and happens to shine on a beetle that the main characters didn\'t know was there. The list goes on...The movie also tries to force emotional moments that don\'t always work. For example, one scene has the main characters reminisce about their experiences with their parents, which was nice and all, but felt thematically odd at the same time. Despite Nobita\'s father being a major character here, most of the story doesn\'t particularly focus on the interactions between the kids and their parents. A conversation like this would have been more fitting in, say, Nobita and the Birth of Japan (1989). (It also doesn\'t help that much of the dialogue for this segment appears to have been borrowed from the 1974 manga chapter ""Mom Swap"".)Suneo of all characters gets a good bit of characterization in this film... or it would be good if it weren\'t immediately undercut. When he and Koron, the young granddaughter of the village chief on the island*, are captured by the villains**, he tries to reassure her by saying the others will rescue them, even adding that Nobita is actually quite dependable in situations like this. (It\'s rare to hear Suneo say anything good about Nobita!) Not only that, but when the villains threaten Suneo in an attempt to persuade Koron to give them information about the golden beetle, Suneo continues to insist that she shouldn\'t tell them, a very brave gesture compared to his usual reactions to danger. Unfortunately, just then a pendant made out of a fossil of the golden beetle\'s horn***, worn by Koron\'s pet dodo, starts glowing, giving away the beetle\'s location and rendering Suneo\'s heroism moot. By the way, the fact that the pendant glows in response to the beetle and that this phenomenon can be used to track the beetle\'s location are never mentioned before this.*Yep, there\'s a village of humans living in the middle of this extinct animal preserve. Why are they there? This is not explained.**At least it\'s not Shizuka getting kidnapped for once...***Why is there a fossil of the beetle\'s horn if the beetle is still alive? This is also not explained.Meanwhile, Nobita is panicking over how they\'re supposed to save Suneo and Koron without any of Doraemon\'s weapon gadgets. After this goes on for some time, Shizuka tells him to get a grip, saying (paraphrased), ""Can you do nothing without Doraemon\'s gadgets? I hate cowards like you!"" Whoa! As much as I\'d normally welcome Shizuka displaying aspects of her personality other than straightforward niceness, this reproach felt unearned, because Nobita\'s concern came across as completely valid: how are some children, peaceful villagers, and a babysitting robot supposed to contend with 22nd Century criminals without weapons? What\'s more, when the heroes eventually reach the villains\' doorstep, Doraemon reveals that he does still have a few potentially useful gadgets left after all. Maybe you should have brought that up back when the others were panicking and arguing!Probably the most ridiculous part of this movie, however, is when the protagonists respond to the villain leader bringing out a giant mech by... running around and yelling. Somehow, this actually works to stop the villain from attacking. Maybe he was just as confused as the audience was... This is one of the few Doraemon films I\'ve watched in theaters, and that may well have been the most awkward scene I\'ve ever seen in a cinema. Island of Miracles.

Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 3 - Kagayaku Mono Ten yori Otsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15199/Code_Geass__Boukoku_no_Akito_3_-_Kagayaku_Mono_Ten_yori_Otsu,"[""This was very boring. I can believe how long it was push back, in fact I could not remember what had happened before, so I re-watched the previous episodes in preparation, all for nothing.The first half: it is totally inconsequential, the characters lose their money in the most irresponsible way imaginable, as one bureaucrat shuts down the entire squad. If the European military is run like that they deserve to lose.The whole gipsy sub plot is pointless. I get they were trying to flesh out the characters and give them relations beyond just fighting, but it serves no purpose, except fill time. In fact...the entire episode is drag as much as possible.The second part: yes Lelouch appears, but not really. The great character from the series is gone and what is left behind is a shell, a cartoon. He acts smart, because we are suppose to know he is smart, but in the context of this story he does very little. Then there is some dumb plot about a guy betraying Britania, and trying to use Lelouch's identity to force a rebellion, but it makes no sense. As his action are mostly random and he has no clear motive, just the usual anime trope of he is disappointed with humanity so he is just going to kill everyone.In conclusion the characters are dull, the plot meanders the entire run time, and the beloved characters of the original series are reduced to caricatures of their former selves. the entire episode is drag as much as possible.The second part: yes Lelouch appears, but not really.

It might seem boring if you're only here for the action and don't have any appreciation for using a little humor as an interlude, but I think...this detour was absolutely necessary if you want to understand the narrative structure as a whole.No matter how many complicated personal issues Akito, Leila and the others have to deal with, whether in the past or in the future, they are still human beings at heart. This is a story about people struggling to survive in the middle of a rather bleak part of the world, where democracy is not a guarantee of freedom. That being the case, we can't have them fighting the enemy or each other all the time.Once that is out of the way, we should discuss what is happening on the Euro-Britannian front. Politics and backstabbing take the center stage this time around through internal divisions due to the arrival of Julius Kingsley and Suzaku, along with some setup for over-the-top plans that aren't particularly realistic yet seem oddly fitting for the larger-than-life world of Code Geass. The chapter's single mecha combat sequence also happens here, remaining as exciting as one can expect from this production.In short, this was a transitional period with a turning point that might have interesting consequences for both new and old characters.CharacterWhile the size of the cast feels relatively large for the running time and many of them tend to have a low profile, I think we are finally starting to get used to the newcomers.In particular, it's worth mentioning that we learn about Leila's past and why she struggles against the status quo even from within a military organization. This also prompts a certain interaction with Akito that also manages to show his vulnerable side beneath an aloof and occasionally cold exterior.Then we come to the question of Lelouch, or rather the person officially known as Julius Kingsley. It is fair to say he isn't remotely the main focus of the story here, which means his portrayal is less detailed than during the original TV show. He is playing a different role as an envoy from mainland Britannia sent to the European territories who wants the Emperor's wishes to be followed, no matter the cost, in order to quickly conquer the continent.However, beneath all of his bombastic speeches and outright villainy, which is probably still entertaining to watch if you are a fan of Code Geass in one way or another, there are a couple of hints about the true nature of the character that contrast with the superficial simplicity of the individual currently known as Julius. His interaction with Suzaku also matches the state of their dynamic at this point in the original story, though certainly in a less direct manner than usual. In other words, you may need to read between the lines.Another character who gets some much needed time in the spotlight is Shin, the main antagonist of Akito the Exiled. He actually didn't have a lot of opportunities to act before, outside of meeting Akito in battle and previously engaging in murder behind-the-scenes, but now we get to see him as a truly manipulative individual who can be surprisingly dangerous. It is he, not Julius Kingsley, who ends up in control of the situation.  This is not a person you want to cross.We also briefly meet a mysterious entity connected to the Geass, who is apparently involved in some sort of conspiracy, but since nothing else has been revealed yet there's no point in worrying about it too soon. I hope this subject receives a proper explanation within the next two chapters.Just as an aside: I found the old ladies at the start of this chapter kind of silly, if you must ask, but not too problematic in the grand scheme of things.Art and SoundAs expected, production values remain high quality here. There isn't much to complain about as long as you're not expecting something on the level of the visuals for Gundam Unicorn.

Which makes me happy, since I think we need more variety and less repetition in order to avoid some of the problems with the second season of the previous work (leaving its excellent ending aside).OverallSo far, I admit it's taken a while for the audience to warm up to Akito the Exiled and perhaps it will only be fully appreciated when all five chapters can be watched one after the other.

The Akito sub-series is already filled to the brim with utterly ridiculous moments in the first two films alone, but this movie takes it up to endearing levels of stupidity, despite what it does to the series\' canon and how it makes the whole geass stuff even more convoluted than ever before. People claim that this was the start of the fall of the series when, honestly, it was horrible to begin...with. All of the same problems (except bad CGI because it\'s improved here) are on full display, like dumb character decisions, poor usage of Geass in terms of justifying it and how it works, edgy writing and MC, and bland characters (though the main protagonists are far less dull here). However, the writer managed to become even dumber than before which is quite an accomplishment, and the pacing really ruins itself.Absolutely nothing makes sense in this movie. Somehow, our military protagonists get financially locked out and unable to get into their military building and then a group of old ladies tries to hustle the group, and then the group works for them for a while. We don\'t know how we got to this point. We also learn plenty of backstories, like for Akito, Leila, and that one scientist lady who keeps her lover in some kind of stasis in hopes of him recovering, however, each of these backstories is rushed beyond belief, making it hard to process them. The pacing of this movie is terrible because of that; things rarely get to breathe and flesh themselves out properly. We then see Julius, Shin, SpinZaku, and others coming together, and then Julius enacts his fake terrorism plan, and it works. After a game of chess against Shin, we see him flip out after saying ""your majesty"" because somehow that triggers his actual memories as Lelouch now despite him saying it a lot beforehand. He flips out, passes out, and Shin tells them that he killed him (though he obviously didn\'t, since if he did, R2 couldn\'t exist), as well as some stuff shot killing people we never heard of and this Euro-Britannia stuff we never heard of until minutes prior in this film with no explanation of what it is. Then this weird geass lady shows up from the TV somehow to tell Gene Smilas what to do, and we end on a hokey fist fight. What a mess. Things are just thrown in there with no proper explanation and the pacing goes far too fast. It only added more problems to the already broken Akito narrative and has potentially jeopardized the continuity of R2.Aside from boring Akito, the other 4 major protagonists actually get to show off their fun side, even if it makes the rebel trio in particular feel like completely different people if not for their singular trait from before that occasionally appears. Ayano has the biggest personality change, and it all comes out of left field, though for her, it compliments her beauty more. Let it not be said that these three aren\'t more likable and that they aren\'t less generic now, because they are. The lightning-fast pacing doesn\'t let the backstories tell themselves well either, especially for Leila. Plus, the gypsies are annoying and not well written. Now to the other side of this conflict. Julius is pathetic. He\'s just an arrogant man who goes crazy for the most ludicrous of reasons and is reduced to someone pathetic, almost like a sick parody of the man he was in the TV series. His plan is compared to what the real Lelouch did despite him never doing something like that in the original series, and I can\'t explain why he is so pathetic about water. Shin is every bit as one-note as ever, but it\'s interesting to see how the other guys are dicks to him behind his back. We luckily only get to see the badass side of Suzaku and not the abhorrent and hypocritical side of him, but he can\'t help much. Then we get this hot but disturbingly one-note lady of Geass who we know nothing about, in the second to last scene of the film and apparently we don\'t see her again in the next one. Just...why?Yet with everything I said, it seems like the movie did learn something, as its visuals are a massive step up from the previous movies. For one, the characters move quite a lot, at least thrice as much as the first two films combined, which shouldn\'t have been as big a relief as it was. Also, the CGI in the second half of the film has vastly improved, notably in the battle between Suzaku and Shin\'s forces. Sure, they would look more appropriate in a PS3 video game, but the CGI is far more fitting for a mech given how metallic they all look now, like the kickass Lancelot. Sure, the action directing still needs work, but everything, including the looks and effects of geass, is a major step up from before. Still doesn\'t beat the original series, but hey, it\'s still better than what came before, including the CGI in the first half of the film.There\'s a surprising number of new songs in the first 40 minutes, and they work much better and are more varied than the other ones. Unfortunately, we still have to put up with the other generic tracks and the generic ED, and even the new tracks don\'t stick out, but there\'s at least some flavor coming from these new tracks, flavor that actually fits, unlike the flaring trumpets track. It\'s a step up here as well, and I hope to hear more interesting tracks from this sub-series in the future, especially since it makes the OST actually have its own identity for once instead of just sounding like a lamer version of the main series\' OSTs.I wonder why people call this film worse than the other two and the start of Akito\'s decline. It\'s not much worse than the awful second film in terms of writing, and there\'s actually a sense of charm here, even if most of it came from unintentional hilarity. Is it because the first half felt weird and out of place? Perhaps, but it at least had characters actually doing things and actually trying to get more fleshed out. Is it because it\'s boring? I\'d disagree and say that the first film is far more boring, but hey, opinions. However, you can\'t really say the series is starting to get dumb since it has always made absolutely no sense, especially during the second film. It\'s just that the ball of suck keeps rolling, even if this time around, it manages to be enjoyably terrible. Plus, the CGI and music improved, and there is actually a lot of character animation. Perhaps an in-depth discussion can lend me some insight, but for now, this is as entertaining as this sub-series has been so far, quality notwithstanding. with. All of the same problems (except bad CGI because it\'s improved here) are on full display, like dumb character decisions, poor usage of Geass in terms of justifying it and how it works, edgy writing and MC, and bland characters (though the main protagonists are far less dull here). However, the writer managed to become even dumber than before which is quite an accomplishment, and the pacing really ruins itself.Absolutely nothing makes sense in this movie. Somehow, our military protagonists get financially locked out and unable to get into their military building and then a group of old ladies tries to hustle the group, and then the group works for them for a while. We don\'t know how we got to this point. We also learn plenty of backstories, like for Akito, Leila, and that one scientist lady who keeps her lover in some kind of stasis in hopes of him recovering, however, each of these backstories is rushed beyond belief, making it hard to process them. The pacing of this movie is terrible because of that; things rarely get to breathe and flesh themselves out properly. We then see Julius, Shin, SpinZaku, and others coming together, and then Julius enacts his fake terrorism plan, and it works. After a game of chess against Shin, we see him flip out after saying ""your majesty"" because somehow that triggers his actual memories as Lelouch now despite him saying it a lot beforehand.

Well it\'s definitely a filler... but at least it serves its purpose in giving the characters more development.  We get to see how they interact and how they\'ve changed from past episodes. And it\'s not entirely a filler, no, that\'d be a waste of a one-hour episode series. This episode continues the mystery of Code Geass; unlike the first, this is about the mysteriousness of Geass and not about the changing of the world by our characters.  What is Geass? Who are they that wield the power to take and...give to the humans of this world? This is what I like best about Boukoku no Akito.Story: 9The story continues with the refreshment of our wZERO squad, who are taking a little, well-deserved break from fighting behind enemy lines.  Though their break is short-lived, at least we got to see the characters in happy mode. But it also continues, as I like to say again, the mysteriousness of Geass.  What is Leila\'s Geass power? How and what did General Smilas do to upset the Order? Why did Shin murder his ""family""? And, the biggest question of all, how did Shin Shaing obtain his power?Art: 10Art is the same as ever by CLAMP, but everything looks much smoother than the original, which I must admire because this is 2015 after all.Sound/Music: 9The sounds are amazing, but the music is kind of questionable.  The jazz-like music playing during the fights sounds hilarious but it somehow resonates with the chaotic speed at which the battles progress.  I get hyped up from watching the battles as they are, by far, the best 3D CG animated battles I\'ve seen in anime so far.  However, there is none of that; instead we get music that fits these nomadic people (I forgot the name for them xP)Characters: 8Akito - still a psychopath hell-bent on killing and suicide, but at least he is changing little by little with Leila\'s influence. Leila - the innocent commander and, lo and behold, rich-girl-who-can\'t-do-chores-for-shit.  The trio of juveniles - actually quite nice kids after they\'ve opened up, after realizing that there\'s someone else with a more twisted history than them who is facing it alone, though it\'s slightly unrealistic how they did a near-180 after the 2nd episode.  At least we got to see them as who they are when they\'re having fun (FOR ONCE).Enjoyment: 10I\'d have to say that this was an enjoyable episode; it\'s a good break from the fast-paced mecha action the first 2 episodes had.  Though there is a little bit of action, it\'s toned down far enough to level with the calmness of the episode.  Lelouch\'s rousing the European people into rioting  was very nicely done; it seemed realistic enough to be applicable.  There\'s none of the loud jazz-like action music in this episode.Overall: 9Some minor flaws to make it the perfect episode, but then again, perfection is hard to achieve.  Also, you CAN\'T compare this to the original Code Geass because Boukoku no Akito takes a completely different approach to the series; instead of the typical boy-meets-girl-and-gains-superpowers, its about a boy-trying-to-reconcile-with-his-past, more similar to Ranpo Kitan.  And I\'d like to say that Ranpo Kitan pales when compared to this OAV series (Who the hell was the main character in that show again, Kobayashi or Akechi?).   This series has been great so far. give to the humans of this world?

This series has been great so far.', ""Well, it's starting to get worse. Maybe i'm just a little burned out when it comes to the Code Geass franchise by now, but this wasn't exactly great. Mind you, none of the previous movies were, but still, the 3rd installment is the worst so far. However, i am almost done with all of it, so i am going to pull through now, my mind is set, so let's talk about what i didn't like and what i liked about the third Akito the exiled movie.Story: It starts stupid. Like, really, really dumb. Our heroes are broke, cause some idiot in the european army...wants to get back at leila and then they get scammed into working for a bunch of old gypsys. Now the question i asked myself the whole time is: Why are they doing that? Just tell them off, don't do...that. Hell, they literally molest both Ayano and Ryo. Yeah, those are our heroic soldiers, what a great statement for the protagonists. At least Akito doesn't participate in all of the madness, but he still gets dressed up and follows their orders. Again, why? Clumsy Leila is kinda cute, but that's such a cliche by now, the sheltered rich girl. The rest of the movie is a subplot handling Lelouch and Suzaku and our main antogonist, Shin. That was okay, everything involving Lelouch is always an upgrade. That's really it though, there is some Geass-stuff as well, but this is all we get. I am not satisfied with that, especially since i don't even like the resolution so far to Lelouchs story. This can only be a 4, no matter how hard i try to find something redeeming.Art: Nothing new here. I got my Lancelot fight (superhuman Suzaku still makes no sense, but whatever, anime) and that was pretty good. The fanservice is getting really overboard, maybe someone can explain to me why Ayano pulls the zipper of her already revealing, skintight suit to to her belly-button. That wasn't a negative point though, quite the opposite, heh.Sound: More of the same, however! I will add one point for lelouchs voice, what a great man.Character: Lelouch and Suzaku, even some C.C. That's it, moving on. Nah, just kidding, but those three certainly help. In setting up the antagonist for example, that one is actually threatening and absolutely ruthless, i guess that's what you want from a villain. Well, a motive would be nice too, but that's probably coming up. I hope so. To the protagonists, i can once again only talk about the attractive females. Do you see what that implies? That they are boring, really, especially Akito. He's Sasuke, that's all he is, it's lame. So i just stare at their bodies and these movies are very generous with showing them, so it all works out. Not really, it could be better, but then again Lelouch. I´ll keep the seven.Enjoyment: The start made me a little angry, other then that, i enjoyed it as much as the previous movies. But the beginning annoyed me so much, that it costs two points for this category.So what can i say at the end? Something clever? Hah, no, you're wrong here if this is what you seek. I still want to see the remaining two movies, but i start to think that there will never be any satisfying resolution. So i watch it for the booties. I don't, i'm not that much of a degenerate. Ugh, what is happening to these reviews, i need a timeout. Only two more...only two more. And then we'll see what's next. Something really good would be nice, i just want to fanboy all over a show, that could be fun.

Edomae Elf,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52081/Edomae_Elf,"['Otaku Elf is an anime about an otaku elf. That\'s the anime and you must remember it. My favorite part was when the main heroine, Elda, was an otaku.But in all seriousness, a concept of an elf getting isekai\'d into our world and turning into an otaku is quite fresh, and the fact that she\'s pretty much being ""worshipped"" here just makes this show 3x funnier to me.You see, Elf is a long-aged creature, the total opposite of human that is short-lived and fragile, that\'s why in most literature Elf is often depicted as a very closed species and prefer to not interact or share...intimacy with other species because of the burden of losing your love one is just that hard, imagine keep being young while your love one starts getting older and older and older and older until eventually, they died, now imagine being an elf transported into a world where you can outlived 20 generations, one generation appears, they grow old, and then they die, another one appears, they grow old and they die again while you are still as young as you were, Elda choice to become an otaku and a shut-in is not only realistic but also understandable,nobody wanna gone through that.This anime is very good at covering those heavy aspects about the consequences of being immortal,it can go all tear-jerking drama mode if they want to but they prefer going on the comedy route while teasing this part at some point and i do get a good laugh,it\'s like a calm before the storm,it\'s sousou no frieren if you want more laughing and less crying.Also wanna give a shoutout to the characters design,i really love Elda and her cutesy demeanor,the way her ear wiggle if she feels happy,her voice that is as smooth as silk that she literally scream in lowercase,her interaction with koito and the others is just so adorable.So give it a try if you are into watching cute and adorable elf being adorable. intimacy with other species because of the burden of losing your love one is just that hard, imagine keep being young while your love one starts getting older and older and older and older until eventually, they died, now imagine being an elf transported into a world where you can outlived 20 generations, one generation appears, they grow old, and then they die, another one appears, they grow old and they die again while you are still as young as you were, Elda choice to become an otaku and a shut-in is not only realistic but also understandable,nobody wanna gone through that.This anime is very good at covering those heavy aspects about the consequences of being immortal,it can go all tear-jerking drama mode if they want to but they prefer going on the comedy route while teasing this part at some point and i do get a good laugh,it\'s like a calm before the storm,it\'s sousou no frieren if you want more laughing and less crying.Also wanna give a shoutout to the characters design,i really love Elda and her cutesy demeanor,the way her ear wiggle if she feels happy,her voice that is as smooth as silk that she literally scream in lowercase,her interaction with koito and the others is just so adorable.So give it a try if you are into watching cute and adorable elf being adorable.', 'Edomae Elf was one of my biggest surprises this season. I initially included it in my top 10 new shows to watch video based off a solid first episode, but I did not think I would end up liking it nearly as much as I do. Hilarious, wholesome, fun and surprisingly educational. A unique experience.I’m convinced that the author wanted to write a history manga, but probably thought he couldn’t sell enough copies with just that, so he added a cute elf waifu and other cute girls. I mean, seriously, there is a lot of genuinely informative information in this show about Edo era Japan...that I found so cool to learn about. There’s also a ton of Shinto religious history and cultural stuff in this show as well since it follows a literal shrine maiden. I don’t think we’ve seen anything like that before.Koito and Elda’s relationship is so sweet and I had a lot of fun watching them slowly come to understand each other better. Koito has only recently taken over as shrine maiden, so she’s still establishing that connection with Elda who is the goddess of the shrine. It makes for a really interesting dynamic as we see them go through traditional rituals, as well as dealing with Elda’s otaku habits. What really stuck with me was seeing Elda gradually opening up her heart to Koito. Given she’s an elf, she obviously lives way longer than humans. But Koito is one of the first people she’s truly connected with and felt close with. Their slice of life adventures were a blast to watch. I will miss that a lot.Comedy really landed for me too. There’s a lot of pop culture references, usually with slightly different names for copyright reasons. But, seeing Elda play games, collect figures and all other manner of otaku merch was awesome.There’s a ton of modern Japanese cultural information in this as well as the historical stuff. Particularly as it relates to Japanese regional cuisine. Had a lot of fun learning about local dishes and delicacies. Honestly, the whole show felt like it could have been made by the Japanese tourism board, which I have absolutely no problem with.This was just such a wholesome and fun watch that made me end every Friday afternoon with a smile on my face. I think it’s a must watch for fans of Japanese culture, history or general slice of life fans. It’s just a nice relaxing watch that we need more of these days.Edomae elf gets 9 out of 10. that I found so cool to learn about.

Any kind of blessing will do, so as long as you do your job as a deity!""A love letter to Otakuism, and in the same but different vein as the show that aired next to each other, mangaka Akihiko Higuchi\'s Edomae Elf a.k.a Otaku Elf can be regarded as being the better show (as compared to Mahou Shoujo Magical Destroyers) when...it comes to Otaku culture, fusing both tradition and modern values into a trivia-like enjoyment that otherwise is a rather unique take and is something that has not been done before in the last few years as a supernatural, fantasy comedy work.If you\'ve been to Japan before, the Land of the Rising Sun has no shortage of shrines no matter which city or town you go to visit to say: Pray for good luck, buy good luck charms, and hope that the gods will bless you in your favour even once in your life. What\'s not seen behind-the-scenes is the work of the Miko a.k.a shrine maidens, who work as hard as the job implies: to take care of the housekeeping and stuff like that, even more so with the goddesses and deities, and make sure that everything is in proper order. That is what the central characters are here for: Koito Koganei and her ""goddess"" Eldarie Irma Fanomene, or Elda for short. Both miko and goddess of Takamimi Shrine, located in the Tokyo Metropolitan area of Tsukushima in Chuo City, is a shrine with more than 400 years of rich history since the Edo period, but with a surprise twist: that the object of worship...is a recluse of a crazed Otaku. Therefore, the beautiful female elf, aged 621 years old, being reverse Isekai-ed into Earth over 400 years ago by the founder and first Shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu himself, became Takamimi Shrine\'s Hime-no-Mikoto ""deity""...that hilariously relapses into painful, but relatable comedy as she lazes around the shrine, engaging in the couch potato of the human life: eat (and drink Red Bull, proudly sponsored), sleep, play video games, watch anime, and repeat the process again and again, daily. And that adds to the detriment of her miko, the 16-year-old 15th generation shrine maiden, who has to bear her hardline Otaku idiosyncrasies day and night, fulfilling and opposing her whims as a useless goddess who has a pension for protecting all things Otaku-related, which initially fuels the anger between miko and goddess, only to then accept it as their way of life, because like-minded beings think alike, right...?Despite the hectic life between Miko and the goddess of the Takamimi Shrine, Koito is not alone, for her younger sister Koyuzu is well-endowed and mature given her unknown-but-young age, and within the Tsukushima neighbourhood of theirs, she is quite well known among the people over the local seafood market, more than a well-rounded, talented cook that Elda loves at first sight. And friends be friends in the growing-up stage of life, for Koito\'s best friend Koma Sakuraba is a ball of interesting and hilarity on her own, initially playing better to Elda\'s requests, and just being a good, nurtured friend at heart to Koito. For a miko that looks just as hard as she was both in school and at work, Koito has a good heart for the people too, thanks to Elda, who, despite her faults and her extreme shyness, is immensely popular in the local neighbourhood, mostly because of her unaging nature.Alas, both Miko and the goddess are not alone in their shrine endeavours, because there are others who share their heritage as well. There are warring factions over which side is the best, and that holds true for both Miko and the goddess Himawari Kohinata and Yordeilla Lila Fenomenea a.k.a Yord of the Hiromimi Shrine. The female dark elf who\'s a year older than Elda and (like her) summoned by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, instead, is the petite child that has the traits of extreme energy and has traversed far and wide across Japan...except that she has a bad sense of orientation that beckons the somewhat clueless Himawari to act as her mother figure of sorts. But the best is yet to come, for the 3rd miko and goddess pairing who hails from Uramimi Shrine: Isuzu Koimari and Hylaria Aira Mirarasta a.k.a Haira, is more out there as being risk takers in their own good and bad ways. Specifically, the girl who is the same age as Koito, is a famous influencer, of whom the former is a huge fan. But Haira is another goofball of an elf. As the one who\'s summoned by one of Oda Nobunaga\'s leading generals, Maeda Toshiie, at age 726, she\'s the Onee-chan/big sister character when compared to Elda and Yord as the oldest of the Isekai-ed elves, but if there is a taboo about Haira, it is that of the proposition to not give her any money, because she is a compulsive gambler. And despite Isuzu raking in her influence through the likes of people on social media, and often scolding Haira for her compulsive gambling behaviour, she is a big fan of Haira, who dresses eloquently to the amusement of the former, taking photos of her and spending all of her money to acquire her photos for books and bands of seemingly never-ending photo albums.As mentioned earlier in the review, there are subtle trivia-like stories of both the modern day and ""back in those times"" segments with Elda, explaining how people back in her time of the Edo period would have done things in their own fashion, which I thought helped to increase viewership, especially for those who are history buffs, and adds a sense of depth to the series. The show understands the importance of having ""endearing character dynamics and deeper themes"", with Elda not only living gaming, but having a ""deep sense of care for the community"" she cares for, with silliness grounded in characters that aren\'t ""one-off jokes"". I love it when works show the genuine side of characters feeling real and close to real life, there aren\'t many source works that emanate or imitate the way that only Otaku Elf can, and that to me, is a silent, but honourable W. <Insert Success Kid meme here>After working on what has been a successful streak of Isekai shows over the last 2 to 3 years, studio C2C has proven itself to be a powerhouse studio of capability, that provide them whatever variable genres of shows to adapt, and it will live up to its name of impeccable and great animation to boot. Though in the case of Otaku Elf, the hit-or-miss in-house director Takebumi Anzai is back after his stint of failure with Fall 2021\'s PuraOre! Pride of Orange and the somewhat interesting Spring 2019\'s Hitori Bocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu, his contributions are few, even against other well-known in-house directors like Shinji Ishihira (who directed Tensei Shitara Ken Deshita a.k.a Reincarnated as a Sword) and Toshiyuki Kubooka (who directed Majo no Tabitabi a.k.a Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina). Takebumi Anzai\'s job is very simple: adapt Akihiko Higuchi\'s manga series and follow it to a T. It\'s just that simple. Though there is that one episode (Episode 10) where the manga\'s extra (i.e. omake) content was added into the anime as an added bonus of sorts, and episode director Michita Shiraishi hit the sweet spot for me to give additional points to praise about the anime in general.The music is interesting, to say the least. Nanawo Akari\'s OP song ""Kien Romance"" has this Enka-like stylistic music personality to it that I feel is a great fit for the anime, and it\'s so infectiously good that it can become like a karaoke song for singalong sessions. The same goes likewise with Cody・Lee (李)\'s ED, which is more of a relaxing breather of sorts, rummaging within the grasps of the mix between 2D and the real-life inspiration scenery of the referenced Takamimi Shrine.Above it all, Edomae Elf a.k.a Otaku Elf is not a big series, so I\'d put it as the kind of show that goes under the radar, only for it to be an underrated hidden gem of sorts. Regardless, if you\'re looking for a comfy, chill pill of a time, this show would do you justice, blending both tradition and modern-day elements for a work that you just won\'t find anywhere else, even if you look hard enough.

It doesn\'t matter if the frame is focusing on Elda, Koito or other characters or how far they are, they are always extremely detailed. Of course Elda have a special treatment since she is heavily inspired by the beautiful elves from the Tolkien universe, but try to also pay attention to the other characters, their...eyes, hands, nails, hair, expressions, everything is done to perfection.Only if the drawing was the only thing that stands out. Elda is very interesting, funny and the whole idea of an otaku god fits perfectly with the concept of mighty immortal beings that basically didn\'t have much to do during the ages.

In short, the story is basically about the daily life of Koito (a shrine maiden - 'miko') and Elda (the deity of the shrine).The cool and different idea relies on Elda, which is an Elf and on top of that a recluse who is into Otaku-things.The problem is that they didn´t explore much of that uniqueness, and in the end the anime might end up just being 'another one' you will add to your list. For example: If Elda wasn´t an Elf, it wouldn´t change much except for the...psychological effect that instead of a human she´s an Elf - they ocassionaly and randomly talk about her past (Edo period etc) but it doesn´t add much. She being recluse is poorly explored as well - they just show she´s afraid of going out and of interaction with other people and that is basically it.-------- OTHERS:- The secondary / support characters are fine. Honorable mention to Yord  which made things more interesting and enjoyable to watch. Ah! There is Koito´s imouto (Koyuzu); the cute reliable imouto ^~^- The animation is good enough but where this anime shines most is its art, which is very pretty in my opinion.- Catchy OP music. As expected every seiyu did an amazing job, but honorable mention to Yord and specially Elda´s seiyu.CONCLUSION: An anime that had potential for more but its uniquness wasn´t fully explored, but it might have a few scenes here and then that you might enjoy, specially if you are looking for a chill / easy going anime. psychological effect that instead of a human she´s an Elf - they ocassionaly and randomly talk about her past (Edo period etc) but it doesn´t add much.

You are tired, exhausted, lonely, without any aim, hope, dream, passion in life, and you just want something to keep you company during those lonely hours. Edomae Elf is the show for you.The premise cannot be any more common: the daily life of an otaku from the eyes of those having to take care of her. There are three things Edomae Elf does different, however.1/ You have the cast. Your...otaku is now a 400 year-old elf who not only has excellent design and demeanor but play the Otaku part nicely and actually shows that unlike some beta-cuck who needs to be isekai-ed by truck-kun and blesses by some god to get better she actually does try, on her own willpower, to be a better person. You have your obligatory cast of supporting characters and main character who are female high school student because of course we are watching Japanese anime who are entertaining to watch and not some cookie-cutter cliche character.2/ You have the story. Sure, it is a slice of life about an otaku elf and her miko and there are some laughs throw in there, but some times the story can take a deeper turn with talks on how body-shaming can harm people's self-image and make them withdraw or how can being an immortal suck as you watch people fade away. Don't expect some Sousou no Frieren stuff in here; the show is for laugh, for you to feel comfy, not for you to wake up at 3:00 AM in the morning questioning your existence and the matter of the universe over another sleepless night.3/ You have the care that is put into the show. C2C studio is not a big studio and neither is Edomae Elf a big name, but the care they put into this show is something that rivals the major title out there. Every frame is not some fancy French New Wave but it is natural, beautiful, and gives a comfy vibe. The music, especially in the OP, is excellent. They also utilize our otaku elf's longevity and her 400 years in Japan to give us snippet into life in the Edo's period, and also shows us some insight into the life of a Miko. Is it accurate? Who the heck knows, I am no Japanologist. But I can say it gives some refreshment to the series.In short, it is a nice, comfy series that I can only see it getting better, especially with the short gyaru elf and a hot instagram-material elf being advertised in the OP. otaku is now a 400 year-old elf who not only has excellent design and demeanor but play the Otaku part nicely and actually shows that unlike some beta-cuck who needs to be isekai-ed by truck-kun and blesses by some god to get better she actually does try, on her own willpower, to be a better person.

The difference being this didn't just happen, she's been around for 400 years and is fully integrated into human culture... maybe too integrated even.The show instead explores other aspects that don't come up often in this kind of story.

She is immortal and has been around for centuries. She’s also a hikkikomori (shut-in). And an otaku. - Hence, the name Otaku Elf lolHas an amazingly relaxed vibe, and the characters are fleshed out and interact with each other in endearing ways. Elda’s hikkikomori tendencies aren’t also all just a personal quirk but partly a product of her seeing so much change, and so many people she cares about pass on - she’s an immortal after...allIt’s a slice of life - there’s no real story or anything apart spending time with the characters as they go through normal events in their daily lives. Fun events include Elda going to a restaurant, Elda going up a tall building even though she’s scared of heights.It also features rather detailed (to me, who’s not from the land of the Rising Sun) and interesting historical tangents about how various things like this or that (insert examples) got their names. As someone who is interested in Japanese culture but has had minimal exposure to it outside of anime and some video games, these are usually quite fun especially since Elda explains how each historical detail, say the messenger system used by the feudal lords, was a part of her life. and that’s usually to do something silly. like deliver tic-tac-toe game moves between her and the other Elf Goddess.This is an anime I came in with little to expectations. But it blew me away in how amazingly calm its vibe, setting and mood is. It has lazy, chilled yet enthusiastic energy, which grows on you, just like the characters.Some of the humour is genuinely funny. Most of it will cause you to chuckle or smile - at least it did for me. Watching this made me super relaxed…The animation is quite well-done, with the characters animated very well. Elda especially has beautiful character design as the titular otaku elf.The opening is amazing. It features a great singer with some Japanese instruments lending it a soothing tune that’s somehow catchy at the same time.In my own, admittedly super-limited and ultra-biased ranking system, I give it an 8 out of 10 for how fun and relaxing it was to watch.

The comedic timing is impeccable, with clever jokes and witty dialogue that had me in stitches. The characters are an absolute riot, each bringing their unique brand of humor to the table. The animation perfectly captures the exaggerated expressions and slapstick moments, amplifying the comedic impact. The absurd situations and hilarious misunderstandings kept me hooked, eagerly awaiting the next punchline. The voice acting deserves special mention, as the talented cast brings the humor to life with their impeccable delivery.

I enjoyed the characters with all their eccentricities. Any type of over-arching plot is basically non-existent, but having an awkward, shut-in elf, who got reverse-isekai\'d to Japan 600 years ago teach you history lessons about Japan during various periods from the past because she was there as a bystander is a nice little premise + having other elfs pop up here and there too is a great addition. I can\'t say that I found many of the random facts about history that she imparts to be too interesting personally, but there were a few I went, ""huh, that\'s kinda...neat."" The bits where Elda and Koito bond overly something silly like eating Monja were probably my favorite; there\'s a sentimentality to this series stemming from Elda\'s immortal, unchanging nature and seeing the ones you love grow older and die before your eyes that\'s similar to the vibe you get in Frieren and Maquia, but it didn\'t overshadow the comedy bits.

It would\'ve been easy just to have a series of zany 4koma-esque gags and make a funny enough series of shorts, the premise of a nerdy elf who\'d rather stay in and play video games certainly is funny enough for some solid comedy, but doing a full 24 minute episode you need a bit more and the show has plenty of connective tissue in between the gags to make it worthwhile.Going one layer deeper than the basic gag is the characters themselves. The show is mostly centered on the elf and her keeper, and the...two have a great give and take that not only works well in comedic scenes, but also plays into their deeper friendship beautifully. There are a handful of side characters who add some flavor, including other elves and their keepers who have great personalities, and some human friends who I wish we saw more of but all have their own interesting personalities. Similar to ""And Yet the Town Moves"", this is also a great show that does a nice job showing a tight-knit community and how those communal bonds can make a group stronger, even if nobody outside the shrine really seems to notice how strange their deity really is. The show never goes to full-on tearjerker mode, but there are these really nice subtle melancholy moments stemming from the fact that Elda is immortal but the friends around her aren\'t and it adds depth to her relationships with everyone.Then even deeper you have what may be the true purpose of the show: stealth edutainment. Elda came into the ""real world"" in the Edo period, and frequently relates aspects of the culture of that time to the problem she\'s facing in the current day. You learn a surprising amount about the history of consumer products and services, along with social trends. My favorite thing I learned is the Emperor really liked outlawing things that were fun and then the citizens would basically find a way to cheese the law and get around it. Good job Edo-Period Japanese people for not letting the man get you down! The history bits are a ton of fun, they remind me of Wilson from Home Improvement telling Tim about some ancient thing, or Tito\'s ""as the ancient Hawaiians used to say"" bits on rocket power.The production value is also excellent. You don\'t always get amazing visuals from Slice of Life shows barring stuff like DIY or Bocchi, and this show makes it\'s way into the pantheon of SoL\'s that are a cut above visually. There\'s clear effort put into the artwork and character designs and it\'s not just the standard copy-paste template you tend to see on cheaper productions. Close-ups and facial expressions have a ton of great detail, and the flashback history lessons have their own oldschool historical style that looks great. Beautiful colors and linework abound, and there\'s even some cool mixed-media stuff going on in the outro (both the intro and outro songs are also bangers). The VA\'s also nail it and Elda\'s airy, whispy, delivery is always comic gold.This is just a good solid show that works at every level, the jokes land, the characters are great, and it gets you to care all while tricking you into learning something.

And which may lead to my unconsciousness in skipping Otaku Elf until I didn't & changed my mind a week ago or so. The animation quality is great, not to mention the scriptwriting doesn't feel repetitive or boring.Otaku Elf is like any iyashikei series which involves the main characters of this subgenre doing the best they can to make each day worth living for. The exception...is that there is some solemn moments involving Elda being an immortal elf who can exceed a human's lifespan for a thousand years at least. Fortunately, this kind of subtlety didn't create mood whiplash as we can see her miko partner Koito being uplifting in helping & lecturing Elda about her duties as a deity. I love how this being an obvious tourism advertisement of Tsukishima in Chuo, Tokyo wasn't written like a blatant ad and the Edo era's history educational stuff is a plus for non-Japanese who would like to visit this place that soon.What's more is the experience of a comfort feeling watching two female protagonists form a deep friendship day by day despite each of them having a different lifespan. I also get to see the supporting characters being able to carry the series with their various personalities from cheeky and quirky to clumsy and lovely. I'm glad these kind of supporting characters were able to make me feel that they're much important as the main characters going about their daily lives.To sum up, if you want to watch a non-human character acting out human emotions in a cute, heartwarming way along with supporting characters that don't feel like they're written in this story just for the sake of acting as support to the main characters, then Otaku Elf should be your immediate watch that hopefully cleanse your whole self from today's reality without romanticised self-centred escapism (which is unfortunately prominent in male-lead stories) & wholesome moments being genuine to your heart. is that there is some solemn moments involving Elda being an immortal elf who can exceed a human's lifespan for a thousand years at least.

Beginning with the story, it is founded on a rock-solid concept- a Shinto shrine in a particular spot in Tokyo is dedicated to its resident elf, summoned in the Edo period, who has always been a bit of a shut-in, but has long since become a hardcore otaku as well. It unfolds in a decidedly episodic manner, a lot of the...time packing in 2 brief story arcs into a single episode. I think this format really works for Otaku Elf, and highlights the general vibe of what daily life with this eccentric immortal would be like, especially when contrasted with and complimented by the people around her. Though, the strong start spent capturing the atmosphere of otakudom doesn't carry through past the beginning of the anime, the rest of the show spent focusing more on Edo history than otaku culture. It was fun, and I even learned a couple things, but it's just not quite what I was expecting. One anticipates more otaku themes in a show titled Otaku Elf, after all. There's not much else to say about the story, as it sticks with this formula and executes it in a strong way from start to finish, never feeling rushed or bogged-down. Even beyond my personal feelings as a fan of the episodic format, it's just a great fit for this anime in particular, even sprinkling in some minor dramatic and philosophical points in regards to immortality and sacred duty. However, it is the art which is the strongest aspect of this anime. It is clean, characteristic, colorful, and energetic throughout. From the smooth animation to the vibrant color palate, it is everything a slice of life art style should be, especially one which deals with the everyday aesthetics of a Shinto religious space. It really strikes a balance in depicting a sacred place in a casual way, which manages to be simultaneously striking in its contrast and familiar in its approach. There's even a blend of 2D and 3D animation in the outro, where the characters have been superimposed over a real replica of the room in which the elf Elda resides, bringing to life items specific to the show, like her collection of frog and tadpole themed minis, and the stickers on her laptop. Though, my favorite part of the art is the character design, which is very distinct and visually engaging from start to finish, with an attention to detail, animation fluidity, and application of facial expressiveness which one would typically expect from an anime movie, not a show. The sound meets all standards of quality, not really standing out, save for the banger OP. The characters are a perfect fit for the show they're in, remaining simple and enjoyable without feeling empty or contrived. My favorites among them are easily the main duo, Elda and Koito, as their odd relationship as venerated deity and everyday shrine maiden builds up the two of them through their unique relationship with one another- the awkward and nerdy Elda learns to rise to her station as a pillar of the community and someone her friends can depend on, while the determined and maturity-obsessed Koito learns to take life one day at a time, and enjoy being in the moment with the people who make up her life. Overall, it is clear a lot of love went in to Otaku Elf, and the people who worked on it must have had a lot of fun, which is a fact that shines throughout this show. Definitely give it a watch as a solid slice of life, even if it has fewer otaku elements than you might initially expect going in. time packing in 2 brief story arcs into a single episode.

The anime continues to be absolutely funny; never dull or boring and in my case, kept me from falling asleep after some busy days! The gang continues to fit into their personalities quite well and they're still a blast to watch.Mint and Milfuelle continue to be my favorites of the show, but recently Vanilla has become a star to me. The third season sees a lot more screen time for Vanilla with some episodes dedicated to her, as...such, it really makes her a great character, even if she almost never talks. Ranpha and Forte continue to be the two bad asses of the anime and they're always funny to watch, especially when Mint, Ranpha and Forte get into competitions revolving around lost artifacts or events going on in the universe.The sci-fi aspect of Galaxy Angel is down-right brilliant. It's not deep, is never really explained and has no true purpose aside from having Galaxy Angel take place in an environment that isn't school related. I feel like it works really well too, because so much slice of life is about that high school experience and no offence to all the SoL that do use schools, I love them very much, but a new environment is needed once in a while. (I still love all you animes in school, I really really do (Don't get mad at me)).Lost Technology plays a bigger role this season, though how we obtain the Lost Technology is typically never showed, instead we're almost always shown how the Galaxy Angel solves the problems set in place by Lost Technology and just about every single scenario we witness is fantastic. Glad to see Lost Technology play a more upfront role.Music and sound wise: The OP and ED's used might be my favorite of the 3 seasons I've seen thus far and even though the music and ambient sounds and back ground sounds definitely give off a 90's vibe, it totally works, even if they're recycled a bit.Once again we see the trend of 90%-95% comedic and outright laugh out loud funny episodes in a beautiful episodic format, the other 5%-10% is filled with some serious and more intense episodes. The way these episodes feel and are shown to us is so different from the comedic stuff, it's a little crazy. I still feel that having the serious or darker based episodes (Darker compared to the light and fluffy that GA already gives us) is 100% incredible to do. The stark contrast can really give the viewer a huge adrenaline rush with a good story or great character roles and even though the episodes last 22 minutes or so, you feel more connected and involved whilst watching these types of episodes.I feel as if Galaxy Angel AA might be my favorite season thus far, I love the OP and ED. I love the wild and crazy episodes we get to witness. I love the character progression and the focuses on Milfuelle and Vanilla. I love the better focus of Lost Technology too.I guess the only thing I don't like about AA is the inclusion of the Twin Stars Brigade. The two kids aren't bad at all and in most cases can be really funny, I just wasn't expecting Galaxy Angel to cut some focus time away from the Angel Brigade. Even with the Twin Stars, I can't give Galaxy Angel AA any less than a 10/10, fantastic season for sure. such, it really makes her a great character, even if she almost never talks.

The third season of Galaxy Angel is continuing with the quality bar set by the second season, which means it's great. It's still the same Galaxy Angel, which means the same show with no real story. Our heroes are still looking for some vague Lost Technology and that's about it. Every episode is different and they don't rely on each other. Every episode is independent. It could be described as slice of life. Slice of life from space. If you are looking for some mindblowing story, well, this is not the animeme for you. But if you're looking for something very...fun, brainless and enjoyable, well, look no further. I think the last time I had this much fun watching anime was few years ago.Characters are the same as you know from the first and second season. And they are still as lovely as ever. All of them are great, there is not a single character that would suck. They are all very different, with different personalities, but they fit together PERFECTLY. I gotta say, my favorite character is still Mint.What I found kinda funny was the fact that they introduced few new characters in this season, but then I got the feeling they realised they kinda sucked, so they really weren't in most of the episodes. So if you're not that happy with the first episode where they are introduced, like I was, just keep watching, they will disappear eventually, I promise!The music and sound is excellent, as is always the case with things produced by Broccoli. I especially loved the second ending. It always felt like the great end of the alcoholic night. The song used in second ending and its atmosphere is so... celebratory. Animation and thing in second ending is really simple, when you think about it, but it works very well. I can imagine watching it on New Year night.I loved the art. It felt kinda old school, but in a good way. It looks like very solid, older anime. Anyway, to summarize this - I recommend this anime and you should definitely watch it if you need some cute, funny no-brainer. And I enjoyed this season so much, I am not afraid to rate it as masterpiece. fun, brainless and enjoyable, well, look no further.

And that includes the Galaxy Angel franchise, which I have talked about before, twice. This time around, we\'re looking at the third series. This one aired from late 2002 to early 2003 with each episode containing two separate acts, except for the last one which I\'ll definitely get into. Let\'s dive right in.Story:We open with the Angel Brigade having gone their separate ways and Commander Volcott having to get them back together to rival the newly formed Twin Star unit and save his job. It\'s the same as the other instalments...in the franchise in that the episodes quickly become only loosely connected and all have their own little comedic arcs and gimmicks.I actually have the same issue with this series as I have with the previous two. Except that its actually worse in this. Instead of one random serious episode that sucks, there are three random serious episodes, including the double-lengthed finale. There\'s one where Ranpha encounters a hologram on a tragic voyage (38). One where Milfeulle has to persuade a depressed veteran to abandon his old post before the planet is destroyed (42) and the finale where the group uncovers a tragic, old case that could lead to disaster. None of these episodes are funny nor are they trying to be. Its almost like there are writers on the staff who really want to prove that they could do serious sci-fi. The problem is that the characters and scenario as a whole aren\'t designed for serious sci-fi. They\'re quirky and hilarious. The serious episodes are just out of place and fall completely flat. This is also the first instalment that has a comedic episode that isn\'t really funny. Basically, there\'s an episode based off of the old legend about Princess Kaguya being found in the bamboo stalk but the ""humour"" is all based around the Angels going baby crazy and becoming obnoxious mothers. You know the type, the ones who think they can do whatever they want because they\'re mothers and everyone hates them. It\'s honestly a pretty annoying episode.With all that being said, this series does have some of the funniest episodes in the franchise thus far. The one where they get turned into children, the one where they\'re dangling from a cliff, the one where Ranpha sets them up on a group date, the one where Milfeulle dimension hops, Vanilla getting a love letter, having to play shiritori to save the universe, the one where they lampoon super sentai shows. All of those episodes stand out as exceptionally hilarious. Which does mitigate the damage caused by those serious episodes and the one comedic one that falls short.Characters:All our old favourites return and they\'re just as hilarious as ever. They also continue to mesh perfectly for comedic purposes. The addition of the twins, Malibu & Cocomo along with their commanding officer, Mary, actually works really well. The writers do a good job of integrating them into the dynamic and finding niches for them to fill that provide for enhanced comedic opportunities. It also helps that they only get used when they enhance the comedy. Like that aforementioned episode where the Angel brigade gets turned into children.Art:The anime looks pretty good. There are some strong visual gags, the designs are good and the animation flows pretty nicely. Like with the previous series, the comedic shifts might be overdone for some people but I maintain that they suit the comedy.Sound:I\'ve already talked about how good the main cast is and they\'re still really good. But let\'s talk a bit about the people who voice our new secondary characters. We have Ohara Sayaka, Saeki Tomo & Sanpei Yuko. All three of them perform their roles really well and bring a lot of energy to their performances. One thing every person in the cast, old and new, excels at is knowing when to be more subdued and when to get a bit exaggerated. I also really love the music. The theme tunes are goofy, well composed and wonderfully performed. The one good part of Final Dish Rebecca is the song, In the Chaos. I\'d still suggest skipping the episode, but look up the song for certain.Ho-yay:There\'s a little bit. The series has the occasional scene that reads as having a touch of les-yay, just like the previous series. And like them it\'s nothing too substantial.Areas of Improvement:1. Stop with the serious episodes. Having an hour worth of serious episodes really doesn\'t work in a series with twelve hours worth of absurdist zany comedy. Especially in a series like this where the characters regularly die for comedic pay off. The tonal shift is too awkward.2. If you\'re going to have an episode where parenting is a key part of the humour, actually find something comedic about parenting first. Don\'t just make your characters act like the worst type of entitled parent.3. Don\'t end your zany comedy series with a serious episode. Frankly, having serious episodes at all doesn\'t work, but it\'s particularly egregious to make one the finale.Final Thoughts:This isn\'t as good as the second series. The one failed comedic episode and multiple serious episodes do drag it down a bit. That being said, it does have some exceptionally hilarious episodes and everything good about the franchise is still present in force. For fans of absurdist comedy, it\'s a must watch with all the weirdness and over the top goofiness you could ask for. But I would recommend skipping past Bamboo-Cutter Platter, Galactic Rose Tea, Sub-Zero Hot Hot Dog & Final Dish Rebecca. But check out the song, In the Chaos because it\'s amazing.

My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10.', 'This is going to be a short review.This is basically more of the same thing as in Galaxy Angel 1 and in Galaxy Angel Z. The difference is that this time episodes are even less connected with each other and the ""mysterious/serious episodes"" that were present in Galaxy Angel Z are next to non-existent (I think there was only one episode like that).Overall.. it is a gag comedy. Individual episodes share characters, but otherwise are not connected to each other, and can probably be viewed in any order. The show usually takes some sort of a strange idea and runs with it for the...duration of an episode (episodes are short - there are two stories per episode, meaning in 26 minute episode you\'ll have two unrelated 13 or so minute long episodes. Usually).The humor however is not exactly top notch, but isn\'t bad either. Which makes it a decent anime to kill time.Details below:Story: 5/10. There is a smaller number of serious episodes compared to galaxy Angel Z, so it is slightly worse in my opinion. The story isn\'t horrible, but it is centered around gags and silly ideas, so it doesn\'t take itself seriously to begin with. There\'s larger number of anime parodies, comparable to previous seasons, but overall it is more or less the same thing - a show that doesn\'t take itself seriously and is mostly about silly fun.It is worth mentioning that this time it is incredibly common for story lines fail to finish. Meaning you could have an episode that ends up with some sort of disastrous consequences, and in the next one, everything starts from the blank state, as if the previous story never happened. This is extremely common, which is why I say it is possible to watch this anime pretty much in any order.Art: 5/10: It is decent but those are budget series. Meaning overall it has low level of detail, and doesn\'t really excel in a visual department.Sound: 5/10: Music is okay. Same applies to voice acting. The music doesn\'t stand out.Character: 5/10: Those are gag characters that stick with their typical role, and do not try to do something beyond that. So, no significant character depth, just characters playing their parts. Still, for the comedy show they\'re believable enough.Enjoyment: 5/10 : I found it to be okay. It was not a very existing show, but it wasn\'t a horrible one. So I didn\'t hate it.Overall: 5/10: Worth a watch if you want to kill some time or to have some cheap lights. it is not a masterpiece level material, but it isn\'t bad either. duration of an episode (episodes are short - there are two stories per episode, meaning in 26 minute episode you\'ll have two unrelated 13 or so minute long episodes.

I would recommend watching this, because it's more like a 13th episode for the second season, if you're in for the fanservice, then you're differently going to love this, but if you're like me, a man of culture but also has interest in the plot, you could skip this as it has no ties to the main plot, but skipping an episode might end up in you having some regrets, because one day, you'll finish seeing all of the episodes, and probably want more, but there are no episodes left, so take this chance if you're comfortable, and have fun. before.- Art (7.5/10):With nothing fantastic about it, the same old art style and animation quality spanning this OVA.

This special focuses on capturing a lingerie thief who happens to be experimenting with forbidden rituals hilariously linked to the philosopher's stone. It's pretty much entirely ecchi with maybe 1% of action thrown in as well.Animation:The animation quality is on par with DxD New, which is to say it's already slightly dated. Lines are a bit blurry and everything is more or less drawn rather than generated....The characters are drawn identically to the parent show and, really, the only difference is the amount of fan-service based ecchi. This pretty much borders on suggestive hentai.Sound:The OVA uses the 2nd OP and ED from DxD New and the BGM, like the parent show, is completely forgettable. They pack a lot of characters into this OVA so expect a majority of the main VA cast to be present in this episode.Story:I pretty much summed it up in the introduction. The story isn't particularly great nor does it add anything to the franchise. The plot here is self-contained with fair rising action, climax, and resolution; but honestly, it's not to be taken seriously as the main focus is to shove breasts in your face.Character:Though we got many cameos here, there isn't any particular development per say, just a lot of different characters screaming as they are fondled, unclothed, or otherwise molested. I had forgotten how much of an open pervert Issei is.Value:Honestly speaking, this OVA perhaps has some entertainment value but otherwise adds very little to the franchise. Unless you find yourself in a desperate need of either DxD or something extremely ecchi yet not hentai, this is probably skippable. The characters are drawn identically to the parent show and, really, the only difference is the amount of fan-service based ecchi. This pretty much borders on suggestive hentai.Sound:The OVA uses the 2nd OP and ED from DxD New and the BGM, like the parent show, is completely forgettable. They pack a lot of characters into this OVA so expect a majority of the main VA cast to be present in this episode.Story:I pretty much summed it up in the introduction. The story isn't particularly great nor does it add anything to the franchise. The plot here is self-contained with fair rising action, climax, and resolution; but honestly, it's not to be taken seriously as the main focus is to shove breasts in your face.Character:Though we got many cameos here, there isn't any particular development per say, just a lot of different characters screaming as they are fondled, unclothed, or otherwise molested. I had forgotten how much of an open pervert Issei is.Value:Honestly speaking, this OVA perhaps has some entertainment value but otherwise adds very little to the franchise. Unless you find yourself in a desperate need of either DxD or something extremely ecchi yet not hentai, this is probably skippable.""]"

For we, at the Devil’s Factory, have a new affordable product! Introducing our newest breast enhancers, the \'D-Plant\'!...1) What is the \'D-Plant\'?– The \'D-Plant\' is a crossbreed between a dragon and an insectivorous plant, it’s 100% organic and contains no chemical preservatives. Unlike most plants, this plant grows a unique fruit shaped like a breast, this breast fruit, if eaten, enhances and increases the bust size of any woman, regardless of how small they were before.2) Who discovered this plant?– That is an excellent question. This plant was first created by a crazy devil scientist named Maverick. But, then he got arrested and let the creature go free. Then, a boob-loving man named Issei and his group of sexy demon woman (with another guy), encounter this \'horrible\' plant. Issei sympathizes with the plant because it wants the world fulled with large-breast women and wants to save it, but the girl don\'t really like perverted animals or objects and destroy it. But, we, at the devil\'s factory, managed to recreate it. So, please enjoy this excellent plant.3) What does it eat? And how do I feed it?– This plant doesn’t require any water or sunlight. In fact, you don’t need to feed it. It feeds on you! Now, don’t be discouraged, it doesn’t eat you, but rather it sucks on one\'s breast, draining the spiritual energy from your body. At first, you may feel tired, but after a few weeks, you will regain your strength and much more. Furthermore, you may ‘feel’ a tingly pleasure from having your breast stimulated. This is intended to put the owner in a euphoric state, while feeding the plant. Overall, it’s a win-win for both you and the plant.4) Are there any risks to owning this plant?– Risks include: dangerous vines when being provoked, white liquid that dissolves one’s clothes (no skin damage), feeling of tiredness, being in a hypnosis state, and increased heaviness around the chest area.––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––If you aren’t convinced, here are the words of some previous customers:Customer A – “I used to be a size ‘AA’, but after eating the fruit, my bust size increased to a ‘D’!""Customer B – “I used to be insecure about having a small chest, but after owning the ‘D-Plant’, I became more confident!""––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Call now and we will give you our limited supply of Egyptian Clothing.

Ok, with that out of the way, this is an OVA, a short that expands on the original series, be it on the story, or character development, but seeing that the parent story had almost none of those, this is an expansion...of its glorious side, that resides on the hardcore fanservice.- Story (4.0/10):This OVA, that's told in 2 episodes are a very standalone tails that require no knowledge on the parent show, so even if you have not watched the show, you can probably still watching and enjoy this, it has no attachment to the plot whatsoever, and it's not a bad thing, these two episodes each tell a different story, so the production team must have to improvise a lot, and eventually came with the most stereotypical shounen episodes ever, Nothing to be memorable here really, aside from the yet extreme fanservice.- Art (8.0/10):Just as good as the main show, with the decent art style, and ideal female anatomy, the ridiculous breast physics are just as wild as ever, and the camera angles, 👌.- Sound (7.0/10):If it weren't for the shortness of this animation, the amazing soundtrack would have had some space to breathe, I'm deeply in love with the parent series' OST, too bad it wasn't used more often in here.The sound effects used here are surprisingly good, especially the ones simulating sexual contact.The voice acting was at it's best as well.- Character (4.0/10):Just as poor and flawed as the main story, it seems the production team didn't expand on the characters more, as they remain just as one dimensional as ever, most of them are just pure sexual reincarnation that has nothing to admire aside from their body bumps.- Enjoyment (8.5/10):I really enjoyed watching this despite its many flaws, it's like they understood what we really want from series such as these, nobody cares about the plot, or else we would have gone to better story driven shows, they just gave us our overdose of fanservice, with extra comedy.- Overall (6.3/10):This is originally a sequel to the first season and a prequel to the second, and as one might see them, they are respectively the 13th and 14th episodes from the 1st season, but watching them isn't necessary to grasp the “plot”, if you have time to spare and see some extra goofiness and extreme fanservice, then tag along. of its glorious side, that resides on the hardcore fanservice.- Story (4.0/10):This OVA, that's told in 2 episodes are a very standalone tails that require no knowledge on the parent show, so even if you have not watched the show, you can probably still watching and enjoy this, it has no attachment to the plot whatsoever, and it's not a bad thing, these two episodes each tell a different story, so the production team must have to improvise a lot, and eventually came with the most stereotypical shounen episodes ever, Nothing to be memorable here really, aside from the yet extreme fanservice.- Art (8.0/10):Just as good as the main show, with the decent art style, and ideal female anatomy, the ridiculous breast physics are just as wild as ever, and the camera angles, 👌.- Sound (7.0/10):If it weren't for the shortness of this animation, the amazing soundtrack would have had some space to breathe, I'm deeply in love with the parent series' OST, too bad it wasn't used more often in here.The sound effects used here are surprisingly good, especially the ones simulating sexual contact.The voice acting was at it's best as well.- Character (4.0/10):Just as poor and flawed as the main story, it seems the production team didn't expand on the characters more, as they remain just as one dimensional as ever, most of them are just pure sexual reincarnation that has nothing to admire aside from their body bumps.- Enjoyment (8.5/10):I really enjoyed watching this despite its many flaws, it's like they understood what we really want from series such as these, nobody cares about the plot, or else we would have gone to better story driven shows, they just gave us our overdose of fanservice, with extra comedy.- Overall (6.3/10):This is originally a sequel to the first season and a prequel to the second, and as one might see them, they are respectively the 13th and 14th episodes from the 1st season, but watching them isn't necessary to grasp the “plot”, if you have time to spare and see some extra goofiness and extreme fanservice, then tag along."", ""This two episode OVA consists of side stories that take place after the events of the first DxD season. The first episode centers around a mysterious tree that generates breast-shaped fruit that grants the (hopefully) female eater immediate, voluptuous proportions. The second episode follows Asia and Issei's training as they shadow the other peerage members' contract missions. The OVA doesn't contribute much in terms of advancing the core plot line; instead it focuses on delivering maximal fan service per second.

She was hit by a truck and was hospitalized, it is still a mystery to me how someone this small could be hit. That needs good aim lol. Anyways she comes back to school and as you might expect its not too good because of her shyness, her socials skills are low....Then she meets Yuushin who is uber tall and gets a seat next to him. He draws alot of attention which Hiyori does not like but later on that changes. The art and animation are pretty good and follow the manga well. My only complaint is that this is too short! It deserves a full series adaptation or atleast a movie. I hope they will make a sequel or another OVA of it in the future since the manga is up to like 8 chapters now. The characters remind me of Toradora! (lol at the locker scenes). Its great so if you like slice of life genre then check it out and you wont be disappointed.

As a huge fan of Kimi ni Todoke, I really did enjoy this short show.Hiyori's shyness is similar to Sawako's even though she seems a little less mature than Sawako.

I really liked that part of kimi ni todoke, so I enjoyed it in Hiyokoi too.The animation and character designs are cute. Cute things these days tend to turn ecchi, but again, like kimi ni todoke, it stays pretty.The male lead, Hirose, is like a less responsible version of...Kazyhaya. Their personalities are awfully similar though. Even their looks, expressions, and gestures all look alike.Unfortunately for this anime, it can only be compared to Kimi ni Todoke.I want more episodes too, but I think if it gets more and stays the same way, there will be too much comparison, which will only make this work look bad.But this gentle little episode is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Kimi ni Todoke.

She then meets Yuushin Hirose, a guy who is taller than the average guy height and is practically friends with everyone.  He attempts to make friends with her and eventually gets her to slightly overcome her shyness.I liked the anime of Hiyokoi because it was quite fun to watch.

There isn't too much difference making it an easy transition for those who are curious how the series goes.Essentially watching this was a nice breath of fresh air and makes me want...to try picking back up the manga series by starting it all-over again. Also if you liked this then I'm sure you'd like Lovely Complex as well.Hope everyone else were able to enjoy this OVA as much as I had.

Helck,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51020/Helck,"[""From a light-hearted comedy show with few action scenes to an amazing show with wonderful world building, characters, heavy backstories and one of the best voice acting roles I have ever heard in my life (Ma Shaa Allah). Welcome to the fantastic world of Helck.What I picked up as a comedy show due to what feels like a drought of good ones in months, turned out to actually be a very solid anime. An anime that started with a very unique premise of a hero trying to be a demon lord and the antic he faces along the way. From demons accepting him and others...feeling suspicious, I thought the anime would continue in that way but also felt from the first episode that there was more to it. More depth that I didn't expect to be this good.What I really loved about Helck is how the story unfolds. You start in a simple yet funny way and keep integrating more and more things in your story. You see the first villian of the series and who he really is. You get to meet the first demon you consider a friend and you go through very well-written world building that just happens naturally as the story goes on. It's a simple way of story telling yet that really was the key point to me in finding its charm.The characters were also amazing, from our main MC Helck to every other side character, each one is unique in the way they speak, interact and fight. The build up to the villians was also done well and the way they handled the plot twists for them was also great.Also, there is Piwi. If you want one reason that I would whole-heartedly recommend this it's him. It really has been so long since I loved a character so much to the point of wanting filler moments in the show to continue just to see more of him even if the episode was fire.PIWI is the GOAT.The art and animation were good but nothing too crazy. It got the point accross and it was the lowest part of the show imo but it appears the budget wasn't amazing so it was still very good to watch.I really loved the voice acting as well.For the parental advisory/religious section, there isn't really anything bad in it. Apart from some human evolving garbage, demons are good and the 2nd op having some heresy words in it, the anime is very clean and wonderfully made.If you still want more reasons, feel free to check my profile for a video on it.Overall, I would give Helck a 9/10. Could've been a 10/10 but the animation and things stated above made it a 9. Hoping for a second season any time soon.Would recommend it. feeling suspicious, I thought the anime would continue in that way but also felt from the first episode that there was more to it.

But not only that, there is more and more to come. As if it perfectly blends it's fun comedic elements, but then will hit you with a hard taste of reality, with a bit of serious edge about it, that'll make you wonder what on earth is going on, or what is truly going on. Making you want to know more and more about the series, and I'll say it. After seeing the first few episodes, you'll WANT to read the manga, as you'll want...to know what happens next, but it'll be such a good and enjoyable experience, that you'll want more of it.Story and characters: 8Really playing off the whole humans vs demons thing, but as if there is going to be more to it, the more you watch, the more you'll come to enjoy and expect. In context, Helck might seem silly, goofy, and stupid, because it mostly is. But as said at the start, you'll get the feeling there will be more to this then meets the eye, which will only draw up more and more interest. It's as if it has a core of goofy and silly nature, but then has that serious element that it's just waiting to drop, that'll either take the story in a different direction, or hook you at first, but then drag you along for the hell ride that it's gonna go on, and I cannot wait for more.If you love your fun and silly anime, that'll add more and more as it goes along, you for sure are going to enjoy this. It's good fun, and I'm on the edge of my seet, to see what happens next.To touch upon the characters, there is a wide mix, and you push them together, it makes up for a well balanced cast of characters. Not to mention the reflection of Helck to Vamirio. It's great. You can see so much personality expressed from the  two of them, through different means. Vamirio very open with how she feels, and you can tell she wants the best for the Demons, even through her rage and annoyance. While through Helck, you can see his entire personality through his happy go lucky laugh and actions alone. A real good complex, backed up with good side characters, that make it all a well balanced dish of a good cast of characters.Art and music: 8What I really love is like, just take the first episode into a spotlight. The high level of music, as if we're in an Opera, as if we're in some high end boss, and we're ready to throw hands. It's so well done, and gives off such a great feeling.With an OP that really matces the theme of the show and it's contents, making for a perfect blend. To match with not only a good and pleasing looking art style, but it really gets in depth and creative at points. Giving you a grand presentation on both fronts.Helck is such a welcome treat, that'll be more welcomed as it goes along, a hit for sure, and I'll be for sure, checking out the Manga when I can. I am stocked to be watching this, and you should be too. to know what happens next, but it'll be such a good and enjoyable experience, that you'll want more of it.Story and characters: 8Really playing off the whole humans vs demons thing, but as if there is going to be more to it, the more you watch, the more you'll come to enjoy and expect.

More people said it’s similar to I’m Quitting Heroing, so I guess I’m gonna watch that at some point for the sake of comparison or something.Another comparison that was made was with One Punch Man, and initially Helck does play out like a...comical take, though not necessarily a straight parody, of the typical fantasy and fighting shounen tournament arc. The plot revolves around a strong human dude that sides with demons and is suspected to be an infiltrator, in the silliest way possible, at least in the beginning.With one exception, every character acts stupidly, which combined with the superiority of the main character, allows the latter to go up his way in becoming the next demon lord quickly and easily.If you are a fan of the early episodes and the two, later on three, main characters interacting in silly ways and getting to know each other while interchanging little catchphrases between them, you might get bored or disappointed with the following events, which are an invasion from forcefully mutated humans, while for plot reasons the main characters are either stranded on an island, or go into flashback mode for a quarter of the season.If, like me, you prefer character exploration, and more or less serious stories, perhaps you might prefer that second half, as the backdrop and mysteries of the main and titular character are revealed and answered, along with the reasons for various characteristics of his, such as his smile, broken weapon, objective, dark power and stuff. Also, the dynamics between the two protagonists evolve as they open to one another and come to understand and trust each other.While the two main characters are taken away from the plot, and while the series is not in flashback mode, you also get to see other characters doing things, and showing more of their serious side, which they didn’t during the early episodes because comedy equals everyone acting like idiots. One of them plans and strategize, others take down enemies, one infiltrates, and in general is cool to see characters waging war with some sort of strategy and tactic instead of just brawn, at least until the powerful main characters can get back and wipe out every enemy with ease.The problem is that all of the above comes with the cost of sacrificing plot progression, as about a third or perhaps even half the series is spent on that, main characters introspecting while travelling, allowing the author to explore the setting, and supporting ones and antagonists fighting seemingly with no end.Speaking about the fighting, since the main characters are so powerful, the enemies are remarkably weaker for plot reasons, and the visuals are rather low budget, this is not really a series that you watch for the action, which is usually short, simple, one sided, low on stakes, and well, not very good looking, as Helck is a series that despite coming out in 2023, looks like it aired back in 2008. The artwork and the coloring, even though they don’t have very noticeable quality drops, look simple, outdated and lacking detail, the character designs are very simple, the backgrounds are ok, the motions are ok in the beginning but become worse later on as the artwork becomes better for some reason, and the special effects look even older and more outdated than everything else.The music is ok, generic but serviceable, the endings are two cute ballads, and I skipped each of the two openings every time because of how upbeat and unfitting they sounded to me. The sound effects and voice acting are ok as well, though I did not expect a second serious role from Tomokazu Sugita on a single season.What I didn’t expect from Helck was it being another one of those “humans are the real monsters” type of stories were we are the real bad guys even though actual monsters or in this case demons live in the same world. Regarding this point, the anime does a good job at times, showing more races than just humans or demons, and having some good and bad ones amongst them, or show some completely bad ones being like that because of the setting, which does a good job in exploring the world the story takes place in and builds up more mysteries.On the other hand there is a serious issue in its theme exploration, since even though several characters say that there are good and bad people everywhere, and humans wanting revenge on the demons for all the killings they did in the past, not a single bad demon is actually shown in the plot, while there are almost no good humans anywhere, while the ones that are shown go as far as killing their own kind for the sake of wiping out their enemies, with over the top, illogical and unbelievable actions, thus the message and theme come off as simple and one sided, as one side of the conflict is completely demonized while the other is completely victimized.Similar things happen with the other theme of conflict between classes, as the nobles are complete assholes and the real main villains behind everything, while the lower class are all good people and poor victims of the rich.There are no grays whatsoever in the themes, they are explored in a naïve, simpleminded, one sided and superficial way, so I guess they at least go well with the equally presented protagonist, but it would’ve been better for the show to remain a lighthearted comical adventure if its serious side would turn out like that.As for the characters as a whole, they are fine, definitely stronger than the simple, kind of weak, and slow moving plot, they become more memorable and are more fleshed out through flashbacks, which show how interconnected most of them are, while others show more of their characteristics, capabilities and come to accept others in a way as the series goes on.At the end of the day, I feel like you watch this for either the comedy, or the adventure, or the drama, definitely not the action, but not all the elements all together as one single whole, as it feels half-baked. The comedy gets replaced heavily by the drama, which doesn’t come in until half the series, and only after some really silly humor, so those who might prefer the second might not go through the early half to watch the latter. And the adventure is fine for showing the setting, it’s just that at the end of the day said setting it’s quite simple and generic, so it’s not like there is much nor very strong world building thanks to it anyways. The weakest aspect is for sure the plot, which is simple, illogical, slow moving, constantly stalled in one way or another, bad at exploring its themes, and remains incomplete.If you don’t like any of the above, you might still enjoy the show for its characters, but you’d have to power through the first half of it for that. Or well, you might not like anything in it because of the half-baked way every element is combined with the rest, so you just wasted your time with a 24 episodes series.Or maybe you are the definitely more rare type to enjoy the whole package.

Helck is a really great seinen fantasy-action show with some great comedic elements. It takes 1-2 episodes to get properly started as the tone is a bit more silly, but once it does it has a really consistent quality with a genuinely good story. The humans are genuinely villains here and the demons aren't really Christian demons as much as just another race. It's a great one. I read this ages ago and had wanted to re-read and forgot the name. It's great being able to experience this again...as an anime. And the voice acting is 100% on-point. as an anime. And the voice acting is 100% on-point."", 'I have to say, this was a complete surprise to me. I thought Zom 100 was going to be the only ray of hope in this otherwise pretty stale season compared to the last ones, but then Helck came along.The dynamic in the first episode was great and hooked me immediately. This continued throughout the next few episodes, when new elements start rapidly appearing out of nowhere and you start realizing that there\'s actual profundity to this. I continued until the latest episode and it did not disappoint. I immediately binged the relatively short manga afterwards and I have to say, it\'s amazing. One...potential criticism here is that after reading the manga I\'ve realized the anime is maybe a little too faithful to the manga, that doesn\'t make the experience any worse though.Animation-wise you\'ll have to bear with it a little. It\'s not Records of Ragnarok bad like some people have claimed, it\'s actually quite decent although admittedly lacking at times. Personally I didn\'t even notice until I payed closer attention. Just don\'t set your expectations too high, it\'s low-budget but I don\'t think that\'s a bad thing necessarily.I highly recommend you give at least the first three episodes a shot. It\'s a bit of a slow hitter with a slow start but it builds depth and suspense pretty quickly. Whether or not you\'ll enjoy the first few episodes will highly depend on you liking the humor. Don\'t think Helck is pure comedy because of this however, it pretends to be until it hits you with heavy hitting themes and depression later. I definetly get why there\'s such a passionate small community around it and I now consider myself part of it.I\'ve seen some people here criticize the focus on the plot rather the characters and I see where that\'s coming from, until Helck\'s backstory is introduced later, it does seem that way. Trust me though, seemingly inexplicable actions will start making sense then and there will much more depth in the cast.Overall Helck is at the least my second favourite anime this season and among my favourites this year. It is truly, and I am usually hesitant to use that label, criminally underrated. Don\'t be turned off because there\'s ""demon king"", ""hero"" and ""overpowered"" in the synopsys compared to your trashy isekai power fantasy (which are great in their own right) this is much more profound and not comparable in the least.Animation: 7/10Plot: 10/10Pacing: 9/10 (starts of slow, gets great pacing after 3rd episode or so)Humor (subjectively): 10/10Characters: 9/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 9/10 potential criticism here is that after reading the manga I\'ve realized the anime is maybe a little too faithful to the manga, that doesn\'t make the experience any worse though.Animation-wise you\'ll have to bear with it a little.

Think of Mashle, but with adults and proper traditional fantasy world of humans and demons.This is one of those anime that doesn't need reviews. The first episode is a great introduction and your time is better spent watching that instead of reading a long review. Thus, i shall be keeping this review short and crisp.1. comedy: Our MC Helck has ridiculous physical ability (similar to Mashle) and his ridiculous feats are the source of many gags. The voice acting of Vamirion is god tier and her frustrated scenes are hilarious in many scenes....2. Mystery: I would recommend people to just go watch it blind without spoiling yourselves. The story feels generic at first, but once you start introducing the mysteries, you can definitely feel that there is something much much darker lurking underneath this generic fantasy.  The setup is so cool that I kind of regret watching this weekly. I keep getting the urges to just binge the manga right now and not wait for the next episode.I would highly recommend giving this a chance. The first episode is a great intro, and if you are into action, definitely try watching until episode 4 where the story gets serious for the first time. 2.

Though after like 2 years of not watching anything and going through new shows this season, Helck really caught my attention. What can I say, its funny, well written, good animation. The whole package is just perfect. I just wanted to give this one a little shout out because it kind of pissed me off because of the low score, I thought this would be atleast in the #1000 rank. But yeah I really love this show and...I hope more people will find this show because it's actually pretty entertaining. 100/10 I hope more people will find this show because it's actually pretty entertaining. 100/10"", 'Although there are hints of a potentially serious story at the beginning, I almost disregarded \'Helck\' as a pointless comedy because let\'s be real, many anime waste their potential, such as Spy x Family who could be so much better just by ACTUALLY EXPLORING ITS PREMISE and having the characters work together. Disregarding \'Helck\' would have been a big mistake! A mistake a lot of people apparently made, but I\'m glad I stuck with it - very much so - because the story does get real!First, let\'s get the concise stuff out of the way.Art: 6/10, fine. Not much wrong with it, if any. Subjectively,...I disliked the design of quite a few side characters. Fortunately, I like the design of the main ones.Sound: 10/10 both good and immersive, which is a rarity these days, when we have things like season 4 of \'Attack on Titan\' with its hip hop tracks. Here, we\'re in a fantasy and we have traditional, fitting songs played on chronologically fitting instruments! Fantastic!The voice actress of Vermilio quickly became one of my 6 favorites of all time.Characters: 10/10 our crew is lovely, funny, and Helck has some badass moments! As for the enemies, they are mysterious and diverse in personalities! I can think of one even being non-Manichaean so far.Story: 9/10 it\'s an anime where it\'s right to give it credit at the start. The development isn\'t immediately in your face, at first it\'s subtle in parts and it\'s not known for a fact that the story will be developed, but I\'m here to assure you it is. And it\'s a touching story at that. There are two reasons I\'m not giving the maximum rating: the first is that the conclusion wasn\'t climactic enough and I don\'t know if things will be wrapped up well enough for a perfect rating. The second reason is so far, some stories are even better written, and giving \'Helck\' the same rating would be unfair to those superior ones, like \'Death Note\', \'Steins;Gate\' or \'Full Metal Alchemist\'. I\'m not one of those people who thinks ""I liked it, therefore 10/10"", no, the full scale exists for a reason and that matters in my opinion, so, 9/10 and that\'s a very good rating.Enjoyment: 10/10 I came for the comedy, it was good but I feared it would get stale, old. Fortunately, the comedy did not overstay its welcome and right before getting old (at least for me), the comedy decided to step back and let the story shine! And at that point, I stayed for the story and boy, was it fully worth it! Although the story has not been completed in season 1, it\'s the start of a potential masterpiece so far. The stopping point wasn\'t too shabby either!Overall: 9/10 so far, I really hope the anime gets completed at some point and that season 2 lives up to my expectations. It\'ll be harder because concluding a story nicely and climactically is hard. My 9/10 rating only concerns season 1 so far, but for a start, it\'s worth that rating to me so that\'s what I give. I disliked the design of quite a few side characters. Fortunately, I like the design of the main ones.Sound: 10/10 both good and immersive, which is a rarity these days, when we have things like season 4 of \'Attack on Titan\' with its hip hop tracks. Here, we\'re in a fantasy and we have traditional, fitting songs played on chronologically fitting instruments! Fantastic!The voice actress of Vermilio quickly became one of my 6 favorites of all time.Characters: 10/10 our crew is lovely, funny, and Helck has some badass moments! As for the enemies, they are mysterious and diverse in personalities! I can think of one even being non-Manichaean so far.Story: 9/10 it\'s an anime where it\'s right to give it credit at the start. The development isn\'t immediately in your face, at first it\'s subtle in parts and it\'s not known for a fact that the story will be developed, but I\'m here to assure you it is. And it\'s a touching story at that. There are two reasons I\'m not giving the maximum rating: the first is that the conclusion wasn\'t climactic enough and I don\'t know if things will be wrapped up well enough for a perfect rating. The second reason is so far, some stories are even better written, and giving \'Helck\' the same rating would be unfair to those superior ones, like \'Death Note\', \'Steins;Gate\' or \'Full Metal Alchemist\'.

There are some things it does well and others that are either meh or disappointing. But for the most part it's a ride worth taking.Probably the best 2 things about the anime are the characters and the story. Helck is a lovable guy that has that right combination of strong, caring, and troubled parts of his personality that make you want to root for him. Vermilion is a good contrast to him and it's fun to watch them interact and slowly come to understand each other. And even Piwi is someone that is fun compliment...to the team.The show starts out giving the impression that it's going to be all action and humor, but after a few episodes you start to see that there's a lot more going on related to Helck's past and the general conflict.

So many times there are characters that are flying in a way that can only be described as a jpeg being dragged across a background. It's especially noticeable when they are depicting enemy forces in huge numbers flying across that sky. While not awful, it can take you out of the action.Another weak element is that the dialogue can drag a bit, especially in the earlier episodes.

I think from episode 12 when Helck is talking about his past this became a much better anime and the next 6 episodes literally flew by. Idk what some people’s deal is, did they really want to see more of episode 1 and 2? Of Helck competing to be a demon lord? This plot adds sooo many more elements to the anime. It’s actually makes this a much deeper anime. It makes you feel the rage inside of Helck and it makes you understand why Anne was warned about what’s deep inside of Helck. At...first it makes you think oh it’s just because he tries to be such a positive guy who has to go through shitty situations and when you watch his past you really understand and feel it. I love isekai anime’s more than anything, but I love isekai anime’s that have make you feel deep emotions whether you want to or not. Like Rising of the Shield Hero season 1. But Naofumi wasn’t as strong as Helck who could fight against everything, which i understand why people liked it more. But this anime deserves more than a 7 rating. I was more lenient with giving it a 9 cause I want others to know there’s people that really enjoyed this anime. But in my honest opinion it’s a solid 8. Kinda upset the manga is only up to 12 volumes cause I wanted to read it after finishing the anime but I feel like there won’t be a lot of meat left and probably better off waiting a few months or maybe a year to allow the manga to continue to grow its storyline. I’m so glad that they decided to make this a 24 episode season, I’m sure this is prob the end and they won’t make another season but I’m content. first it makes you think oh it’s just because he tries to be such a positive guy who has to go through shitty situations and when you watch his past you really understand and feel it.

I don\'t think it\'s worth it to watch the 24 episodes while there\'s not a continuation out there to watch.All in all, Helck has a vibe similar to the old 2000\'s animes, which is really refreshing. You can see that in the art style and also in the type of comedy that is scattered here and there and softens the plot, which is actually surprisingly dark.Art style: amazing.Animation: really good, well-balanced fighting scenes.Plot: the main plot is surprisingly good, but it doesn\'t finish, and it\'s...interrupted countless times by side quests that make the pacing of the anime kinda boring. Basically if you survive all the fillers you will still be disappointed because the anime doesn\'t finish the main plot and there will be a lot of unanswered questions.Characters: Helck himself doesn\'t have a lot of character development, it\'s more like ""you get to know who he is throughout the anime"", while Vermillion/Anne has quite a lot of development as she changes her views on life due to her experiences with Helck. This is definitely a strong point of the anime.Overall: Mixed feelings because it feel pointless to watch an anime without an actual end, but if they launch a season 2 then it should be worth it to watch the whole thing. interrupted countless times by side quests that make the pacing of the anime kinda boring.

I went in blind and I thought Helck was just another generic overpowered fantasy MC, but his entire character is slowly revealed throughout the story which makes it interesting and avoids him becoming a stale overpowered generic MC. Helck can be funny, mysterious, and many many more, which we get to watch and unravel his relationship to the world the more it progresses.Really enjoyed how they didn’t shy away from really having good funny moments, to even revealing much darker moments whenever needed all throughout the story. I say it was balanced...all around and had a decently-paced story. Good for binge watching a 24 episode anime if you got a lot of time.Most of the characters are not one-sided and actually have some thought put into them when writing. Everything they do has a purpose to help the story and I think the events and reactions of the characters were mostly very reasonable and believable which got me hooked to the story a lot. Even if some of the characters are there for just comedic relief, I was entertained.For now, the story was “complete”. Most of the things I expected in a fantasy genre anime is well made here. Will definitely continue to read it in the manga now. all around and had a decently-paced story.

While that may sound like a typical tournament style action anime, it is far from it. The whole competition to become demon lord is less about serious battles and more about trying to uncover why Helck is participating in the tournament in the first place. There is a ton of great jokes and subversions of expectations,...with a lingering sense of darkness at play in the background. The show does a great job of building up Helck as a loveable guy you can watch do anything because of how well written and enjoyable he is. His optimism oozes through the screen in every scene. But Helck despises humans (or so he says) and you find out he is a wanted criminal in the human world for the most heinous crime. Which leaves a lot of mystery and again a sense of darkness and edge to his character that keeps him from falling into the infallible good guy trope.The first 5-6 episodes are light on what the story is actually about, but does an amazing job of making you fall in love with and care for the characters in this world.**SPOILERS**After Helck and Vermilio get teleported away from the demon realm is when the real story begins. And Oh man, is it quite the ride. Helck and Vermilio get transported away right at the peak of the conflict between demons and this new mysterious enemy, humans with wings. Their whole mission being to get back to the Demon realm and help stop this endless invasion. They travel across a mysterious new world encountering new characters on the way and helping where they can. Helck spreading his classic Helck charm and positivity everywhere he goes. Majority of the characters they meet along the way are also very well written and enjoyable, take Piwi for example. Very easily could have been an annoying naive character, but he\'s written to be so fun and entertaining. The conflicts they get involved in a long the way are also very well written and never lead you feeling bored or feeling like the episode is filler. This show can take you from laughing out loud to heart wrenching gut punch in the span of an episode or two. Again, I can\'t express how well this show/story is written.My one minor complaint would be that it does feel like they bait you with Helck\'s backstory for awhile before fully getting into the meat of it. But now that we are actually getting the backstory, I wouldn\'t even say this is a complaint anymore. The setup of the mystery and the pay off are well worth the wait. I started this show constantly laughing and having a good time, and the past few episodes have left me teary eyed as the pay off for Helck\'s back story is just THAT DAMN GOOD. The story isn\'t the most original story ever made, but the characters, their interactions, the comedy, the action, the drama/main conflict. All set this show apart from similar shows by MILES and I mean MILESSS. Its pieced together so perfectly.If you are looking for a pure action ""hype"" show, this isn\'t for you. This is for watchers who like a lot of substance and heart in their shows. And not just the generic, ""I want to be the best/strongest"" type of heart. Helck the character., while OP has a lot of heart and really cares for the people around him in a way that a lot of other shows fail to capture with their MCs.

So a fair warning, you need to be a fan of both dark fantasy and light fantasy. Cause the season begins as a light fantasy with hints of dark lore and at the end of the series it is the dark lore, with a few comic relief characters.So heres the story in very broad strokes(Stop for 100% Blind):First there is a tournament for Demon king with a hero running in it which is a very light hearted tournament storyline.Then a few characters get teleported and a mostly light hearted journey back ensues. Near the end of that...journey the hero drops a lore bomb and the entire series shifts in tone to be very dark. There were small sprinkles of dark lore and hints at his backstory beforehand though, so it's not entirely out of the blue (but it's still a pretty dramatic shift) Anyway, from this point forward it just goes full dark, with very few jokes (a few from the comic relief character acquired on the journey )So in conclusion, I liked it. I have a high tolerance for both, but I don't know if I would recommend it to everyone. The light fantasy part would be pretty insufferable for a dark fantasy fan and vice versa. If I would have to choose between one pf the to recommend it to to, it would be the dark fantasy one. The light one is mostly misadventures with some lore attached, so if needed could be skipped. (Most of the journey could be cut out and have it make perfect sense) And the dark part contains pretty heavy themes. Not that it did it the best possible but it's at least worth checking out if you are willing to sit through the light part or find a sufficient skip guide. journey the hero drops a lore bomb and the entire series shifts in tone to be very dark.

Helck is a very amateur to outright bad series. I have a separate review for the manga, but as for the anime how is it? ... Very meh to sometimes bad. While this adaption could have maybe improved upon the original series where it was lacking, if anything it\'s a bad adaption of what I consider to be the ""good part"" of this series. The animation is lackluster, the voices ill fitting, the tone all over the place. And don\'t get me started on the pacing, goodness it is awful. The worldbuilding might seem to be good at first, but it...is quickly revealed to be incredibly simple and boring. I\'ve seen power fantasy isekai have more interesting worldbuilding than Helck, which is just downright depressing.Ultimately would I recommend Helck? No, not at all.

I can\'t recommend something similar in tone or genre off top of my head, but I\'m sure you can find something better than this trash.', 'Helck, at first, seems like a decent show with a likeable titular character who in the surface is this big, strong guy with a jolly heart. He\'s kind of like a Hercules (and I think, this is where it is inspire... Herc... Helck) type of character and I do like the female protagonist Vamirio who wants to know more about Helck who dropped into the demon world and siding with them against the human race.From the outside, it would look like it\'s going to be some sort of buddy-buddy adventure with the two including a funny side-kick, Piwi, with a bird like creature (or...a green testicle with a beak). That sounds from me and you get that for some of the part from the intro, outro songs.But once the show goes deeper, this is when, for me, feels quite underwhelming and that is the whole LORE. While the lore, secrets, humans vs. demons things are very understood, they don\'t seem very interesting to me. There is some dragging that goes along from the side story, side characters that at some point, I feel like I\'m watching a different Anime. There are episodes in which Helck doesn\'t appear before snapping going: ""Wait... is this Helck or something else?"" For as much as the Anime tries to make me invest into the side characters or the main story, I feel so tuned out. Whenever the show focuses on Helck, Anna, Piwi, as they try to find their way to the demon world thing, this is the fun part to see their adventure. Helck is strong and nice, Anna is angry and curious, Piwi is clumsy and funny... that makes the show worthy but aside from that, I just want to fast forward or move this whole thing along.As a whole, I don\'t think this is a bad show depending on what you\'re looking for.

As a result Helck was a breath of fresh air in a genre oversaturated with Video-Game style Isekai shows. However Helck\'s appeall goes beyond simply ""being different"". Instead Helck\'s comedic first episode belies a deep character driven story. The story focuses on the rather OP human fighter Helck who has decided to participate in a competition to choose the next Demon King. The other protagonist is Vermilio, known to Helck as Anne. She is a powerful demon who is...wary and initially tries to stop Helck becoming the new king. Unusually for such a story the plot is told from Vermilio\'s perspective and follows them both as Vermilio and Helck try to combat a new threat from Helck\'s past. What follows a journey not only to stop the villain but to know each other as Vermilio and Helck become friends. Vermilion is fun and enjoyable character\'s however the show really shines with Helck. At first sight he appears to be a typically morally pure and overpowered however in reality he is deeply troubled and traumatic past. Helck\'s past is presented to us as a mystery, that\'s hinted at early on before being explained later and it\'s an approach that I found really works. Quite frankly, Helck is one of the best overpowered protagonists I\'ve seen.Helck, is a genuinely well written show and the series gives us a great character arc for Helck that has some degree of resolution by the end of the season (as of writing there is only one season). Side characters such as Hyura also have some development. However the series does have one problem and that\'s the ending. The series leaves the character arcs in a satisfactory place but not the overall plot. At the end of the 24 episode season, the main villains are still alive and their plot still ongoing. They\'ve been hindered but is no where near being stopped. Unless Helck gets a second season, this is a problem and it risks leaving an otherwise great anime feeling incomplete.Overall Helck has great characters  and plot but it desperately needs a sequel or second season. wary and initially tries to stop Helck becoming the new king.

Helck turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me. Fantasy is kinda dead nowadays since pretty much 95% of the fantasy genre are isekais. That said, Helck was actually a pretty good experience for a fantasy lover like me. They slowly worked the story up, making it serious and more serious along the way and i really enjoyed that. They managed to world build a little bit, which i always appreciate, have solid character development and fun moments all along the way.Helck is sold as a comedy but it actually is a tragedy. Was not expecting the series to get such a...shift in moods when i started watching it.The characters are fun and iinteresting and you feel the impact on the plot that each one has on the story.It lacks a little bit on the animation department, since in some eps it looks like a powerpoint presentation ngl but it is still able to have some solid scenes. Overall it was pretty good experience for me and if you are a fan of ""old"" fantasy genre you might enjoy this one. Even if you are not give it a try since the drama on the show is suprisingly good. shift in moods when i started watching it.The characters are fun and iinteresting and you feel the impact on the plot that each one has on the story.It lacks a little bit on the animation department, since in some eps it looks like a powerpoint presentation ngl but it is still able to have some solid scenes.

But the production of this anime was so bad that I considered dropping it multiple times.The anime can be roughly divided into two parts based on progression of the story. The first half is a (relatively) light-hearted and comedic isekai adventure, contributing most jokes to the show. However, most humor felt ""forced"", and the overall pacing was slow. It seemed that the creators wanted the viewers to be patient, but the quality of the production simply couldn\'t sustain such a leisurely pace for the story to unfold. A substantial portion...of the first half turned out to be quite boring for me.When the story finally delves into the more exciting part, the other flaws became evident, unfortunately. Emerging characters were formulaic, the dialogue often gave me cringe, and the plot felt fragmented due to the slow pacing. The animation was even worse - I\'d be better off just reading a vomic. I didn\'t abandon the show out of curiosity, but the weekly 24 minutes was a torture for me.Despite all the hate, as a viewer who hadn\'t read the manga, I\'d still give it a 4 out of 10 (rather than an even lower rating) purely for the storyline. If there will be a second season, I probably won\'t watch it. of the first half turned out to be quite boring for me.When the story finally delves into the more exciting part, the other flaws became evident, unfortunately.

It presented itself as a comedy series with an OP protagonist, which has been done before, but had a few interesting facets including a lot of “why” to answer, particularly when it came to worldbuilding an character motivations. Especially considering how manga fans were singing its praises, I was expecting to see something interesting in at least one of these.To put it simply, the worldbuilding is basic with only a few glimmers of something more, and the character motivations range from extremely basic to enigmatic with only a couple of characters breaking the mould.That being said, it didn’t have...to be complex to be good. I’ve loved simple stories. But this story tries to have its cake and eat it, too, bearing the hallmarks of a simple series and trying to turn complex late in. I’ve seen other series manage this well (see: Scissor Seven), but Helck just can’t do it. Its styles clash, and motivations come too late for me to buy into the journey of the lead. Other series could also coast on strong sakuga, but that’s only rarely present here and almost all relegated to backstory.There’s some good humor here, more than a few homages to other, better anime, and some of the elements are emotionally resonant, but none of it is enough to make this series stand out. It has some elements that hint at a much better series somewhere in here, but it’s lost in so much else here that just felt like it was there to pad things out that it’s hard to appreciate. It’s largely just the fine, only occasionally doing something that makes it stand out and leaving things nebulous and kind of toothless in the middle end after what looked like a consequential lead-up. If those few big moments grab you hard enough and you’re willing to wait to see them through, this may be worth your time. They were barely enough to keep me going and, with those tonal clashes, I could only see the result as muddled and wanting. to be complex to be good. I’ve loved simple stories.

The show starts off really well as a strong comedy, however as the show progresses almost all the comedic elements disappear and we are left with a stereotypical shounen action show. It includes all the tropes that I hate in shounen action, such as the MC being strong enough to stop everything that happens but standing by and watching all his friends be defeated because he's sad, or being able to stop pretty much any attack but not being around when attacks occur due to random details from the plot or just standing around waiting to join the fight for some...reason.After about 20 tedious episodes (the first two were good) the season ends without resolving the central plot, leaving an already tedious show hanging, possibly in the hopes of a second season.

It\'s more complex and convoluted than you think.On the outset, mangaka Nanaki Nanao\'s first amateur series, which was serialised through Shogakukan\'s Ura Sunday and spans 12 volumes from May 2014 to December 2017, certainly looked like a promising series about its central MC in the typical fantasy world of finding successors to continue the never-ending war between humanity and demons. Even if the manga felt almost as dated as it is with Satelight\'s anime adaptation under director Tatsuo Sato, in which this show ironically falls under...the wheelhouse of the veteran\'s 30+ year-long history with AniManga, who does things all wrong, there is just no saving grace for Helck, both on an authoritative and directorial level. Not if the anime decides to do a radical change, which is rather late now.The story of Helck is right in the name. But first, a little plot-driven backstory. You know your usual fantasy world humans vs. demons war, in which, in the typical case, the humans won and celebrated their victory, while the demons went all frenetic to hurriedly choose their next Demon Lord to face the human hero. How they did it was to organise a tournament between demons to pick out the most suitable candidate, and from the many candidates, there is one quickly rising up the ranks: Helck, a human hero who claims to hate his own humankind. Of all the higher-up demons present, one of the Four Elite Lords of Vermilio the Red senses something sus about said human and tries to rig the tournament to make sure that he does not become the new Demon Lord. But Helck just continues to dominate the tournament to her chagrin, though with one radical shift of a rather sinister plan, he brings both said humanity-hating human hero and the Elite Lord together (who parades under an alias), learning of his true origins and understanding that who Helck really is and where he came from under his ""human hero"" moniker is more than meets the eye.Nanaki Nanao\'s rather long (and incomplete) adaptation has three parts: the Beginning, the Story, and the End...which is what I\'d say, if not for the fact that this should not be just seen as a mere simpleton story (which it does on paper), but it\'s best described this way: the Recourse, the Reasoning and the Retaliation. I\'ll try to keep spoilers as minimal as possible, because this is one of, if not, the only strength of the source material.The (Present) Recourse: Helck comes to the Demon Realm to pick up the challenge to become the next Demon Lord. He mentions that he\'s a radical enemy of humankind, which, as expected, the demons of Vermilio and yet another fellow Elite Lord (or Heavenly Kings, as the anime puts it) Azudra the Blue are not stupid enough to take Helck at his word that he wants to destroy the humans. But as it turns out, there is reason enough to justify giving Helck a chance when the tournament suddenly is thwarted by winged knights that the demons did not perchance onto, but that Helck did have an inkling that he knew why the Human Realm would continue to attack the demons, even though the war between both entities has recently ended.The (Past) Reasoning: Both Helck and Vermilio get transported out of the Demon Realm, and their way home is a rather cumbersome journey that crosses both land and sea. The story of Helck, in general, goes like this: orphaned brothers, whose parents got killed by monsters, then seek work against a life of harsh poverty. which, one of them got so ill that the other had to seek help, and they both got saved by compassionate people and raised under them. And as the brothers grow up, they are seen fit to lead the Human Realm\'s army, becoming heroes in the making, unaware that the humans have trickeries of sorcery behind the scenes that will change the fate of the entire world, which involve the brothers and take a turn for the worse, cementing the reason why he wants to join (or, in the correct term, defect) to the other side to help them take down the humans. I\'m pretty sure you can guess where Helck fits into this description.The (Future) Retaliation: Helck vs. the rest of the world, it\'s a duel to the death to save what has already been lost — his brother, who fought valiantly as a hero, only to be used as a tool for the Human Realm\'s sinister plan, and eventually dealing with the demons on their agreed terms as per the tournament.Par for the course of the anime, we\'ve only reached both the Recourse and Reasoning portions, so I\'ll just say this much: I truly adore Helck as a character; he\'s selfless and puts others before himself. As much as the huge and muscular external physique that he looks that can give people sights of intimidation, he\'s quite literally the opposite internally: the softhearted and naïve person who trusts others too easily, he\'ll go to extreme lengths for the people he loves and cares about, though it puts him in the danger of being manipulated or taken advantage of by people, becoming a person who bears grudges due to regrets and anger, which can possibly turn him into a living nightmare. Being the older brother of the human hero who has gone before him, his relationship with Cless is so beloved that this is where he cultivates his strength, which is built up over time with a power that can even rival the best of the Human Realm.Likewise, Helck and Vermilio\'s relationship is somewhat of an oddity, being in loggerheads with each other as you would expect of a human and a demon. Though as usually hotheaded as the latter is, being one of the Heavenly Kings that take care of the Demon Realm well, as well as unnecessarily being picked on by Azudra always by him always calling her in a loving and teasing way that is the verge of respite, Vermilio stands for what\'s right in her eyes, even as she\'s slowly changed after meeting Helck and learning of his bizarre proposition of having humanity decimated before the demons do. The short, petite, vermillion-haired woman is absolutely one not to be trifled with, unless that\'s the subject of their following attendant, the not-so-kiwi-looking bird of Piwi, who is just a hilarious menace of a messenger of plot pointers and a robust follower throughout the series.While you can argue that the demons\' side of Azudra the Blue stands out as one of the original Heavenly Kings (before Vermilio would take a similar stand being trained by him) who is always the subject of torture from said woman, they\'re at least an interesting bunch of people, from Hon the attendant to sisters Asta and Ista being spies for the Demon Realm, and even the possible Demon Lord candidates of Kenros, Hyura, and Dorshe who would get entangled by Helck\'s big business. It\'s the same with humanity being once a vibrant realm to live in, but with people like the brothers\' saviour of swordsman Rafaed (having his daughter Sharuami), working for the Human King and its doctor-cum-tactican Mikaros, the latter who once feared death facing demons from wars long before the present day, it\'s complete mayhem to turn the world upside down by employing sorcery that the demons will not surmise of humans having this ""extraordinary"" power to completely overthrow them. It\'s even sadder that the former heroes whom Helck worked with in the past, like Edil, the young man being in the same monster subjugation unit as him, and the mercenary Alicia, form the admirable friendship between the two, as well as people whom he cares a lot for. It\'s just so messed up, but it makes you feel compassion for Helck, who has juggled his life through high hell and back, seeing these people through to realise his goals and objectives for the foreseeable future.The anime\'s aesthetics, however, are not the show\'s strong suit. Satelight may have the pristine Symphogear franchise on their hands, but outside of that, all of the studio\'s works of the past years were mostly a miss, especially when related to its closest sibling, Spring 2018\'s Juushinki Pandora a.k.a Last Hope, where continuous 2-cour productions take a massive toll on the production team. This is clearly what happened to director Tatsuo Sato and his staff team, and for the six months that they spent on Helck, it looked like they\'re already going to give up at any time. If not for Nanaki Nanao\'s story, which did go topsy-turvy quite a fair few times, the source material that tries to be one thing and another the next, it can give quite the jarring treatment for anyone watching this show, which will potentially be a rather bad time. And sadly, this is also what happened to this faltering production cycle — that everything just ended up being awfully average at best. The music is pretty much the same, though with both the 1st and 2nd Cour OSTs together, they are unmemorable at best (well, at least a bit tangible with the 1st Cour\'s OP/ED songs).Helck has the potential to be a story for the ages, but the subpar production and/or even the author\'s writing skills really weigh it down. It\'s just such a shame for such a larger-than-life story where the circumstances carried don\'t quite have the same weight as how Nanaki Nanao intends it to be, as in the manga, that the anime basically translated less weight than desired no thanks to someone who doesn\'t quite know his craft.It is such a disappointment that the anime could be improved on quite a lot, but what do I know? Just read the manga and carry on. the wheelhouse of the veteran\'s 30+ year-long history with AniManga, who does things all wrong, there is just no saving grace for Helck, both on an authoritative and directorial level.

It\'s just such a shame for such a larger-than-life story where the circumstances carried don\'t quite have the same weight as how Nanaki Nanao intends it to be, as in the manga, that the anime basically translated less weight than desired no thanks to someone who doesn\'t quite know his craft.It is such a disappointment that the anime could be improved on quite a lot, but what do I know? Just read the manga and carry on.', 'Sometimes when you have a complete dud of a series, it can be hard to know where things went wrong. Not so in the case of Helck, where there is one simple, glaringly obvious problem lit up in neon lights that makes the rest of it unsalvageable. Namely, it looks ugly as sin.Modern Satelight is depressing for many reasons, but this effort on Helck has to stand as one of the studio\'s lowlights in its 20 some years of production. The character designs are poor, the animation is stiff in the best of times, but rarely deviates from its baseline level of ""hideous"". The action...storyboarding is among the worst in recent memory, leading to a few fight scenes that had me outright laughing at how something this incompetent could make it to air. It suffers from many of the same problems that afflicted the similarly-mocked Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer last year, namely that the slavish devotion to 1-to-1 remakes of the manga panels for a beloved series, combined with next to no resources or time for production, resulted in a series with extremely low ambitions that nonetheless utterly failed to meet them. Whatever underlying charms there are to the original are totally lost in this adaptation, a failure so comprehensive that it\'s almost inconceivable that it could lead to someone who was not previously a fan of the series picking up the manga.And to be clear, that is not the only failure here. There is a specific vibe to watching a feature film that was poorly adapted from a short film, where you can tell exactly when the original premise ran out of gas and the writer had to start throwing new ideas at the wall to fill out the runtime, even if they don\'t fit in with the original story. That\'s the vibe I got from the story here, which begins as a one-note gag comedy (Helck\'s really strong! He keeps easily winning the competitions to become the next demon lord even though he\'s human!) and eventually unspools into a tragic drama over the course of an agonizingly long flashback that lasts for almost the entire 2nd cours. These parts don\'t fit nicely together at all. The tone shift comes out of nowhere and it\'s almost absurd to look back at the early episodes of the series and see where it began before the ""digression"" that ends up being the main plot of the series after the gag comedy is discarded. While it\'s tempting to discredit the anime production for this considering how badly they dropped the ball in every other area, this is a panel-by-panel recreation of the manga\'s story so it seems to be an inherent problem with the story (or at least inherent to adapting it into a TV anime) and I\'m not sure even a stronger hand at the till could have smoothed over that flaw.At the end of the day, what you have here is a lackluster and poorly paced story given over to a seemingly-indifferent and resource-starved production team, making it less than the sum of its parts. While I have to assume there are positive things about the source material considering how many people like it, none of its positive qualities come through in this woeful adaptation. storyboarding is among the worst in recent memory, leading to a few fight scenes that had me outright laughing at how something this incompetent could make it to air.

It started competently then it went in all sorts of directions from adventure to cooking competitions and all kinds of different genres all the while quality of animation kept dropping. It didn\'t have far to fall from but artists sure did start to take number of different shortcuts and it\'s getting annoyingly noticeable. The straw that broke camel\'s back was when other characters started oooing and awwwwing at what main character did, without it actually being shown. Even things they did show were poorly animated outlines.These...episodes taught us exactly nothing about main character. He\'s as blank as they get. No history, no traits other than strength, no likes or dislikes, no conflicts, anything. Other main character, the girl, is your typical tsundere and am not expecting her to do anything wild and out of the box either.To be honest I expected more. I thought it would be a nice conflict for human to become daemon lord and to find out what is the reason for his hate of human kingdom. While I suppose those story arcs are coming I feel continuing watching this is nothing more than waste of time. For me, this show started as solid 6, perhaps even 7... but it\'s ending as 5. Average to a fault and any qualities it started with have worn out by now with nothing left to justify anything higher than ""average"". episodes taught us exactly nothing about main character.

Idol Time PriPara,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34787/Idol_Time_PriPara,"['Idol Time PriPara stands up to its predecessor, PriPara, if just barely. I believe that if you enjoyed PriPara you will also like Idol Time, though the sequel still has its flaws compared to the first series.The main aspect of Idol Time that is lacking is the story; it seems to have a lot of unnecessary filler to stretch out the series. PriPara is also guilty of this, but Idol Time seems to have even more of this. I always look forward to the CG performances in each episode, but when the same song is played for three or four episodes at a time, it...gets repetitive.The new characters in Idol Time are a good addition, but fall short of PriPara\'s main characters in terms of likeability. Personally, I think it\'s because of having to hear ""Kashikoma"" and ""Yumekawa"" ten times an episode.Overall, Idol Time Pripara is an enjoyable series, though not as good as its prequel. The story are art are okay, and the characters and songs are better. I would still recommend watching Idol Time if you enjoyed PriPara because it adds fresh content and has about the same feel as the original. gets repetitive.The new characters in Idol Time are a good addition, but fall short of PriPara\'s main characters in terms of likeability.

To this day PriPara is one of my favourite idol type animes but Idol Time can't scratch the surface.The only thing that keeps me from slowly dragging myself through this anime is the characters from PriPara - and they are in for a few episodes max - and the sound. As always Idol Time lives up to the great soundtrack with it creating upbeat and enjoyable songs. That is sadly the only praise I can get.The art isn't bad but it...isn't good. The anime makes some good jokes on it, making me like it a bit more, but the extra details and lines seem off. When I watch a sequal i may expect better animations or better art here and there but I don't expect to see art that looks very different from it's source. It scares me when the old characters stand next to the new, they seem like they've been pasted onto a scene rather than the two being part of it. If they had to change the art style, they should've did minor changes to make the other characters blend into scenes.I really wanted to enjoy Idol Time but the characters are so bland. All feel like copies from the original and the story is... well I don't know. After 19 episodes of watching I would expect to know the story but other than Lala needing to make this place great there is none. With you following Yui, that is just Lala with catchphrase steroids, and having no idea what is happening because Yui explains things with dream so much you can't tell what things mean or just because that episode lacks a story all together.The anime feels so force with the only character of being an interest is Nino. I don't need to watch further to predict what is going on and granted this is aimed at someone younger than me, but even PriPara had me still watching with it's childish acts.Idol animes fall for this usual trap of reboots and some can work well while others fall. Idol Time falls because of my high expectations and the lack of anything new. Despite new characters, new music, new adventures and new mysterious, it still feels old and reused like someone just paraphrased the entirety of PriPara but with their own characters.I think the big problem is how slow the anime is. PriPara was not fast, but each episode had chaos, real problems or something that made you grow towards a character. Idol Time has new episodes that I watch the OPing (my favourite part of the show so far) and then instantly wish I wasn't hooked onto Lalas' adventures.Without Lala I am sure many people, not just me, would not be watching this show and so I will drag myself slowly to watch this show. I have no expectations of this to be enjoyable especially with mild spoilers being thrown at me about the ending being way to similar to PriParas.All in all, without it's prequel, I would not be watching this. I would download or find the soundtrack on the wiki so I can listen to it.

Ok I'm sorry but the story for Idol Time just bores me. It takes so long for things to start happening. Yui finally makes a team in EPISODE 36!! It took a long time to introduce most of the characters and the main conflict in the show.Art [6/10]I feel like the animation for this series isn't as great as the original. The CGI sequences are pretty much the same but the normal...2D is pretty lazy and not that detailed.Sound [9/10]One of Pripara's best points is it's music. It's SO good! Especially Miss. Prillionaire, Gira Galactic Tightrope, Accha Kocha Game, Ghost Coaster, Brand New Happiness, Kaida Senshin Kakkin Buddy, etc. It's songs are so catchy and fun! The only thing I have to complain about the songs is that songs like Brand New Happiness are played over and over and over again which isn't so bad but the fact that songs like Kaida Senshin are only played once kinda annoys me.Characters [6/10]The characters are like mixes of the old ones, they aren't very original. Yui (Laala, Mikan, and Non), Nino (Shion, Dorothy), Michiru (Chiri, Aroma), Shuuka (Hibiki, Chiri). I'm annoyed that they brought back the Black and Green Vocaldolls/Goddesses conflict between sisters thing. Falala and Galala are basically Jewlie+Falulu and Janice+Garuru combined. Like how many times are they going to reuse the same sister drama plot. I'm happy that they added in boy idols like WITH but they barely got any development. I'm sad that most of the old charas barely get any screen time, but it is the sequel so meh.Enjoyment [8/10]While I much prefer the original Pripara, IT isn't horrible, it just isn't as good. It has it's funny moments (like Yui and Shougo) and it's times of character development (Michiru, Nino). There are filler episodes but they are mostly enjoyable. I really wish that they would stop using the same plot as Season 3 of Pripara with Super Idol Time and Falala and Galala, but thats my only problem.Overall [7/10]It's not amazing but it's not horrible either. I love Pripara because of how cute and fun it is. I always look forward to watching new episodes and listening to the new songs.

since I read the manga, so I wanted to see these 3 ovas to see how good they are, after all for my Alice in Bordelands it was a great and I knew that, despite being 3 ovas, it could be a good thing from there (well, I was wrong).The story does not change much, Arisu Ryohei, tired of his life and with an inferiority complex by his brother, appears in another world with his 2 friends after seeing some fireworks, in the...""new world"" (which is equal to the Earth, but without many people) there are some survival games in which Arisu will have to participate to survive, the plot is simple, but it can unleash many possibilities, but the pacing is terrible, the plot rushes so much that we can not get to Psychologically understand the characters or their actions, the ovas only take advantage that they are a game of death to play great and develop them well (that is a good point that the ova have at least) and then forget everything else, it shows due to the emphasis to make each game fit a game and making their preparations, which does not work because the grace that the games had was to see how the protagonists faced the games in a psychological way and in a way Inamica, while here they only focused on making the game great, leaving a kind of ""style over substance"", since the reflections and deductions of the characters completely dislodge due to the inconsistency that the ovas had to prioritize and retract the games ( it takes very little time to explain correctly and dynamically).The last game was the one I gave the most hope, but the flask forward (as opposed to flask back) that were recurrent in the chapter made the majority of the chapter\'s dialogue meaningless and explicitly let you understand that something wrong It was going to happen (which is a simple way to put tension although with everything, this game was the one that best treated the tension), without the need to resort to psychological immersion, which generates, although all the games are raised in a way correct, the latter in particular could have developed in a great way, but the little immersion with the characters and the fact that we could not get into their mentality makes their deaths do not feel like something emotional or that has weight (although the soundtrack did a good job in general), so, despite the good approach, the development was mediocre.The characters are where the ovas weakest, in the manga the characters are undoubtedly their best element (especially Arisu), due to the duration of the ovas the characters are very poor, you can not get to emphasize with any due to the emphasis that is only given to the games and in the ingenious way to solve them, it is not at the end of the third game where you can get to understand the feelings of the characters, but that only serves to generate an emotional scene where friends of Arisu die, if not for that reason the characters never managed to express themselves correctly, the exposition of deep themes is very superficial and pretentious (we never really get to know much about Arisu\'s past or why Chouta feels a loading, they are only vague themes presented in a superficial way), so the exposition of themes is superficial and does not complement the characters due to their poor presentation in the chapters (although I always I talk about character designs in other reviews, here I have nothing to say, it is normal), the characters besides being poor do not get to express their personality well nor can we see great relationships with each other (which is a contradiction taking in mind that they are best friends), so outside the protagonist the other characters become very boring due to their little time on screen (it provides very badly the exhibition of characters, something that did not happen in the manga).The animation is normal, although the scenarios are very muted and low in color that they use to express more the dark tone of the ovas themselves, outside of that the transitions are mediocre and the facial gestures too, the animation does not help to focus the viewer on certain aspects, at least the animation is not as bad as you might think at the beginning, it just does not meet decent standards.The end of the ovas only leaves the viewer anxious, forcing him to read the manga, which makes it a concise ending, but with clear intentions, I really find that these ovas were totally wasted, the manga being a work that gives much emphasis to psychological aspects and the ingenuity of the games, the anime only gave emphasis to the ""ingenuity"" of the games (since the few that appear are not the big deal), well, a short review, if I don\'t talk about other aspects of the ovas it is because it is irrelevant, I really would not recommend these ovas to anyone, or to

""So I love these kinds of animes, the ones where they basically have to play games/solve puzzles. This anime is kind of like No Game No Life but they have to play the games to stay alive. I really love this because it takes those kids that aren't good at anything in the world we are in and place them in a world where they can thrive essentially. Most of the characters are also great, once you get past the initial little freak out. I would recommend this to anyone who liked No Game No Life, or animes about solving puzzles.

Even those who are not into mindf@&# -like myself- will enjoy this.It's about a bunch of kids who can't adapt in the real world being warped into a mirror image of the world and told to participate in games with their lives at stake. These games  are different to what any one might expect from an anime like this and actually make sense and are exiting. You would find a cliff hanger of sorts at the centre of each episode which...will make your heart go crazy and your eyes will be practically glued to the screen. However dispite it being unique in many ways there still are plenty of similiar story lines so one might find it to be a bit of a rip-off.

It emphasizes on light and harmony in colours, bringing forth brilliant details, but for an anime of this era it isn't particularly spectacular. (8)Sound: This is a bit of a let down. The sound is fine and you could say unique, but still not particularly interesting. The voices of the characters aren't the cutsy type you normally get, nor the rough types you sometimes get, but something in between - but closer to the rough type- and have the proper emotions in place.

Together, these are about 1.5 hours long and the same story was told over 3 or 4 hours in the live action show, so I was expecting the story to have fewer frills here. I was pretty much right. And, because I preferred the live action version, I'm going to talk about why that is more than anything else.But if you're not interested in that, the TL;DR is that you should watch the live action version instead of this, if...you only want to watch one. It goes further in the story and reworks it so that everything gels better.Now, I have not read the manga and I won't until the live action series has finished, but I assume this anime is a pretty straightforward adaptation. And I was really impressed by most of the story changes they did in the live action version. They changed the whole first game because that arrow set-piece was never going to happen on TV, and their replacement was much better, in my opinion. It was kind of a ridiculous puzzle, but it didn't reduce to just a word game like this one did. Making the beams smaller and using TV screens instead of the placards gave the whole thing a more modern feel. Arisu's characterization is completely different from the start; he's way more reserved through the whole thing and develops from a weak and scared starting point. In the anime, he's confident from the start and even sort-of happy to be there. He's indistinguishable from Karube and doesn't have anywhere for his arc to go. I mean, in the live action version, ARISU is the one to call out to people in the tag game and tell them he's going to coordinate. It's a moment where he comes out of his skin slightly. Here, it's Karube. What purpose did that moment serve in the anime? Moving the plot along. Which is not even to begin with the consequential hide-and-seek game, where Arisu doesn't even try to think deeply about the game at all in the anime. The live-action version was a lot more contemplative and sympathetic.That's not to say the live action version's changes were perfect, though. They apparently cut a moment, seen in the anime, where Arisu invites someone to hide with him. In the live action version, that person just runs off and dies in a way that makes it seem like Arisu used him as bait or, at best, didn't care about his humanity. The live action version also put Shibuki in a situation where she was not in control of her decisions during the hide-and-seek game, so you could say Chota made her decision for her. Which came after a weird sex-and-cult-related segment about Chota that is not in the anime. I assume those elements are in the manga, but I preferred the anime's rendition without the cult segment and without Shibuki's choice being made for her.What this anime does have over the live action version is that it's well-animated and has cool character designs. It also has a really pleasant, muted color palate that works well aesthetically. I wouldn't say it's worth checking out for the visuals alone, but they are nice.Here's hoping future seasons of the live action version get to the end of the story, and that it continues tweaking things to work better.

I\'m into this""...By the 3rd episode...I thought I knew was what was about to happen, I was so sure..but woof was I wrong. So now I\'m awaiting the second season and my mind is racing trying to figure out answers (cuz that was a hell of a cliffhanger lol). December can\'t come soon enoughI gave it a 7/10.. Only...because 8-9-10 is reserved for EXTREMELY amazing masterpiece anime..and with this only being 3 episodes so far, I think 7 is a pretty good place to rank it for now. Or even a 6.5.My only criticism is that they could do MORE with it. Like go in depth with the strategic puzzle solving skills. It feels like it\'s over as soon as it begins..not too much to uncover in the actual games themselves. Most anime have the characters at some point walk you through what theyre seeing and how they\'re gonna figure it out after a bit of struggling and it ends up being some master plan that you thought couldn\'t be defeated...all while trying to uncover the whole operation and those involved....but they don\'t really get in depth like that, it just kinda happens and it\'s onto the next without much of the story-building.

I don\'t think the people that are strictly fullfilled by only reading the manga truly can appreciate anything else that may spawn out of it. Case and point, when people continuously read what they perceive as to be a good story in reality they wouldn\'t be reading it if it wasn\'t already good to them, so it tends to make them focus more towards the story and consequently ignoring everything else like the theme and genre they\'re reading into, and then they...happen to see a second telling from the writers true perspective and all the sudden to them it feels completely alien to them.I just watched Alice In Borderland. I never heard anything about it before today, although it sounded familiar. The idea is just this: yeah like I read from another reviewer the duration and characters could have been better, and that\'s just exactly the way I like it. It doesn\'t really matter what the theme is like, it\'s still a death and killing game and that\'s really all that you need to watch it. It\'s the fact the characters don\'t get a lot of dragged out screen time that makes the that idea better. An anime like this should make you question your own sense of morality, no one gives a care about what the characters are actually like, not knowing that is about the part where it actually does it makes you question your own sense of right and wrong if that was you put in that same situation with people.I liked the part where arisu was the only one really using his head the whole time. Most of the time everyone is struggling to survive constantly, so by the end of the show as it turns out he\'s the only one still alive, well then it forces you to be reminded about the premise of the show in the first place that everyone wishes they can still be that guy that starts over living in another world, it\'s true everyone does, but also in the game of life and death, everyone has a side of them that, that believes they are the ones that need to play in order to live, that over anyone else as well no one ever thinks they want to be the ones to admit about themselves.SO frankly, above besides all that, if you showed me this anime out of the blue and then told me that whether it was either the manga or the anime that the not even the main character is really the one who has difficultly contemplating over that right there, then you can honestly just don\'t even bother concerning yourself with showing it to me then even it really was just a death game like this one too... Because that sounds like the smelly end of a horse to my ears right there.. seriously just don\'t bother even..

There's even a lot to enjoy with their difficulty rating system and game genres as translated to different playing cards.

While overall this anime isn't necessarily anything special, its first episode is really strong, with a powerful setup and strong hook that leads the viewer straight into the story. Perhaps that's a symptom of a manga getting a rushed OVA. Regardless, the story is more than good enough to remain engaging over 3 episodes. The art is perfectly serviceable, though nothing really catches the eye other than how ugly the facial expressions of the characters can occasionally be. The sound is also serviceable, with anxious and mysterious music throughout. The characters are perhaps the strongest point of the show, with the natural chemistry between Arisu, Karube, and Chouta really shining by the end.

Right now, I am only about reaching halfway through the airing of this, but I am wholeheartedly invested in this, that is how gripping the plot is.To put this into context, I, myself, have seen and completed over 100 animes, so I like to think that I know a thing or two...about what makes an anime good. And this one just doesn\'t disappoint. I am in love with the way the story is told, unfolding a mystery from one thing, but then out of nowhere, that leads to an even bigger mystery from that.The escape room and game-like element fit really well with the storytelling, and the anime literally pulls a ""never let em know your next move.""Right now, I feel like I am on an acid trip trying to understand what is going on, (in a good way).The story begins with zooming on a duo main cast, but we then begin to see just who exactly the MC is and things start to spiral out of hand.Like seriously, the MC here is having a bloody nightmare about an escape room.So, without trying to spoil much, just please go ahead and watch 1 episode. You honestly will like this, if you would enjoy the psychological, borderline supernatural mystery to it. about what makes an anime good. And this one just doesn\'t disappoint.

You honestly will like this, if you would enjoy the psychological, borderline supernatural mystery to it.', 'Note: There might be a little bit of spoilers in here. To sum it up: the visuals and atmosphere are great, but there is very little plot and characters in here, and what is in it, is a waste of time.It’s interesting that this donghua even caught some attention, given that initially the premise was very vague, and it adapts a seemingly not that well known webcomic. I guess it has to do with it being easily available.Well, aside from that, there’s the hook, two dudes go to an escape room and win it, for one of them, the protagonist, to have recurring visions...of different escape rooms and the female owner of the place they went to, afterwards. Quite unusual, plus during the first three episodes the pacing is quite good, having the setup and a cliffhanger in the first, the resolution in the second, and a hint of the backdrop stories that connects all the characters in the third.The visuals are also very good, nothing mind blowing but definitely way better than the average anime out there, especially modern ones. The artwork is very well done, it’s always consistent without quality drops whatsoever, very well made backgrounds despite being limited to the same places in the same city all the time, and a better use of lighting and shading than any anime out there these days. The special effects are also very good, and the CGI used in the show is mixed very well with the rest, compared to other anime, and donghua as well. Plus the visuals and directing during the hallucination parts are very good as well. The parts that stood out the most for me were the genuinely visually dark moments in the show, which nowadays I don’t find anywhere else, even in series that are supposed to have dark aesthetics. The minuses in this department have to do with how stiff the series is most of the time, and how simple the character designs are, the only character that stands out a little is the main girl, and only because of her dress, black and red like her hair and eyes respectively. When she appears with other clothes she blends within everyone else like the rest of the cast.The sound department is also very good, very well made sound effects during both relaxing and intense moments and the soundtrack is pretty immersive. The opening fits the mysterious vibe from the initial episodes very well and the ending, although nothing special, is fine as well. I take out points here because of the voice acting, it feels very generic and without much variety in delivery among different scenes and events.But that’s as far as the positives go for me.Initially the series plays out as a suspenseful psychological thriller making the viewer guess why is this happening? Is it all just a dream? Is the protagonist going crazy? Did he fall in love with the woman? Is she a demon that bewitches all men as the rumors say? Is it that all Chinese men can’t stop having recurring thoughts about a woman they met for like an hour?Well, let me tell you, from episode 4 to 13 and half of 14, X & Y is not a psychological thriller, is not suspenseful and it’s not a drama in the least. It’s a romcom about the two main characters teasing each other. You can forget about the setup because so does the show, as it becomes a lighthearted slice of life and romantic comedy series with no plot progression whatsoever that made it feel way longer than just a 16 episodes series of a runtime of 15 minutes per episode. Plus from that point the initial thrilling tone and atmosphere became weaker and weaker until disappearing almost completely. No wonder it ended up falling into obscurity once again.Ok, sometimes a character would appear to yell at the protagonist to STAY AWAY FROM THAT WOMAN, SHE IS THE DEVIL is a most exaggerated and ridiculous way, only for that to lead to nothing. Ok, bad things keep happening to people that harass the main girl, as well as acquaintances of the main character, fuelling the initial suspicion. But that also leads to nothing happening in the end, a girl gets kidnapped and placed in an escape room for several episodes? Nothing happens to her in the end, it was all fake tension, the show just felt like wasting some episodes. Did a character die for harassing that other woman? It happens out of screen or you won’t see what ends up happening to the asshole.They also keep bringing up how suspicious it is that the woman could build such a big and complex escape room place out of nowhere, but I don’t recall the show ever answering that.Another big issue are the slice of life moments, which normally serve to at least flesh out the cast, but that doesn’t happen either. Everyone remains one note up until the last two and a half episodes. In the meantime they have the most unnatural interactions in a slice of life series ever, maybe the translation is to blame but seriously who talks like that? Even leaving the dialogues aside, there’s nothing to learn about this cast, they only appear in one place and they do the exact same things every time. Do you want to know more about the protagonist and what the heck is going on in his head? Well, too bad, he is amnesiac and he doesn’t get a clue about himself or the plot until the 14th episode out of 16, and the way he got that was so easy and simple you can’t help but think that it should have happened way earlier.Anyways, once the answers are given, turns out there’s no supernatural stuff, and the protagonist isn’t losing his mind either, everything was a lie the whole time. To be fair, the reason behind all of this isn’t too bad, if the series was good, it could have been something like a mix between The Truman Show (minus the reality show aspect) and Memento or some shit. But there’s none of that here, and what ends up being the answer certainly isn’t very believable, in fact I dare to say it’s not at all, the characters shouldn’t interact the way they do at all, given their backdrop story, and it definitely didn’t mindfucked the protagonist nearly as much as it should have done, and it definitely didn’t need 16 episodes to show it, it could have been a short movie combining the first three episodes, very few scenes of the next ten, and then the last three. Either that but with better writing, or at least anticipate the outcome a bit for it to not feel as sudden as it was, plus it would have been more impactful and relevant for the protagonist. Ok, maybe if we track every escape room shown prior in the series we could find some hints, but I’m not doing that, and even if I did and they exist, I bet they are few, little, very easy to miss, and not really adding to the big picture nor highlighted in a way that might feel well written or directed. You would find more pausing the opening.And you know what the worst thing about this show is? The ending is open and circular, and from what I read the series only adapts half the source material, which follows a similar pattern to end with, again, an open and circular ending.Down to it, this is a show that promises a suspenseful psychological thriller early on, only to give Babylon vibes in a most exaggerated way, full of red herrings and fake tension, a dead pacing with barely any plot progression, a very inconsistent tone, some of the most unnatural interactions among characters ever in one of the emptiest slice of life series ever, no proper anticipation for the outcome, very nonsensical writing as a whole, disappointing resolutions, a story that essentially goes nowhere, and a complete waste of very good visuals, directing, sound, and atmosphere. I didn’t complete many donghua so far, but among those few, this is the worst of them all (but certainly not the worst one I ever checked out, that is Evil or Live, by far). of different escape rooms and the female owner of the place they went to, afterwards.

I\'m going to downgrade it to an 8, which is still a high recommendation.Aiyou de Mishi has an incredibly strong start, and does so much to build atmosphere and tension that it just draws you in. Watch the first episode, and you won\'t be able to escape.There\'s something odd about the escape room that Yuechu and his coworker try out. There\'s rumors of people becoming obsessed and getting dreams about the escape room or the beautiful owner Aiyou. Aiyou uses...a spooky salutation for all the leaving customers: ""I will never let you go""It\'s a thriller where it\'s probably best to not spoil anything. Like Link Click, Aiyou de Mishi or X&Y likes to end episodes on cliffhangers. The primary draw of this show is the mystery, so you\'ll have a different experience if you are watching the simulcast with everyone else. You (the audience) look for clues to understand what\'s going on. Unlike Link Click, there isn\'t much of any B plot, and it doesn\'t evoke many emotions beyond that of mystery.It does a good job using atmosphere to create tension. The direction is near flawless. Everything (the cinematography, audio, pacing, transitions) comes together to generate the mood.The animation is good. Backgrounds are lush and detailed. Lighting is used effectively. There aren\'t really heavy action scenes to animate, so there isn\'t any really spectacular sakuga, but the scenes are all set nicely.The OP has outstanding visuals and music which really set the mood of the show.

They enjoyed making escape rooms. Yan (the main character), was in love with Xu. Based on other episodes, I\'m guessing Xu\'s dad cheated on Xu\'s mother. So Yan took revenge by creating an escape room that gave him a heart attack?Yan has some kind of mental break from the whole experience and forgets who he is. Any recollection of the past...makes him pass out and forget everything again.Xu is upset with Yan for ""killing"" her father so she teases and toys with him waiting for a good opportunity to kill him once he remembers everything and doesn\'t black out from it?

It was confusing to analyse what's actually happening with characters at then end.What i understood is that the Main character had a past that he can't remember and coming to final epsiode the main character again goes into amnesia like his past.If this was the Whole story with some excape room elements? then this is a time pass watch with a popcorn.I welcome the counterpart explanation of the last epsiodes or the whole series if I'm wrong. of ending the story.

Life is like an escape room, isn\'t it?Art : is probably the best part of the show in my opinion; every scene and character design is clear and very well made. Also,...I find the camera angle really cynematography-like and less anime-like, if that makes sense to you.Characters:I think they did a really good job for Xu Aiyou; they described really well the whole exterior figure and gave a lot of insight into her past,her personality, and the myths behind her.For other characters however, it seems they gave them no space; we don\'t know about their past, personalities, etc. It seems like the whole show revolves around one figure. To be fair, I don\'t mind that,but I would appreciate more space for at least one more character.The show right now is a beautiful mess,a really good mystery,I\'m curious to see if the finale will make sense,that\'s my only fear.A must watch if you are into mystery.

Animes like ‘Aiyou de mi shi’ are just proving the fact that Chinese animes are getting better at an astonishing pace.Plot(8/10): The plot of this anime centers around a mysterious woman and the escape room which she owns. And as male lead we have a relatively normal guy,  who is not that normal (Big twist at the end) . As a mystery show it ticks almost all the boxes. It had good pacing, several interesting characters combined with great direction. Some of...the scenes really justified the suspense tag it has. The initial phase got me hooked easily and made me watch the whole show.  Though we barely discover what happened throughout those days and what was the motive behind it, the story is still intriguing until the point it covers from the source material.Animation,Audio(9.5/10): Probably the best part of the show. Background art was outstanding, character designs were also great. I read some chapters of the source material afterwards and compared it with the anime. I was genuinely shocked to see how much the anime improved the art. Great job done by the studio.The backround music and sounds were good as well. It was able to create the vibe needed for the situations. It has an ending song which was also not bad .Overall (8.5/10): Out of the few Chinese animes I have watched so far ,‘Aiyou de mi shi’ stands out as one of the best among them in terms of quality of the story and animation. The story stops at a crucial point and it definitely deserves a second season. It hasn’t got even half of the recognition it deserves , probably because it’s a Chinese anime . If you are not bothered by the language, you should definitely watch this. Highly recommended. the scenes really justified the suspense tag it has.

If you're a fan of mystery, thriller, and psychological genres, it's worth checking out. The anime kicks off with a powerful start, although it encounters a temporary slowdown after episode 5. This momentum is effectively regained towards the conclusion of the series. However, the overarching story and subtle clues remained engaging, prompting me to reconsider earlier episodes, which little anime are able to do. The combination of pacing, hints, music, animation, the conclusion, and the central character, along with the unique focus on escape rooms, makes it a compelling watch....I'd rate it 8.5/10 I'd rate it 8.5/10"", ""This was honestly beyond my expectations!

It basically was the best way to grab people's attention with the escape room theme. As much as once could piece the story together, the ending still caught me hanging and wanting for more.There were definitely a couple of loose ends throughout but honestly it feels like they...were kept in purpose to enthrall the user experience and keep them wanting for more.

We're dropped into the life of Yuecha, as he and a work colleague visit an escape room called X&Y.

Angel Heart,https://myanimelist.net/anime/282/Angel_Heart,"[""Note: This series is a spin-off from another show called City Hunter, and uses many of it's characters. All I did before watching this series is read the synopsis for City Hunter, and I've had no problems following the story. It still may be preferable to watch City Hunter first though.Angel Heart starts by following professional assassin (trained from a child), Glass Heart, as she attempts to escape from her life of killing, by ending her own. But after a heart transplant, and a couple of years sleep, she's good as new. The new heart brings it's owner's spirit with it, and refuses to let...Glass Heart die, and so, Glass Heart escapes, to try and find out about the person the heart belonged to.The series is made up mostly of seperate story arcs, the first following Glass Heart's escape, the rest following her new life as she starts accepting missions to help people in dire situations, and in doing so, learning about life.The first arc is generally more plot-driven and a lot more fast-paced. After the first arc, things start to meander into character development, with far less in the way of action. If you have a short attention-span, you should be able to watch the first arc alone without worries, as it's a self-contained story.Since the series mainly follows character-development, the characters are important, and in my opinion, they've done well. The regulars are a variety of interesting characters that you should have no trouble watching for the length of the series. The characters that need help are also well made, with realistic reasons for needing help. Honestly, some of the coincidences in the series are a bit of a stretch, but still, they're well used.I'll also note that there are a fair few flashbacks about how Ryo became the City Hunter, and his relationship with Kaori. These may have been covered in the original series, but if you haven't seen it, then these will fill in a few gaps.This is a 50 episode series, but there's no real 'ending', things simply keep going without any further resolution beyond that of the first arc. And it is kind of disappointing. Also, with so many episodes, despite the series being good, it does start to drag towards the end.The art goes for a more realistic style than usual, (most notably, the eyes are smaller) and it's well done.One thing I wasn't expecting from this series was that it contains a fair chunk of humour. The humour is mostly character-based. For example, Seaba Ryo, the City Hunter, is a bit of a clown, and lot of a woman-chaser.The realistic art-style makes seeing the silliness of some situations that much stranger, and in my opinion, that much stronger. For instance, the gigantic wooden hammer (that makes only a couple of appearances) is obviously ridiculous, but it does actually look like a real object.To summarise, this is a good, mostly serious, character-driven series, that involves combat specialists helping people out of dangerous situations, though there's not that much action after the first story. There's also regular silliness to mix things up.And people with short attention-spans may only want to watch the first few episodes.You'll just have to decide whether to watch City Hunter first. If you haven't already. Glass Heart die, and so, Glass Heart escapes, to try and find out about the person the heart belonged to.The series is made up mostly of seperate story arcs, the first following Glass Heart's escape, the rest following her new life as she starts accepting missions to help people in dire situations, and in doing so, learning about life.The first arc is generally more plot-driven and a lot more fast-paced. After the first arc, things start to meander into character development, with far less in the way of action. If you have a short attention-span, you should be able to watch the first arc alone without worries, as it's a self-contained story.Since the series mainly follows character-development, the characters are important, and in my opinion, they've done well. The regulars are a variety of interesting characters that you should have no trouble watching for the length of the series. The characters that need help are also well made, with realistic reasons for needing help. Honestly, some of the coincidences in the series are a bit of a stretch, but still, they're well used.I'll also note that there are a fair few flashbacks about how Ryo became the City Hunter, and his relationship with Kaori.

Or can it be a new start in life?The show starts off with a quick pace. It starts with Xiang Ying aka Glass Heart assassinating a man in the park, but while she’s walking away, she over-hears a little girl trying to give that man an ice-cream cone and telling her dad that he can’t sleep or the ice-cream will melt. As a result, Glass Heart (the assassin) then decides to commit suicide by jumping off of a building. A year later,...after seeing some memories of the organ donors past, she wakes up in a mysterious place and finds her way to Ryo aka City Hunter. And that is where the story begins.The main concept this show uses is using many different stories over the course of 7 years to help shape Xiang Ying’s personality and help her start her life over and become human once again.  The stories that the show covers is typically romantic and heart-warming, yet filled with danger and excitement. They show basic morals and values and help Xiang Ying understand that her assassin skills can be used for good and not always just for bad. Throughout the show, you’ll see Xiang Ying become more like Kaori (the organ donor whose heart was stolen) and make almost everyone’s life she comes across, better.The music in this show is absolutely wonderful. It ranges from Goofy to Romantic and always seems to fit perfectly with the moods. The dialogue moves quickly at times, but that doesn’t make the experience any less fantastic. It’s nice to see that there can be some comedy and romance in a show that so often has violence.The characters are well thought-out. The background story of Kaori and Ryo is very romantic and subtle. The other supporting characters, don’t receive such a wonderful look at their personalities or backgrounds. Xiang Ying has the best character development, seeing how she had so little personality to begin with. At first, I didn’t like Ryo, I thought he would be evil and kill the person who received Kaori’s heart, but he turned out to be a wonderful guy who is goofy and clever. The synopsis and some reviews made me think that this show was brutal and unappealing, but in fact, it’s a very wonderful show and I hope others find it fascinating too.Overall, I really enjoyed this show. Almost every episode I found myself crying because the stories are just so wonderful. It’s nice to see that assassin skills can be used for good and not only for evil. This show can teach people a few good lessons and don’t let the number of episodes scare you either. Each story roughly covers 3 to 5 episodes each and the action is plentiful. I never found myself getting bored and I often felt that I had to continue watching the show and as a result, I lost a lot of sleep. A three day sabbatical should be a requirement to watch this show.Sub Group Used: [Ani-Kraze] after seeing some memories of the organ donors past, she wakes up in a mysterious place and finds her way to Ryo aka City Hunter.

Like the old series, he's interesting and fun, but this series focuses more on the young assassin girl who's gotten City Hunter's wife's heart.  The story's art is consistent and solid - good backgrounds...and no sloppy drawings.  It works very well for this somewhat dated story.  The show also has lots of potential and a somewhat interesting pre-romance that unfortunately never goes anywhere (also very typical - ugh!)- just like most of the series' other story arcs.Bad points: The story has about 40 different 'arcs' and never really completes any one of them to satisfaction.  It really feels like 10 separate stories that kind of loosely tie together but there's a lack of consistency or focus to the series as a whole.  You have one arc about the girl's implanted heart giving her memories of the woman it came from's life - highly implausible, but if they'd worked on that arc for a while, I'd have bought it.  There was also the one about the girl's real father - that one was mentioned and left hanging.  The one about the childhood friend / fellow assassin that was completed pretty well, but the romance that they hint at never develops past 'yeah, I kind of like you but don't come any closer or I'll kill you'.  You get the distinct impression that that poor boy (whom I grew to like) is really NEVER going to get any... I ended up feeling really sorry for him!Really, the bad points of this story are almost entirely story and character based.  I really wish the people that make anime would spend the time and talent that they obviously did illustrating, animating and producing this one on a story that more deserved it.  This one came off as wholly mediocre. and no sloppy drawings.  It works very well for this somewhat dated story.

I was wrong. Angel Heart not only succeeds in continuing where City Hunter left off, it also provides character and relationship development  that City Hunter lacked.Story:It starts with a professional female Assassin named ""Glass Heart"". She has...killed a handful of people and, although a professional, feels guilt and decides to commit suicide throwing herself off a building. But the ""Organization"" decides to save her by transplanting in her a stolen heart. That heart belongs to Makimura Kaori, Saeba Ryo\'s former partner. Many things lead to another and Glass Heart decides to meet with Ryo.The story starts off on a rather sad note, but dont let that fool you. After the first arc the story shows its true colors being a heart warming, emotional and sometimes funny anime. 9/10Art:light years different from its predecessor, my opinion is that the art of this anime reflects its emotionality and and drama. It\'s a really good touch and only amplifies the enjoyment. 8/10Sound:I didnt hate the op and ed. Actually I feel in love with the last op as it had an 80\'s feel to it (I like 80\'s music) lol. The voice acting was good, but I thought they could\'ve done better. 7/10Character:This anime excels in this aspect, especially if you\'ve seen City Hunter. Old characters are thoroughly developed throughout the show while new showing a few things unknown about them from City Hunter. On the other hand, new characters debut in harmony with the old ones while also developing throughout the show. But, as I\'ve said before, this is a dramatic show and it is to be expected. 8/10Enjoyment:I enjoyed it alot and I wish this review convinced you to watch it aswell.  I strongly recommend watching City Hunter first because it would cause what I like to call the ""Fumofu"" effect.

These 50 episodes, after 01~14, are separated into small ""arcs"" containing 3~5 episodes that are derelict from each other.To help you maximize your enjoyment, I give you a list of which episodes are good/bad. Which ones I think you must watch, and which ones you can but don\'t need to, and which ones I think you should not.[++] Excellent: You should watch these. Satisfaction guaranteed:Ep 01~14, Ep 32~41[+] Moderate: You can safely check these out if feeling curious or have enough time. But lower your expectations. They are in no way perfect, so...you might feel ""meh"" or great depending on whether you like soap operas. Expect drawn-out dialogues and occasional cringe:Ep 15~16, Ep 19~23, Ep 25~28, Ep 42~50[-] Terrible: I advise that you skip these unless you\'re really really tolerant and don\'t mind hurting your own eyes and brain. You have been warned:Ep 17~18, Ep 24, Ep 29~31That\'s the list. If your mind is already set on watching the anime, go do it. It\'ll be worth your time, I promise,  but I hope you keep this list in mind and know to either skip or tolerate bad episodes when they come up, and know that they won\'t last forever.Giving an ""Overall"" score for this anime series is very difficult for me because it is a blend of extremely good episodes and unbelievably terrible ones:- The female lead, Xiang-Ying,  is amazing. She\'s essentially a female clone of Saeba Ryo in terms of fighting skills but is extremely down-to-earth and believable. I\'ll choose her over Star Wars Rey any day (I do like Rey though)- Saeba Ryo is in a mentor role this time, and as I expect, he makes an amazing teacher. Humorous and mentally strong, in equal measure.- Umibozu\'s soft side is shown a lot more here than it was in City Hunter. I like it.- I love Xin-Hong and am a huge fanboy of Saeko. Their arcs resonate a lot with me. I\'ll let you find out which episodes are those (good news: They\'re all in the ""[++] Excellent"" category)- Kaori\'s spirit is an overused plot device. Like, I was neutral about her in the beginning, by the end of the series I\'m just very very sick and tired of her. This is an anime about living forward, not dwelling backward. Stop reminding us how great you are by telling us how great you are (good-ish news: Most of such over-usages are in the ""[-] Terrible"" episodes so if you follow my list you won\'t see too much of them).I hope this helps and, hope you enjoy the anime. There\'s only 24 out of 50 episodes to watch if you\'re trying to maximize your enjoyment.The music is marvelously done, and surpasses even some of my favorite series like Ghost In The Shell on many occasions. It\'s also extremely unfortunate because it seems the manga series had continued to run until year 2017, 11 years after the anime was cut short in 2006.Most great things that the series actually developed down the road in the manga ended up never included in the anime, which was made when the series was too busy finding its own identity to tell the best story it could. you might feel ""meh"" or great depending on whether you like soap operas.

It\'s a spiritual successor to the widely acclaimed ""City Hunter"" series, sharing characters and themes but carving its own unique narrative path.This anime is a compelling tale that follows the journey of Glass Heart, a skilled assassin whose life takes a dramatic turn after receiving a heart transplant from the protagonist of the renowned ""City Hunter"" series, Ryo Saeba.The story begins with Glass Heart, formerly known as Xiang Ying, working as a ruthless killer for the Chinese mafia. However, her life changes forever when she receives a heart transplant from...Ryo Saeba, a legendary ""sweeper"" known for his sharpshooting skills and sense of justice. After the surgery, Glass Heart awakens with no memory of her past life and a newfound desire to seek redemption for her sins.As Glass Heart struggles to come to terms with her new identity and the memories implanted by Ryo\'s heart, she embarks on a quest to uncover the truth about her past and find her place in the world. Along the way, she encounters a diverse cast of characters, including former associates from her days as an assassin and allies who aid her in her quest for redemption.Throughout her journey, Glass Heart grapples with questions of identity, morality, and the nature of justice. She must confront her own dark past while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld and facing formidable adversaries who seek to exploit her abilities for their own gain.At the heart of the story is Glass Heart\'s complex relationship with Ryo Saeba, whose memories and personality continue to influence her thoughts and actions. As she learns more about Ryo\'s past and the ideals he stood for, Glass Heart begins to understand the true meaning of justice and the importance of using her skills to protect the innocent rather than harm them.Angel Heart is a gripping narrative that blends action, drama, and mystery with themes of redemption and self-discovery. Through Glass Heart\'s journey, the series explores the power of forgiveness, the bonds of friendship, and the possibility of finding redemption even in the darkest of circumstances. It\'s a story that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end.The animation style is sleek and modern, effectively conveying both the intensity of the action sequences and the emotional depth of the characters. The series does an excellent job of balancing its darker themes with moments of levity, often provided by the interactions between Glass Heart and her newfound allies.One of the standout visual elements of this anime is its character design. Each character is distinctively crafted, with unique features and expressions that reflect their personalities and backgrounds. From Glass Heart\'s enigmatic presence to Ryo Saeba\'s iconic appearance, the characters are visually striking and memorable, making them easy to connect with and empathize with as the story unfolds.The series also excels in its depiction of action sequences.

The choreography of the fights is well-executed, with dynamic camera angles and smooth animation that keep viewers engaged and immersed in the action.Beyond its action-packed moments, this anime also showcases stunning backgrounds and environments that help to establish the mood and atmosphere of the story. Whether set against the backdrop of a bustling cityscape or the tranquil beauty of the countryside, each scene is beautifully rendered with vibrant colors and intricate details that draw viewers into the world of the series.The use of lighting and shadow further enhances the visual experience, adding depth and dimension to the animation. Whether it\'s the soft glow of streetlights illuminating a nighttime scene or the harsh glare of sunlight filtering through a window, the lighting effects contribute to the overall mood and tone of the series, enhancing the storytelling and immersing viewers in the world of Angel Heart.What sets the anime apart is its focus on character development. Glass Heart\'s evolution from a cold-blooded killer to a compassionate individual grappling with her past sins forms the core of the narrative. The supporting cast, including Ryo Saeba and other familiar faces from ""City Hunter,"" adds layers of complexity to the story, each with their own demons to confront.While maintains ties to its predecessor, it also stands on its own as a compelling tale of self-discovery and redemption. Fans of ""City Hunter"" will appreciate the nods to the original series, but newcomers will find plenty to enjoy as well, thanks to its engaging plot and well-realized characters.Overall, Angel Heart is a must-watch for fans of action-packed anime with a strong emotional core.

The beginning is kind of rough but when the show started going I found myself loving the cast and the relatable themes it touches upon . In addition as someone that was looking for some semblance of closure after watching City Hunter I sorta kinda got it here but I wish it was a legit fifth season instead of a spin off . The reason I'm saying this is because it finds itself in a very peculiar...position as it has way too many retcons to serve as the much needed conclusion to City Hunter (At the very least as head canon)  but at the same time it has way too many callbacks that won't do a damn thing to anyone that hasn't already spend a crap ton of time with these characters in the original seriesComparetively to City Hunter Ryo isn't nearly as obnoxious here and there isn't so much excessive filler but at the same time the action , Villains and music all took a massive step back . Regardless I recommend it if you got nothing to do with the one exception being if you're utterly allergic to J/K-Drama tier writing position as it has way too many retcons to serve as the much needed conclusion to City Hunter (At the very least as head canon)  but at the same time it has way too many callbacks that won't do a damn thing to anyone that hasn't already spend a crap ton of time with these characters in the original seriesComparetively to City Hunter Ryo isn't nearly as obnoxious here and there isn't so much excessive filler but at the same time the action , Villains and music all took a massive step back . Regardless I recommend it if you got nothing to do with the one exception being if you're utterly allergic to J/K-Drama tier writing"", ""Let's clear up a certain misunderstanding, 'Angel Heart' is NOT a sequel, reboot and it's barely a spin-off of 'City Hunter' (which is a series I absolutely love). This series is a stand alone story, an alternate reality, where in the characters (Ryo, Saeko, Umibozu, Kaori and Hideyuki) are all from the original series but they've been given different, yet still similar, origins. This series introduces new characters to the franchise that just absolutely fit.This is an excellent series filled with drama, heart, action and fun. I am, without a doubt, biased towards this series.Admittedly there are some parts of the series that are considered...lacking or even dull and repetitive but the characters and story telling are solid and enjoyable. I love this series, it's not the greatest ever done but for the 'Hojo Lovers' out there it's one of the best.You'd think fifty episodes would be a bit much but the series is separated by story arcs making it feel less episodic but rather like having chapters in a novel.Everybody has their own tastes but I sincerely hope those that get the chance to watch this anime do and enjoy it as much as I have.Please look into its predecessors too, 'City Hunter' and 'Cat's Eye', and enjoy the music. lacking or even dull and repetitive but the characters and story telling are solid and enjoyable.

Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Lite,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15687/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai_Lite,"['This mini series. This Mini Series. THIS FUCKING MINI SERIES can be described in several words in my opinion and those are:Phenomenal, Hilarious, Entertaining, and probably one of the first 30:00 of a mini series (combined in total) that I sat through and continue to adore.Tbh, I never liked youtube that much but this right here, my friends, has given me a new light of hope.Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Lite is an alternative adaptation of its parent story, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date! Lite) that debuted before the original series. It\'s like...a little preview, or a foreplay before the real thing begins.The series debuted as short episodes aired on KyoAni\'s official YouTube channel. While the series doesn\'t stand out much on its own, it was entertaining. No. I\'ll say it again. It\'s bloody entertaining.Some of the main characters make their cameos in this mini series. We got the one eye patched girl Rikka Takanashi, the main heroine who has apparently made a contract with Togashi Yuuta. She also has this interesting eye behind that eye patch known as the ""Wicked Eye"" that looks somewhat like Laura from IS. No, screw that. Rikka\'s eye is wicked, beat that!Yuuta also makes his appearance as well. He is a young boy who believe himself...as Dar-. Well, actually I\'ll leave you to check out the real series for the more detailed info. He has some funny instances in this mini series. Other characters also get their spotlights as well like Shinka and Yumeha. Despite their relative short appearances, it\'s entertaining to see them doing what they do. Hell, even watching Kumin ""Pillow Senpai"" Tsuyuri doesn\'t make me want to sleep and grab a pillow. No. This series did not put me to sleep at all.The artwork of the mini series is still generally the same as its parent adaptation. Like daughter, like mother, the moe like faces of characters and KyotoAni\'s glorious animation are there. Remember Hyouka\'s art this year? Ya, you get the idea.As for the music, it\'s comedic and remains most of the same. No, wait. The OP song ""Kimi e (君へ)"" by ZAQ is different! It didn\'t give me an eye seizure like the original series but instead was dramatic. The ED however was...oh God, how do I even describe it?Search up the word ""cute"" on thesaurus.com and you\'ll get a general idea.Overall, this lite series was a delight for me. There\'s not much of a story but who cares when you got delusions, comedy, and the cast that KyotoAni presents to us. All in all, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Lite is a ""8"" in my book. I\'m probably overpraising this but for a 30:00 of a series, this was just...phenomenal. a little preview, or a foreplay before the real thing begins.The series debuted as short episodes aired on KyoAni\'s official YouTube channel.

Nothign changed from the series.Art: The art is pretty solid especially considering it was made like 15 years ago. Animations look solid and Omegamons fight with Diablomon is awesome. But the last fight when Diablomon is defeated bothers me. I dont...know why they did that or if they just didnt have any budget left but the Digimon looked static and not as smooth as in the other fights and didnt change their stance at all whilest being in mid air for like 20 secs. It looked really off. Other than that you will be able to enjoy some nice Omegamon action again.Sound: I dont know if I have to say anything about the sound. Its Digimon. Its awesome.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the film. Its not as good as its prequel and it suffers from 1 or 2 plotholes along the way but in the end it is an enjoyable experience for every Digimon fan. know why they did that or if they just didnt have any budget left but the Digimon looked static and not as smooth as in the other fights and didnt change their stance at all whilest being in mid air for like 20 secs.

That would be most of the cases for us die-hard fans into the mystery, thriller, and horror theme that the original series bought us.However, in this OVA, we see a more brighter side of Mei Misaki and her ""other half"".

But you\'re still probably asking yourself ""should I watch this even if I\'ve seen the original series?"" Let me answer that with a 7-letter word:Depends.Why? Because this is a mini-prequel. In other words, this is not what happens after the series or an anime that will throw bloodshed at your screen every 5 minutes.

And that calm will soon turn into calamity as disaster strikes into the heart of Yomiyama.So, all in all, this OVA is entertaining but not something I\'ll remember by for a long time; at least not like the death of you-know-who in the original series or that Nice Boat episode when the class went to the beach.

This really helped to enhance the feelings of intimacy conveyed throughout, and to allow us to connect more on a personal level, to Mei.I have no doubt about it that by watching this prequel, you\'ll come to understand Mei\'s back story much more vividly. It seems as though this was the reason behind releasing an episode 0, and especially due...to the inclusion of real scenes from episode 1 (of the main) - the story comes together beautifully.I really found it nice to see Mei so happy for a change, during this episode. The show reflects some Slice Of Life-like elements, and it works well in bringing out the thoughts, feelings and emotions of Mei and her Sister, that were originally going to remain untold. However, contrary to this supposedly ""dramatically less dramatic"" feature, i can say however that the show retained its sense of uneasiness. Contrasting with what i\'ve said about it being a chilled out piece, it still manages to incorporate some of the show\'s signature fear inducing, edge of the seat presentation tactics.This is an essential piece for fans of the show to watch! to the inclusion of real scenes from episode 1 (of the main) - the story comes together beautifully.I really found it nice to see Mei so happy for a change, during this episode.

Here we see Mei Misaki\'s twin sister Fujioka Misaki who is very dear to Mei. We also see the evil Kouichi who we know is gonna kill the soon to be extra and the other Kouichi whom Mei met in the hospital. This OVA is a bit different from its parent anime, co\'z unlike the parent anime only the mystery and drama genre are in it, let\'s not forget that the time setting is before the start...of the school year, so therefore what happen to Mei\'s twin sister has nothing to do with the curse of class 3-3. So for the story I give it a ""Good"" number 7, since the drama that is the meeting between the twin sisters is very touching. But, for the art........I\'m not much into being an art critic, so a ""Mediocre"" number 5 will do and for the sound since the opening is still the same as its parent anime\'s opening theme, the same score applies.Character: Good 7.I really like the appeal of Fujioka Misaki, she seems to be a girl who probably knows that her time is coming and that she would like to enjoy it with Mei, but it is rather vague as to why the parents would prefer Misaki over Mei, and that is a mystery. Then again that mystery about the sister is why this part deserves such score.Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.Unlike the parent anime were we the audience are made to wait for the climax, this OVA is more of the soft side, needless to say that the title alone is basically for Fujioka Misaki since it is all about her plus the  tragedy for Mei to loose someone she cares deeply. Definitely, it is something which one would sympathize with Mei\'s loss as more tragedy awaits her as the school year starts....... which has already been shown from the parent anime. of the school year, so therefore what happen to Mei\'s twin sister has nothing to do with the curse of class 3-3.

More times than not, I find them to be nothing more than just padding to a series that is completed and provides nothing extra for the fan to really enjoy.However, I found this OVA to be a bit different. While it didn't exactly provide anything that new to the original series, nor did it provide anything to anyone who watches the OVA before the original series, it still stung deep in my opinion. Why?For those who did watch the original series before the OVA, this gives us an in-depth look at...Mei's personality and her relationship with her twin sister, Fujioka...and a bit of a spoiler...how Fujioka dies. For those who watched the series, that doesn't come as much of a surprise as that fact is revealed pretty early on in the series.What struck me about this OVA was the close, personal relationship the two sisters had for each other. If you look back at Mei's personality during the original series, it was dry, hollow, and essentially closed off from her classmates and family. Compare it to this. Mei had such a close relationship to Fujioka, apparently the only person she could confide in and act like herself. All things considered, it was tough seeing this because in one, short string of events, Mei lost her sister and best friend, has a distant relationship with her mother due to her not being her real mother, and became the extra in the class so she could talk to no one about what troubled her. I can't imagine the sort of sorrow I would feel if all these events happened to me at once. If anything, it makes me appreciate she was able to meet someone like Kouichi, who was the only one that would speak to her during this troubling time. I believe that's what this OVA does best...expresses the sort of sorrow Mei went through at this time and understand the significance of meeting Kouichi.Now that I got that out of the way, here's how I scored it...Story - 8In retrospect, this OVA doesn't do a whole lot for the overall story. It does show the details behind the Misaki sisters before the start of the series...but that's about it. As far as the overall conflict in the original series, it doesn't have a big impact.Art - 10I find the artwork of Another to be really, really, good. The OVA certainly doesn't lack in that department.Sound - 9The music, as usual, fits pretty well and the voice acting is solid as well. Then again, there are only three characters that are actually dubbed so its hard to rip any of it unless it is really bad. I found both Mei's and Fujioka's voices fit perfectly.Character - 10If we're talking characters, I'd like to gives this more of a 13 or 14 score. It was really that good. As I mentioned in the previous comments, what this episode did for the character development of Misaki Mei was outstanding.Enjoyment - 9I'd say this is a pretty enjoyable OVA. I did think it was a little slow at times and wished it would've delved a little farther into the other aspects of Another (*spoiler* Like how Reiko died or Kouichi's transition to Yomiyama *end spoiler*). However, I really, really enjoyed watching the Misaki sisters relationship in action.Overall - 9Pretty close to giving this a 10, but like I said, this didn't provide a whole lot on the overall story. It's essentially a character profile on Misaki Mei, and I am completely alright with that.Final Thoughts - If you read this and didn't watch the series first, shame on you. Although, don't let that discourage you. The series is also really, REALLY good. All this OVA provided was a small background snippet on Mei that didn't play a whole lot into the overall story. If you did watch the series first, I felt this OVA did a nice job giving us a closer look at Mei. It's hard not to admit that seeing Mei's cardboard personality during the series was a little hard to watch at times, but to me, this opened up a lot about Mei and explains why she acts the way she does. After watching, it is VERY understandable now. Looking at this OVA from that regard, it's hard not to admit it is a worthwhile watch. Mei's personality and her relationship with her twin sister, Fujioka...and a bit of a spoiler...how Fujioka dies. For those who watched the series, that doesn't come as much of a surprise as that fact is revealed pretty early on in the series.What struck me about this OVA was the close, personal relationship the two sisters had for each other. If you look back at Mei's personality during the original series, it was dry, hollow, and essentially closed off from her classmates and family. Compare it to this. Mei had such a close relationship to Fujioka, apparently the only person she could confide in and act like herself. All things considered, it was tough seeing this because in one, short string of events, Mei lost her sister and best friend, has a distant relationship with her mother due to her not being her real mother, and became the extra in the class so she could talk to no one about what troubled her.

Basically, watch this only if you like Mei or yuri. Don’t watch this otherwise, it’s a waste of time. Above all, don’t expect this to have a story.Story: 6/10This is supposed to be a prequel to Another. It does a nice job being a prequel, since it makes you feel with characters but it does an awful job being a prequel released after the original. Why? You’ll learn nothing new in this. Actually, you learn completely nothing that wouldn’t have been...said in Another. Probably the only thing you’ll learn is why Mei was carrying the doll to hospital basement in the first episode but if you had at least one brain cell activated during the show, you'd have already known that. The only thing you can see in Another 0 is twins getting as close together as they can. There’s a bathing scene, “date” (sort of) scene, sleeping in one bed scene... you get the point.Art: 9/10Art fits MUCH better in this cuteness overload that it did in the brutal murder overload that was Another so not much of a problem here.Sound: 6/10It wasn’t bad but opening and ending from Another were used here and it affected the rating a lot. I actually liked them; the problem is that they completely didn’t fit in this. Cute girls having yuri moments constantly really shouldn’t have an opening that will make you expect a monster popping at you and an ending completely unrelated with it full of characters that didn't appear.Characters: 6/10The only thing I can say is a cold girl interacting with her exact opposite. That’s as far as characters go. There’s no one else with screen time longer than 1 minute.Enjoyment: 4/10To me it seemed like this wanted to get money from its moe factor and nothing else. Those scenes weren’t even proper yuri since they are twins. I’m not really into moe and cute characters being cute (squared here) so I was tempted to stop watching several times.Overall: 6/10This was boring to me. But if you like moe, Mei or yuri scenes watch this. You’ll enjoy it definitely more than I did. said in Another.

But for fans of the series (such as myself), it\'s a necessary episode to watch. Why? Because it\'s a missing ""piece of the puzzle"" that properly explains the reason behind Mei\'s forlorn personality and attitude towards the curse.I feel that this episode reveals the reason why she chose not to interfere with the deaths of the curse victims despite having the ability to do so and also why she chose not to reveal the identity of ""the dead person"".[Minor spoiler] Because while...watching this episode I realised that Mei must have somehow predicted/noticed the impending death of her sister (probably through her ""eye"") and attempted to save her [see Ferris Wheel scene]. In the end however, her sister died anyway and Mei realised that she couldn\'t do anything about her sister\'s death afterall.Which is why in the series, she felt that it wouldn\'t have made a difference whether she revealed or tried to help the victims at all.Of course, that\'s just my personal opinion. Maybe I\'m thinking too much but that\'s how I\'m going to interpret the episode.It\'s important for everyone to watch it and come to their own conclusion. watching this episode I realised that Mei must have somehow predicted/noticed the impending death of her sister (probably through her ""eye"") and attempted to save her [see Ferris Wheel scene].

In fact, it was much lighter than the series itself and a pretty enjoyable watch. However, my warning is to not make the mistake of watching this first, a mistake that I had made.One of the strong points of Another that I had found was the suspense. Many elements of the story, how it is told, and the music that accompanies it contribute to that. It was truly a horror series unlike any...that I have seen, not that I have seen very many...Nevertheless, I advise that if you want to enjoy the main series fully, you should watch this after rather than before. This nugget actually does endow you with some knowledge that makes the mystery in the series (especially the early parts) less of a mystery.This OVA basically shows an aspect of the story that was mentioned in the series. It provides a little extra for the fans. It contains an ebb and flow of light and dark, but mostly light. For viewers who have already seen the main story, this is just a more detailed flashback. You'll find some wonderful moments of innocence and fun (a little fan service as well), but also moments where you're left dangling - literally in one instance. Overall if you liked the female protagonist, you'll probably find this to be an additional dosage to soothe your cravings. In fact, you get to see a side of her mostly devoid in the main story. But you'll understand why after watching this, if not already.Unfortunately, if you are a viewer who has yet to see the main series, please save this until the end.

If you watch this first, you will not get the experience intended.

And this does not squander on anything else, it\'s all about Mei and her sister.

Anyway, the animation is great, moving on.The music is used from the original anime series, because why create new music just for an OVA? I don't know. You could create a new opening, but that would be even more weird. Just for a one episode OVA why not create an entirely new opening? It'll be great!Since this is about Misaki and her twin sister, every single character is awesome.

During the series, there's minimal character development, which they make up for here. Mei's character is so developed here that you won't recognize the girl at the beginning of the OVA and at the end of it.Overall, this was an amazing episode that makes me want to rewatch/reread the entirety of Another all over again.I would recommend this if you: are an Another fan, like angstI would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like AnotherHave a great day everyone! my faves forever, and the background music always fits the events of the episode well.The characters: oh boy.

Doraemon Movie 17: Nobita to Ginga Express,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2675/Doraemon_Movie_17__Nobita_to_Ginga_Express,"[""My overall take: An entertaining romp that culminates in a high-stakes encounter, though I find the conflict less interesting than the journey.In this movie, Nobita and his friends take a trip on a train that traverses the Milky Way. This is a fun one, especially once it's revealed that the final stop of the Galaxy Super-express is an amusement park built on a cluster of planets, with each planet having its own theme. Watching the main characters go from planet to planet trying out the different facilities is quite entertaining.Just about everyone gets a moment to shine in this story... except maybe poor Suneo, whose...main role is getting body-snatched by an alien parasite. Additionally, Shizuka's primary contribution (discovering that the parasites are weak to soap solution) mostly seems like a cheap excuse to show her bathing onscreen. Gian's moment is actually very cool, however, and Nobita is the one who gets to finish off the main villain. It's a consistent trend in the Doraemon films that Nobita often comes across as more heroic than he usually does in the main series, but this may be the movie that shows off his precision shooting skills (one of the few things he excels at) the most.That being said, I found the main conflict in this movie to be somewhat less engaging than the more lighthearted parts. For such a high-stakes narrative (including the first and probably only example in the Doraemon movies of a villainous party that wants to take over the entire galaxy), the way the plot unfolds feels surprisingly low-key. That is especially true considering the unusual nature of the villains here, being parasites that can take control of their hosts, which could have been used to build a suspenseful atmosphere in which both the protagonists and the audience were kept in the dark about who'd been possessed and who hadn't. Yet even though the parasite that takes over Suneo's body does trick the main characters by masquerading as him, that concept is otherwise not explored much, with the climax ultimately consisting of a fairly straightforward pursuit and a mostly one-sided battle sequence. Despite my minor gripes, however, this is certainly a distinctive Doraemon movie with its own unique charm. main role is getting body-snatched by an alien parasite.

Dororo to Hyakkimaru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5760/Dororo_to_Hyakkimaru,"[""I must warn you at this point: even if this is a children's anime, it is very gory, and has cruel themes going on (starvation, child slaughter, war...). But no sex nor rape, obviously. Many of the monster scenes would be considered way too scary for children today.As of writing this, only half of the episodes have been subbed. I understand some japanese, so the lack of subtitles wasn't a problem, since the story is quite straightforward. Knowledge of old fashioned and slangy japanese is useful, if you wish to keep up with the characters' lines.Story:I haven't read the manga, so I didn't have any...expectations when I started to watch this. The story took me by surprise! It was enjoyable and reminded me of some old japanese folk stories. I would compare the feeling to watching Mushishi, except that Dororo has lots of action going on and less monster lore thrown around.The first half of the series has a gripping storyline, with a lot of character development. The episodes' storylines could span 2-3 episodes. After that the series gets a bit loose, and I can't help but feel the episodes have a filler feeling to them. They also change to the one-episode-per-storyline format, which didn't do good for the pacing.The last episode ties things up hastily but is okay. The ending development could have started a bit sooner, so the pacing would've worked better.Art:I'm actually pleased that this anime stayed black and white. The colored pilot doesn't have the same eerie feeling. I also like it that they made Hyakkimaru look older than in the pilot. The animation is okay, though there are some wonky parts here and there. As an animator, I can forgive them.Sound:I really liked the music in this series (though the opening theme is too catchy :D). If you like biwa, you'll like it too. The music reminded me of Ninja Scroll, which is my favorite. The sound design is old fashioned, and I recognized some nostalgic sound effects that were a norm even in the 80's.Sometimes the growling sounds were more funny than threatening, and I would've liked more variety in female voices.Characters:The first half of the show is a bit more focused on Hyakkimaru, and the last half on Dororo. It's not too black and white, but I would've liked the story to be more evenly divided between the two. I liked how Nota (the dog) also had important moments in the plot, and wasn't there only to look cute.The series has a wide cast of secondary characters, of which some are more memorable than others. But I liked it how they were easily distinguishable from each other; a trait that isn't that well handled in more recent anime.Enjoyment:As mentioned before, the plot was great in the first half, but lost it grip in the second half. I did watch the whole series during a few days, so I guess it was gripping enough.Overall:If you like wandering samurais, yokai and old school kids' anime, this is for you.

This older adaptation appears to simplify a good deal of the supernatural lore and character depth found from the remake with Hyakkimaru appearing to have psychic abilities for sensing his surroundings and communicating with others, Dororo being more hot-headed and bratty, and Daigo Kagemitsu portrayed as a pure villain. Plus, the number of demons that Hyakkimaru has to slay to reclaim his body parts is...48 instead of 12 from the remake. It looked like reducing the demon count for the remake was to allow the series to focus more on developing its story and characters instead of Hyakkimaru's slaying of demons he encounters on his journey. Granted, simpler storytelling was the norm with TV anime of the 1960s. But said simplicity does have its ups and downs throughout Dororo's run.Far as pros go, the 1969 Dororo anime actually does a pretty solid job of story building for its first half and dabbling into horror with its presentation. The story developments within Dororo for its first half are divided up into 2 to 3 episode arcs. Some story arcs dabble into Dororo and Hyakkimaru attempting to investigate and slay a demon within any village they travel to, while others serve to explore backstory with the pasts of our two lead characters. It looked like the series was planning to gradually develop our two lead characters throughout their journey, notably when Hyakkimaru does eventually come to confront members of his biological family in the later part of the anime's first half. Far as the horror goes, the anime's black and white presentation helps enhance the visuals with depicting how monstrous the demons confronted by Hyakkimaru are and setting up story arcs across 2 to 3 episodes helps create slow enough pacing to create genuine suspense out of the confrontations that Hyakkimaru and others have with enemy threats. I understand the anime was originally meant to be in color, but made black and white due to budgetary constraints. As commented, this aesthetic decision actually helps benefit the anime's element of horror. Adding to this, the anime is surprisingly violent for its time period with plenty of spilled blood and dismemberment found throughout its run. I didn't mind the violent content in question as I felt it necessary to reflect the brutal nature of Japan's feudal era with the corruption of the samurai class and the demons that exploited the suffering of humans they haunted. But I was under the impression that there weren't TV anime with that level of violence during that era since they were largely aimed for younger audiences.Setting aside praises, the 1969 Dororo anime has a good number of issues. The second half of the anime deviates from the plot structure of its first half by largely focusing on episodic plots exploring Hyakkimaru's slaying of demons. This leads to the series taking a big hit with its focus on further exploring its plot and characters, as well as greatly reducing the suspense of Hyakkimaru's encounters with demons confronted since the demon-focused plots have quicker pacing and are resolved within the span of a single episode. Apparently due to Osamu Tezuka abruptly ending the Dororo manga series, many episodes for the TV anime's second half were exclusive for the anime and this shows with the hit in quality for the show's storytelling within its second half. Not helping matters is the final episode being rather compressed and lacking proper buildup with showing Hyakkimaru's final confrontation with his evil birth father and the very sloppy handling of Dororo's gender reveal.The simplicity of the storytelling does also work against my reception to Hyakkimaru's character. The so-called psychic powers that he has for interacting with others and following his surroundings in spite of lacking much of his body parts and functions reeks of lazy convenience written into the series and this element of his character is actually never mentioned or explored until a later episode has him make a passing mention of this after regaining the ability to talk. Matter of fact, the anime has some noticeable inconsistencies with Hyakkimaru regaining specific body parts or functions in spite of still shown using his body prosthetics all the way up to the final episodes of the series. The 2019 remake does a much better job of portraying the difficulties that Hyakkimaru has with moving around and interacting with others outside of demon slaying until he gradually regains more of his body parts and functions.While I'll admit Dororo is a unique beast for its time with its elements of horror and solid first half, it gets quite sloppy in its second half with changing up its plot structure and rushing with its finale, as well as offering enough issues with Hyakkimaru's character in believably portraying his disabilities. While I'd at least recommend seeing the 1969 Dororo anime once due to its historical value, I still find the 2019 remake to be the definitive version of Dororo to check out due to its stronger plot building and character development. 48 instead of 12 from the remake. It looked like reducing the demon count for the remake was to allow the series to focus more on developing its story and characters instead of Hyakkimaru's slaying of demons he encounters on his journey. Granted, simpler storytelling was the norm with TV anime of the 1960s. But said simplicity does have its ups and downs throughout Dororo's run.Far as pros go, the 1969 Dororo anime actually does a pretty solid job of story building for its first half and dabbling into horror with its presentation. The story developments within Dororo for its first half are divided up into 2 to 3 episode arcs. Some story arcs dabble into Dororo and Hyakkimaru attempting to investigate and slay a demon within any village they travel to, while others serve to explore backstory with the pasts of our two lead characters. It looked like the series was planning to gradually develop our two lead characters throughout their journey, notably when Hyakkimaru does eventually come to confront members of his biological family in the later part of the anime's first half. Far as the horror goes, the anime's black and white presentation helps enhance the visuals with depicting how monstrous the demons confronted by Hyakkimaru are and setting up story arcs across 2 to 3 episodes helps create slow enough pacing to create genuine suspense out of the confrontations that Hyakkimaru and others have with enemy threats. I understand the anime was originally meant to be in color, but made black and white due to budgetary constraints. As commented, this aesthetic decision actually helps benefit the anime's element of horror. Adding to this, the anime is surprisingly violent for its time period with plenty of spilled blood and dismemberment found throughout its run. I didn't mind the violent content in question as I felt it necessary to reflect the brutal nature of Japan's feudal era with the corruption of the samurai class and the demons that exploited the suffering of humans they haunted. But I was under the impression that there weren't TV anime with that level of violence during that era since they were largely aimed for younger audiences.Setting aside praises, the 1969 Dororo anime has a good number of issues. The second half of the anime deviates from the plot structure of its first half by largely focusing on episodic plots exploring Hyakkimaru's slaying of demons. This leads to the series taking a big hit with its focus on further exploring its plot and characters, as well as greatly reducing the suspense of Hyakkimaru's encounters with demons confronted since the demon-focused plots have quicker pacing and are resolved within the span of a single episode. Apparently due to Osamu Tezuka abruptly ending the Dororo manga series, many episodes for the TV anime's second half were exclusive for the anime and this shows with the hit in quality for the show's storytelling within its second half. Not helping matters is the final episode being rather compressed and lacking proper buildup with showing Hyakkimaru's final confrontation with his evil birth father and the very sloppy handling of Dororo's gender reveal.The simplicity of the storytelling does also work against my reception to Hyakkimaru's character.

Despite being an anime from the 60s, Dororo to Hyakkimaru does not disappoint. The story itself is super interesting, and tugs at the heart in a tragic way. Even though the story definitely has its comedic and cute points (the dog omg), it really shows the traumas of war and poverty and the lengths people go to just to survive. I think the funny thing is this story really should be called ""Hyakkimaru to Dororo"" because the story\'s main protagonist is hands down Hyakkimaru, while Dororo is a sidekick (with a twist. I was NOT expecting that at the end. Very cool to throw...that in there).Really great to watch! I haven\'t watched the modern version yet, but I\'m starting with this one and I thoroughly enjoyed it. that in there).Really great to watch! I haven\'t watched the modern version yet, but I\'m starting with this one and I thoroughly enjoyed it.', '*SPOILER WARNING*Daigo Kagemitsu is a man who desires power. Political power, to be exact. One night, he decides to sacrifice forty-eight of his unborn child\'s body parts to forty-eight demons to gain more power within Japan. When the child was born, it only had a head and a torso. The baby, soon after it was born, became an orphan. One day, a doctor named, Juko, found the baby and decided to take care of it. He named it, Hyakkimaru. As Hyakkimaru got older, Juko had to create prosthetic body parts for him, and that\'s when Hyakkimaru noticed that monsters were around him on...a constant basis. He was being haunted by the forty-eight demons, and was told personally that if he wanted his original body parts back, he must slay all of the forty-eight demons. Whenever he defeats a demon, one of his body parts is returned to him. Hyakkimaru, while on his journey, saves a young boy by the name of, Dororo. Dororo is a orphan just like Hyakkimaru, and after being saved by him, he admires Hyakkimaru and chooses to follow him on this dangerous journey.Dororo to Hyakkimaru is a pretty good show. The only major flaw that I noticed while watching was with some of Hyakkimaru\'s body parts. I mentioned earlier that when a demon is slain, Hyakkimaru gains a body part. Halfway into the show, Hyakkimaru is given a voice. He says, ""Dororo, I can finally speak!"" Up until that point in the storyline, Hyakkimaru was a mute, yet he speaks for the entire show. Dororo responds with, ""But you\'ve been speaking this entire time."" Hyakkimaru explains to Dororo that he hears everything he says in his mind or some bullshit like that. Same thing goes for his eyes and ears; he was incapable of seeing and hearing from the very beginning, yet he interacts with other characters within the show, and slays demons ಠ_ಠ. Hyakkimaru is practically a Japanese Hellen Keller! That flaw aside, the show is good.I can see a lot of people turning away from this show, because of how it looks and it\'s age. Personally, I\'m not bothered with how the show looks. I\'m not that ignorant to the point where I would avoid a show just because of the way it looks. The story is good, the music is catchy, especially ""Dororo no uta,"" and the two main characters are cool. Dororo is a little annoying and gets Hyakkimaru in trouble sometimes, but he has his good moments. I\'ll give this show a 7.3/10, the last episode is probably the best episode. a constant basis.

When Dororo was first announced and started serializing, that was a challenge for me to undertake, I didn't watch to mùiss out of the weekly hype bandwagon, so I decided...to go with the one that still has the scent of packaging, and leave the older adaptation for later to experience, perhaps watching the neer one is the way to go, as I was wishing that the production team will improve on the things that the original did wrong.I was satisfied, after finishing the 2019-recut, and thus, the need for watching the original series had already faded out a massive bit from what it was before, filling me with a sense of laziness that will have me go about seeing a daunting 26 episodes of black and white 50 years old animation when my backlog that has all sorts of highly praised series in it is still calling for me to dedicate the time and effort needed to seal them off for once and for good. Well, what do I have to do? So I bit the bullet and sat through what I was hesitating to watch the most. And it was quite the experience.Story (7/10):I don't know what would be more shocking, seeing the original then jumping over to the recut or vice versa. Changes have been made, some for the better, but some, oh boy.Just like we set off from the recut, the original does it the same way on a narrative level, while changing up some details and character treats to suit the time period of its release. With an inspiring episodic pace, for each day its own story, which sometimes has to branch into a 2-episodes tale (A very familiar formula that we see the 2019-recut following).Looking at how the original tells its story, there were a lot of drop details that we didn't manage to get in the recut that are actually pretty pivotal and vitally consistent that make a lot of sense for some stuff that we never understood in the remake. Some story arcs were also missing, some of which I think make the best out of the original, like the animal abuse centric arc that I think was dropped from being re-adapted for obvious reasons.Art (6/10):Well,let's be honest, it is 50 years old, and in black and white while at that. Now, it is not the aesthetic direction's fault per se, in fact, Dororo Pilotm the special episode that pre-dated this TV adaptation had colors, so the technology was there, however, they have made the right call of having it in white and black for how much atmosphere that alone adds to the scenery, demons are actually scary looking for once, and the backgrounds look so dead and rotten, perfectly conveying the tone of the narrative on a visual level.I was not a fan of the Astro-boy heavy inspired art style, but who is there to blame for that, at least Dororo fit that art style just nicely.My only complaint really is the unnecessarily drag up still frames that some times would have certain characters star for lengthy periods before a fade-in transition happens which really hurts the pacing at some portions.Sound (8.6/10):“Hoge Hoge Hogetara Heera Hera”I was mesmerized. The last thing I was expecting to impress me, right after the visuals are the vocals. It is expected from something this old to have bad sound composition, but man, seriously, this one is up there with the best I've heard in Anime.The voice acting was, well, very conflicted, there is so really well-done performance, like Dororo's (My favorite), the voice of a spoiled bratty child that feeds of making trouble, and you can tell that much and more just from hearing her voice, I might even put her performance slightly above, what the remake has. Hyakkimaru had a surprising deeper voice than I expected, but it grew on me more than the remake's did.But the real star here was the OST and opening/ending theme song.Let me just reaffirm what Joey (The Anime Man) said, it is a freaking party bander. Well, I saw one of the comments describing it as “something that Dororo would sing, while the remake's opening was more like something that Hyakkimaru would sing“. It is just a stupidly catchy song that I find myself signing it out lout even at the most serious of moments.The OSTs are just phenomenal, most shows I watch, which still have some amazing audible compositions, this one just surprised me the most, given its age and dimmed popularity.Characters (6.5/10):There was a lot to be desired.The only character I won't complain about is Dororo. Even her flaws are permissible given the bratty role she's enclaving, however, Hyakkimaru does not emit the proper vibes you'd get from a disabled doll seeking to slay back its humanity. For starters, he just can talk and then have enough confidence in calling Dororo out “You're just imagining what I'm saying by reading my mouth just a moment after he supposedly gained his speech back”. Also, despite lacking other sense, he always acts like he doesn't and leaving it to a shameful lazy excuse to clear up the doubts when he finally gains whatever he lacked back. And don't even get me started of the Dororo's gender reveal at the end, it was just so random and sudden that it did not matter in the slightest.Nota, the friendly dog was a welcomed member of the trio, I'm surprised they did not have him in the remake for how wholesome and fun he made everything when he was around.Ah, Tahomaru, the persona people hated the most in the remake, saying that he lacked personality and proper development, well, will you even consider him a perper character in the original by any means? The dude screams of “I'm unimportant”, he had a trivial and minimal role in the whole story, like some side characters made more of an impression than him. And Daigo, well, he is more of a piece of shit in this one.Enjoyment (6/10):For the most part, Dororo to Hyakkimaru was daunting and kind of gritty when it came to watching it. Maybe modern Anime spoiled me far too much, but the series did have a lot of flaws, but also, some strong points that kept me going. It is hard to sit through the first half, but until you get used to it, it becomes like a bag of Doritos that you know is bad for you in large sums, but you still drill into its bottom anyway.Overall (6.82/10):I wouldn't necessarily have this as a recommendation, especially in this day and age where Anime is produced in a large mass.

Doupo Cangqiong,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36491/Doupo_Cangqiong,"[""I'm writing this review after watching all 3 seasons of the anime as well as all the specials that are available at this moment.This review will be spoiler free, so feel free to read before you watch.The first season of Doupo Cangqiong is garbage, there are no other ways to put it. The story is stale and have been done many times before. Normally I don't have a problem with overused stories as long as the execution is good, but as you guessed it, the execution is also trash.Story:This story starts with our protagonist Xiao, Yan. When he was just a young boy, he...had great power that surpassed everyone his age. He was a genius, and because of his amazing abilities, he was engaged to Yan Ran, Na Lan, a girl from a powerful family. Just as everything was going well for Xiao, Yan, something terrible happened. After he turned 11, his power stopped growing and even became weaker as time went on. After three years, he was one of the weakest in his family, and deemed useless by his peers.Because of this, Yan Ran, Na Lan wanted to break their engagement as she doesn't not want to be married to a useless husband. This was devastating to Xiao, Yan's family as her family was very powerful and sacred off people who tried to take over.In the Heat of the Moment, Xiao, Yan promised a 1v1 with Yan Ran, Na Lan in 3 years time. If he was to win, he can do whatever he wants with her, but if she wins, she'll get to break off their engagement. From there the story begins.Conclusion:The reason I said the first season was garbage isn't necessarily because of the plot, but more of the poor execution when it comes to story telling. It was incredibly boring to watch the predictable plot points happen one after another. The music used isn't that great, even the OP is questionable. Overall the whole season could have been cut down to 3-4 episodes.However, I'm writing this review not to drive you away from watching this anime as the second and third seasons are so much better after a new animation studios took over. I recommend skipping through the first season or reading the webnovel so you know the main plot points and moving on to the next seasons.This season is a 5 out of 10 at most while the next two seasons are easily 7-8 out of ten. So please, do not turn away from a great anime due to this first shitty season. had great power that surpassed everyone his age.

Prompted by her immense disrespect, Xiao Yan stands up to defend himself and the agreement; Nalan Yanran (the fiance) concedes and strikes a Three-Year Agreement with him to delay the annulment. After that agreement, Xiao Yan finds out the reason for his decline in cultivation and under the direction of a mysterious teacher, trains in preparation for the Three-Year Agreement duel return the humiliation Nalan Yanran foisted onto him.PlotThe plot for BTTH S1 is pretty standard, especially for a cultivation story. The MC, Xiao Yan, is a fallen genius, and is now the ridicule of others who once looked up to him. Others come to kick him while he\'s down, including his fiance. But he soon finds out why he has fallen and once again regains his talent under the guidance of a mysterious teacher. This storyline is (now, maybe not back when this novel was written) a very common opening for a revenge-type story.The portrayal/plot presentation does have many issues, but that\'s mostly an adaptation problem; as a standalone story, it is not as bad as I originally thought, but it does seem way to childish and convenient.CharactersThe characters for the show are also pretty normal for this type of Xuanhuan cultivation story. The MC was a genius, fell, and is now a genius again. The villains/bullies are your typical stock ""bad guys"". There isn\'t anything exceptionally good or bad to say about them. The show (and novel) are more known for Xiao Yan\'s personal adventure than the world building, plot, or the villains.AnimationOkay, so despite my initial impressions on the character design that made me choose to watch Origins as my starting point for this donghua series, I have to say the designs of the environment are not that bad. The animation overall is also done fairly well, considering the age of this season. The character models, however, are horrendous. The character model designs/style remind me of disney character designs (though the clothing is inspired by ancient chinese clothing), except they are not as polished and thus I consider it a discounted disney aesthetic; the ""good"" characters look better than the ""bad"" ones in a very disney-esque fashion. When it comes to the fighting animation, it is also very basic and average, nothing to write home about; they follow the same basic design/appearance as the characters and I personally consider them unappealing(ugly).Final ThoughtsDespite my severe distaste with BTTH S1 because of how it presented the plot in the donghua medium, it was not as bad as I thought once I put down my disgust for the plot changes and the character designs. The animations and designs are, as a whole, consistant and pretty good, the plot is cohesive enough, and the important characters have their own distinct traits. However, the biggest problem by far is how childish everything seems, especially compared to the rest of the seasons.Score: 5/10Adaptation Review:Okay, this part is the review of it as an adaptation with a comparison to the ""remake"" Origins. I WILL eviserate this because I think it does a great number of things wrong as an adaptation.To start, after watching this in full, I still suggest going to Origins, both because of the uniform character designs with the rest of the donghua (this S1 was done by a different company, which got fired after the disasterous reception of S1) and because it presents the most important parts of S1 in a more novel-accurate light.Now, let\'s talk about BTTH S1 and what it does right from a adaptation perspective. There are two main things that this does well: it covers more of the events from the novel (including many of the frivolous and annoyingly childish confrontations) and it has all the basic information for understanding cultivation basics presented in some kind of infodump explaination. The infodump format isn\'t the best, but at least it has that information (unlike Origins). But that is where the good ends.Now when we get to the things that BTTH S1 does wrong:The first and most obvious change is that they changed the atmosphere. Starting from the hook, the marriage annulment, the scene got changed to be VERY VERY childish, both the characters and the atmosphere. Xiao Yan was supposed to be matured after 3 years of ridicule while Nalan Yanran was selected as the successor of a very powerful sect, yet the two engage in a name-calling shouting match? This doesn\'t conform with their respective positions. After that, many other scenes feel dumbed down and childish.After this would be the changes to the actual plot. There are numerous changes here, changes make developments too convenient or don\'t make sense. For example, Xiao Yan\'s interaction with Ya Fei, the proprietress of the auction house; in this scene, instead of the business negotiations in the novel, she is simply attacked by kidnappers when he is doing a negotiation: that is the dumbest way that negotiation could have ended in Xiao Yan\'s favor, why would you leave potential witnesses for something like this AND he revealed his identity unlike the novel where Ya Fei figured it out herself. Other examples include: Xiao YiXian\'s entire encounter with Xiao Yan; the donghua encounter felt like a very cliche harem member introduction instead of the more nuanced and complicated realtionship beginning that the two had. Finally, in the ending of the season, they made Xiao Yan some kind of chick magnet where basically every girl he interacted with has some kind of feelings for him or he has some kind of feelings for her setting up a harem setting when romance was not the focus of this portion of the story at all.Then comes change to the characters and how they act. Xiao Yan, rather than the matured individual from the novel, acts much like a child. He crys easily and makes very dumb decisions among other things. For example, he cries after the marriage annulment, which is out of character when compared to the novel.  For the villains, the head of the other families are just empty suits, as the son, Jia Lie Ao is the one apparently making the plans for his father.For Xun\'Er, this season was the best chance they had to develop her relationship with Xiao Yan. They did some decent scenes, but most of her concern and helping Xiao Yan in the dark (without his knowledge) was mostly cut out. In the novel, Xun\'Er clearly has a powerful background, but this isn\'t really even hinted at in this season and most of her covert actions to help Xiao Yan were excluded, like: paying off the family when Xiao Yan\'s father wasted money on the pill from the auction, sneakily trying to take out more money when Xiao Yan looked like he didn\'t have enough, or giving him a powerful Qi Method other than simply mentioning it in the donghua. They also eliminated some of the subtle but not subtle implications of Xun\'Er\'s affection for Xiao Yan (like the comment about Xiao Yan only treating her like a sister when she wanted more).Finally, I was annoyed by the fact that they changed Xiao Yan\'s signature weapon from a ruler to a greatsword.Ugh, anyway, I think I have made it very obvious that I dislike this season\'s adaptation of BTTH. There are so many changes to the story that I have given up trying to point them all out, and even though it covers more events than Origins, I think it does a worse job presenting to story. I still prefer the Origins ""remake"" to this.Adaptation score(how faithful to source): 5/10 Zhi Qi rank 3, making him the ridicule of everyone in the family.

If you have never seen a cultivation story, Doupo Cangqiong will get you familiar with all the tropes of the genre in their purest form.Cultivation stories are very popular in China, in this type of story individuals accumulate some form of energy, usually called Qi, by a process similar to meditation. The accumulated Qi is that individual\'s cultivation and allows then to become powerfull and prolong their life. The cultivation process is often subdivided into several...stages, which allows one to have an idea how powerful an individual is by which stage of cultivation he is in.Doupo Cangqiong follows the story of Xiao Yan, who as a kid was touted as a genius with great talent for cultivation. However, suddenly and without apparent reason, Xiao Yan\'s cultivation stopped progressing and in fact started to regress, which made his reputation take a turn from genius to trash. The show follows Xiao Yan\'s climb in the cultivation world, from trash back to prodigy.One of the staples of cultivation stories is that the main character is both overpowered and weak at the same time! You may find that statement odd, but because cultivation takes place over many years, older characters tend to be stronger than younger characters. There are no ""old man past his prime"" in cultivation stories, the older a character is, the more time he had to cultivate. Doupo Cangqiong makes full use of this dynamic, alternating situations where the main character is heavily outclassed and situations where he gets to be an overpowered badass dealing with people around his age.It must be said that season 1 is by far the weakest of the show. This show was a pioneer in the recent explosion of chinese 3D shows and as such, it took then a while to get a proper handle on it. Based just on season 1, I wouldnt recommend this show. However, having seen the subsequent seasons I definitely recommend getting through it to get to the latter seasons. The latter seasons have improved character models, the animation steadily improved from season to season and the fight choreography improved as well.For me, season 1 earns a rating of 5, but the show as a whole (up to season 5) earns a score of 7, with the more recent seasons being clearly better than the early seasons. stages, which allows one to have an idea how powerful an individual is by which stage of cultivation he is in.Doupo Cangqiong follows the story of Xiao Yan, who as a kid was touted as a genius with great talent for cultivation.

Apparently, next seasons got much better. I'll watch them and write reviews at appropriate pages.I will give my honest, one-line review: This shitshow brutally murdered one of the best parts of the story. A complete massacre.Story:If you have already read the novel then don't watch this. MC's character was horribly nerfed. Some key points of the story were horribly changed. These changes actually affect the entire story's continuity. It should have stuck to the original story instead of this horrible improvisation.Art:The art is fairly decent. Arguably, a notch above other similar titles. However, some of...the over dramatic scenes ruin the mood.Sound:Fairly good sound effects. Maybe tone down a little bit to be better.Character:Again, MC's character was horribly nerfed. Also, some of the key characters were brutalized. Some key character developments are missing. Some characters don't make any sense anymore.Overall:For viewers who haven't read the original novel, it's a good show, 7/10. But for people who have read the story, it's horrible. Giving it a 5/10 is already very generous.Finally: Watch at your own risk. the over dramatic scenes ruin the mood.Sound:Fairly good sound effects.

It's short and more aligned with the story. Old season 1 is quite bad and lengthy, so start from reanimated season 1 and go for all seasons. It only gets better season after seasonstory is great and only gets better with time. character developments good too.only drawdown will be naming in the whole anime is quite confusing or subbed weren't that good and this is usually problem with Chinese animes and if you're used to it you will have no issues ""]"
Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1858/Gakuen_Utopia_Manabi_Straight,"[""What a wonderful series. I am so glad I decided to watch this anime. I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to say it&rsquo;s one of my favorite, maybe  one of the greatest anime I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by its childish loli-looking exterior, what lies in this anime is the bittersweet and heartwarming message of moving forward.The story is set in the future, where schools&rsquo; populations continuously  decrease, and is about girls brought together by something as simple as a student council. They develop such a strong bond throughout the series, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen an anime where friends were this close. Mainly...it is about them preparing and then trying to revive the school fair, which turns out to be a long struggle. There is the lighthearted and funny moments (mostly brought on by Momo with her refreshingly odd antics) but there are also sad and dramatic times. Each episode will bring on different emotions, some sad, some happy.I love the animation. Each shot seems to be carefully done, and though some angles can be odd, others make the series a piece of art. The music is well done too, and the opening is so beautiful and becomes so clear as to what they've done once you finish the last episode. The ending theme is a little strange  considering it is stop-animation, but perhaps this is one of the things that makes this series just a little different.What I was very impressed at, also, was that when the times of Manabi singing, the lip movements actually correspond with the words perfectly, instead of going up and down. This isn't true the whole way through the anime, but there were instances where I saw the brilliance shine forward into tiny details such as that.A strong controversy sets out over the &quot;loli&quot; factor. Yes, the girls are drawn looking cutesy and they look much younger than high schoolers, but if you get past that in which would attract viewers who would only watch this show for the cute girls, you see a deeper interior of a sweet, heartfelt anime that deserves to be watched.There are also other debates as to whether to consider this shoujo-ai. They do blush a bit with eachother and hold hands, and things could be inferred there, but nothing is taken too far. I believe the story tries to focus more on friendship, but obviously there are some undercurrent hints.However, I cannot give character as high of a score as I would like. The characters may be sweet and likeable, but really most aren't developed enough. While I realize it would take away the point of the show to feature their home lives, this results in a lack of character development. This could have been made up for by each character having an episode of their own besides Mei, whom in episode four you really get to see inside of her. Also, you would think the main character would be Manabi, but it is mostly shown through Mikan's perspective, probably the reason being Mikan is the person Manabi affects the most. So we see this change in Mikan... but do we really get to understand Manabi, and why she fervently defends the school she has been at a significantly short while?You do get to go into Mikan and Mutsuki&rsquo;s relationship a bit, which is nice; however, the a couple scenes with them proved to be a bit confusing, because it gives the viewer no knowledge of what is happening beforehand, at the current time, or afterward. It&rsquo;s sort of a key point to why they are good friends, too&hellip; perhaps I missed something. I believe their episode is episode 6.Don&rsquo;t get me started on Momo. All we know about her through the entire series is that she has no attention span and she wealthy (which I&rsquo;m not sure you really see until the OVA anyway). She may have been adorably odd and a treat to see on screen, but it&rsquo;d have been nice to explore her personality a bit more. Yet despite these flaws, the characters are still enjoyable and each girl&rsquo;s personality is different, but they still all become good friends.To sum it up: the animation is great and the art is adorable; the characters are cute and very loveable but some could be better developed; the opening and ending themes are amazing but the BGM is forgettable; and the story is sweet and poignant and the end suggests a positive outlook in life. The basic concept of the story is maturing and growing up, while still maintaining relationships. Though this may not be anyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, I still recommend this highly and Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight reminds one of my favorite anime. it is about them preparing and then trying to revive the school fair, which turns out to be a long struggle.

This anime features wonderful creativity and enjoyment to the maximum, while not being bogged down with heavy clich&eacute;s. I will not hesitate to say that it is probably my favorite slice-of-life series and probably one of the most touching series I have ever watched.5 words review: Deep, touching, fun, cute, epic.Story: 10/10The story is amazingly simplistic yet its plot is complex. In fact, this whole series is about the student council and the Seioh School Fair with absolutely no action or romance. There's not a lot of comedy, and it is basically a slice-of-life drama (weird, I know). Manabi Straight uses...the school fair to explore the true meaning of friendship, endeavours, and dreams as Manabi, Mika, Mei, Mutsuki, and Momo go through trials of hardship to find their courage and understand the bonds that they share. I love it for its ability to turn something so simple into a beautiful work of art.Art: 9/10For some series I often notice weird character facial expressions, awkward animation sequences, or lazy screen shaking/panning/scrolling, but for this series the art is really excellent. Of course, it is nothing that makes you say &quot;wow,&quot; but there's just no flaw. It is a solid series with good enough animation to capture the vast range of emotions the series portray. What I love best was the opening sequence that made so sense. Aside from being one of the most artistic and best animated opening sequence ever, it is very &quot;cool,&quot; matching the energy of Manabi and other student council members.Sound: 9/10Once again I would like to point out that the opening sequence was excellent, and it had an extremely catchy song to go along with it. Other than that, the background music was excellent and nothing seems out of place. It should be noted that Yui Horie voices Manabi, and she sings the Seioh school anthem, a pretty song, in many occasions throughout the series. Insert songs, especially good ones, are always a plus.Character: 8/10As well as this series convey feelings and emotions, nothing is really known of the characters outside of school. Manabi Straight is strictly about school and rarely do the characters go outside of school, and even so, it would be for a school activity.  Manabi and Mika's out of school life is pretty much most explored, but for Mutsuki, Mei, and Momo, no one really knows anything about them. However, their personality and and actions are quite unique and noticeable, which gives them character, unlike other shows with three girls that are just too similar. Oh, and did I mention? The characters are way too cute (this is a good thing), even though they're in high school. It adds an interesting element to the plot, as well as showing the difference of experience between high school students. For example Takako, Aikoh's student council president, is shown to be taller and about high school age, and she is usually more mature and organized.It should also be noted that a very widely known voice acting cast is used for Manabi Straight, including Yui Horie and Aya Hirano. The results are generally positive.Enjoyment: 10/10This category is very important, because Manabi Straight is often a &quot;hit of miss&quot; anime for many people! This means that there's one group that finds it extremely good while there's another group that finds it pointless. Since this series really have no meaningful story, it could be understood why some would hate it. The meaningful part of Manabi Straight is the bond of friendship, and while people prefer action and romance to create drama, I personally find friendship a very unique yet powerful source for drama. I often forget how important the bond of friendship is, and this series did well to remind me of it.Overall: 9/10I consider the series excellent, and even though it has lots of valuable messages, its best points were being enjoyable and &quot;cool.&quot; I love how this series does comedy. It's definitely not overdone to take over the drama, but it is there enough to release tension. There are also some interesting additions, such as how the girls blush when they hold hands or are talked to, but I assume that this goes nowhere and that it's just there for fun. But overall, it is a series not to be missed, especially if you're taking a break for romance/drama or just trying to find something unique and interesting. I am personally impressed at how much a series like this could impress me. Don't miss it! the school fair to explore the true meaning of friendship, endeavours, and dreams as Manabi, Mika, Mei, Mutsuki, and Momo go through trials of hardship to find their courage and understand the bonds that they share.

Insert songs, especially good ones, are always a plus.Character: 8/10As well as this series convey feelings and emotions, nothing is really known of the characters outside of school. Manabi Straight is strictly about school and rarely do the characters go outside of school, and even so, it would be for a school activity.  Manabi and Mika's out of school life is pretty much most explored, but for Mutsuki, Mei, and Momo, no one really knows anything about them. However, their personality and and actions are quite unique and noticeable, which gives them character, unlike other shows with three girls that are just too similar. Oh, and did I mention? The characters are way too cute (this is a good thing), even though they're in high school. It adds an interesting element to the plot, as well as showing the difference of experience between high school students. For example Takako, Aikoh's student council president, is shown to be taller and about high school age, and she is usually more mature and organized.It should also be noted that a very widely known voice acting cast is used for Manabi Straight, including Yui Horie and Aya Hirano. The results are generally positive.Enjoyment: 10/10This category is very important, because Manabi Straight is often a &quot;hit of miss&quot; anime for many people! This means that there's one group that finds it extremely good while there's another group that finds it pointless. Since this series really have no meaningful story, it could be understood why some would hate it. The meaningful part of Manabi Straight is the bond of friendship, and while people prefer action and romance to create drama, I personally find friendship a very unique yet powerful source for drama. I often forget how important the bond of friendship is, and this series did well to remind me of it.Overall: 9/10I consider the series excellent, and even though it has lots of valuable messages, its best points were being enjoyable and &quot;cool.&quot; I love how this series does comedy. It's definitely not overdone to take over the drama, but it is there enough to release tension. There are also some interesting additions, such as how the girls blush when they hold hands or are talked to, but I assume that this goes nowhere and that it's just there for fun. But overall, it is a series not to be missed, especially if you're taking a break for romance/drama or just trying to find something unique and interesting. I am personally impressed at how much a series like this could impress me. Don't miss it!"", ""I swore when I seriously started writing reviews that I would never give anything a perfect rating. No anime was flawless no matter how great I thought it was. However, Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight is the closest thing I've found to perfect.Set in Japan in the near future, Manabi captures the outlook of its setting better than any other series that's tried to work out such a scenery. It is made clear with a national birth rate crisis reflecting the current steady drop in Japanese citizen births, as well as advanced but realistic technology such as streamlined buses, computers built into desks, and student organizers...that are essentially limited-function Blackberries. These subtle points serve to add an extra glow to the already wonderful story presented.Manabi's plot is so basic it may almost be seen as a flaw, but alas it cannot. So often do we get caught up in the grandeur anime has to offer that it becomes increasingly difficult to enjoy the simple story Manabi presents. But as is the theory regarding real life, Manabi takes great pleasure in the little things. Cleaning up what will be your office, making sure an assembly presentation is complete, recordng video interviews of your friends...  all of these are either easy or mundane, yet for Manabi they are crucial plot elements and are thus treated with proper gravitas.Likewise, Manabi's story is not just an event-to-event episodic process like so many modern slice-of-life series are. Manabi is clearly a linear storyline. Episodes begin with character development, begin to introduce conflict simultaneously, flesh out the conflict once the characters are developed, conflict is properly resolved, and the story is even given time for a dynamic epilogue that brings the message of the series full-circle. This is proper storytelling, paced to perfection with each episode having its own moment of new resolution for a contained or continuous conflict. I can think of nothing to take out or add upon.Manabi is lead by five high-school girls, including the titular character. This is another point where Manabi stands out as well. Though each girl is given a requisite character archetype, their personalities were still given room to grow to the point that it no longer becomes acceptable to say &quot;oh Mei's just a typical tsundere&quot; and the like. Perspectives are also another plus as far as characterization goes, as the series starts leading us to believe it is from Manabi's perspective, yet it becomes clear as the series progresses that it is another girl through whose eyes we are watching the story unfold, and rightfully so as the epilogue demonstrates.Though character designs are skewed young, similar to Lucky Star, they are appealing and don't pander to moe extensively. Cute, but not sickeningly so, and within reason. More to the point, the fact that the characters were drawn in a &quot;loli style&quot; doesn't do anything to harm the series as a whole. Besides, any high-schooler can tell you that just because they were 16, that doesn't mean they acted like it.Manabi was animated by the spotty, hit-or-miss ufotable. All the stops were pulled out for Manabi though, from the gradient-style hair colors to the richly detailed web sites and chat room discussions. Animation flows smoothly throughout and frequently touches upon movie quality for its more poignant scenes. It's work that could hardly be improved upon and easily the studio's shining star for quality. One can only hope that ufotable animates another series of this art quality soon. Of course, ufotable included its penchant for a clay-mation ED sequence, but that is only to be expected, and the sequence is well choreographed despite its appearance.The accompaniement is provided by first-time composer Yasuhiro Misawa, and I pray that this is only a taste of what is to come. The soundtrack captures the urgency of Manabi's pace with appropriate music throughout, ranging from slow and serene, to frentic and uplifting. No track is quite the same and quite a few well probably memorable for every viewer; the most memorable arguably being the *CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP* that decorates every next episode preview and other scenes. The OP and ED, originally songs by the late, etheral Ritsuko Okazaki are now sung with a headier sound by famous seiyuu Megumi Hayashibara. Both are quite good.The vocal performances however are all wonderful. Voiced by a blend of veterans and rookies to the field, each gives their all to their respective performance, capturing all the individual nuances of every single sentence. It's quite possibly the best ensemble cast for a slice-of-life anime, and arguably one of the best ensemble casts of any anime.At this point I think it's rhetorical to ask if I enjoyed it. This series took me to every possible emotional high and, despite its short run, satisfied me to the upmost. Everything about this series has left me with nothing but good impressions. Though personal biases will easily detract some from watching this, those with an open mind regarding the style should come running. Anime does not get much better than this.Overall, I proudly give Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight a 10 out of 10. that are essentially limited-function Blackberries.

Anime does not get much better than this.Overall, I proudly give Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight a 10 out of 10."", ""Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! is a classic example of looks over substance. While not totally devoid of any redeemable qualities, it's hard to recommend Manabi Straight to anyone, as it is simply outclassed by too many other choices.The story revolves around the Seioh high school student council and its attempt at organizing the school fair. Underneath that lies a story of friendship between the five girls who takes part in student council activities. However, neither of these stories succeeds in gathering much interest for one important reason: the characters.Simply put, after the initial impressions, the characters of Manabi Straight get stale very quickly. You have...Manabi, the hyperactive student council president; Mikan, the mousy and insecure treasurer; Mei, your typical tsundere in an all-girl setting; Mutsuki, the cheerful tomboy, and Momo, the side character with the attention span of a goldfish. There's not much to the characters beyond that, and if you have watched any significant amount of anime, none of the characters would strike you as original; but more importantly, the key flaw is in the lack of meaningful character development. Viewers are never given a glance behind Manabi's over-excitable disposition, hence they never come to understand her zealous passion for the school. Mikan's growth from her shy self is done in the ancient formula of &quot;confidence through friendship&quot;, the kind of stuff you would expect from series aimed at younger children, such as Digimon. The only meaningful character development happens with Mei, but most of that takes place in one episode during the first half of the series, leaving the rest of Manabi Straight rather dull.The underlying friendship story concerning the student council as well as the rest of the school is just not very compelling, partly because of the caricature-like main characters, as well as the cliche developments that you would be able to see coming from a mile away. Because of this, it's very hard to actually care for  the personal struggles of the characters or the school fair, which accounts for much of the overly simplistic plot.On the bright side, the art style of Manabi Straight definitely scores it some much-needed points. The colors are very pleasantly vibrant, both in the backgrounds and on the characters, producing an unique sheen. The characters are drawn in a slightly chubby style that is probably cuter than their actual personalities will ever hope to be, though trying to pass them off as high school students is a very long shot. Beyond that, the animation in the movements and mannerisms of the characters are above average, though the detail is never too high when dealing with the simplistic (but pleasant) character designs.In the terms of sound, the seiyuu of Manabi Straight did a fine job, though Mikan's mousy voice may get on some viewers' nerves at by the end of the series. The musical score consists of nothing too memorable, but nothing offending either. The opening, ending, and insert songs are also commendable, but once again fail to leave much impression.In the end, beyond the refreshing art style, Manabi Straight fails to impress. With a story more suited to younger audiences, yet a concept that appeals to older viewers, it suffers from a sort of identity crisis. The comedy is sparse, the drama is weak, the plot is cliche, the characters are generic -- reflecting upon these facts, Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! probably turned out better than the sum of its parts. Of course, that's not saying much, as Manabi Straight remains merely a mediocre experience.

Of course, that's not saying much, as Manabi Straight remains merely a mediocre experience."", 'Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight, or just Manabi Straight, is a school life anime that has been mostly forgotten by time. The term “underrated” is a somewhat contentious way to describe a show, (because who is to actually decide if a show receives enough attention/phrase?) and risks sounding pretentious or overly-emphasizing a show’s quality. However, in my eyes, Manabi Straight is a truly underrated show. With less than 27,000 members registered on MAL and only a mere 100 favorites, I feel that its lack of lasting attention from most anime fans is disappointing. It bears some obvious narrative similarities to the likes of Lucky Star, K-on...and Azumanga Daioh, yet unlike those shows, has not been beloved by time in the slightest. There are certainly reasons for this, and I do think Manabi Straight is more niche of a story and has far less widespread appeal than the former three. Still, Manabi has a lot going for it, and is certainly worth a watch for those that enjoy the aforementioned anime.Manabi Straight is, to put it bluntly, a show about a bunch of cute girls in high school. However, Manabi handles a setting and attitude that I have never seen in another anime. Unlike most school life shows from this era, there is no initial school pride or excitement from the characters to enjoy their academic duty. Manabi takes place in 2035, where Japan remains mostly unchanged, besides the increased work force for its citizens from an earlier age. High school is made optional, and job opportunities and trade schools are opened up to teenagers very early on. Realistically, most teens in this world choose to begin their careers sooner, deciding on a solid paying work schedule over four more years of mandatory education. Due to this adjustment, high schools are a dying breed, and are constantly merged into one another because of the lack of both teachers and students attending. The kids at these high schools are mostly independent, studious, and appear to be even bored, focusing on their schoolwork first and having little interest in the excitement of high school activities. This concept feels unique right off the bat because it allows for some obvious questions. What will the characters get up to in the show if they are not even interested in going to school? What are the different perspectives and attitudes towards this system?Enter the main character Mikan, an adorable and easily flustered high schooler senior who was roped into running her high school’s student council. Mikan is without a doubt, Manabi Straight’s protagonist, as she has the most meaningful interactions with each character and the strongest development throughout the story. The titular Manabi herself plays the Kamina to Mikan’s Simon, constantly motivating and humbling her friend in hopes of seeing the leadership and strength that Manabi recognizes is there. Mikan begins the show by sloppily presenting a slideshow on the student council’s importance and attempts, halfheartedly, to encourage her classmates into joining her. She is paid no attention by anyone, not even the teachers, and loses her motivation quickly on this cause. Manabi then steps up to the stage, excitedly announces her want to help Mikan, and then SINGS the school’s anthem for a few minutes. This entrances the crowd briefly, as they sit both confused and curious about who this Manabi girl even is. Thus starts the story of Manabi Straight, as these two unlikely girls are now joined together in hopes of bringing back school spirit and fun to this futuristic, less school-dependent society.Manabi Straight’s first three episodes ultimately serve to introduce the main plot and characters, managing to be both a strong start to the central narrative and a lot of fun on their own. The ultimate destiny that Manabi wants to accomplish is a School Festival. In Manabi’s eyes, that will be her last hoorah for the senior class and a way to motivate interest in the dying out high school setting. Manabi and Mikan indocturate other members to help with their school festival, members who join somewhat half-heartedly initially but do progress and begin to share Manabi’s spirit. Although the main five girls are fairly simple and serve mostly as means to help the story progress, they are still a lot of fun and really entertaining to watch. Manabi is a spirited leader and the heartbeat of the show. Mikan is a somewhat timid and grounded girl who agrees with Manabi’s ambition, though is less blatant with showing it. Mei is tightly-wound and focused, Mutsuki is bold and well-respected by the school, and Momo serves mostly as comic relief/to even be the eyes of the audience. Although these characters do fit obvious archetypes, and are not the most nuisanced outside the plot/their roles within the show, I still found myself endeared to them greatly, and wished I could have seen more of them. The little moments of them sharing excitement together, working on planning for the festival and even just spending time relaxing are always comforting.Each episode of Manabi simply portrays a portion of planning for the school festival. Small arcs occur, typically involving setup for the big day (like indoctoraing clubs, signing petitions, getting motivated, etc.) Although I think Manabi Straight is mostly consistently good throughout, there are a few moments in the mid section that felt slightly forced and cheesy. The biggest for me being Manabi’s brother dating Aikoh’s principal, which felt only present in the story to create added internal conflict for Manabi. Aikoh’s principal’s role and personality felt kind of forced in general, since most of the other teachers and adults within this story were endeared by Manabi and her excitement for the festival. Still, these qualms are few and far between. Big moments happen in almost every episode, from friendship developments between the characters to the ever-emotional scene in episode 10 in which Manabi is able to bring her entire school together.Episode five definitely deserves a mention for being my personal favorite in the entire series. This episode focuses only on two characters and their hesitant friendship due to past circumstances. As the episode progresses, the two characters learn more about one another and complete different tasks without reliance on outside forces helping to break the tension between them. I am a big fan of montage scenes that are able to show off progression in a brisk yet emotional way, and this episode definitely does not fall flat in that regard.The ending of Manabi is also truly special. The characters graduate in the last episode, a common destiny for shows about girls in high school. However, Manabi takes its story a step further by showing the characters after high school, and showing each of their decisions they made for their futures. This definitely adds further weight to Manabi’s story, and really makes the entire show completely justified for just how well it wraps itself up.If I had to describe Manabi Straight’s story in one word, I would choose “cinematic”. Each episode of Manabi flows into the next as if it were a film. Little time is wasted for less important moments that would be service to the audience, as the show feels tight and most scenes feel somewhat necessary. Of course, Manabi Straight is still a show about cute high school girls. There are moments of silliness, weird interactions or just a second to look at the character in a cute pose. Still, it really feels like Manabi Straight is emphasizing the importance of its message and using its characters’ development as tools strictly for that mission. Shows like Lucky Star and K-on have more character interactions and variety in topic, which gives both of them the advantage of making one more invested in the characters by the end. However, neither of those shows have the consistent central story of Manabi. Where Manabi lacks the wide variety of discussion and added personality to its characters, it decides to prioritize the linear message of how important this goal for the characters is. I feel that this benefits the show greatly, considering it is only 12 episodes and it was a treat to see a well-done story about high school girls instead of taking up that time for random bullshit and typical tropes.Comedy wise, Manabi Straight is pretty strong. There were several instances when I laughed out loud at scenes and jokes, usually due to the unique timing. Manabi’s style could be described as a mixture of both slapstick and dry humor, often involving weird actions from the characters or a few seconds to let something bizarre that was spoken sink in. An example of this is in the first episode, when Manabi herself is late to school. She frantically asks a girl (later introduced as Momo) walking by for directions, and is pointed a few feet away from the steps going up the hill to school. Manabi completely ignores the steps and flies her scooter straight into the trees next to it, constantly whipping through trees to get to the school on the other side. And at times, the absurdity of a moment is the joke. Halfway through the show there is an entire scene of the characters losing their minds due to being overworked/experiencing sleep loss. Mikan begins to wreck their club room out of desperation to reorganize it (a common symptom of overstress) while Mei, Mitsuki, and Manabi taunt each other out of frustration and take turns smacking one another in the face. The ridiculousness of scenes such as this one provide further realism and character interactions, allowing for the potential happening of the Student Festival to be all the more important to the audience as it is for Manabi’s characters.Manabi Straight’s animation and art design can be described as ambitious and high-spirited. UFOtable may be known as the “Type Moon” studio nowadays, handling both the Fate and Kara no Kyoukai franchises, and pairing those stories with highly stylized and bright digital animation. However, a decade or so ago UFOtable had a very different aesthetic, which came across in both their graphics and stories. Their shows featured colorful and poppy animation and cute rounded character designs (you can see this in other 2000’s UFOtable productions like Ninja Nonsense and Dokkoida) and Manabi definitely continued this trend. Everything about Manabi’s setting is alive and bright, from the whimsical looking school to the detailed club room. Each girl’s room and house is shown throughout the show, and each of these settings is filled with so much variety and specific detail that they all have strong distinctions. And by the end of the show, the viewer will have somewhat of a spatial idea of the school, considering the show’s tendency to show off different angles and areas that the characters have wandered. This may seem like a pedantic compliment, but it is one I truly was very excited by. It is not often I can say an anime has made me feel aware of its central location’s proportions and that they have stuck in my mind, since that seems like an afterthought for a lot of shows, especially high school comedy ones.While I can not defend Manabi Straight as having the best animation ever, or even being a contender for that contest, I can strongly state that it has some of the most unique and interesting animations cuts I have seen. There are many little moments throughout that stick out and add an increased flavor to the show’s direction. Manabi growing wings as she motivates her club and flies around as her ideas are portrayed around her. Mei sitting in her lit-blue bedroom sadly while only her video game’s reflection is shown bounced off of her wall, which feels very Hideaki Anno inspired. And episode four must be praised for having the most interestingly animated scene in the entire show. A flashback showing an entire classroom of students with blindly neon inverted colors, emphasized in that fashion to show Mei’s despair and unease. Manabi Straight just feels unique with the way the characters move and interact within its universe. It often shows very blatant animated symbolism, which of course adds intrigue and enhanced attention due to straying away from stagnant direction.Of course, I can not discuss the artwork of Manabi Straight without mentioning the character designs. Manabi’s Straight’s characters are all drawn as cute and goofy looking lolis topped with bright hair, which I am fully aware will immediately turn off an entire crowd of viewers. However, it should be mentioned that everyone in Manabi’s story looks that way, even the adult men have rounded proportions and somewhat cutesy faces. Personally, the weirdly juvenile and innocent designs did not detract any of the show’s likability, and instead contributed to its unique narrative (which is of course, a coming of age story). The characters in Manabi also often make silly faces or have funny mannerisms (Manabi’s iconic raised fist is a big stand out) and I was admittedly endeared by just how cute they could be at times.Manabi Straight also has an extremely memorable and outright delightful soundtrack that suits it well. Each background song has so much personality and care put into it, often complimenting its given scene with grace. Fully orchestrated string pieces are played with the more melancholic and poignant scenes, and the upbeat moments are paired with upbeat clapping and what sounds like a really fun jam session. Manabi Straight also has one of my top five favorite openings ever, which might be surprising to some, but I can not deny how much of a fun earworm it is. Sung by the ever-wonderful Megumi Hayashibara, who has not only talent in voice acting but singing, “A Happy Life” is a motivating ballad with sweetly sung lyrics and exciting buildup in the background instruments. The characters are shown running around their school and appear almost as if they are being videotaped, shown in interesting angles. This video may appear nonsensical for a first time viewer, but has incredible payoff in the context of the ending.So do I recommend Manabi Straight? Obviously, I just gushed about it for a dozen paragraphs. If you are a fan of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things shows, you owe it to yourself to watch this one for its uniquely structured story and likable characters. If you are into original anime in general, or just want to see a tightly done yet fun narrative, it is also recommendable. Manabi Straight was an especially touching show to rewatch during these intense times, as it provides an entertaining tale that mostly revolves around the importance of taking advantage of the excitement of teenage years, no matter the circumstances. and Azumanga Daioh, yet unlike those shows, has not been beloved by time in the slightest. There are certainly reasons for this, and I do think Manabi Straight is more niche of a story and has far less widespread appeal than the former three.

Mei is tightly-wound and focused, Mutsuki is bold and well-respected by the school, and Momo serves mostly as comic relief/to even be the eyes of the audience. Although these characters do fit obvious archetypes, and are not the most nuisanced outside the plot/their roles within the show, I still found myself endeared to them greatly, and wished I could have seen more of them. The little moments of them sharing excitement together, working on planning for the festival and even just spending time relaxing are always comforting.Each episode of Manabi simply portrays a portion of planning for the school festival. Small arcs occur, typically involving setup for the big day (like indoctoraing clubs, signing petitions, getting motivated, etc.) Although I think Manabi Straight is mostly consistently good throughout, there are a few moments in the mid section that felt slightly forced and cheesy. The biggest for me being Manabi’s brother dating Aikoh’s principal, which felt only present in the story to create added internal conflict for Manabi. Aikoh’s principal’s role and personality felt kind of forced in general, since most of the other teachers and adults within this story were endeared by Manabi and her excitement for the festival. Still, these qualms are few and far between. Big moments happen in almost every episode, from friendship developments between the characters to the ever-emotional scene in episode 10 in which Manabi is able to bring her entire school together.Episode five definitely deserves a mention for being my personal favorite in the entire series. This episode focuses only on two characters and their hesitant friendship due to past circumstances. As the episode progresses, the two characters learn more about one another and complete different tasks without reliance on outside forces helping to break the tension between them. I am a big fan of montage scenes that are able to show off progression in a brisk yet emotional way, and this episode definitely does not fall flat in that regard.The ending of Manabi is also truly special. The characters graduate in the last episode, a common destiny for shows about girls in high school. However, Manabi takes its story a step further by showing the characters after high school, and showing each of their decisions they made for their futures. This definitely adds further weight to Manabi’s story, and really makes the entire show completely justified for just how well it wraps itself up.If I had to describe Manabi Straight’s story in one word, I would choose “cinematic”. Each episode of Manabi flows into the next as if it were a film. Little time is wasted for less important moments that would be service to the audience, as the show feels tight and most scenes feel somewhat necessary. Of course, Manabi Straight is still a show about cute high school girls. There are moments of silliness, weird interactions or just a second to look at the character in a cute pose. Still, it really feels like Manabi Straight is emphasizing the importance of its message and using its characters’ development as tools strictly for that mission. Shows like Lucky Star and K-on have more character interactions and variety in topic, which gives both of them the advantage of making one more invested in the characters by the end. However, neither of those shows have the consistent central story of Manabi. Where Manabi lacks the wide variety of discussion and added personality to its characters, it decides to prioritize the linear message of how important this goal for the characters is. I feel that this benefits the show greatly, considering it is only 12 episodes and it was a treat to see a well-done story about high school girls instead of taking up that time for random bullshit and typical tropes.Comedy wise, Manabi Straight is pretty strong. There were several instances when I laughed out loud at scenes and jokes, usually due to the unique timing. Manabi’s style could be described as a mixture of both slapstick and dry humor, often involving weird actions from the characters or a few seconds to let something bizarre that was spoken sink in. An example of this is in the first episode, when Manabi herself is late to school. She frantically asks a girl (later introduced as Momo) walking by for directions, and is pointed a few feet away from the steps going up the hill to school. Manabi completely ignores the steps and flies her scooter straight into the trees next to it, constantly whipping through trees to get to the school on the other side. And at times, the absurdity of a moment is the joke. Halfway through the show there is an entire scene of the characters losing their minds due to being overworked/experiencing sleep loss. Mikan begins to wreck their club room out of desperation to reorganize it (a common symptom of overstress) while Mei, Mitsuki, and Manabi taunt each other out of frustration and take turns smacking one another in the face. The ridiculousness of scenes such as this one provide further realism and character interactions, allowing for the potential happening of the Student Festival to be all the more important to the audience as it is for Manabi’s characters.Manabi Straight’s animation and art design can be described as ambitious and high-spirited. UFOtable may be known as the “Type Moon” studio nowadays, handling both the Fate and Kara no Kyoukai franchises, and pairing those stories with highly stylized and bright digital animation. However, a decade or so ago UFOtable had a very different aesthetic, which came across in both their graphics and stories. Their shows featured colorful and poppy animation and cute rounded character designs (you can see this in other 2000’s UFOtable productions like Ninja Nonsense and Dokkoida) and Manabi definitely continued this trend. Everything about Manabi’s setting is alive and bright, from the whimsical looking school to the detailed club room. Each girl’s room and house is shown throughout the show, and each of these settings is filled with so much variety and specific detail that they all have strong distinctions. And by the end of the show, the viewer will have somewhat of a spatial idea of the school, considering the show’s tendency to show off different angles and areas that the characters have wandered. This may seem like a pedantic compliment, but it is one I truly was very excited by. It is not often I can say an anime has made me feel aware of its central location’s proportions and that they have stuck in my mind, since that seems like an afterthought for a lot of shows, especially high school comedy ones.While I can not defend Manabi Straight as having the best animation ever, or even being a contender for that contest, I can strongly state that it has some of the most unique and interesting animations cuts I have seen. There are many little moments throughout that stick out and add an increased flavor to the show’s direction. Manabi growing wings as she motivates her club and flies around as her ideas are portrayed around her. Mei sitting in her lit-blue bedroom sadly while only her video game’s reflection is shown bounced off of her wall, which feels very Hideaki Anno inspired. And episode four must be praised for having the most interestingly animated scene in the entire show. A flashback showing an entire classroom of students with blindly neon inverted colors, emphasized in that fashion to show Mei’s despair and unease. Manabi Straight just feels unique with the way the characters move and interact within its universe. It often shows very blatant animated symbolism, which of course adds intrigue and enhanced attention due to straying away from stagnant direction.Of course, I can not discuss the artwork of Manabi Straight without mentioning the character designs. Manabi’s Straight’s characters are all drawn as cute and goofy looking lolis topped with bright hair, which I am fully aware will immediately turn off an entire crowd of viewers. However, it should be mentioned that everyone in Manabi’s story looks that way, even the adult men have rounded proportions and somewhat cutesy faces. Personally, the weirdly juvenile and innocent designs did not detract any of the show’s likability, and instead contributed to its unique narrative (which is of course, a coming of age story). The characters in Manabi also often make silly faces or have funny mannerisms (Manabi’s iconic raised fist is a big stand out) and I was admittedly endeared by just how cute they could be at times.Manabi Straight also has an extremely memorable and outright delightful soundtrack that suits it well. Each background song has so much personality and care put into it, often complimenting its given scene with grace. Fully orchestrated string pieces are played with the more melancholic and poignant scenes, and the upbeat moments are paired with upbeat clapping and what sounds like a really fun jam session. Manabi Straight also has one of my top five favorite openings ever, which might be surprising to some, but I can not deny how much of a fun earworm it is. Sung by the ever-wonderful Megumi Hayashibara, who has not only talent in voice acting but singing, “A Happy Life” is a motivating ballad with sweetly sung lyrics and exciting buildup in the background instruments. The characters are shown running around their school and appear almost as if they are being videotaped, shown in interesting angles. This video may appear nonsensical for a first time viewer, but has incredible payoff in the context of the ending.So do I recommend Manabi Straight? Obviously, I just gushed about it for a dozen paragraphs. If you are a fan of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things shows, you owe it to yourself to watch this one for its uniquely structured story and likable characters. If you are into original anime in general, or just want to see a tightly done yet fun narrative, it is also recommendable. Manabi Straight was an especially touching show to rewatch during these intense times, as it provides an entertaining tale that mostly revolves around the importance of taking advantage of the excitement of teenage years, no matter the circumstances.', 'Fuck! That was so good. This anime does not waste time on useless scenes, every second and minute of it was perfectly crafted and tells a beautiful story.The Art was exceptional and the sound shook my heart.The characters were the crucial point of the anime which each and every one of the cast was unique. Blah blah blah.To summarize, this is a SOL anime that does not go through the usual pains that average SOL presents. It is cute and adorably cute at that. The pains were logical and yet presented perfectly, Sometimes SOL anime creates a premise where it forcefully makes the character...suffer simply because for the sake of it. This anime does not but it creates an endearing story that showed a particular universe where 5 different people come together and make things happen. This is its beauty. A good start, a smooth flow and an excellent ending. Fitting in the genre and tells a story that is unique in its own way, filled with lovable characters, presented in cute art, accompanied with outstanding soundtrack. I totally enjoyed it - 10/10 suffer simply because for the sake of it.

What differences this series of others of its kind is its focus in school (not in school`s events but in the school as an institution and how characters deal with it) and time set up which as mentioned previously is placed in a future where highschool is not mandatory and a much less popular option than now.One of the things I found more interesting about this show is its view of the world in a slightly distopic way. Aestheticaly talking this shows...in the color palette the series uses which is at least interesting and likely to catch your attention as it`s not what you expect of a distopic show. I personally liked it a lot.One of the most appealing aspects of this kind of shows is the cast of girls, in this case we have a group of girls similar to the k-on`s one, where they all have an in interest in common (being this interest the student`s council and the correct function of the school experience). It`s also similar on how the characters develop, being this aspect reduced to only to the relation the girls have between eachother and with the school. You won´t find love or family drama, the struggles the characters face in this anime are ones such as: finding what to do with their life after school, over coming a school trauma...This series also comments about the nature of highschool which may resonate with you at a personal level if you disliked or didn't fit very well in the highschool system.I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes the school genre and it`s looking for something more meta or slightly different in the color palette the series uses which is at least interesting and likely to catch your attention as it`s not what you expect of a distopic show.

It reminds me of simpler times when I used to see green meadows all of the time, had more parks around my area and more fun things to do.Now, most of those areas are closed down for building reconstructions or the ones that I used to play in already have new buildings over them.The official music of it really knows how to hit me deep in the heart and I love this anime for giving me something different.Despite its short length, everyone whom is an anime lover...needs to give this one a go; even lifts up your spirits if you are in your own student council and are feeling like your word is not getting to the people.This anime is a reminder that true effort will be heard; though perhaps you will not have as many, dare I say, buddies as the girls in this anime did.But, it reminds you that some people will reach out to you if you cry loud enough. It reminds you that you can make bonds with new people, even if it does not seem so.And lastly, it reminds you that you should never lose faith in what you believe in. That, you should always be yourself and never let the cold foot of oppression weigh you down.I chose the most popular video of this anime, apparently being this music mashup (sounds really good by the way), to spread the word for those that think it is another generic anime. I highly recommend you give it a go; you will not regret it. If you doubt my prior mentioning of the piano music being good, here is a sample:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9_cyzhsXYQJust from listening to this, you can tell already that most of what I have stated about this anime is extremely true.

But, do not let the futuristic setting turn you off; they do not even reference it that often, either. The story is true, crisp and recommended for even new anime.If I have to be a hundred percent honest here, to make sure I am not just giving this anime positives the entire time, the only true flaw to this anime was that it did not play the piano songs often enough; it specifically played the interlude song quite a bit, which was extremely catchy, but it felt like it did not have enough variety in the way it spread its music. I swear it felt like I was hearing the same few songs over and over again, though it does have more music that plays for specific episodes.So, yeah. The only true problem with this anime is that it falls under one of those anime that had a repetitive soundtrack. But, it does shine when it plays those piano songs, among other pieces, in the sad, serious and meaningful scenes. Truly, its story is actually un-flawed and, at first, it gives off a vibe that it might fall under those ""main character is overly hyped and naturally makes everyone feel better"" but the main character only helps out a little bit; the bonds are formulated by the other characters themselves and not just under the sole influence of the main one.

Very rarely does a work strike out of the blue that hits some pretty amazing spots in just 5 episodes. What flagged me to watch this was mainly the fact that it was directed by the person who made Futakoi Alternative and was produced by ufotable during the experimental pre-Type Moon phase. Although the polish of Kara no Kyoukai and all the Type Moon series has gone up several notches, except in Paradox Spiral, rarely do you see the type of pizazz that they were pulling off with Futakoi Alternative and Manabi Straight.Anyway the plot is socially...socially heavy, being about a declining birth rate leading to a lack of interest in public education, leading to massive amounts of youths just skipping by school altogether for future job prospects and other pursuits. Everyone knows that overwork and the relentless stampede for progress is a kind of thing in Japan, with stuff like Karoshi and Office-Sleeping Cubicles being extreme examples of the well-critiqued routine standard salary-man lifestyle. While it remains relatively under the radar for the episodes I\'ve seen so far though, there are hints of the idea cracking through. One of the episode\'s has a secret reference to Kenji Miyazawa\'s The Restaurant with Many Orders and an interpretation of it as being a commentary on the consumptive nature of Japanese progress and relentless development.But if it was merely social commentary, there wouldn\'t be much to talk about would it? In the end what Manabi Straight really gets right is the kinds of thing special to Film and Televisual format, that of Cinematography and Atmosphere. The first thing you\'ll notice is that, like Futakoi Alternative, Manabi Straight has a thing where they play the line between energetic straightforward comedy, moments extremely pregnant with tense silences, and touching & emotional moments of catharsis. Yet this time all these moments take place in the context of a relatively normal everyday school life, surrounding a School Council trying to regain its previous splendour by, basically, engineering culture (or counterculture, depending on how strong you see the social reality element).In a normal 5 girl series, you\'d probably see a high gag density and need to never take anything seriously until the emotionally touching final graduation moment, which usually comes with a ""what are they doing"" montage. Extroversion is especially required, for a merrier cast that likes to talk about all sorts of things is better than a normal cast. Especially Manabi herself is the epitome of this relentless joy and overwhelming positiveness that makes the most touching speeches and seems to draw the whole crowd along with her. And, except for Mei, who is a cold and pragmatic girl, the rest of the cast are pretty hardline cheerful as well. Any other series would play it for all its worth, and have her be the \'straight male\' to their antics.Instead we have an episode where Manabi, the main driver of the show, falls sick, and Mika, the clumsy earnest girl, is forced to confront the horrible fact that she has absolutely no way to approach the other normally cold, pragmatic, and distant member of the cast. Likewise she has not enough self-esteem or social currency to properly forge a relationship with her without the always positive Manabi being around.In which other show would you have a scene where said clumsy earnest girl, so utterly shocked by her inability to get together with her acquaintance, and utterly guilty of almost denouncing her personality to her other friends in class, lies in a detached catatonic state on her bed, and ponders about her stupid own lack of will, as the cinematography basically stands still (a trademark Anno tactic mind you) with absolutely no music playing while she just stares, uncertain of what to do, as her phone continuously rings while the camera goes and takes in various shots of the room. And yet this entire episode also manages to capture the whole gamut of emotions that someone experiences making a new and strange acquaintance and ends in the highest and most powerfully ringing note of all. While lacking the calm and tranquil absolute beauty of ARIA, the character depth of this show goes a hell of a long way. And the techniques used in the cinematography run the whole range, from shaky cam to fish-eye lens like warped view, to timeskip montage, jump cuts and repetitive cuts, to ellipsis, to highly dark shaded psychological trauma (the beginning of episode 4).Most openings would show bright cheerful colors, characters laughing and talking, and various shots of life. Manabi Straight has an Opening theme song that depicts the main characters running around a dark and gloomy school in the evening spray painting various names all over the walls, taking part in the general emptiness and running their own colors all over it. Eventually the top down pan shows the whole school marked with paint signifying the title of the anime with the assertion that ""It\'s my life"".

They\'re probably best known for their work on 2x2=Shinobuden, the Tales of Symphonia OVA, and, most recently, Fate/Zero. It shouldn\'t be any surprise that an anime quickly followed. There\'s even a visual novel game for the Playstation 2 based on the series. However, in spite of being semi-successful in Japan Manabi Straight was never released elsewhere. Let\'s take a look at the anime and try to figure out why.The setting is a future where Japan has a declining population and schools have less students partially due to the lower birth rate...and partially due to a system of apprenticeships which leads a lot of youngsters to just skip school altogether. The setting is Seioh High School where an incredibly energetic transfer student bursts into the school and quickly nominates herself for student council President, which she gets because no one else wants the job. The episodes follow her and four other girls as they attend to student council business, in spite of several of them not even being part of the student council. The episodes do have a clear progression but they don\'t have an underlying story. It\'s reminiscent of Azumanga Daioh in that respect. There are a few major themes, mainly camaraderie and moving boldly into the future, personified by Manabi\'s favourite saying ""Forward Go!"" The major difference between Azumanga Daioh and Manabi Straight is that Azumanga Daioh focuses on the comedic aspect and Manabi Straight focuses more on cute, fluffy moments. On the plus side, it works very well. It\'s a fun series with lots of good and funny moments. The themes get a little heavy handed, but they\'re pretty well handled overall.By themselves, the characters are pretty standard archetypes. However, they interact very well, they play off of each other pretty strongly and they bring out complexities within each other that aren\'t readily apparent. I can\'t really tell if that\'s a deliberate way of strengthening the camaraderie theme or if it just turned out that way. I have a feeling it\'s the former.The art is the one aspect I really don\'t like. They use a super chibified art technique that makes all the characters look roughly ten years younger than they\'re supposed to be. The imagery is very deliberately bright and vibrant. They also do some really interesting things with the art at intense moments. Sometimes they go overboard, but it usually works and, in spite of my general dislike of the art form it works for the series.The voice work is pretty good, for the most part. There is some over-exaggeration, especially from Horie Yue but it generally works for the scene so it\'s not too much of an issue. The music is spectacular. The school anthem, the themes, and the background music are all perfect for the series and excellently performed.The yuri factor is a 6/10. The main five girls cuddle up to each other consistently. Mikan also develops an obvious crush on the student council president of another school. None of them go beyond being cuddly, but it\'s still pretty homoerotic and there\'s definite yuri potential.My final rating for Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight is a 7/10. It\'s a good series. If you\'re looking for something that\'s energetic, funny and just generally fun you\'ll probably enjoy it. It\'s kind of similar to Azumanga Daioh or Gokujou Seitokai, so if you\'re a fan of either of those I would check it out. However, if you\'re looking for a complex story or action-packed fight scenes you should probably look elsewhere.As for why it was never released outside of Japan, maybe they felt that an anime that emphasises cuteness and uses humour as a secondary aspect wouldn\'t do well for international audiences.

Language is the greatest tool invented by humankind. Without language, we will not be civilized. We will not be able to watch anime or invent baconnaise.Many parents and teachers claim that school is a forum for thinking. School is the place to...learn how to collaborate. In the real world, most projects require more than just one person. If one cannot work together, one loses many opportunities. Chefs have to work together with assistant chefs and waitresses to serve the best food; delays and a lowering of quality can happen if the employees are obtrusive and inexperienced. There are many cases that the teacher-student relationship blurs and this is why school is so great; namely, we all can learn from each other. There is no other place for learning many things besides a school.Manabi Straight’s setting argues that the quality of education, the importance of school, and teamwork will degrade in the future -- it is set around 2035. Some viewers, interested in the field of education, may also argue that this is happening today. Colleges are becoming more expensive and it seems more practical to start in the workforce; my mathematics teacher said that an experienced plumber will earn about the same revenue as a doctor in a lifetime. In America and Britain, education systems are on the verge of a revamp. Japan’s student scores on science exams has steadily decreased, but the students feel less stress; this is quite unlike its neighbor, South Korea, which has problems with student suicides. What should the education systems do? What is the meaning of school today? These are great questions to ponder for politicians, people in the education field, students, and parents. Without a doubt, this is a fantastic setting that asks us to think about the future.Manabi, a new student, has elected herself as the Student Council President and, inspired by the school anthem’s lyrics, has started creative projects to vitalize the school. If there is one reason to watch the show, it is to watch Yui Horie’s fantastic Kushieda Minorin-like performance. Her character personifies the idealistic view on the meaning of school. She is a genki girl that believes in the power of friendship; her humor and gregarious personality is admiring. A natural-born leader, Manabi manages to lead the student council despite her status as a newbie. Her struggle as a character is awe-inspiring and drives the story forward; if you are a college admission officer, you should immediately accept her into your college no matter how prestigious it is. If you did not feel any emotion from her singing the school anthem in the first episode, you have no soul. She is just that awesome.Like Azumanga Daioh, the work also has a character people can relate to. Voiced by Haruhi, Mei personifies those students with a strong sense of responsibility. Everyone knows at least one Mei in our lives; we also have different opinions on people like her. She is a fantastic character because her archetype appears in other works. In Manabi Straight, we see her archetype through a sentimental lens. This is to provoke our minds into changing our perceptions of characters and people like Mei. Thus, Mei is the most realistic and human character in this whole series.Takako, as well, deserves a mention. She should have been a main character. A mentor to Manabi, Takako is a bored student council president in a typical rich girl’s school. Until she meets Manabi, school is nothing more than a place before work. Her character becomes dynamic and more humane. Thus, her character is complimentary to Manabi’s. Both characters develop the themes together and their interactions are the most interesting ones in the show.Sadly, this is the end of positive aspects of the show. Everything else is as stale as a live-action Disney show.The story is hampered by the other characters: Mika, Momoha, and Mutsuki. Mika is the shy girl character and her path to adulthood is predictable and pointless. Momoha is one of those characters that is “unnecessary, but oh well, let’s add her because she is moe”. Mutsuki is genki and that’s about it; she is clearly Ritsu from K-On!. These three people slow down the story to a snail’s pace, using terrible jokes that people really don’t care about.Thus, this brings up another point. What is the focus for this show exactly? Manabi Straight has an impressive setting and this work has the potential to be deep and thought-provoking. This reminds me of a work like Sora no Woto, a combination of K-On! visuals and antiwar environmental themes. Why can’t this work do that? Instead, it goes back and forward. Pacing is abysmal. Mika is not the main character; Manabi is. Why are we hearing her thoughts instead of Manabi’s? The story and theme feel underdeveloped thanks to teetering and its most dramatic moments succumb to it.Art direction is generic and the lighting feels underexposed. This is probably a stylistic choice, but it makes it hard for viewers to see. Character designs are standard lolicon. It does not venture into more creative territories. There is nothing daring or expressive that ufotable did. It is just so bland that words can’t express it.Any anime enthusiasts will figure out the clock tower’s bell. It is a commonly used sound effect, which also appears in the Umineko visual novel series; I assume the Golden Witch is rolling her head in her grave. Manabi’s OP and ED are standard forgettable j-pop songs. Sound, as a whole, is ordinary at the very best.Sometimes, I think too deep into many things; Manabi Straight’s setting is one of them for sure. Thus, it is a pity to say that I am disappointed in such a promising setting. For a work with such a huge potential to be more than just moe, it feels lacking. A bore, most of the characters should have been cut out. It focuses on the wrong things at the wrong times and there is no limit to its genericness. Manabi Straight is just a slice-of-life show featuring lolicons doing cute things. It does not sit well with me. learn how to collaborate.

It does not sit well with me.', ""One of the forerunners of the Cute Girls Doing Cute Things genre, unfortunately this series was completely overshadowed by the release of Lucky☆Star.This series is an interesting glimpse into the anime culture that was developing before the massive influence of Lucky☆Star and K-on! dramatically changing the landscape for this kind of anime.The series is mildly experimental relying more on light story than daily gags, and I plays with social commentary on Japan's declining population. One of the first if not the first anime to ever do so.The story is charming, the artwork is insanely sweet, the characters are realistic yet fictionally adorable, and the soundtrack...is actually really unique for the time. I can't think of a single anime that has ever used a percussion based OST for motive and mood setting like Manabi Straight! has.If you are a fan of the Cute Girls genre, this is a series that is all too often overlooked, and forgotten about.It is an absolutely sweet yet goofy light drama that reminds me of popular Shoujo-ai story telling over the modern CuteGirls typical daily life gags, despite being not being Yuri.For those who critisize this series for being unoriginal, remember that this came out before Lucky☆Star, K-on!, Nichijo, Gabriel DropOut, Minami-ke, Love Lab, Yuyushiki, Non Non Biyori and really most of the genre.For the timeframe, Manabi Straight! was fairly unique take, and it still has a unique ring to it to this day.Always remember the context of time frame and culture when rating and judging an anime.And in such Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! stands out as quite an interesting and unique attempt at a genre that had yet to flourish. is actually really unique for the time.

In a series written well, like Urusei Yatsura, implications will become incorporated later in the story, but this is a narrative that creates implication upon implication, but constantly contradicts what each of those hints may have initially meant. It seems as if the modus operandi of this show was just to have exploitative shots of girls; who look like they’re 11–12 in age (but are actually, canonically, 19–20 year olds). This review contains spoilers! You have been warned!This anime takes place in 2035 but the futuristic setting really has...no bearing on the story, other than to illustrate the societally low birth rate, and henceforth have the visual aesthetic of abandoned school buildings—sparsely populated by cute girls. The emptied buildings reminded me of how I felt while watching this show—hollow. The visuals were okay, but there wasn’t anything motivating me to care about any of the characters.The girls didn’t really act human a lot of the time; just a culmination of generic archetypes that would randomly yell out something zany, with weird sounds involuntarily squeaking out amongst the shouting. Weird speech aphorisms are fine, if done right. As a fan of *Ryūkishi07, I have seen characters have weird speech quips that are later explained in the story, and double as a cute moe point. Speaking of sounds, I hated that repetitive clapping OST—the amount that that was played during the series drove me up a wall.*Creator of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.*Characters of Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight in a Nutshell:*All of the names start with an ‘M’ for some reason, I don’t understand how that has relevance to the story. I guess it could be some kind of unifying factor, but I don’t even recall it being a plot device in the actual series.—Manami Amamiya: Genki to nth degree. Good at singing *because her seiyū is Yui Horie. Goes hard, even when on a hover board. Natural leader of the group since she is deftly enthusiastic about everything.*Check out her vocal tracks for the Mawaru Penguindrum ED (it was a special performance for Episode 10, where she covers the Coaltar of the Deepers track), Maria Ushiromiya from Umineko no Naku Koro ni has a special character track from a limited edition OST of the series (named ‘Happy Halloween, Maria’), and there are voice-enacted openings for her Monogatari character, Tsubasa Hanekawa.—Mika Inamori: Commonly referred to, by me, as ‘bargain bin Cirno (東方Project).’ Since their designs are nearly identical. She’s shy and clumsy, often a wallflower, though her awkward demeanor makes her stick out like a sore thumb. She spoiled and sheltered, so she has difficulty moving forward from complacency. This is actually accented nicely, when she moves forward (via studying abroad) in *Episode 12. One of the few fairly fleshed out characters, along with Mei.*Episode 12: The Cherry Blossom Colored Futures (桜色の未来たち)—Mutsuki Uehara: She’s an athletic, tomboy who takes on the tasks of participating in multiple clubs to help out—on top of that, she juggles taking care of her younger brothers at home. Despite her boyish demeanor, she is the most sexually promiscuous character and seems to have chemistry with both Mika and Mei.—Mei Etō: Mei has the typical, standoffish ‘tsundere’ personality and finds it difficult to express her emotions. It is revealed in *Episode 4, that Mei has trauma related to her fear of interacting with other students because, during her tenure as class representative, all of the other students shirked their duties off on her and took advantage of the fact that she was too shy to speak up about it. I would have enjoyed this series more, if every episode was similar to the aforementioned Episode 4.*Episode 4: The Film Reel of Promo Go (プロモでゴーの巻)—Momoha Odori: I question why Momo is even in this series, her whole roles it to be: boisterous, wealthy, quiet, and whenever she does talk, she immediately gets shut down by one of the other girls. I don’t know why she’s part of the club. No one seems to like her.—Takako Kakuzawa: The student council president. You know that she isn’t part of the central girl group because her name doesn’t start with an ‘M.’ She’s initially rigid and cold, but eventually warms up because of her inclusion in the rebuilding of the school.Manabi’s unfaltering idealism would have been more compelling if it seemed like real human beings would, even remotely, behave like this character. Even in the most fantastical settings, there is usually at least one nuance that makes the characters feel as if their personality that would be practical in real life. None of these characters have that; their interactions seem foreign and strange. Surreal moments like the scene where the girls start slapping and punching each other because of the humidity are nonsensical. If there had been commentary about the climate becoming unbearable, in the year 2035, then maybe their insulated moments of insanity would have made sense; but they don’t with what‘s established in the *anime.*I didn’t even bother checking out the OVA, manga, or visual novel afterward—because of my revulsion towards the anime adaptation.Their relationships with each other are even less relatable than their individual personalities. In all-girl shows, there are almost always implicative shōjo-ai relationships between the girls. Manabi Straight is no exception. But it’s weird, (1) Mei and Mutsuki seem to have a chemistry that is in the ‘more than friends’ terrain based on their body language around each other, (2) Mika longingly stares at Mei, yearning to be closer to her, (3) In *Episode 6, Mika goes to Mutsuki’s house at night, in a mini-skirt, and sexual tension arises between them, but only in that one episode.*Episode 6: Cinnamon Sugar Raised Happiness (シナモンシュガーレイズド·ハピネス)The shōjo-ai elements seem to primarily exist for older men to write explicit yuri dōjins in their basements. The uncomfortable, voyeuristic short of the girls throughout the show doesn’t help dissolve that theory either. I am a moderate fan of ecchi and am perfectly okay with it being in anime, but the ecchi in Manabi Straight is gross; it’s classless and creepy. There’s a candid shot of Mutsuki erotically sucking off a popsicle in one episode, and another where Mika is laying on her back while talking to one of her friends on the phone and the angle that the shot is placed at—shows right up her skirt, and the camera angles constantly fixate on Momo’s *thighs. Speaking from a female perspective, the male gaze in this is suffocating.*Termed officially as zettai ryōiki.The characters have sudden schisms in behavior in some part that were *DID level, played for the sake of cute-girls-doing-wacky-things. Nothing makes sense, not even Manami’s grand promise to rebuild the school works—the only thing that really seems rebuilt is Mika’s perspective but that isn’t even hinted at, until the very end, when she boards the airplane. This scene was supposed to be touching, but instead felt incredibly empty.*Referring to dissociative identity disorder.In the end, no amount of visual metaphors or hints of emotional enlightenment are able to salvage this series. During its airing date (2007), I completely feel in love with another moe show called Renkin 3-kyū Magical? Pokān—that series had much more of an impact than Manabi Straight, which is clearly trying to elicit a coming-of-age nostalgia from its viewers.

This is the first review I have submitted in MAL and it's for this awful anime. I gave it a go due to the rating it has an the other reviews and I regret that decision.If you are interested in a soft anime to past the time give Gakuen Utopia a chance, you might like it who knows but if you are interested in getting a good laugh stay away from this.  Rest assure this is not going to be a full of hate review not at all, there are a couple of good things...in this anime for example* The characters *Manabi is a straight forward girl that has a unique way of acting and doesn't take things seriously giving problems to everyone around her. In each episode we see them supporting each other and also learning a little about the secondary characters past which is something that is not often shown.*Story> I got to admit that it caught me. The ideal of a school life anime which is involved about school life almost ending is something that I have not seen before, the main issue is that they focused on how to make those days joyful instead of the reasons why those specific characters decided to go to school.The sound it has it's not the best but due to the environment it takes place it makes sense. The art style it's an not so bad  but it could improve. in this anime for example* The characters *Manabi is a straight forward girl that has a unique way of acting and doesn't take things seriously giving problems to everyone around her.

The art style it's an not so bad  but it could improve."", 'Another day another anime another review where i have to come up with interesting things to say about said anime.But this is not just any other day,it\'s a rainy day and i\'m dead tired.Only thing keeping me awake is my pure hatred which i\'ll try to transfer into this review as best as i can.And where to start really?When an anime such as Manabi Straight is so devoid of..Anything to be honest.Let\'s get the story part out of the way since there\'s no story to talk about..It\'s just another slice of life anime..Cause we needed one in 5 minutes,correct?Well no we didn\'t need another Moe-SOL...anime in our lives but market says otherwise and the rest of us who were not hit in the head as children have to suffer for it...Basically all you need to know about this anime is that it\'s about a school FULL of girls and more specifically the student council which tries to overcome some problems such as ""oh no my nail just broke,what is the society gonna think i won\'t be able to get married"" and ""oh my god the festival we planned is gonna get cancelled OMFG i\'ll die""..I would commit suicide too if those were my only problems in life..And don\'t whatever you do be fooled by the description and think of this as an anime where dark themes are explored in any way at all..You might have thought that they would at least explore the reason why kids choose not to go to school or why school is deemed unnecessary or at the very least a mention of the ever decreasig population..And you\'d be wrong,very wrong..In fact this anime is just about cute girls and their cute things.Sure there are times where they try to pull off some dramatic scenes but they are so obviously fake that even a 3yr old would die laughing.And speaking of kids why don\'t i share some thoughts on the characters?Well there are characters for sure and many of them but who cares?Did the writers care?Not in the least it seems cause apart from Manami the rest of the cast is like watching a dead horse race.I\'m prepared to bet you all of my hair that the stuff had a meeting and said ""right lads,moe sells..So to prove how idiotic the moe lovers are i have a proposal to make..Let\'s make only the main character interesting in some way and not bother at all with the rest of them,see how that pans out"".And boy did it work cause anyone with working brain cells could plainly see that this cast is a farce.To put it into perspective Manami while offering nothing new in terms of characterisation,is at least a joy to watch and full of energy..In contrast the rest of characters are like they overdosed on these new zombie drugs.In fact if you search the term ""generic archetypes"" a photo of this cast is gonna show up..Somwhere along the way they did try to breathe some life into them but it was hopeless.The show was already consumed by the moe-fog and as a result you can\'t connect with them as characters to the point that if someone came into the school and killed them all you wouldn\'t even notice.So even if it had a story it woudln\'t have the characters part right.Visually i can\'t say i\'m dissapointed but i\'m not over my self with joy either.The character designs consist of a faux chubby loli style which is all the rage in the circles of child molesters in the late years.No facial features whatsoever,with huge eyes and they look like they\'re a LOT younger than they\'re supposed to be.The backgrounds and the tone is well done,nothing fancy but they cleverly hid that under tons of vibrant colours..So it\'s like sleeping with a woman who has tons of make up on and when you wake up next morning you are next to a 40yr old man.This might be the result of the absence of a director.The role of the director was taken upon by a team of creative staff members.Now i can\'t very well sit here and say the whole thing worked cause yes the visuals were nice-y but again it lacked story.In their defense the last episode was at least a lot better than the rest of the series.So there you go,if you want an anime with fluffy shit all around and a cherry hid in the mountain of shit,go ahead and watch it.Now before you march in with your opinions and whatnot i want you to do an experiment with me..Try and read every review,every comment and try not to find the words cute,moe,romantic or other similar words to describe the show.Manami is at best a generic mediocre borefest..And we had enough of these already,in fact 80% of the shows produced are the exact same copy of each other.So yeah sure they\'re heartwarming and all that crap but in the end they\'re not special..In fact they\'re not even worth of mention. anime in our lives but market says otherwise and the rest of us who were not hit in the head as children have to suffer for it...Basically all you need to know about this anime is that it\'s about a school FULL of girls and more specifically the student council which tries to overcome some problems such as ""oh no my nail just broke,what is the society gonna think i won\'t be able to get married"" and ""oh my god the festival we planned is gonna get cancelled OMFG i\'ll die""..I would commit suicide too if those were my only problems in life..And don\'t whatever you do be fooled by the description and think of this as an anime where dark themes are explored in any way at all..You might have thought that they would at least explore the reason why kids choose not to go to school or why school is deemed unnecessary or at the very least a mention of the ever decreasig population..And you\'d be wrong,very wrong..In fact this anime is just about cute girls and their cute things.Sure there are times where they try to pull off some dramatic scenes but they are so obviously fake that even a 3yr old would die laughing.And speaking of kids why don\'t i share some thoughts on the characters?Well there are characters for sure and many of them but who cares?Did the writers care?Not in the least it seems cause apart from Manami the rest of the cast is like watching a dead horse race.I\'m prepared to bet you all of my hair that the stuff had a meeting and said ""right lads,moe sells..So to prove how idiotic the moe lovers are i have a proposal to make..Let\'s make only the main character interesting in some way and not bother at all with the rest of them,see how that pans out"".And boy did it work cause anyone with working brain cells could plainly see that this cast is a farce.To put it into perspective Manami while offering nothing new in terms of characterisation,is at least a joy to watch and full of energy..In contrast the rest of characters are like they overdosed on these new zombie drugs.In fact if you search the term ""generic archetypes"" a photo of this cast is gonna show up..Somwhere along the way they did try to breathe some life into them but it was hopeless.The show was already consumed by the moe-fog and as a result you can\'t connect with them as characters to the point that if someone came into the school and killed them all you wouldn\'t even notice.So even if it had a story it woudln\'t have the characters part right.Visually i can\'t say i\'m dissapointed but i\'m not over my self with joy either.The character designs consist of a faux chubby loli style which is all the rage in the circles of child molesters in the late years.No facial features whatsoever,with huge eyes and they look like they\'re a LOT younger than they\'re supposed to be.The backgrounds and the tone is well done,nothing fancy but they cleverly hid that under tons of vibrant colours..So it\'s like sleeping with a woman who has tons of make up on and when you wake up next morning you are next to a 40yr old man.This might be the result of the absence of a director.The role of the director was taken upon by a team of creative staff members.Now i can\'t very well sit here and say the whole thing worked cause yes the visuals were nice-y but again it lacked story.In their defense the last episode was at least a lot better than the rest of the series.So there you go,if you want an anime with fluffy shit all around and a

Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9135/Fullmetal_Alchemist__The_Sacred_Star_of_Milos,"['Dairy farming isn\'t something that one would normally associate with anime and manga, especially as there\'s nothing really entertaining about looking after or milking cows. There is, however, a rather improbable connection between these seemingly disparate industries, and nowhere is this more apparent than when dealing with popular franchises - like Full Metal Alchemist.With a successful manga, two anime adaptations, two movies, six light novels, two series of drama CD\'s, around a dozen video games across several formats, and a mountain of merchandise ranging from art books to key chains, Arakawa Hiromu\'s tale of two brothers is undoubtedly one of the most profitable titles of...recent years. That said, the jewel in Bones\' crown does lack the marketing clout of long-running franchises like One Piece, Bleach and Naruto, and in order to maximise profits the studio has decided to follow a tried and tested method to ""advertise"" the main series.Which is a much nicer way of saying that Full Metal Alchemist is the prize cow, and Bones have decided to milk it (again).The movie opens with a girl dreaming of her past, in particular the moment when a group of soldiers take her and her family away from what looks like a refugee camp. She wakes up to find her brother studying their parent\'s alchemy research book, but before she can go to bed the siblings hear a strange noise inside the house. Her brother goes to investigate but she secretly follows, only to witness a nightmarish scene that causes her to pass out.Several years later Central city, the capital of Amestris, is rocked by a prison break on the day of the harvest festival, and a confrontation with an escaping convict leads the Elric brothers on to another adventure.Okay, it all sounds pretty straightforward, and therein lies one of the main problems with this addition to the Full Metal Alchemist franchise. The overly linear plot and the fact that this is nothing more than another tale about a specific ancient power mean that the storyline is highly predictable - even though the feature is set in a new country with its own history. In addition to this there\'s a fairly noticeable lack of cohesion with the sequence of events, which may be due to the speed at which the narrative progresses. In order to fit the entire storyline into 110 minutes certain corners needed to be cut, but this has been done with very little care so things can often get a little ... disjointed.Aside from the over-churned plot, The Sacred Star of Milkos - sorry, Milos - also suffers from a similar ""anime-by-numbers"" methodology that was prevalent in Guilty Crown, and this becomes obvious when one considers the relevance of characters like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, and even Winry Rockbell. It\'s likely that their presence is nothing more than a nod to the fans as their addition adds nothing to the narrative, and this only serves to highlight the fact that this movie has been made for one reason only - and that isn\'t to tell a story.Visually this is a bit of a departure from the clean lines and smooth animation that one might expect of the franchise, and the techniques used during action set-pieces have an experimental feel. That said, the detailed artwork lacks the finesse of  Brotherhood, and while the character designs are pretty much what one might expect, the movie has a rushed atmosphere that no amount of familiarity can counter. This is reflected by the quality of the animation the attempts to make the action scenes more visceral often has bodies contorting in odd ways. The experimental nature of the visuals also makes the CG stand out, and the obvious disparity can make certain scenes look more than a little odd.The movie does have an opening theme, but viewers will have to wait ten minutes before they can listen to Miwa\'s dulcet tones as she sings ""Chasing Hearts"", a pleasant rock-pop song with an adventurous atmosphere which unfortunately has been relegated to background music for the on-screen action. The Sacred Star of Milos closes with a rather simple sequence depicting a train journey across various landscapes while L\'Arc-en-Ciel\'s serenade viewers with their fourth contribution to the franchise - an upbeat rock ballad called ""Good Luck My Way"". The rest of the movie has a variety of musical accompaniments composed by Iwashiro Taro ranging from dramatic martial themes to medieval-style ditties and mysterious piano pieces, and for the most part these tracks fit their respective scenes quite well.Sadly, the movie suffers from the poor scripting that has plagued many shounen titles over the years, and although the actors are as competent as ever, not even their vaunted skills can do much with the typical formula of cheese, shout, run, hit people, shout louder, more cheese, run faster, scream, hit more people, etc, etc. The rather pedestrian dialogue means that The Sacred Star of Milos lacks the emotional charge of its predecessor - a fact that is borne out by the predominantly static characters.The problem is that this movie is little more than a sideshow rather than a main event, which ironically places this feature below the much maligned Conqueror of Shamballa in terms of development - especially where the Elric Brothers are concerned. The only character who shows any sign of growth is the main heroine - Julia Crichton - but this alone cannot support the weight of a story that relies on previous familiarity with specific characters. While this method of storytelling isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, it does place limitations on the storyline regarding the actions of particular individuals, and when one adds the fact that several characters are nothing more than window dressing, viewers may find themselves disappointed with the overall lack of depth.That said, although this addition to the Full Metal Alchemist franchise has more moo than milk, fans will probably find themselves warming to it as it offers them a chance to see the Elric Brothers in action once more. The  feature may not be of the same standard as Brotherhood, the original anime adaptation, or even the first movie, but it does offer some moments of pure enjoyment. Although the storyline is relatively simplistic compared to what has gone before, anyone familiar with the franchise will probably find this an easy film to watch - even with the blatant and somewhat redundant reminders of certain past events.It\'s just a little sad that a great title is being treated as nothing more than a cash cow, but with The Sacred Star of Milos, hopefully Bones will decide it\'s time to put the franchise out to pasture. recent years.

However, it\'s still Fullmetal Alchemist (FMA) so while I wasn\'t looking forward to this as much as other things, I still would\'ve seen it as soon as it was released. I wasn\'t aware of the runtime (2 hours) until before I saw the film. I generally don\'t care for films this long but I had some faith simply because it was FMA and the franchise hasn\'t let me down... until now.Story: Generally in films based on something, they want...to broaden their audience by giving a little background on the characters and why they do what they do. If this film was someone\'s first Fullmetal Alchemist experience, knowing what it\'s about might help guide them into the story. Unfortunately, for those who do know about FMA, there might\'ve been a tad too much for my liking. Beyond that the actual story is pretty generic and not very interesting. There wasn\'t anything to hook me in and it\'s a story that\'s been done to death. So I understand giving background for the newer audience but they really should\'ve considered the people that FMA has already roped in. What lead up to the climax is boring... I was waiting quite a while for the plot to kick in and it was maybe halfway in that relevant things started to happen, though I still didn\'t care enough.Let\'s talk about the actual story now. Or, you can just look at the themes that FMA has previously explored and watch/read that again. This is one of the major problems with the film. As a FMA fan, this is nothing new. Even in general, this is nothing we haven\'t seen before. There are some people being oppressed by the military and they\'re forced to live in fear under terrible conditions. Not too different from the Ishbalans. The greedy bad guys want the Philosopher\'s Stone for monies and to make the world into what they feel is a better place. It\'s up to our heroes to stop them. ""Classic filler plot""  basically sums up the story to be honest. The plot itself is pretty straightforward barring a few twists that I\'m sure many won\'t see coming. The biggest ""facepalm moment"" for me was the end of the final fight. One of the most random ""because the plot required it""/deus ex machina moments I\'ve seen in a while. More on that later though. Watching how they fight and how it ended really bothered me. There were also plenty of ""Oh, that\'s convenient"" moments throughout the film and unfortunately, they\'re pretty in your face. I was near insulted at how ""subtle"" they were about them too. I\'d like to share them with you but you know, spoilers. Even if you\'re new to FMA but not new to movie cliches, you shouldn\'t find this to be a great piece of work. If you didn\'t care about this story though, I still hope it gets you to check out previous works because those are genuinely good and still hold up.Art: A little aside for a moment. Compared to Brotherhood, I liked the art for the original series better since they looked more straightforward for lack of a better term. There wasn\'t anything too strange or different about the way they looked. The faces of the characters looked ""sharper"" and I was okay with that. I know that both FMA and Brotherhood were made by the same studio and that for Brotherhood, they wanted to mimic the Manga\'s art style. I can respect that and have no problem with it as they were making faithfulness a priority in both art style and story (Seriously, lots of respect from me here). I suppose I was just used to the first FMA because it came first and I liked it so much. On the other hand, for both series the animation was fantastic. Things looked good as they happened and the characters were animated very well with little or no loss in art quality.For this film however, I think the art suffered a lot at times. Sometimes the faces of characters simply looked awful. Most of the time, it was fine but you can tell when the quality goes down. There\'s just this inconsistency that keeps coming up. I would expect more from a movie budget. On the other hand, the animation was just okay. Considering the quick chimeras they fight at some points of the film, the fast movements looked well done and exciting. The train fight was very well done and really one of the few highlights of the movie. What I definitely wasn\'t a fan of, were the Gurren Lagann shots during fights.http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/clubs/3/9348.jpgIf that wasn\'t a proper screenshot of what I\'m talking about but you\'ve seen Gurren Lagann, then you know what I\'m talking about. Plenty of shows have utilized this animation style. The movement might look okay but the art suffers tremendously and I don\'t understand why it has to be this way. I suppose the guys doing it like it but I really didn\'t care for it at all as it was quite distracting. It felt out of place when used and I didn\'t want to be reminded of Gurren Lagann when I\'m watching FMA.Sound: I can\'t comment much on the music. While I was watching it, nothing in the soundtrack stood out to me. I also didn\'t have an urge to track down the opening or ending song. Just going to give them the benefit of the doubt here since I can\'t judge this area fairly. The voice acting is fine (Watched the Japanese version) since it\'s the same cast as FMA Brotherhood and I don\'t think anyone could find them awful after so many performances. The two filler mains have pretty famous voice actors behind them and I was surprised to later find out who they were. For me, they don\'t bring in a performance that wowed me but they were fine for the roles they played. Not annoying or horrendous to listen to so I\'m good here.Character: Why were any of the FMA cast even in this film? If you took them out of it and rewrite just a tiny bit the plot could honestly still resolve the same way. I\'m all for giving attention to filler characters so they aren\'t just throw-away one-shots we don\'t care about but there\'s no reason to sideline the franchise\'s actual stars to do so. Ed and Al play the voice of reason in opposing the use of the Philosopher\'s Stone but really, anybody could\'ve taken this role. Unfortunately, at the end Ed also has to give heroic speech #2148 while fighting the main villain. I\'m reminded of all the times that Naruto and Ichigo have to spend time going through a heroic monologue in the middle of a major fight. FMA is better than this.Winry - I have nothing against Winry but she didn\'t need to be here at all other than because the writers/plot required it. If you\'re going to use Winry, make her do something other than fix Ed\'s arm during a fight. That\'s all she does here. If the writers didn\'t make Ed\'s arm break, she had no business being in this film. We don\'t need Ed\'s arm to break to indicate that the villain is strong. In FMA and Brotherhood, her character had things to do other than being a mechanic and that\'s what made her different from the usual useless female that\'s just in the show. Here, she\'s written into the film purely as a fanservice.Roy - I\'m pissed. If there\'s going to be any bias from me, it\'s here. To start, he shows up early on in the film so they establish that he\'s there. Great, now I have something to look forward to. Guess what? He doesn\'t do anything. He shows up at the final fight, I see him put on his gloves and I\'m like ""This is it!"". He doesn\'t even participate... All that happens is that after Ed fights the villain a little, they cut to Mustang with some burned chimera on the floor who at this point aren\'t even a threat. They didn\'t even show Roy taking them out. It all happened offscreen. What. The. Hell. Despite my dislike of why Winry was in the film, her fixing Ed\'s conveniently broken arm was far more than anything Mustang did in the whole film. When Mustang showed up in Conqueror of Shamballa, that was a big highlight for many. He did plenty to help and that was great. He had a place in the film because he did what soldiers with guns couldn\'t do, blow stuff up. And really, in a filler film where they have freedom with the characters, that\'s not too much to ask for. If you\'re going to put them in, make them do something.Everyone else - Armstrong makes a cameo just to whisper something in Mustang\'s ear, useless. Hawkeye has one bad ""comedic"" gun scene, useless. That\'s pretty much it for the characters we know and love. Anyone new to FMA would have no idea the importance of these four characters in the original story. As much as I like these characters, if they were going to be treated like this, I would rather they not be in the film at all. It would honestly be for the good of the film since whoever decided to make these choices with the characters obviously didn\'t care, so why were they in it? I went into the screening not too excited but knowing that these guys were in it raised some expectations which weren\'t met in the slightest. I\'m pretty sure I\'m not in the minority on this.I didn\'t care about the filler characters overall but I guess I should I talk about the obligatory female guest st- I mean main character. I\'m sure many who see this find her to be a good character and all but I\'m not a fan. Sure, she had some moments that one might classify as badass but I question a lot of her decisions. Her main goal is to save her people from the military using the Philosopher\'s Stone despite Ed and Al\'s objections that getting involved with the Stone is a no-no. Real-life examples right in front of her with how they messed up their bodies. This becomes a matter of temptation, a major theme in the FMA universe sprinkled all across the series. Later, she gets the Philosopher\'s Stone (not really a spoiler, you know the stone\'s going to come up) after watching the villain keep it in his hand to amplify his alchemic abilities. What does she decide to do? Does she decide to not use it, toss it to Ed and learn a lesson about fighting temptation? Does she do that? No, she eats it... which when done previously by other characters in the main series causes them to vomit and stuff. Good thing the plot conveniently doesn\'t let that happen here. There is no way she would know that eating it is any better than keeping it in hand like the villain did. Anyway, she participates in a crossfire of alchemic beams with the villain which is reminiscent of the final scene when Gohan was fighting Ce- Wait a minute, that\'s not how they usually fight in FMA at all. In FMA, fights are generally decided by skill and wits, not clashing alchemic beams... Then she wins thanks to [insert generic kizuna/nakama/main character power] reason. Not because of any well thought out reason, just another cliche. The end of the film results in her using the Stone to save her people and etc. with an overall minimal cost compared to the payoff. So, what lesson did we learn? Don\'t listen to warnings and do whatever? Using this character they have spit on a pretty crucial theme in FMA and that bothers me because I feel FMA is smarter than this.They\'re pretty in your face with who the bad guys are. One of the military guys looked like FMA\'s Yoki, stroking his thin upper lip hair. I wonder if he was a villain? Then, if we didn\'t already know the FMA military was corrupt, they shove it in your face. Including the Yoki guy, the military is once again keeping people down. This plot has been done to death. Where\'s the effort? The motivations for the valley people to do what they do is understandable as they\'re living under the military\'s control but again, I\'ve seen this a million times so I could care less. Some of the villagers die during parts of the movie, maybe one or two with names. They have a cremation and such but I felt like the plot was revolved around them to make the audience feel sad and sorry for these near nameless characters. Offscreen deaths of characters who aren\'t established properly or named for the most part aren\'t going to make me care any more than when a Jedi Council member died in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.Enjoyment: Not much. I was expecting something while sitting through the exposition and boring scenes and I got nothing. One of my friends fell asleep. I am severely disappointed and I hope that this will be the last one they make unless the original author writes it or the people who pitch it actually care about what they\'re working with. Conqueror of Shamballa was not much better but it was far better than this. Lesser of two evils since I can sit through that one again. I\'ll probably never watch this film again unless I was going to make a commentary/parody of it. Whoever was in charge of this film forgot why people like FMA: the well-done and unique story, smart and memorable characters, and their interactions. I usually hate character fanservice and pandering to the audience but this film REALLY needed some. If there was some effort put into writing a good story like we\'re used to in FMA, I wouldn\'t be asking otherwise. In this case however, having Mustang and Armstrong blow stuff up would\'ve been more than welcome despite being shameless. I\'m not asking for these two to take down the main villain but even a little more than what we got would\'ve been nice. FMA has such a colorful cast of characters and they\'re side characters in their own film.I could easily come up with ideas for a FMA film if it had to be filler. Why couldn\'t we get a look at Xing? As far as I know, we\'ve never seen the place and those characters made a big impact in the main story. Make one of the clans corrupt if you need an enemy. No different from the usual making of filler villains. The Xing characters have their share of fans so this could be a draw for people to see the film. Since they already established things for an epilogue at the end of Brotherhood, let\'s see it through. It would be interesting to see how our heroes now spend their days. Or make the story take place before Hughes died. I would\'ve loved to see more Hughes. Are these the best ideas? No. Will there still be some cliches? Probably, but the point is these premises are interesting and have qualities to draw people in. The trailer didn\'t really have any ""awesome"" to point out. I\'m sure everyone has their share of ideas that would beat this no contest. Filler doesn\'t have to be bad, especially if you have good characters to carry it. Since this film had to be filler, they had a lot of freedom and they just didn\'t care, much like Naruto and Bleach fillers/movies. I\'m hoping FMA doesn\'t become one of the many franchises that will continue to be exploited for no reason other than because we can and monies. If they stopped making FMA after Brotherhood, I\'d be okay with that as a fan because it had a good run. Brotherhood should be remembered as a well done story and a very faithful adaptation where the effort was clearly seen, something that doesn\'t come up often these days in Anime adaptations. This is a blatant blemish on an otherwise good record like Cars 2 for Pixar.Was there anything I liked about the film? At best I thought the train fight at the beginning was exciting and well done. That\'s about it. I would like to think that the film had potential if it was handled better and there are so many easy ways to improve it. It just unfortunately falls flat and rolls into a lump of cliches which the film could do without if a little thought was put into it. A couple of the twists I can see many people not expecting which might be fun for them but unfortunately, I could predict a lot of them. If you have a masked guy that only shows up for a movie with a self-contained cast, you\'re going to guess who he is. Unless, well... this.19:38 inhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wu5xfzbY2EThere was also this one scene that I almost couldn\'t handle and nearly turned away. No, this wasn\'t because of how bad the film was but more that the ""gore"" (for lack of a better word)  level was too much. It was far more than you\'d expect from FMA and since like many other things I\'ve omitted, it\'s a spoiler so I won\'t go into detail. However, if after this review you still decide to watch this, you\'ll know exactly what I\'m talking about. Watch with care... Couldn\'t they have found a different way to do this scene...? FMA isn\'t exactly for a young audience but this was too much. Seriously guys...Overall: I cannot believe that this is close to surpassing Conqueror of Shamballa while there still isn\'t a home release. I am hoping that when this film gets a wide release, everyone will see how bad it is. Mustang bias aside, you can\'t include these great characters in a film, not do anything with them and expect fans to be silent. I don\'t use the word often, but these guys must be trolls. Check out this interview with the director.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2011/otakon/20He didn\'t give anything close to a response about Mustang\'s ""involvement"". It seemed like an obvious thing to him that fans would be mad about everything that Mustang didn\'t get to do. He doesn\'t even TRY to explain himself. All he does is dodge the question by telling us something obvious. When asked about other FMA countries and the manga\'s ending, he just dodges it by saying that\'s the original creator\'s department. What?! Ask the author? No, we\'re asking YOU. Did you really think that those wouldn\'t be good ideas for a filler story? If he at least said that the creator wouldn\'t let them use those, fine but that\'s not what happened at all so guess who I\'m not siding with? According to Anime News Network, the guy who wrote the screenplay has only previously worked on Doraemon. Come on... is that the guy who you\'d count on to write an FMA film following the quality of Brotherhood? Let me just say I have nothing against the guy but it does seem to be a questionable choice when the only other Anime he\'s worked on was Doraemon. At least we learn from the link that FMA\'s creator had nothing to do with the story. I would feel even worse if she did and lose a lot of respect for her. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this film to anyone, not even FMA fans. It was a big letdown but I\'m sure dvd sales and box office will be as good as ever so the movie makers won\'t care. But if you haven\'t seen/read anything FMA before, check out anything else besides this movie. FMA is something that can easily stand the test of time and is much better than a lot of things being put out these days.As a fan of FMA I wanted to give my honest thoughts about the film because I walked out of it disappointed and mad. Again, one of the people I saw this with fell asleep... The plot holes, repetitiveness/reuse of plotlines, boring and cliche story, villains with no dimension, blatant ignoring of actual FMA characters who were in the film anyway for no reason, unnecessarily random and over the top ""gore"" scene, unreasonable runtime for what\'s in the film, and lack of FMA-ness killed it for me. It just didn\'t bring anything new to the table because while cliche stories can be done well or presented in a new way, that didn\'t happen here. It\'s all about the execution guys.Thanks for reading my review. I know this was a long one. I would appreciate feedback if you have any. to broaden their audience by giving a little background on the characters and why they do what they do. If this film was someone\'s first Fullmetal Alchemist experience, knowing what it\'s about might help guide them into the story. Unfortunately, for those who do know about FMA, there might\'ve been a tad too much for my liking. Beyond that the actual story is pretty generic and not very interesting. There wasn\'t anything to hook me in and it\'s a story that\'s been done to death. So I understand giving background for the newer audience but they really should\'ve considered the people that FMA has already roped in. What lead up to the climax is boring... I was waiting quite a while for the plot to kick in and it was maybe halfway in that relevant things started to happen, though I still didn\'t care enough.Let\'s talk about the actual story now. Or, you can just look at the themes that FMA has previously explored and watch/read that again. This is one of the major problems with the film. As a FMA fan, this is nothing new. Even in general, this is nothing we haven\'t seen before. There are some people being oppressed by the military and they\'re forced to live in fear under terrible conditions. Not too different from the Ishbalans. The greedy bad guys want the Philosopher\'s Stone for monies and to make the world into what they feel is a better place. It\'s up to our heroes to stop them. ""Classic filler plot""  basically sums up the story to be honest. The plot itself is pretty straightforward barring a few twists that I\'m sure many won\'t see coming. The biggest ""facepalm moment"" for me was the end of the final fight. One of the most random ""because the plot required it""/deus ex machina moments I\'ve seen in a while. More on that later though. Watching how they fight and how it ended really bothered me. There were also plenty of ""Oh, that\'s convenient"" moments throughout the film and unfortunately, they\'re pretty in your face. I was near insulted at how ""subtle"" they were about them too. I\'d like to share them with you but you know, spoilers. Even if you\'re new to FMA but not new to movie cliches, you shouldn\'t find this to be a great piece of work. If you didn\'t care about this story though, I still hope it gets you to check out previous works because those are genuinely good and still hold up.Art: A little aside for a moment. Compared to Brotherhood, I liked the art for the original series better since they looked more straightforward for lack of a better term. There wasn\'t anything too strange or different about the way they looked. The faces of the characters looked ""sharper"" and I was okay with that. I know that both FMA and Brotherhood were made by the same studio and that for Brotherhood, they wanted to mimic the Manga\'s art style. I can respect that and have no problem with it as they were making faithfulness a priority in both art style and story (Seriously, lots of respect from me here). I suppose I was just used to the first FMA because it came first and I liked it so much. On the other hand, for both series the animation was fantastic. Things looked good as they happened and the characters were animated very well with little or no loss in art quality.For this film however, I think the art suffered a lot at times. Sometimes the faces of characters simply looked awful. Most of the time, it was fine but you can tell when the quality goes down. There\'s just this inconsistency that keeps coming up. I would expect more from a movie budget. On the other hand, the animation was just okay. Considering the quick chimeras they fight at some points of the film, the fast movements looked well done and exciting. The train fight was very well done and really one of the few highlights of the movie. What I definitely wasn\'t a fan of, were the Gurren Lagann shots during fights.http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/clubs/3/9348.jpgIf that wasn\'t a proper screenshot of what I\'m talking about but you\'ve seen Gurren Lagann, then you know what I\'m talking about. Plenty of shows have utilized this animation style. The movement might look okay but the art suffers tremendously and I don\'t understand why it has to be this way. I suppose the guys doing it like it but I really didn\'t care for it at all as it was quite distracting. It felt out of place when used and I didn\'t want to be reminded of Gurren Lagann when I\'m watching FMA.Sound: I can\'t comment much on the music. While I was watching it, nothing in the soundtrack stood out to me. I also didn\'t have an urge to track down the opening or ending song. Just going to give them the benefit of the doubt here since I can\'t judge this area fairly. The voice acting is fine (Watched the Japanese version) since it\'s the same cast as FMA Brotherhood and I don\'t think anyone could find them awful after so many performances. The two filler mains have pretty famous voice actors behind them and I was surprised to later find out who they were. For me, they don\'t bring in a performance that wowed me but they were fine for the roles they played. Not annoying or horrendous to listen to so I\'m good here.Character: Why were any of the FMA cast even in this film? If you took them out of it and rewrite just a tiny bit the plot could honestly still resolve the same way. I\'m all for giving attention to filler characters so they aren\'t just throw-away one-shots we don\'t care about but there\'s no reason to sideline the franchise\'s actual stars to do so. Ed and Al play the voice of reason in opposing the use of the Philosopher\'s Stone but really, anybody could\'ve taken this role. Unfortunately, at the end Ed also has to give heroic speech #2148 while fighting the main villain. I\'m reminded of all the times that Naruto and Ichigo have to spend time going through a heroic monologue in the middle of a major fight. FMA is better than this.Winry - I have nothing against Winry but she didn\'t need to be here at all other than because the writers/plot required it. If you\'re going to use Winry, make her do something other than fix Ed\'s arm during a fight. That\'s all she does here. If the writers didn\'t make Ed\'s arm break, she had no business being in this film. We don\'t need Ed\'s arm to break to indicate that the villain is strong. In FMA and Brotherhood, her character had things to do other than being a mechanic and that\'s what made her different from the usual useless female that\'s just in the show. Here, she\'s written into the film purely as a fanservice.Roy - I\'m pissed. If there\'s going to be any bias from me, it\'s here. To start, he shows up early on in the film so they establish that he\'s there. Great, now I have something to look forward to. Guess what? He doesn\'t do anything. He shows up at the final fight, I see him put on his gloves and I\'m like ""This is it!"". He doesn\'t even participate... All that happens is that after Ed fights the villain a little, they cut to Mustang with some burned chimera on the floor who at this point aren\'t even a threat. They didn\'t even show Roy taking them out. It all happened offscreen. What. The. Hell. Despite my dislike of why Winry was in the film, her fixing Ed\'s conveniently broken arm was far more than anything Mustang did in the whole film. When Mustang showed up in Conqueror of Shamballa, that was a big highlight for many. He did plenty to help and that was great. He had a place in the film because he did what soldiers with guns couldn\'t do, blow stuff up. And really, in a filler film where they have freedom with the characters, that\'s not too much to ask for. If you\'re going to put them in, make them do something.Everyone else - Armstrong makes a cameo just to whisper something in Mustang\'s ear, useless. Hawkeye has one bad ""comedic"" gun scene, useless. That\'s pretty much it for the characters we know and love. Anyone new to FMA would have no idea the importance of these four characters in the original story. As much as I like these characters, if they were going to be treated like this, I would rather they not be in the film at all. It would honestly be for the good of the film since whoever decided to make these choices with the characters obviously didn\'t care, so why were they in it? I went into the screening not too excited but knowing that these guys were in it raised some expectations which weren\'t met in the slightest. I\'m pretty sure I\'m not in the minority on this.I didn\'t care about the filler characters overall but I guess I should I talk about the obligatory female guest st- I mean main character. I\'m sure many who see this find her to be a good character and all but I\'m not a fan. Sure, she had some moments that one might classify as badass but I question a lot of her decisions. Her main goal is to save her people from the military using the Philosopher\'s Stone despite Ed and Al\'s objections that getting involved with the Stone is a no-no. Real-life examples right in front of her with how they messed up their bodies. This becomes a matter of temptation, a major theme in the FMA universe sprinkled all across the series. Later, she gets the Philosopher\'s Stone (not really a spoiler, you know the stone\'s going to come up) after watching the villain keep it in his hand to amplify his alchemic abilities. What does she decide to do? Does she decide to not use it, toss it to Ed and learn a lesson about fighting temptation? Does she do that? No, she eats it... which when done previously by other characters in the main series causes them to vomit and stuff. Good thing the plot conveniently doesn\'t let that happen here. There is no way she would know that eating it is any better than keeping it in hand like the villain did. Anyway, she participates in a crossfire of alchemic beams with the villain which is reminiscent of the final scene when Gohan was fighting Ce- Wait a minute, that\'s not how they usually fight in FMA at all. In FMA, fights are generally decided by skill and wits, not clashing alchemic beams... Then she wins thanks to [insert generic kizuna/nakama/main character power] reason. Not because of any well thought out reason, just another cliche. The end of the film results in her using the Stone to save her people and etc. with an overall minimal cost compared to the payoff. So, what lesson did we learn? Don\'t listen to warnings and do whatever? Using this character they have spit on a pretty crucial theme in FMA and that bothers me because I feel FMA is smarter than this.They\'re pretty in your face with who the bad guys are. One of the military guys looked like FMA\'s Yoki, stroking his thin upper lip hair. I wonder if he was a villain? Then, if we didn\'t already know the FMA military was corrupt, they shove it in your face. Including the Yoki guy, the military is once again keeping people down. This plot has been done to death. Where\'s the effort? The motivations for the valley people to do what they do is understandable as they\'re living under the military\'s control but again, I\'ve seen this a million times so I could care less. Some of the villagers die during parts of the movie, maybe one or two with names. They have a cremation and such but I felt like the plot was revolved around them to make the audience feel sad and sorry for these near nameless characters. Offscreen deaths of characters who aren\'t established properly or named for the most part aren\'t going to make me care any more than when a Jedi Council member died in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.Enjoyment: Not much. I was expecting something while sitting through the exposition and boring scenes and I got nothing. One of my friends fell asleep. I am severely disappointed and I hope that this will be the last one they make unless the original author writes it or the people who pitch it actually care about what they\'re working with. Conqueror of Shamballa was not much better but it was far better than this. Lesser of two evils since I can sit through that one again. I\'ll probably never watch this film again unless I was going to make a commentary/parody of it. Whoever was in charge of this film forgot why people like FMA: the well-done and unique story, smart and memorable characters, and their interactions. I usually hate character fanservice and pandering to the audience but this film REALLY needed some. If there was some effort put into writing a good story like we\'re used to in FMA, I wouldn\'t be asking otherwise. In this case however, having Mustang and Armstrong blow stuff up would\'ve been more than welcome despite being shameless. I\'m not asking for these two to take down the main villain but even a little more than what we got would\'ve been nice. FMA has such a colorful cast of characters and they\'re side characters in their own film.I could easily come up with ideas for a FMA film if it had to be filler. Why couldn\'t we get a look at Xing? As far as I know, we\'ve never seen the place and those characters made a big impact in the main story. Make one of the clans corrupt if you need an enemy. No different from the usual making of filler villains. The Xing characters have their share of fans so this could be a draw for people to see the film. Since they already established things for an epilogue at the end of Brotherhood, let\'s see it through. It would be interesting to see how our heroes now spend their days. Or make the story take place before Hughes died. I would\'ve loved to see more Hughes. Are these the best ideas? No. Will there still be some cliches? Probably, but the point is these premises are interesting and have qualities to draw people in. The trailer didn\'t really have any ""awesome"" to point out. I\'m sure everyone has their share of ideas that would beat this no contest. Filler doesn\'t have to be bad, especially if you have good characters to carry it. Since this film had to be filler, they had a lot of freedom and they just didn\'t care, much like Naruto and Bleach fillers/movies. I\'m hoping FMA doesn\'t become one of the many franchises that will continue to be exploited for no reason other than because we can and monies. If they stopped making FMA after Brotherhood, I\'d be okay with that as a fan because it had a good run. Brotherhood should be remembered as a well done story and a very faithful adaptation where the effort was clearly seen, something that doesn\'t come up often these days in Anime adaptations. This is a blatant blemish on an otherwise good record like Cars 2 for Pixar.Was there anything I liked about the film? At best I thought the train fight at the beginning was exciting and well done. That\'s about it. I would like to think that the film had potential if it was handled better and there are so many easy ways to improve it. It just unfortunately falls flat and rolls into a lump of cliches which the film could do without if a little thought was put into it. A couple of the twists I can see many people not expecting which might be fun for them but unfortunately, I could predict a lot of them. If you have a masked guy that only shows up for a movie with a self-contained cast, you\'re going to guess who he is. Unless, well... this.19:38 inhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wu5xfzbY2EThere was also this one scene that I almost couldn\'t handle and nearly turned away. No, this wasn\'t because of how bad the film was but more that the ""gore"" (for lack of a better word)  level was too much. It was far more than you\'d expect from FMA and since like many other things I\'ve omitted, it\'s a spoiler so I won\'t go into detail. However, if after this review you still decide to watch this, you\'ll know exactly what I\'m talking about. Watch with care... Couldn\'t they have found a different way to do this scene...? FMA isn\'t exactly for a young audience but this was too much. Seriously guys...Overall: I cannot believe that this is close to surpassing Conqueror of Shamballa while there still isn\'t a home release. I am hoping that when this film gets a wide release, everyone will see how bad it is. Mustang bias aside, you can\'t include these great characters in a film, not do anything with them and expect fans to be silent. I don\'t use the word often, but these guys must be trolls. Check out this interview with the director.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2011/otakon/20He didn\'t give anything close to a response about Mustang\'s ""involvement"". It seemed like an obvious thing to him that fans would be mad about everything that Mustang didn\'t get to do. He doesn\'t even TRY to explain himself. All he does is dodge the question by telling us something obvious. When asked about other FMA countries and the manga\'s ending, he just dodges it by saying that\'s the original creator\'s department. What?! Ask the author? No, we\'re asking YOU. Did you really think that those wouldn\'t be good ideas for a filler story? If he at least said that the creator wouldn\'t let them use those, fine but that\'s not what happened at all so guess who I\'m not siding with? According to Anime News Network, the guy who wrote the screenplay has only previously worked on Doraemon. Come on... is that the guy who you\'d count on to write an FMA film following the quality of Brotherhood? Let me just say I have nothing against the guy but it does seem to be a questionable choice when the only other Anime he\'s worked on was Doraemon. At least we learn from the link that FMA\'s creator had nothing to do with the story. I would feel even worse if she did and lose a lot of respect for her.

I would appreciate feedback if you have any.', ""An unfortunate truth about the anime industry is that movies of long-running shounen manga are always trite and unremarkable: uninspired scenarios and forgettable guest characters being among the main reasons why. Though it's not surprising. Why bother thinking up an interesting plot when you know people will be drawn to the popular brand it's based on anyhow?''Full Metal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos'' – based on the acclaimed manga - is no exception. It's a forgettable if somewhat serviceable adventure flick with some exciting action sequences and a lacking story.

Speaking of which, those two really feel like empty shells of themselves. Al feels more like a living plot device while Ed is relegated to being a generic action hero. Worse yet is that they shoehorn in fan favorites like Roy Mustang and Riza Hawkeye only to have their involvement amount to nothing.

It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time through. ', 'Prequels and sequels are known to be tough to do well. They\'re dependent on and constrained by the original work (because of \'Fate/ Stay Night\', we all know that certain characters in \'Fate Zero\' have invulnerable plot armor). Still, there have been examples of such works that earn high critical praise. However, there is a third type of \'-quel\', the \'Interquel\'- a story that takes place during an existing story.

Not even Fullmetal Alchemist, though \'Sacred Star\' does make for a decent time for existing FMA fans.-Story-\'Sacred Star\' is set during the...\'Brotherhood\' storyline, but feels like it came out of the original anime- for all the wrong reasons. The plot is basically a movie length version of ""The Elrics find a lead on the Philosopher\'s Stone, investigate, and it turns out to not be the real thing"". There must be at least half a dozen filler episodes in the original anime that have the same story. Now, the story isn\'t all bad, we do get some cool world building that existing FMA fans will enjoy, and even if you can see the twists coming the journey is enjoyable just because we get to head back to Amestris one more time. The great downfall of any \'Interquel\' is that it categorically CANNOT do anything that would disrupt the main plot, so there are limits to how big the consequences of any action can be (come on, we all know going in that the Elrics aren\'t going to find something that will get them their bodies back).-Art & Sound-Little to say here. The animation production values are decent for a movie-length release, and sound is fine with the same voice actors reprising their roles from the main series. The art style is slightly different from \'Brotherhood\', but that\'s not a plus or minus.-Characters-We already know the main cast, and they stick to their established personas, so no harm no foul. The new characters Ed and Al meet are interesting enough, but not to the point that I wish could see lots more of them. There is some exploration of what it\'s like to be a small people group caught between two large and powerful nations, but not to any truly deep level.

Fullmetal Alchemist fans will like this movie  : )', 'This is going to be a Johnny-Come-Lately review, but after watching FMA: Sacred Star of Milos, I realized something about anime movies like this--non-canon movies about an established franchise stuck somewhere nebulously within the main plot--that\'s been bothering me for a lot of years now, and I felt like I wanted to share it.When I got done watching the movie, I didn\'t dislike it necessarily and I wasn\'t gushing about it. I barely had any reaction at all. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I thought the same thing about a lot of these non-canon movies (e.g. the Cowboy Bebop...movie, the Trigun movie, a lot of the One Piece movies). I don\'t hate them, but I don\'t love them either.That\'s when I realized that there are systemic story problems with non-canon intra-story that prevent the story from having any sort of meaningful impact. Here\'s my logic as it relates to the FMA movie:One of the aspects of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that I liked the most were the characters. Most of the principal cast felt like they grew and changed throughout the story. They learned new things, they changed a little, they thought of things differently, they had character arcs that built up throughout the series.The problem is that since the character arcs of the main FMA characters are already established by the show, there\'s really no way for them to grow in the movie. If the Elric brothers had some grand earth-shattering revelation during the course of the movie that fundamentally altered their worldview, wouldn\'t it be silly if they just discarded it by the time they left the movie\'s setting?This means that for convenience for the greater FMA story, everyone who\'s involved in the main story who is in the movie has to simply have no change whatsoever. You can\'t make a movie like this though, because then the plot of the movie will just be what the Simpsons would call, ""a bunch of stuff that happened,"" so what happens is that they toss in a group of side characters who have arcs throughout the course of the movie in order to have some sort of emotional climax.However, non-canon side characters in anime movies generally have much less screen time than the main story characters because an anime creator wouldn\'t have a side character upstage a main character. The result is that the emotional core of anime movies like FMA:SSoM is built on top of shaky ground and the characterization looks and feels extremely weak compared to the show.What you end up with with FMA:SSoM is a group of main characters that don\'t grow at all, a story that\'s visually appealing but doesn\'t have any impact to the FMA world as a whole, a setting that\'s far removed from the main story so as to have zero impact, and a bunch of side characters that grow in a rushed and superficial way.Which is a shame, because the art and animation is decent in the movie, and the dub is top notch (Funmation\'s voice actors did an amazing job with FMA as a whole), and we sympathize with the characters\' struggles in the show.I don\'t want to say, ""Don\'t watch this!"" because it\'s not a bad movie on the whole, but it lacks impact and is generally forgettable. Rent it from Netflix if you want a lazy Sunday movie. movie, the Trigun movie, a lot of the One Piece movies). I don\'t hate them, but I don\'t love them either.That\'s when I realized that there are systemic story problems with non-canon intra-story that prevent the story from having any sort of meaningful impact. Here\'s my logic as it relates to the FMA movie:One of the aspects of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that I liked the most were the characters. Most of the principal cast felt like they grew and changed throughout the story. They learned new things, they changed a little, they thought of things differently, they had character arcs that built up throughout the series.The problem is that since the character arcs of the main FMA characters are already established by the show, there\'s really no way for them to grow in the movie. If the Elric brothers had some grand earth-shattering revelation during the course of the movie that fundamentally altered their worldview, wouldn\'t it be silly if they just discarded it by the time they left the movie\'s setting?This means that for convenience for the greater FMA story, everyone who\'s involved in the main story who is in the movie has to simply have no change whatsoever. You can\'t make a movie like this though, because then the plot of the movie will just be what the Simpsons would call, ""a bunch of stuff that happened,"" so what happens is that they toss in a group of side characters who have arcs throughout the course of the movie in order to have some sort of emotional climax.However, non-canon side characters in anime movies generally have much less screen time than the main story characters because an anime creator wouldn\'t have a side character upstage a main character.

There\'s some generalized spoilers, and some creative language.I started the movie feeling pretty great, it inflected a great mood; I began reminiscing on how I don\'t credit FMA enough for carrying the shounen genre with a bearable series. FMA in my book, remains the only series to accentuate a ""strong"" shounen feel, it isn\'t melodramatic, the characters aren\'t fucking idiots, and it\'s logically held with in-depth mechanics. Despite those redeeming qualities,...very few of those were prominent in this movie, however, it wasn\'t necessarily a ""bad"" movie, it remained enjoyable, but it was objectively mediocre.Unfortunately, after the reminiscing was over, it started to go downhill from there: incessant bad developments ensued. Every development leaned towards the traditional ""bad"" cliche shounen, something that Fullmetal Alchemist typically doesn\'t represent; every other development halfway through changed from possibly ingenuous, to innocuously ""bad"" (deus ex machinaes). The first half was written by someone aspiring to retain the traditional Fullmetal Alchemist feel, while the second half was a collaboration between Ao no Exorcist and Guilty Crown. As much as I would like to criticize the weak plot, it wasn\'t completely bad. Some developments were somewhat ""good"", the ""bad"" ones just overshadowed the ""good"" in this case.Now the ending to this was also somewhat lackluster; it appeared to be a logically impossible ""happy ending"". The new characters were essentially on the brink of destroying the entire world, there isn\'t logic in granting them freedom without punishment. It\'s great that a smaller nation got it\'s ""independence"", but it\'s kind of surrounded by two powers. One power has a brigade of alchemists, while the other has a arsenal of chimeras. All it has is strong will, and determination, that isn\'t enough to defend itself against attack. Unless the surrounding nations contest the newly ""independent"" territory leading to a stalemate, but that\'s just the best case scenario.Overall, was an enjoyable watch I guess, didn\'t really expect much out of the movie. Although that ending with Ed complementing her was unneeded and somewhat forced, there wasn\'t exactly any development between those two, nevertheless actual chemistry.Also, where the fuck was the Mustang action, all he did was watch; I expected fucking fireballs everywhere. Seriously, probably one of the biggest what the fucks is him standing there while lasers are shooting everywhere. He has less than 30 lines this movie, he doesn\'t do anything but watch. Killed his vindictive personality.Objective Rating 5/10: It should be lower, but it being Fullmetal Alchemist rather than some other series alleviates some of the criticism. What FMA possesses is a unparalleled world on mechanics, alchemy. There isn\'t a shounen anime that comes close to it, it\'s just ingenuous and ""balanced"".Subjective Rating 6/10: More enjoyable if you watch it braindead. very few of those were prominent in this movie, however, it wasn\'t necessarily a ""bad"" movie, it remained enjoyable, but it was objectively mediocre.Unfortunately, after the reminiscing was over, it started to go downhill from there: incessant bad developments ensued.

As a stand-alone film, Milos is a decent anime-only storyline with Ed and Al having to tend to a complicated conflict occurring in a valley town with hostilities between nations, with a pair of alchemist siblings involved with those living in Milos Valley fighting to reclaim their homeland. There is enough time within the movie to flesh out details on this conflict and the two major movie exclusive characters where you can grow to care for the conflict that takes place....Unfortunately, the quality of the film's second half does take somewhat of a hit when more cliched storytelling elements come into play with the motives concerning one major character which play out no differently from the power-hungry military leaders of Amestris seen in Brotherhood and some rather convenient plot twists over events that occur. Beyond Ed and Al, the majority of characters who are in the FMA canon are mostly worthless in their existence within this movie as they only exist to fill screen time. Plus with it existing only as an anime-exclusive film, the events in Milos don't significantly affect anything with in FMA's actual plot continuity and doesn't really add anything new to the series.Visually, the film is a bit of a mixed bag. The scenic shots conveyed have a good amount of detail to them and are nicely drawn, doing well to show the differing living conditions between those within Table City and those within Milos Valley. The animation is also a step up from the Brotherhood anime as it features CG rendering at points with train shots and some of the piping used for alchemy during action scenes which are quite fluid, have no noticeable shortcuts and have their engaging points such as Ed fighting on top of a train with a chimera and some of the later heated conflicts that break out resulting in destruction throughout Table City. On the other end of the spectrum, character designs aren't much different in their level of detail and color shading from the TV anime, and their quality tends to degrade at points either during distant shots or whenever scenes get rather heavy on action.Overall, Milos is a decent entry in the FMA anime franchise despite it not contributing anything new to the FMA mythos. Despite its second half somewhat suffering in quality, its rather complicated plot between factions and the development with Julia's character is still an engaging one to see throughout the movie's run.

Indeed it wasn't perfect, but it wasn't horrible either.Story: The film starts out with a good mood, Ed and Al is on the run again.They get involved with some strange man who escaped from prison,and end up helping a girl and her village (very very short told)The problem with this story is that theres nothing new really. They are just...building on from what we know, Al and Ed searching for a way to get their bodys back, they help some random people, theres some awesome fights and thats it.Sound: The sound was good enough, the song in the start of the film was really good, the fighting scenes had fitting music too and the Romi and Rie is as always amazing voice actors. The other voice actors didn't really stand out in my opinion ..Art: I personally did NOT like the art. sure it wasn't horrible, i just think its a pity that the animators chose to animate the movie like this, when the series have such AMAZING animations! It's the same animators for this movie and the other FMA movie and series, so why the hell did they chose to animate FMA with the old-style raw animation? I don't get it.Characters: Well the characters where fine too. I actually kinda liked Julia, she wasn't annoying as the typical shounen-movie chick is. (And yeah, theres always a chick .. Naruto, Bleach, theres always a chick in the movies our heros gotta help) However this movie lack of our old FMA cast. Roy mustang was hardly shown, and on the other hand Winry was obviously only shown for fan service .. fan service is good, but please put it on the right places! Im sure everyone would have LOVED roy to be actually in action in this movie, instead of Winry running around.Enjoyment: again... fine. I enjoyed it, because i didn't had my hope up for this film to start with anyway. Actually i expected this to be worse.Overall: I give this movie 7 . It's fine enough. The problem here is that its not near the standard of the FMA series . I myself only watched FMAB but i heard a lot about series one too. This is just a normal filler movie, like the many fillers movies they made for Naruto and Bleach and One piece .. the problem here is just that people expect everything from FMA to be EPIC and this movie was NOT. it was just a standard filler shounen movie, as they make so many of on other popular series. They made this movie to get money obviously.But overall i will believe that IF you are a FMA fan, you will be able to enjoy this, if you from the start is aware of this being a filler film, and the animation and story not being as awesome as the series.

However, this films suffers from the lack of what made FMA one of the greatest anime in the history of anime, the Elrick brothers.The only reason, and I repeat, the only reason I watched this movie was to say a final farewell to Ed, Al, Mustang, and Riza. These characters were the reason why I personally loved FMA and was so intrigued by it. This movie gave me everything except for these iconic characters. I mean, sure there were...the odd brotherly love between Ed and Al but not nowhere enough to what I really wanted. This movie focuses on Julia and her brother, Ashley, and their journey, as well as the journey of the people of Milos. One thing that I really found interesting about this movie is how well done the story is. Without giving anything away the plot was extremely realistic and what happens in the movie is actually happening in todays world.There is no reason for this movie to not be drawn exceptionally well. FMA is a long lasting anime that has sold very well and has probably made Bones a lot of money, if it didn't they wouldn't have made this movie. So you would except the movie that they make to have exceptional artwork most cases it does, the fights are done very well and the character movements seems flawless. However, and I might be the only one that feels this way, I feel as if the art of the actual anime was better then this movie (again this is only my opinion).This movie is enjoyable, I loved being able to see Ed and Al interaction again and every scene with Mustang and Riza made me very happy but this movie did not give me the closure that I wanted from this series. I love FMA and I'm sure that most people that watch this movie also love FMA and there is no way that I'm going to tell you not to watch this movie, however, you should know that this movie is not meant to give us any closure from our FMA highs (especially because this movie is supposed to be placed between episodes 15 and 22) but this movie is more of FMA, and I guess that is all that matter. the odd brotherly love between Ed and Al but not nowhere enough to what I really wanted.

Addicted to the original series as it came out, I saw a small portion of Brotherhood and just couldn't get into it very easily, so after finding out that this movie was directly linked to the original series, I had to see it right away. This movie feels like something clear-cut from the original FMA, it feels like every aspect is all there that made me love it so much--aside from a few unavoidable changes. Everything changes with...time, but this was a change that was easily welcomed to one of my favorite anime of them all.Fullmetal Alchemist: The sacred star of Milos is a gem in the franchise, outshining the previous movies and OVA's with a well-written story and excellent animation/voice work done by the original cast. (minus Alphonse, but it has been years, to be fair!) The new characters integrated into the plotline were interesting strangers from the beginning, but their performance pulls you in as the movie progresses until you begin to appreciate their roles far more as it goes on. The 'sketchy' animation changes seem a little odd compared to the sharpness of the original series, but compared to Brotherhood's 'glossy' animation, I have to say I prefer this style far more; it's beautiful to watch, the new CGI style ties everything together well and watching it in true HD was a pleasure!The soundtrack was magnificent, albeit a little missed compared to how much everything else ensnared your attention throughout the duration of the film. The return of familiar characters truly felt like reuniting with long-lost family, and I found these new characters to be exciting to witness interacting with the classic cast. Overall, I find it wonderful that this storyline is inserted into the original series, so no knowledge of Brotherhood is needed to enjoy the sacred star of milos. The story to Fullmetal Alchemist has been concluded twice before, but the possibility of more Elric brother adventures as OVA's or films of this style would be a treasure all their own.Thank you for reading my first review, and I hope you enjoy the movie! time, but this was a change that was easily welcomed to one of my favorite anime of them all.Fullmetal Alchemist: The sacred star of Milos is a gem in the franchise, outshining the previous movies and OVA's with a well-written story and excellent animation/voice work done by the original cast.

The land of the proud people of Milos was conquered by Amestris, and the people were forced into slums in the surrounding valley. The story goes from a rebellion to the creation of the film's namesake: The Star of Milos, or otherwise known as a Philosopher's Stone. Of course, this ties in Edward & Al, and they also venture there to find the user of a mysterious form of Alchemy. The story isn't really anything special. However, Ed & Al really feel like...they are side-lined in this film and don't feel important to the plot. Their connection to the events are limited to the Philosopher's stone (which comes around halfway through the film), and their attempt to find the mysterious form of alchemy (which is scrapped very early on).The backgrounds and artwork look amazing and really, well, what you would expect from film quality. However, most of the shots are of cliff-faces and caves, which gets old fast. Animation is all around good, but where this film really falls down is in terms of the characters; the sheer lack of detail is horrendous and the dreadfully apparent changes in figure when they are in motion looks horrid. After watching Brotherhood, this are a real let-down. The characters, all in all, just look bad, which is unacceptable for a film like this. The battles, thanks to the animation, have a good exciting motion, but it is in some of these where the degradation in character detail really becomes apparent. Also, note: The transformation from Human form to Animal form for a Chimera looked really awesome.Voice acting is decent, as you'd expect, with returning voice actor Romi Paku for the Japanese voice of Edward (w/Vic Mignogna for the English) & Rie Kugimiya as Alphonse. Music was entirely forgettable, which is apparent to me because I have forgotten it all in the space of 10 minutes after watching the film.For me, the movie is too long. The second act goes for way longer than it should've and the film dumps so much useless crap about Milos origins that it is hard to stay interested during some of the dialog scenes. The main villain also was a dud, but this being the case did leave open for a good revelation nearing the end of the film. The final battle is adequately epic and the spectacle of the creation of the Star of Milos is certainly well done.All in all, it’s your average shounen, FMA flick; Nothing special, not bad, but nothing mind-blowing.

I don't know what else people were expecting and I just don't see why people can't just enjoy it as if they were promised something...else that wasn't delivered. All in all, this is a good movie.The military practices are still here. The lead was bad-@$$, especially towards the end. Any hint of romance toward the end was cute, but not unsettling as we all saw how the series ended. I was even laughing out loud at some parts, especially when Ed was just arriving in Milos.The only thing I didn't like was that Winry had such a minor role. It was like they dropped her in the middle of a big battle just to fix Ed's automail. But that's not enough to ruin it.Movie = Awesome. else that wasn't delivered.

The story brings the Elric brothers far from Central and the areas where they are normally are in both anime. Unfortunately, it is the same story line we almost always have. Apprised people trying to get their land back. The story feels kind of old when you keep making it all about a hunt for the philosopher’s stone.There are a couple inconsistencies that happen within this show like the fact that there is a Chimera...that has some human in him but yet it seems that he isn’t having any problems with his body unlike every other Chimera that we have seen.I’m not sure, but Julia seems to be a Mary Sue character in a sense. Everything bad is happening to her and yet she seems to be able to get out of her predicaments. They basically showed her as a girl that has had really bad things happen to her since a young age. She has had no time to have anything good happen and bad things happen to her. Even the story about her brother seems rather sappy.The whole story line seems to be exactly like every other storyline where a group of people are fighting for some ‘holy land’ somewhere. I’m wondering if the people who wrote Fullmetal Alchemist and the ones who wrote this one have something to do with the whole ‘Jews and Israel’ thing. It also gets really gory, lots of blood and guts scenes.When they show the CG, it actually looks pretty well done. They made it look rather close to the animation but it seems to be used unnecessarily in times when the item is still. This shows up in the first few minutes where there is a close up of Edward’s hand. The rest of the animation is actually pretty much the same as the anime, beautiful details and sometimes exceeding the anime. The fighting sometimes seems a bit awkward at times since we get a lot of flashing lights from alchemist. Now a bunch of characters seem to be rehashed versions of old characters.The voices are actually alright, though I’m not sure about Julia Crichton’s voice though. It seems really sweet and innocent.

Story: The story was great, full of suspense to the end with new kinds fights (awesome fights) with alchemy and brand new story which takes place in a different part of Amestries, Ed's country. It is really very good for the eyes because you don't get bored with the same place or area that you have already seen. Art: Well, the art was 90% good. It was not like Brotherhood at all and didn't have that much quality but it...was smooth and easy-flowing. Sound: As usual, the sound was great. The opening and the ending themes were fantastic. When you listen to them, you feel they were meant for FMA Brotherhood. They express Ed and Al to the core. The background music was terrific and very energetic. What can I say aout the characters? I love Ed. He is super hot and his English voice is so dreamy. He is the best and so are Mustang, Armstrong, Olivie, Hughes, the Homunculus, and many more. They are just so cool. I enjoyed it fully, so go and watch this masterpiece. I love you, FMA Brotherhood. Make more movies please because we miss it. was smooth and easy-flowing. Sound: As usual, the sound was great.

All in all it was a fun movie, but I couldn\'t help but think that with a little rewriting, this movie could\'ve been completely standalone and wouldn\'t even have necessarily played in the FMA universe. Ed and Al are there and do their thing, but I can see the movie playing out more or less similarly without them. I\'m not saying they were useless, but rather that the movie seemed disconnected from the rest of the story - not like an OVA episode that plays in-universe but disconnected to the main plot, but rather it seemed like the chracters...where taken completely out of their universe and placed in a different movie script (which kiiiiinda happens on a smaller scale). Mustang, Hawkeye, Winry and Armstrong also show up, but more or less only as a cameo - which did feel rather forced at some points, but helped the story feel more ""in universe"" and actually connected to the rest of the franchise.The movie was alright I suppose, but at the same time I didn\'t really feel like I was watching FMA. The story itself seemed shaky at some parts, too, I\'m not sure if it was underexplained or actual plotholes, but parts left me confused and at other parts I could swear that isn\'t how alchemy worked in this universe before. That being said, I still enjoyed the story. Kind of a 6 1/2 for me.On the technical side of things the mixing stuck out to me. I\'m not sure if this was an issue with my streaming provider, but the fight scenes were super loud while the dialogue was almost inaudible at points - I kept having to rearrange the volume to hear something while not bothering my neighbours.Also the art seemed surprisingly dated and rushed at some points, considering this released after Brotherhood and had a movie-budget. The original chracters at times looked like they were borrowed from another early 2000s anime. And Ed in particular stuck out to me as not really looking like himself at times, with the proportions being off and his eye colour (while looking really pretty) not matching up with the usual - it seemed more green than golden at times, which was a bit odd, given that his eye colour is even described in the dialogue in Brotherhood. Same thing went for Hawkeye, but that was more forgivable, given that she isn\'t the literal main character. It kinda had the feel of a fanfiction or new interpretation of the franchise, rather than an entry in the existing interpretation (which from the release date I\'d have sorted as playing during Brotherhood). where taken completely out of their universe and placed in a different movie script (which kiiiiinda happens on a smaller scale).

The sound and music were meh, nothing special really. The story was hideous, there is no other word to describe the story.The problem I ran into is it tried so hard to catch the magic from the first 10 episodes of the original FMA series. I got through the entire movie and felt let down at the end, there was some pretty...impressive usage of alchemy toward the end but other than that I could have gone my whole life without seeing it and felt like I wouldn't have missed out.The one thing I did like was the fluidity of the animation which was easily noticeable in the first quarter of the movie, but after I got over that the little things like lack of detail in the art and backgrounds started to seep in. The general colour pallet felt washed out or dingy and also felt lazy. I saw so many flat colours through out the film that by the end I was looking up fan art and found better shading and colouring skills from amateurs.Overall I'd say avoid this. Even if you are a fan of the series, avoid it. It's not worth the time or effort. impressive usage of alchemy toward the end but other than that I could have gone my whole life without seeing it and felt like I wouldn't have missed out.The one thing I did like was the fluidity of the animation which was easily noticeable in the first quarter of the movie, but after I got over that the little things like lack of detail in the art and backgrounds started to seep in.

Ittakes place in between Episodes 16 and 20 of Brotherhood. The movie does not add many new things other than a few characters and different variations of what was seen in the show. Feel free to watch it either after you finish the show or during it. It doesn't really matter since the feel of watching the movie is like watching another episode or a very long deleted scene.Dub or Sub?: Both....They used the same voice actors and the new characters had good dubs as well.Story/Characters (7/10): The movie is a lost episode. Its made well enough to be counted as another episode of the main storyline. The brothers are still trying to find a way to get Al's body back. After an incident occurs, Mustang sends to brothers to investigate. Adventure in a new location, military stuff, the Brothers doing cool alchemy, essentially more of the same thing happens. But there are changes that do make this movie interesting.The Elric Brothers: The brothers are awesome. You know who they are and what they do so lets continue on with the other characters.The Supporting Cast Members: Lets see, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Winry Rockbell and other characters from the show make minor appearances. It was good for us to see them again but their appearances seemed a bit unneeded.The New Cast Members:Julia Crichton: a female alchemist who fights to reclaim and restore of the country of Milos. She is very similar to the brothers themselves in terms of morality and love for family. She also serves as a potential love interest to them too. But, unlike them she is a revolutionary who fights to take back her country. She is also not afraid to kill when push comes to shove. Her backstory will be shown in the film.Ashleigh Crichton: Julia's brother is a spoiler so my description will be short. When he was young, he studied the notes and clues left behind by his parents regarding the secrets of Milos and the Sanguine Star. The movie will explain what happens to him next.Atlas: He is the Crichton family's bodyguard. Anymore than this will be a spoiler.Miranda: leader of the Black Bats, who fights for the valley-dwellers. She is determined to fight for every Milosian and will do whatever she can to accomplish her goals.Location: Table City, a city which lies on the border between Creta and Amestris holds a powerful secret....which will be explained in the film.Other notable/interesting things: werewolf-like chimera and the Black Bats, a group of winged soldiers.Art/Animation (10/10): The art/animation is slightly better than the show's. The colors were sharper and the animation was much more simpler.Sound/Music (10/10): The sound/music was good.Enjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed it. It wasn't awesome worthy but it was a good addition to the storyline.Summary/Overall (8/10): The story was decent.

It has always been and continues to be my favorite animation, manga, and story. Today I re-watched the movie that followed the end of the Brotherhood series, Fullmetal Alchemist: the Sacred Star of Milos.The movie tackles the usual themes of Fullmetal Alchemist: the value of truth, imperialism, death, and hints of feminism. I believe this movie, especially after having seen the Brotherhood series multiple times, concisely captures these themes. It shows us the dangers of blindly pursuing the truth, and how it can be corrupted by power and greed....It shows us the devastating impacts of imperialism through the plight of Ishvalans, alluding to the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. The movie goes a step further and shows us the abominable condition of the people of Milos –commenting on the humanitarian crisis in Palestine.I believe one of the most important themes –and whose importance I had just realized – is Death. Fullmetal Alchemist bids us to think of our lives as finite. This is the reason why we were introduced to the Philosopher's stone and human transmutation in the original series; and it continues to persuade us to think of it as so in this movie. What does it mean to have a finite life? Well, it means that this is the only life that matters. It means that we have a limited amount of time. Instead of thinking about what lies beyond, we come to focus on the precious and small amount of time we have left. This is something Heidegger tried to teach us in Being and Time, and he would agree with Hiromu Arakawa –the author of the manga– that it is mistaken and inauthentic to ignore our finiteness.Another astounding fact about this series is that Hiromu Arakawa is possibly the most successful and critically acclaimed female mangaka in an industry dominated by men. I believe her awareness of such a fact allows her to write compelling female characters that are unseen in other Shonen works. This is probably one of the reasons why Fullmetal Alchemist is appealing to so many. We have a female general like Olivia Armstrong who is ambitious, commanding, politically savvy, selfless, and caring. No wonder she trains and leads the strongest army in her country. We also have Izumi Curtis who is probably the strongest human being in the series and a brilliant alchemist who guided the main characters as a teacher and a mother. She isn't merely just a strong person though. She is a sympathetic character who failed to have a child with her husband and tried to bring it back by performing a human transmutation –causing the loss of her organs and the pain of seeing her child die again. This kind of complex and compelling characterization of women can be seen in this movie as well. Julia is a rebel who fights to take back her country. She is troubled by the implications of using a Philosopher's stone. She is troubled by the egregious deeds of her ancestors and family members. Yet, she musters up the courage to not only keep fighting but to use her life and the Philosopher's stone as a means to protect her people. This is not something you see in mainstream Shonen manga.Some may say that these themes were already explored in Brotherhood. My answer: so what? These are timeless questions that we need to keep asking ourselves. If you do not see them as such, I would be tempted to say that you wasted your time watching the series.Last but not least, let's talk about the animation. The animation of Brotherhood was superb, and the same studio animated the movie as well. It showcased a slew of different styles, beautiful landscapes, and even some 3D animation. The colors were vivid and it really helped hit home the exotic nature of this adventure film. I greatly enjoyed this film and I recommend it alongside Brotherhood and the manga.

It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst.Plot: 7.5 (I like to round up so 8 :P)It was simple. Not hard to follow.A fugitive alchemist with mysterious abilities leads the Elric brothers to a distant valley of slums inhabited by the Milos, a proud people struggling against bureaucratic exploitation. Ed and Al quickly find themselves in the middle of a rising rebellion, as the exiled Milos lash out against their oppressors. At the heart of the conflict is Julia, a young alchemist befriended by Alphonse. She'll stop at nothing to restore the Milos to their former...glory – even if that means harnessing the awful power of the mythical Philosopher's Stone. Easy right? :PArt: 6 The art was.....okay. It wasn't my cup of tea but it felt really rushed. Barely any shading, the tips of the hair oh gawd, As a anime artist myself it feels...frustrating. Also as you go on you notice that the quality seems to drop.Sound: 7The sound suited the scenes but there wasn't many that were memorable.Characters: 7Some of them felt OOC. Ed.. well only got mad like once the whole time. Roy and Riza felt...Useless? Al was..Al was ok I guess. The  new characters were ok. Julia and her bro were like normal Naive people...their age.  What I didn't like was they tried to put Al and Julia together! Ed you traitor! I thought you shipped AlMei too! ;^; (I ship AlMei lol)Enjoyment: 7It was ok. There was nothing to keep my eyes on the screen 100% of the time but there was enough for me to continue.Overall: 7.5 soo 8 :P glory – even if that means harnessing the awful power of the mythical Philosopher's Stone.

And the first movieConquer of Shambala was very good maybe a little better than series so how good was this second movie.Story:We have dramatic story it's shares despression and sorrowness quite a bit but it also has natural points describing old times.This is also interesting one because you can learn a new things from alchemy and it's history. But can story like this be a great one?Answer is: Yes, It's story that will make viewer to...feel characters despression and their own personal feelings towards the characters.I think right grade for this story is 9/10The Characters:We have our fateful travelers elric's brothers whose tricks are always fun to watch and their doing stuff that they are good at.Inspecting new places and getting information.Also Winry the Ed's childhood friend is there couraging them like always. Winry's hair style seems like same as Lucy's hair in Fairy Taile.Of course we have that flame guy and his accompanies from military whose actions will change many things.There is most important characters in this movie and they will change watching experiences so they get 10/10Art:First I want to mention that Alchemy looks beautiful and shocks that goes fast as lightning are stunning.Enviroment is really town based because there is buildings builded like inside of circle and towns seemsto have high technology.Animation is really good I don't see any weird details of it it's basic nothing unique. Art is great in this one so the right score would be 8/10Music:At beginning of movie is heard these peaceful lively tone delivered by Miwa.She's the same artist that made one opening to Bleach so her music was right pick for this movie because she has experiences with it.There is also different theme music playing in and I just love listening it. Nothing doesn't sound bad in this one.Some themes is same kind of music likeAkatsuki one in Naruto when something terrible is going to happen it plays in those scenes.L- Arch - en - ciel will play the ED music which is really good and I really like their music because its also fits the series.Music will get definitely 10/10Enjoyment:I enjoyed whole time while I was watching this movie. The final fight in the movie was fantastic and well made.Also some humor parts in this movie was so much fun.Enjoyment is going to get 10/10Overall:This movie really shows the nature of alchemist and friendship is important part of it too. It's movie that will be memoriable in Full Metal saga.I definitely recommend this movie all fans of FMA and also scientic people may love this movie too.But it really is something unique that you have to first see yourself.My Overall score for this awesome and fantastic made movie is gong to be 9/10 feel characters despression and their own personal feelings towards the characters.I think right grade for this story is 9/10The Characters:We have our fateful travelers elric's brothers whose tricks are always fun to watch and their doing stuff that they are good at.Inspecting new places and getting information.Also Winry the Ed's childhood friend is there couraging them like always.

They use a very simplified means of Alchemist that turns out to be way more dangerous and seemingly more unstable than the stuff we\'re use to.I don\'t know why Roy, Riza, and Winry had to be there.

I enjoyed the increased quality of art and animation that was present in this movie. Definitely worth a watch if you have seen FMA: B. I think the story got a little bland, however since it basically just copied the same idea from FMA:B another bad guy, more people dying to create philosopher's stones. I love the characters from FMA:B so this movie won me over still. I would recommend that you watch this movie after you finish watching FMA: B if you have not already. I did enjoy that the writers for this movie...decided to explore an area of the world that had not been previously explored in the series. decided to explore an area of the world that had not been previously explored in the series."", ""Update: upon watching some truly atrocious anime, I've decided to bump my rating of this up two notches, mainly for the art and characters. Make no mistake, I still support everything else in this review.Having finished FMA '03 (FMA), Conqueror of Shamballa (COS), and FMA Brotherhood (FMAB), it was only natural to move on to Sacred Star of Milos (SSM). While I still have my gripes with the ending of FMA and COS, they provided a reasonable ending to that story, if not a completely satisfying one. As COS was a film, I had certain expectations of it regarding production quality, and I was not...disappointed; Sacred Star of Milos, however, did not rise to any of those expectations, to put it mildly.Story-wise, this movie is filler; while it uses some concepts and characters from FMAB, it doesn't influence the series in any way and is never referenced in FMAB. Consequently, most of the suspense is dulled as you know none of the core characters suffer any permanent damage — unfortunately, this means they don't learn anything new either, and the characters and events introduced here are forgotten as if they never existed. However, this is not necessarily bad, as maintaining the status quo is a requirement of midquels.Story - 3/10If you've seen anything FMA-related in the past, the plot will hold no secrets or suspense; rather, some plot points are annoyingly convenient and border on lazy writing - for example: the existence of so many philosopher's stones, and the fact that everyone and their mother — including non-alchemists — seems to know what human transmutation does.As for the pacing, it felt like most of the scenes of the movie were stuck together without any kind of cohesive transition, and the storytelling was pretty basic: this is the part where we're shown the horrors of war, this is the part where we find out the bad guys aren't actually bad, this is the part where the heroine is in a pinch but gets saved at the last minute (several times!) and so on. Thus, the progression of the movie feels less organic and more like rushing to get to the next checkpoint on the list, resulting in a soulless story.Characters - 3/10The characters come across as shadows of their former selves. During the first half hour, I kept questioning why a movie called 'Fullmetal Alchemist' features so little of the title character, and this persists throughout the entire movie: Ed and Al appear very little and don't actually seem to do much aside from infodumping and stating the obvious. I have seen numerous complaints that FMA 2003 was plagued by filler episodes, but even those offered insight into character motivations and backstories ergo they were of value to character development, if not to the overall plot. Since it offers no character development to any of the core cast of FMAB, nor any development to the FMAB story, this movie is, from a functional perspective, less useful than a filler episode.Most of the action in SSM falls on the shoulders of Julia, the new main character, who, despite appearing more than the Elric brothers, is developed less than Rose from either TV series. Mustang, Riza and Armstrong appear solely to draw viewers in and have even less importance in the plot than the Elric brothers. The villains themselves hold little suspense if you're even slightly familiar with the FMA tendency of having a Big Bad behind the first villain.Art - 4/10And now we get to my second biggest complain about the movie: the art and animation. Bearing in mind that animation (movement and production) and art (character design and style) are two different things, it is possible for one to be better than the other, as is the case here, with the animation being notably better than the art. Contrary to the style we've become familiar with in previous FMA works, the character designs in SSM feature few sharp edges (making their hair look like putty — especially Ed and Julia's) and small pupils (which make them look permanently distressed), and their faces lack detail.The action sequences have a noticeable sketchy and stretchy look, which fits as long as you don't linger on them. Animation-wise, the battle sequences and even general movement in SSM aren't as fluid as in the TV series, which was a disappointment considering the fact that, as a movie, SSM should have had more attention paid to these. Add to this the lack of closeup shots in favor of either zoom-ins or shots from far away (probably to mask the bad art), and you've got a very static-looking movie.Sound - 4/10The 2 points [edit: later bumped up to 4] I gave to this movie are mostly for the voice acting, which was on par with the TV series; I will blame the excessive shouting on the bad direction, not the actors. As for the soundtrack: while none of the OP or ED pieces caught my attention, the score was decent and supported the scenes well, albeit forgettable as the other parts of this movie.Enjoyment - 3/10Overall, I feel this should be avoided even as a fan of the FMA story; it adds nothing new and may even sour one's enjoyment of the previous stories in retrospect. Furthermore, most of it features mistakes in filmmaking in general: dumping too much information and plots at the same time, introducing many characters without giving them any depth, underusing core characters, and dropping what makes the FMA story interesting in favor of soap opera-level cliches — all of which make this movie a chore to watch.Overall - 4/10Personally, I only watched this for the sake of completion, but even as I was watching it I began to regret the wasted time. I'm normally a proponent of having people form their own opinion on something, but this time I feel I need to say this: avoid Sacred Star of Milos, you're not getting that time back. disappointed; Sacred Star of Milos, however, did not rise to any of those expectations, to put it mildly.Story-wise, this movie is filler; while it uses some concepts and characters from FMAB, it doesn't influence the series in any way and is never referenced in FMAB.

Creators realize they have one sweet cash cow and they want to milk her dry. So many horrible things like the Star Wars prequels and Cursed Child have come from those abused cash cows and now we get to add The Sacred Star of Milos to that ever-growing list. Mediocre at best and an absolutely awful film at worst, SSOM is a shameless attempt to capitalize off of the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise. If you couldn’t tell by the score I gave this...movie, it was a pretty lousy attempt.Animation:You’d assume that they’d at least get the animation right. Haha nope. The animation uses a somewhat different style from Brotherhood and it… doesn’t really work. Everyone’s hair looks like tentacle monsters, the frame rate is slow, and the action scenes aren’t very sharp or well animated. It had a sort of experimental feel to it, like the animators didn’t really know what they were doing and didn’t really care. And if that was the case, it shows.Sound:Fine I guess. All the old characters keep their voice actors and none of them turn out a particularly bad performance. However, there’s nothing amazing either. All the music is perfectly average and there’s almost nothing of note to say about the sound.Plot:Now here’s where we run into the bigger problems. The plot of this movie is a rehash of things we’ve already seen in the FMA franchise and honestly, it’s pretty dumb. Milos is just another, less interesting Ishval and of course there’s a giant transmutation circle and a philosopher’s stone. Of course. The creators of this movie had a beautiful rich world filled with creativity handed to them on a silver platter and they chose to do things we’ve already seen from the franchise. The biggest sin this story commits though is the complete lack of a reason why any FMA characters need to be here. With a little tweaking to the script, Ed and Al could easily be written out of this movie. That makes the movie a very poor way to introduce someone into the FMA franchise. In a movie based on preexisting works, you have to strike a careful balance between appealing to people new to the franchise and appealing to longtime fans. Movies like The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya strike this balance perfectly. With just a little explaining, you could show that movie to someone completely new to Haruhi Suzumiya and it also has something to offer to old fans. SSOM completely fails at this. Alchemy and Ed and Al’s backstory is so badly explained, no one who hadn’t seen or read FMA would any idea as to what was going on. Yet the movie also included exposition dumps that felt like they were intended for newcomers. That way, nobody wins. The twists in the plot are laughable and are either asspulls that make no sense (like the whole skin-grafting thing- has anyone working on the story seen the results of a real face transplant?) or incredibly obvious twists you could see from five miles away. Seriously, we all knew Melvin was evil. There were so many holes in his story it is a miracle anyone believed him as long as they did. And can we talk about the ending for a second? Julia opens the gate of truth. If we consider this as canon information, why isn’t Father trying to get his hands on Julia? Then he wouldn’t have to use Roy as a sacrifice and it would be much more convenient for him. Overall, this is just bad writing. No effort or love was put into this story at all.Characters:*heavy breathing*Original characters- None of the characters this movie creates are particularly interesting. Julia is given some time to develop, the problem is that she just isn’t an interesting character. Rather, she’s a textbook Mary Sue. The villains are laughable, flimsy pieces of cardboard with almost no motivation and anyone else was so forgettable I don’t know what to write about them.FMA characters- With the exception of Ed and Al, returning characters from FMA do absolutely nothing in this movie and are only there to provide fanservice. Winry does not need to be in this movie, Roy does not need to be in this movie, and Riza does not need to be in this movie. Like I mentioned earlier, Ed and Al honestly don’t need to be in this movie either.Enjoyment:An utterly joyless experience. Watching one of my favorite franchises degraded so much was agonizing and I found myself shouting at the screen, that’s how much certain events frustrated me.

Both of them. The individual great concepts the series share and have unique to themselves combine to create my ideal series, and obviously I don\'t necessarily take offense at creative liberties, or in another words, deviations from the ""canon"" so long as it\'s a place worth going to. Unfortunately, the non-canonical side story movie Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos neither possesses the same distinct qualities of either series and the superficial bases it copies aren\'t taken in any fresh directions. In other words, it\'s a pretty average non-canon anime...movie made for a buck.These sorts of movies are generally bogged down through weaker executions of more inventive ideas and series concepts used in what they\'re based off of, and equally unmemorable new characters. TSSoM has the Elric brothers chasing after an escaped convict Alchemist who shoots lightning from one hand and ice from the other like some sort of X-Men, even though this should be impossible by the series\'s Alchemy rules as he essentially conjures these things out of thin air and this is never properly explained. The convict brings the Elric brothers to the Table City in the middle of Creta, which is undergoing civil conflict after the native Milosians were forced underground by invading armies after the Philosopher\'s Stone. Thin reasons to add Winry, Mustang, and Hawkeye are given even though this situation isn\'t particularly dangerous for the Elric brothers and the Amestrian military is already stationed at Table City. In one of the stranger attempts at fanservice we\'re even given a Yoki clone in the form of one of the Amestrian military commanders that I already have forgotten the name of.Only the Elric brothers and the original characters end up doing anything of real importance anyway, and the two get involved in the Milosian\'s underground resistance who are also in search of the Philosopher\'s Stone. This should sound familiar, as the whole situation is extremely similar to the Ishbalan plot from both series and none the better for it. The most baffling thing in the whole movie is that the Milosian resistance dresses up in bat costumes complete with plastic visors as they soar through the air above on hang glider bat wings attacking the military, even though this makes even less sense when you consider they begin several thousand feet deep into a valley. Will the Elric brothers find out a secret to help them get their bodies back? No, you know they won\'t because nothing in here has overall plot or character importance to the franchise. Will they be able to stop the bloodshed between both sides and prevent more tragedy? I know I personally never cared about the answer to that question, because original character Julia is basically just a stand-in for old character Rose in a less compelling situation. It\'s also pretty funny that regarding her brother Melvin they use the same plot twist twice within about 15 minutes and this went unnoticed by the writers for how lame it was.The biggest missed opportunity here is despite the movie\'s reliance on constant long action scenes they\'re all just a series of explosions and generic physical combat, with little of the Alchemic creativity or special powers of the series that make them suspenseful. There\'s a ton of motion in TSSoM, but none of it gives the viewer a reason to feel excited. This also means Edward Elric\'s fighting intelligence, his best trait, really goes to waste. The two mostly just do a lot of running and transmuting of stone walls. For a feature film the production isn\'t particularly great, not looking much better than Brotherhood and still worse than the original series. The character cels are colored very simply solid, and there\'s a lot of sloppy faces and background characters. The score has a few pretty decent compositions that beat out most of Brotherhood\'s OST, but the music hardly plays a large role in the events of this movie.Though it\'s unfortunate the franchise wasn\'t held to the higher standard it deserved and the movie particularly suffers through very long empty feeling action sequences, it\'s always nice to see Ed and Al again in any context. Even still, this is the least essential Fullmetal Alchemist entry. Its qualities have been done better before, and it offers no new ones to the franchise. If you haven\'t seen the original or Brotherhood yet somehow, hop on it. Watch Conquerer of Shambala before this. Watch the Premium Collection. Watch anything, because The Sacred Star of Milos should be pretty low on your priority list,  even if you\'re the biggest of fans. movie made for a buck.These sorts of movies are generally bogged down through weaker executions of more inventive ideas and series concepts used in what they\'re based off of, and equally unmemorable new characters.

It had the same feel that the anime series did, and in my opinion could easily fit in to the plot of the actual series without much problem. It was full of some stellar fight scenes, and some great pacing which is one of the reasons I love FMA:B in the first place.There were quite a few new characters introduced and they're pretty interesting and for the most part well developed. The animation seems to be turned up a notch from the anime, which is normal considering its a movie. The OST is fine, nothing to write home about...but isn't terrible out of place.The story throws out concepts that fit perfectly into the FMA:B universe and has some introspections into things that happen later on during the series.As a person that absolutely loves Fullmetal Alchemist, I can recommend this movie. It takes place probably mid-way in the series(I'd say anywhere in the 20s if I had to guess off-top) and fits in perfectly. Interesting characters, good animation, solid plotline, and average soundtrack. but isn't terrible out of place.The story throws out concepts that fit perfectly into the FMA:B universe and has some introspections into things that happen later on during the series.As a person that absolutely loves Fullmetal Alchemist, I can recommend this movie.

Very often you get milking attempts which end up as complete wrecks, trying to keep the hype train going and get a few dollars more out of a franchise that already hit it's peak.The worst part of this unnecessary movie is the story. It's in no way connected to the main series, doesn't have a proper set up, has a very weak world building, it's riddled with cliches and doesn't leave any impact on the main characters after it gets resolved. There was no sense of danger, mystery and/or tension which were so prevalent in Brotherhood...and that made it very boring.Edward and Alphonse are completely out of character and  behave and feel nothing like in the main series not to mention that they look very bad compared to Brotherhood because of the awful art style. A few of the key characters from the main series also show up but their impact on the plot is nonexistent. The newly introduced characters and villains are bland and lack any characterization and real motives. The drama tries to make you feel sad by force (such as during the cremation scene or during one of Julia's hissy fits) but fails miserably due to a lack of character development and emotional buildup.The animation is pretty good, especially during the fights but the fights themselves lack any sort of creativity and weren't exciting at all. The soundtrack and the OP and ED were inferior to the main series and I didn't find any of songs particularly interesting. It's a good thing they didn't reuse any of the amazing tracks from Brotherhood. This movie is not worthy of them.Don't waste your time with this and watch something else.

This was just bloated in so that the movie could reach full length runtime, leaving it with around 50 minutes of ""new"" footage  that adapts the current arc of the manga.The movie also features:Terrible animation and overuse of poorly made CGI....Shallow story with no stakes, zero development for the main characters and heavily censored violence.Conclusion:As a fan of the series, this was a complete dissapointment. It is a boring, lazy, underwhelming excuse of a movie and destroys any chance of the anime ever getting a proper second season.

It is a boring, lazy, underwhelming excuse of a movie and destroys any chance of the anime ever getting a proper second season.', 'Don\'t worry, this is a review of Goblin\'s Crown. I must cover a few things first...In my experience I\'ve found that Goblin Slayer seems to be a series that most people either love, hate, or think is just a whole lot of average. I can understand where those who aren\'t fans of the show are coming from. When I first watched Goblin Slayer I found the first couple episodes to be unbearable and it was with great reluctance that I continued on to episode three. I was entertained by the new character interactions and decided to continue onward. By the end I had greatly enjoyed...the series for its fantasy action and characters, giving it an 8/10 final score. Several months later I wanted more Goblin Slayer so I decided to purchase and read the light novels. This is when I really fell in love with the series.The influence tabletop games, specifically DnD, have had on the author when writing this series is much more obvious in the light novels. Some examples that immediately come to mind are the existence of random critical hits and how all the evil guys in the world are referred to as ""Non-Prayer Characters."" This influence can be seen in the anime through how the main characters have a limited amount of skills that they can use each day. The author of Goblin Slayer thought, what if there was a DnD character whose entire purpose was to kill goblins? And hence we got Goblin Slayer. My point with this is that I think it\'s very important that everyone keep in mind when watching the series that this is fully intended to be a darker realistic fantasy focused on the slightly more mundane aspects of adventuring within a tabletop game. Goblin Slayer and company are not portrayed as the heroes who will save the world. They are only Silver-rank and must work together and use their skills together in order to overcome every foe they face. Given that nearly all of their foes end up being goblins with some twist on the scenario, I really can understand how the series might not appeal to everyone. However, having read the light novels I have a much greater appreciation for just how much thought is put into each scenario and how the main characters, especially Goblin Slayer himself, move through that scenario, sometimes making decisions on the fly but often following clever plans that take down goblins in new and creative ways.I begin with all that because I want to express where most of my enjoyment of the series comes from and why I\'m rating this OVA rather high compared to average score and other reviews. And also as a strong recommendation that everyone goes and reads the light novels hehe. On to the specific review...STORY and ENJOYMENT - 10/10I\'m rating the plot based on well I felt it followed the story from the light novels. In a surprise plot twist, Goblin Slayer receives a new quest that involves killing goblins. Well, that\'s not the focus of the quest. But goblin killing happens believe it or not. As I mentioned earlier, you aren\'t going to find much in the way of brand new enemies and scenarios that Goblin Slayer and co. find themselves fighting. I\'ve also already covered why I think the series is entertaining. Goblin\'s Crown does not disappoint with regards to that and as the first new arc I encountered in the light novels I was particularly impressed with it, especially the end sequence. There is some mystery involving the goblins\' presence and activity that grows and we\'re left with a sense of something bigger than just goblins being afoot. This trend doesn\'t stop going forward in the story and I hope that understanding this might also help more people to enjoy this OVA.I\'m including my overall enjoyment with the story here because let\'s face it, there isn\'t really much of a bigger plot to consider when it comes to Goblin Slayer. The only consistent aspect of a plot throughout the series are the development of character relationships over time. I greatly enjoyed the Goblin\'s Crown arc in the light novels and seeing it animated (decently) was awesome. Goblin Slayer trusting his teammates to use their skills at the right moments all comes together in on an epic stage at the end.ART - 7/10This is pretty much where all my grievances with the OVA come from. Overall the animation is little better than any of the seasonal episodes. Some CGI is still present for Goblin Slayer himself and even poorer CGI is used occasionally for the goblins. Goblin Slayer was fully animated more often than in s1, as well as the more important fight(s), though it\'s obvious shortcuts were taken and some of the fighting is just looping sword smacking. With that said, I think the world of Goblin Slayer is still brought to life well enough and I hope more animation adaptations are green-lit in the future.SOUND - 10/10Goblin Slayer\'s personal theme is badass and is played at the right moment. The rest of the score is fitting for the tone of each scene. Yeah, music was good. Not as much heavy metal as the series.CHARACTER - 10/10I think this might be where the light novels surpass the anime the most. The anime portrays all the characters well enough, we get their personalities, tendencies, and interactions with each other. The light novels often show us what they are thinking as well, which doesn\'t come across in the anime. However, I feel this is just a curse of animation in general. Anyway, my 10/10 score is very much influenced by my appreciation of the LNs.OVERALL - 9/10In the end I was very happy with the adaptation of this arc and I can\'t wait for the possibility of more. I do wish the animation was better but what can ya do, sometimes it just be like that. I recognize why some folks can\'t enjoy it as much as I do and in those cases I do really recommend you give the LNs a try if you have the time and means to do so. the series for its fantasy action and characters, giving it an 8/10 final score.

In fact, it would make this movie look even worse in comparison.The first 25 minutes are just a recap of the anime series, but it doesn\'t even do a good job at summarizing what\'s so interesting about Goblin Slayer if this was your first exposure to the franchise. And that\'s under the generous assumption that someone who has never watched or read Goblin Slayer would be interested in...giving it a shot by watching the movie first.Goblin Slayer works as a concept, because it shines the spotlight on someone who is obsessed with staying in his lane, doing the one underappreciated job that nobody thinks is important. It puts emphasis on a lot of small details that are usually glossed over in other fantasy works and makes you think about cliché monster encounters with a more realistic and pragmatic mindset.But the recap only shows that Goblin Slayer kills goblins mercilessly, that he pulls out unconventional tricks in tough situations, that he keeps on fighting with sheer determination, and that he learned to overcome his insecurities through stoicism. That\'s not to say that these aren\'t also important parts of the original series, but it\'s not what I would\'ve picked. Especially the battle scenes were an unnecessary foretaste of what\'s to come later on in the movie. It would\'ve been the better choice to not remind us how the Goblin Champion and Goblin Lord were defeated, because the method they use on the Goblin Paladin in this movie is a lot less spectacular.As for the new content... everything is poorly paced. A lot of smaller scenes are inconsequential and don\'t do anything besides filling time. The action coordination in the latter half is extremely poor and doesn\'t live up to what you\'ve come to expect from the rational and methodic Goblin Slayer.What was the point of the poisoned arrow? You\'d think it\'d be to follow the blood trail to find the nest, but its spreading effect apparently didn\'t do significant harm to this goblin horde.What was the point of the Elf getting shot in the leg? You\'d think it\'s supposed to give the heroes a handicap, but she\'s completely fine for the rest of the movie. If it\'s only there to show that the goblins learned the trick, it only proves the poison arrow trick more useless.What was the point of the Berserk brand? It flared up later on and gave the rich daughter a panic attack that ruined any strategy they might\'ve come up with, but the brand wasn\'t necessary to make her scream in that scene. Was I wrong to expect a God Hand plot where a human sacrifice summons a bigger monster?What would they have done if the rich daughter hadn\'t attacked the goblin priest? They blame her for ruining their cover during the coronation ceremony, but there was no way to let the priest live in the prison scene.What was the point of the armory scene where they destroy all the weapons with rust magic? The Dwarf apparently did save a bag full of weapons for the mountain scene later on, but it didn\'t have a noticeable impact on the goblins\' offensive capabilities.Why didn\'t they use the Dwarf\'s stupor magic or the rich daughter\'s lightning magic when all the goblins were gathered in the courtyard? Goblin Slayer loves efficiency!Why did they split up into a bait team and a prisoner rescue team when the most pressing issue should\'ve been defense from the goblins? They could\'ve easily freed those prisoners later on when all the goblins were eradicated.Why did nobody light the oil on fire when Goblin Slayer threw the bottle?Why didn\'t the goblins cut the rope on Goblin Slayer\'s grappling hook when he casually climbed down the fortress wall?What was the point of having everybody wear underwater breathing magic rings for the avalanche when the Priestess proved that a Protection barrier was much more effective? Goblin Slayer himself ended up being the only one caught up in the avalanche anyway.Why would Goblin Slayer decide to bait the whole goblin army out of the fortress when there\'s a high possibility that a lot of them will remain inside, or that a lot of them will evade or even survive the avalanche?None of this was necessary, and I can\'t help but feel that we were cheated out of a much more interesting battle strategy because the writer was too in enamored with the sea gate scroll scene from the series in which Goblin Slayer uses the forces of nature to wipe the whole enemy army out with one move. It sacrifices character integrity only to rehash old material that was done better previously.Last but not least, I gotta mention that the rich daughter is ducking annoying and unlikable. Her hubris lead to a whole team of adventurers dying horrible deaths, she then unrepentantly joins the cleanup mission, only to fuck it up multiple times with her emotional outbreaks and physical inadequacies. But there\'s never a redeeming moment when she really gets her shit together and grows as a person. At least I wouldn\'t call it ""growth"" when the Priestess nudges her so she would stop wavering, or when Goblin Slayer tells her to shoot her lightning and then she does. That\'s just the bare minimum of functioning as a person in that world. She\'s clearly missing the coping process that the Priestess had to go through at the beginning of the series, so we\'re left with a much shittier version of the Priestess. And this is the character that the whole plot of the movie revolves around.All in all, wasted potential. The Goblin Slayer world and cast can be really interesting, but the franchise doesn\'t do it justice. Would not recommend, even if you\'re a fan and you\'re starving for more content. You\'ll only ruin your appetite. giving it a shot by watching the movie first.Goblin Slayer works as a concept, because it shines the spotlight on someone who is obsessed with staying in his lane, doing the one underappreciated job that nobody thinks is important.

The action coordination in the latter half is extremely poor and doesn\'t live up to what you\'ve come to expect from the rational and methodic Goblin Slayer.What was the point of the poisoned arrow? You\'d think it\'d be to follow the blood trail to find the nest, but its spreading effect apparently didn\'t do significant harm to this goblin horde.What was the point of the Elf getting shot in the leg? You\'d think it\'s supposed to give the heroes a handicap, but she\'s completely fine for the rest of the movie. If it\'s only there to show that the goblins learned the trick, it only proves the poison arrow trick more useless.What was the point of the Berserk brand? It flared up later on and gave the rich daughter a panic attack that ruined any strategy they might\'ve come up with, but the brand wasn\'t necessary to make her scream in that scene. Was I wrong to expect a God Hand plot where a human sacrifice summons a bigger monster?What would they have done if the rich daughter hadn\'t attacked the goblin priest? They blame her for ruining their cover during the coronation ceremony, but there was no way to let the priest live in the prison scene.What was the point of the armory scene where they destroy all the weapons with rust magic? The Dwarf apparently did save a bag full of weapons for the mountain scene later on, but it didn\'t have a noticeable impact on the goblins\' offensive capabilities.Why didn\'t they use the Dwarf\'s stupor magic or the rich daughter\'s lightning magic when all the goblins were gathered in the courtyard? Goblin Slayer loves efficiency!Why did they split up into a bait team and a prisoner rescue team when the most pressing issue should\'ve been defense from the goblins? They could\'ve easily freed those prisoners later on when all the goblins were eradicated.Why did nobody light the oil on fire when Goblin Slayer threw the bottle?Why didn\'t the goblins cut the rope on Goblin Slayer\'s grappling hook when he casually climbed down the fortress wall?What was the point of having everybody wear underwater breathing magic rings for the avalanche when the Priestess proved that a Protection barrier was much more effective? Goblin Slayer himself ended up being the only one caught up in the avalanche anyway.Why would Goblin Slayer decide to bait the whole goblin army out of the fortress when there\'s a high possibility that a lot of them will remain inside, or that a lot of them will evade or even survive the avalanche?None of this was necessary, and I can\'t help but feel that we were cheated out of a much more interesting battle strategy because the writer was too in enamored with the sea gate scroll scene from the series in which Goblin Slayer uses the forces of nature to wipe the whole enemy army out with one move. It sacrifices character integrity only to rehash old material that was done better previously.Last but not least, I gotta mention that the rich daughter is ducking annoying and unlikable. Her hubris lead to a whole team of adventurers dying horrible deaths, she then unrepentantly joins the cleanup mission, only to fuck it up multiple times with her emotional outbreaks and physical inadequacies. But there\'s never a redeeming moment when she really gets her shit together and grows as a person. At least I wouldn\'t call it ""growth"" when the Priestess nudges her so she would stop wavering, or when Goblin Slayer tells her to shoot her lightning and then she does. That\'s just the bare minimum of functioning as a person in that world. She\'s clearly missing the coping process that the Priestess had to go through at the beginning of the series, so we\'re left with a much shittier version of the Priestess. And this is the character that the whole plot of the movie revolves around.All in all, wasted potential. The Goblin Slayer world and cast can be really interesting, but the franchise doesn\'t do it justice. Would not recommend, even if you\'re a fan and you\'re starving for more content. You\'ll only ruin your appetite.', ""Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown begins with a 25-minute recap of the first season's highlights, preparing viewers for the film's events.At the end of the recap, the movie begins, lasting an hour. Despite the inviting premise, the narrative disappointed me. After the first season's introduction, I expected a more linear and inspired story, one that would convince us to follow the development of the events of Orcbolg or Beardcutter, the names by which Goblin Slayer is known to the elves and dwarves, respectively.The Sword Maiden has a new assignment for Goblin Slayer and his companions: a noblewoman swordswoman has decided to abandon her family to become...an adventurer and has accepted the task of eliminating the goblins that infested a small village lost in the snow-capped mountains together with other companions. However, none of them ever returned from the expedition.Despite its lack of an elaborate plot, the movie Goblin's Crown is a faithful successor to the first season of Goblin Slayer. The writing is simple and straightforward, without any twists or turns to keep viewers engaged. However, the film's appeal lies primarily in its charismatic protagonist, who remains the fulcrum of the entire work. Goblin Slayer is a serious and dark character, but he occasionally shows an immature and naive side that can slightly undermine his grim charm. Fortunately, there are very few such instances in the movie.In this new adventure, we continue to see the change in the hero that we witnessed during the main series. This is most evident in the bond he has with his companions, whom he is now able to trust even more. He knows that he can rely on them even in the most difficult situations.However, the relationships between the various members of the group remain somewhat static, and there is no effective development. This could also be due to the lack of good characterization of the other supporting characters: once again, the Elf, the Dwarf, and the Lizard Man seem flat and one-dimensional, so much so that they feel like they play less incisive roles.The hero's lack of closeness to the other members of the party, except for the Priestess, could be interpreted as a narrative choice, given his unsociable nature. However, I would have preferred to see the three supporting characters better developed over the course of the movie, especially since it is now clear that they are no longer simply supporting roles, but integral parts of the story.As for the Priestess, there is very little to say about her development, as she has not changed much since the first season finale. However, the young cleric is now more confident and less afraid of facing hordes of goblins. She is able to be useful to her companions with her defensive and healing magic.As for the new character, the noble swordswoman in need of rescue, it is quite clear during the viewing that she is suffering from the loss of her companions and the torture she has endured. However, everything is handled in a hasty and superficial manner, so much so that I was unable to fully understand how the torture has specifically affected her. I would have preferred the story to offer a more detailed construction of the Noble Swordswoman, not just through a few sequences, so that we could better understand her feelings when she sees the goblins.Putting aside a somewhat unconvincing plot and poor character development, the real focus of Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown remains: the cruel sequences, such as torture and nudity, which allow us to understand the depths of depravity that goblins are capable of, and the violent scenes, which often lead to gore.The visual system is also well-made and contributes to the film's overall quality. While it does not reach the artistic heights of a typical feature film, being more similar to the series, the animation is painstaking and attentive to detail, even if some larger shots have noticeable imperfections. On the other hand, some sequences feature overly conspicuous and wooden CGI.The sword and magic clashes feature fluid animations that maintain the increasingly pressing rhythm of the action. Short sequence shots in some scenes make them even more adrenaline-pumping.The fights are also convincing due to their extreme violence, which is not gratuitous but well-suited to the type of production. The anime's plot is not well-developed, so it relies heavily on scenes of Goblin Slayer attacking all kinds of goblins with extreme malice, staining the snow with their blood.In conclusion:Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown has the same writing as the series, with no notable narrative twists to encourage viewers to continue watching. However, the film is supported by the characterization of the protagonist, who is still fascinating with his mysterious and aggressive demeanor, but is now more open to his companions. Unfortunately, some of these companions are underdeveloped, despite not being entirely secondary characters. The co-protagonist has remained unchanged since the season finale.The various plot problems are partly compensated by the technical aspects of the film, which, despite some stumbles and unpleasant CGI, feature painstaking design that allows viewers to appreciate the moments in which Goblin Slayer slices the small green creatures, because, after all, the only good goblin is a dead goblin.Personal rating: 6.3/10 an adventurer and has accepted the task of eliminating the goblins that infested a small village lost in the snow-capped mountains together with other companions.

Yes, it was a bit graphic, and for some, it may be tough to watch. However, it is still a good series.I always like how the series make goblins, typically a low-level grunt type creature that always had no respect into a series threat. That has always been a great appeal to me.Let's get down to the review. We are going to talk a bit about the story, animation, character development, and world-building.The Story:Typically I am not a fan of isolated stories from OVAs, much because I want a lot of story from a series. OVA's because of...time crunch seem to always rush things a bit. However, the story for this was pretty good for the most part. Instead of cramming an entire arc or season into an OVA, it focused on a single quest/mission. I felt that it was very proper to do it this way and still introduce some new elements into the main lore of the Goblin Slayer series, which is what they did here. It felt like old, and new elements collide that really pieced the main series and this story together. An example of this would be the lore behind the Gods.  Overall, I give the story an 8. The reason behind this is because I would have liked to see a bit more story involving the main and side characters as well as the plot involving the quest itself. I will not name spoilers.The Animation:The animation of the OVA was typical. It was not good or bad. There were, in my opinion, some good animation spots, such as the goblin fighting scenes toward the end of the OVA. But at least it was not crappy CGI, which is something you do see in some great anime fighting scenes or poorly drawn animation. I couldn't find any lousy animation scenes, so that was a plus. Overall, I give the animation a 6 because it was average, nothing like a crazy demon slayer animation sequence.Character Development:The 2 main characters and 3 supporting characters made a triumphant return. There was a bit of some character development behind Dwarf and Goblin Slayer, but other than that, the characters really didn't develop much in this OVA. The dwarf had a bit of lore added when he went into details regarding the Dwarf linage. I would have liked to see more development from the guest characters in the OVA, but to be honest, I did not like the fencer. Her group reminded me of the first 4 adventures in the series. There was not a lot of screen time with the guest characters, and to be honest, I couldn't care less for them. But I do have to give props to Goblin Slayer because he has grown as a character. He doesn't cease to amaze me in which he knows how to dispatch goblins. He is shown to evolve, not just in emotion but also in how he slays goblins and how his personality is slowly changing for the better. Overall I give the character development a 7 because the guest character could have had a better backstory and a pinch more development to flesh out the OVA.The World Building:This is where I am most impressed. Not only did the story touch on the lore with the gods, which I thought was great, but also the goblins themselves. The Goblin Slayer world is so well crafted and really gives attention to detail with the goblins. I definitely have more respect for the goblins and the society behind the goblins. Plus, having it take place in an entirely different environment was great. I loved the fact that the OVA took place on a snowy mount, much different than the forest and dungeons in the series. It really brought the world to a much grander scale. I am trying not to spoil much here, so bear with me on keeping some details from you. Overall I give world building a 9 because the world continues to grow in unexpected ways.So to recap:The Story - 8The Animation - 6Character Development - 7The World  Building - 9Overall Score - 8I hope you like this review. Please be assured this is my opinion, and I welcome any discussion to talk more about this anime.Thanks for reading and be on the lookout for my next one. time crunch seem to always rush things a bit.

Elf is girl is so cute.This was not what I expected considering the badassness of the first season. I must say although very good it was not quite what I wanted. Another 12 episodes with this first or at the end would have made for a much better take on it.The story itself is literally the first 25 minutes a recap of the first season. It is literally recapped in 25 minutes really well. The second half is the generic rich girl goes adventuring and acts like she knows it all...and messes up and needs to be rescued. It is the generic cinderella story. Although it is done really well but feels too rushed in its whole playthrough.The art itself is the same as before, perhaps a bit more polished I could say.The sound is great and does a great service to the show. SFX a bit more would have been great.Characters are more or less the same just a new person in need of help. They pretty remain exactly as they are throughout. Priestess girl does a great fear face still.I would say it is definitely a good watch. It is not as good as I expected in this format. A series would have been better. We even have new years ending which is just expected. Hopefully, a new season can revive this which has started to drown. and messes up and needs to be rescued. It is the generic cinderella story.

The same gang is together, trying to slay goblins. The story for this movie was was different then the rest of the episodes. They haven't gone to a gigantic castle to investigate together, but the fact that the first 25 minutes was basically a review of the series kinds sucked.Although I enjoyed this movie, I wish there was...more new content. Maybe a little more development in the realtionships than what was given.If you haven't watched the Goblin Slayer anime yet then this might be good for you. Explains the whole anime without showing what happened in every single episode. So if the movie is interesting to you, move onto the anime! more new content.

It would've been a great special episode in the anime but when compared to other anime franchises' movies like My Hero Academia, No Game No Life, and Fate, it falls flat. Doesn't mean you should skip it tho.The primary flaw with this movie is that it crams an entire Light Novel volume in the span of an hour, meaning the new character introduced in this movie...from the novels is just not gonna be memorable or as relatable since you literally only get to know them for about an hour. The adaptation of this character wasn't done as well as I'd hope it would. When comparing the Fencer with her LN counterpart, she just falls short. Kind of generic vengeful victim and all that. Reminds me of Last of Us 2's story lmao.Instead of doing a recap of Season 1 for the first 30 minutes of the movie, they could've used it to expand more on the Fencer's character or some other areas of the arc. I did enjoy the recap since it summed up Season 1 pretty well and since it allows us more insight into Priestess's thoughts and character, but I felt like it should've been omitted and reserved for Season 2. And at the very the least they could've cut it down to 15 minutes since they focused a lot on unnecessary scenes leading up to the current events in the movie, because they spent like 10 minutes on the episode where Goblin Slayer almost died.Minor flaw: the lighting was pretty bad for certain scenes. They were basically inside a dungeon cell and it was pretty dark to the point where it was hard to make out some of the characters.Other than that, the fight scenes are done pretty well, the sound design is good, and the character interactions are nice. You get to see how Goblin Slayer has grown as a character since we last saw him in Season 1, and how his party is growing alongside him. Their team mentality and teamwork is a lot more cohesive and in sync. Goblin Slayer actually shows a more human side now and is more empathetic to others, albeit in his own funny little ways. The music used is mostly the same from Season 1 but there's some new tracks thrown in as well. The old tracks were used well and the ending credits song by Mili is really nice (I hope it's reused in Season 2).I could say more about what I liked but overall, if you liked watching Goblin Slayer you'll like this movie. If you read the novels or mangas, you won't enjoy the adaptation of the Noble Fencer arc or character as much. Skip the first 25-30 minutes unless you wanna watch the recap. Again this is my opinion and thoughts and ultimately my critique and score for the movie. I give it a 7. It was a good watch but it wasn't outstanding enough to be rated an 8 or 9 for what is considered a movie. Don't skip it tho b/c it'll probably play into Season 2. from the novels is just not gonna be memorable or as relatable since you literally only get to know them for about an hour.

Are you kidding me? This is more like 25 mins of recapping first season, 25 mins of PTSD flashbacks, and 30 mins of a somewhat ""new"" development. You\'re better off labeling this as an OVA.Honestly it was not worth 1 hour and 20 mins of my life. You\'re better off doing something elseHow else am I suppose to write this longer since this movie provides nothing good to even talk about.

A new movie containing some new material of our lovely friend with an addiction for brutally causing a goblin genocide.In this movie it should be noted that the first 25 minutes are a complete recap of season 1. If you are new to the franchise then you will understand some of the backstory and characters. I would still strongly advise to watch the first season as you will learn a lot more about...the main cast and then just skip the first 25 minutes. In case you have watched the first season then it is up to you if you want a recap to remember what happened before this movie took place.So now to the actual movie. The brutality and gore are all the same and glorious. The attention to detail is not that great in general, but suits the chosen art style perfectly resulting in nice visuals. Nothing is to overwhelming. Paired with the sound effects it can send chills down your spine at the right scenes.The story is very lacking though. There is new content but it is a very mediocre one. Quite cliche one would say. There is no fancy things and just a new character that has a fair amount of development for the given time she had on screen as well as overall time in the movie. We learn a lot more about goblins though, the way they can adapt and evolve. How quickly they learn and how far from stupid they are. They are simple creatures, but they pick things up rapidly. This movie highlighted that fact in quite a gruesome manner.Timeline wise, this is straight after season 1. So if we get a season 2 we will know whether this is canon or not and whether the new character will serve a role in the future or not. Or if you have read the manga you might know whether it is canon or not. I haven't so I don't know it.Overall I did enjoy the movie. It was only a hour of new content and felt very short. I would have loved more content, but I am satisfied. It was good, not great, not bad.PS: If you are new to this, watch the first episode of season 1 to get a general idea about what kind of show you are about to delve into. It has a lot of gore and painful to watch moments. the main cast and then just skip the first 25 minutes.

Or if you have read the manga you might know whether it is canon or not. I haven't so I don't know it.Overall I did enjoy the movie. It was only a hour of new content and felt very short. I would have loved more content, but I am satisfied. It was good, not great, not bad.PS: If you are new to this, watch the first episode of season 1 to get a general idea about what kind of show you are about to delve into. It has a lot of gore and painful to watch moments."", 'So, I gave the movie a 7. Maybe you are wondering ""did this guy watch the same thing I did ?"" Yes I did; to be honest the pacing of the adaptation, the 25 minute recap, and most importantly the atrocious CGI at nearly every part single instance of character movement should have earned this movie closer to a 5. The reason I did not rate it that low is because, I read the light novel. It\'s been a year or so since I read volume 5, and its one of my favorite volumes. Seeing it get an adaptation is amazing, because...it serves as like a checkpoint showing the growth of the party since their first adventure. The group\'s teamwork has improved to the point that they make almost no mistakes. They know each other well enough to cover for each other\'s weaknesses subconsciously and trusting each other (dwarf shaman getting the extra weapons for gs, gs giving the way less experienced priestess the autonomy when to use her miracles). In the novel it is more explicit on the parallels between goblin slayer and noble fencer, showcasing his growth as a person, and the danger the world faces from a monster like a goblin paladin. So this movie would probably anger most light novel/manga fans. However, the art, when still, is very good (I swear they spent the whole budget on priestess). Most of all I wish they explained how lizard-man priest is much weaker due to the cold. Yeah I guess this is where the review ends, never wrote one before on MAL (wait maybe I have?). In other words movie was enjoyable despite all the flaws, pick up the LN if you were a fan of the anime series or movie, you won\'t regret it. it serves as like a checkpoint showing the growth of the party since their first adventure.

It began as a simple rescue mission with goblins involved and evolved as more information was collected.

A lot of this comes off like weird fanfiction. Everyone is loosely out of character, the fight scenes are not done nearly as well, the plans are even more halfassed than in the Water Town arc. Much of the movie is inconsistent in details such as where characters are standing in a scene, or what they're doing,...or how far they are apart. The fight scenes are rushed, the story is rushed. I wasn't a fan of the resolution either. Noble Fencer got to do nothing more or less.I had hoped this would be great, just as a continuation of the series. It's just bizarre really.

It does feel like they're padding it out for time, but it also feels like this movie on a whole wasn't meant to do anything but exist as a standalone.It features one of the shorter story arcs in the Goblin Slayer series, which takes place up in the snowy mountains. It's a very short story arc, so it would be difficult to pace within a season of the anime. I enjoyed it when I read the story in the light novel, but it is a very simple one-off story. Goblin Slayer goes forth, uses...his cunning, and saves the day in brutal fashion, surrounded by the mountains of butchered goblins and their victims.Entertaining, but not the same quality as the series. The animation is so-so and there's a ton of filler, but they do at least a good job of maintaining a good retelling of the story with its emotional moments kept intact.

So i went into this movie having really high expectations and came out sort of... disappointed. I love the show and franchise, but this movie is kind of bland. Its only about 50 minutes long after the 25-30 recap that really no one needed. It was super annoying just having to skip it and realizing that a third of the...movie was already over. Anyways into my thoughts!Story - 7 - The story was halfway decent. I liked the explanation of one of the gods and the green moon, which makes you even more curious about the red moon. I personally did not like the new character, the blonde. She was the perfect example of a royal who runs away and regrets it. You can see from a mile away that her whole group is going to get killed by goblins, which isnt a bad thing but i would have liked more time with them to make it hurt more. It was more like ""Oh they died... lol"" because we had just been introduced to them and knew nothing about them.Art - 9 - I probably would have given the art a ten if not for the few cgi scenes that were a little too obvious. There were parts that probably needed it, like the crowd of goblins, but there were a couple unneeded ones that just seemed lazy (ex. Goblin slayer turning around).Sound - 8 - I only gave this one an eight because i didnt listen to the whole song a the end. I also tend to skip through the long explanations and just catch the words.Character - 6 - This is only pertinent to the new character. I just dont like her, because she is one of those people who think they are better than they are and are just there to make trouble. Her whole shtick in being in the movie is to retrieve a sword that she lost when she got r*ped by goblins. She also killed an important goblin that got them easily found out. She barely has any character development and shes a very flat character, not even giving a reason for running away and becoming an adventurer. I cant stand flat characters only there for plot convenience.Enjoyment - 6 - Like  i said earlier if i find long scenes with no talking or too much i tend to skip through. it was pretty much like that most of the movie. I came into it ecstatic but lost all of it when we had that half hour unneeded recap.Overall - 7.5 - Overall its not terrible, but i definitely wouldn\'t recommend someone watching. its not needed and isnt important to the main story.

This film is an adaptation of volume 5 of the light novel, while the main series adapted volumes 1-2 and a short story from volume 4. The parts that were skipped aren’t much of an issue though, as Goblin Slayer for the most part isn’t really a series where much matters in the long term, at least not yet. This was true when the main series adapted the...first two volumes partly out of order without issue, and is similarly true in how the parts that were skipped don’t seem to have any negative impact on this film.The film begins with an episode length recap of the first season, though to be honest it really wasn’t necessary. The plot of the main series was incredibly simple and recapping didn’t feel like it brought up anything important that I didn’t already remember despite having watched the anime long ago. After that it pivots into the main story, which involves a group underestimating the goblins and Goblin Slayer and his party basically having to clean up the mess. The goblin group they’re fighting have a goblin paladin, which is basically just a bigger, smarter, stronger Goblin, not too different from a Goblin Lord. As such, this film is pretty much just straight up more Goblin Slayer. The party goes in and uses their various techniques and tricks in order to defeat the goblins. There’s a bit more with a goblin attack survivor, Noble Fencer, temporarily joining their party for the duration of this film and it focusing a decent amount on her trauma, which was still fresh, and her overcoming it, which is a bit different from past arcs.Still, it’s not substantially different, and thus the film just feels like another Goblin Slayer arc. Just as with previous arcs, the characters are likable enough and it’s satisfying seeing them just take down goblins in a brutal fashion. However, that’s it. There’s a bit of development in Noble Fencer but not really any for anyone else that feels like it went further than the main series. The art and animation is also incredibly similar to the main series, and it even still uses the not so great CG for goblins and Goblin Slayer himself. The soundtrack is also incredibly similar, and the credit roll uses a song that feels pretty similar to both the OP and ED of the main series. As such, it’s largely pretty average Goblin Slayer for better or worse. Not the best it’s been, but not the worse either, largely middling I’d say. For a film I suppose that’s somewhat disappointing as films usually try to do more and go beyond their TV counterparts in some fashion, but in and of itself it’s incredibly similar to and just as solid as the main series overall was. If you like the main series and go in with expectations of just getting more of it, you’ll probably enjoy this film. If you didn’t like the main series, this certainly won’t change your mind, and if you’re expecting something better than the main series, you’ll be disappointed. first two volumes partly out of order without issue, and is similarly true in how the parts that were skipped don’t seem to have any negative impact on this film.The film begins with an episode length recap of the first season, though to be honest it really wasn’t necessary.

This movie would be much better if they cut out the recap part and gave this time to the final expedition. Cuts in other places were okay. I'd give more time to Noble Fencer though, but only if the total run time was extended.BTW the girl they rescue is called Noble Fencer. I've just realized that I haven't heard it mentioned in the dub even once.6/10, will watch the prettier parts again."", ""I've always liked Goblin Slayer, a strong adventurer who commits himself to killing the weakest type of monster. The issue with this story is that he only kills goblins. Staying true to this, Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown is all about Goblin Slayer killing some goblins.The film starts with a 25-minute re-cap of the series, it's brief and doesn't show everything. Then we get onto the film, the film is about Goblin Slayer being requested to save a noble's daughter who has gone missing while hunting goblins. It's not a special story-line and offer very little new content, it feels like a repeat of season one.The...animation is mostly CGI so the lighting looks a bit weird and the overall animation looks stiff. Some scenes feel forced, a character crying or raging at the goblins, it doesn't really flow well with the rest of the story.I was hoping for something new and exciting, new goblin types, new villains, sadly however this was not the case. The films content is only an hour long so they can't fit much in but I was hoping for something to make the film stand out. The music is good for some scenes and mediocre for others.Overall I give the film a 6, if you like Goblin Slayer then it's worth a watch. animation is mostly CGI so the lighting looks a bit weird and the overall animation looks stiff.

The extra characters that you meet in this episode don't really have anything special going for them that will make you remember them and the big villain is not as impressive, intimidating or as dangerous as ones...we've already met and defeated in season 1.That said, it's still Goblin Slayer. If you like the show, like the characters already then this is worth a watch, but calling it a Goblin Slayer movie is setting people up to be disappointed.

The first 25 min was a full season 1 recap, which is very unnecessary; meaning the rest of the 1hr is for the actual movie and credits.The plot:A nobles daughter is MIA and the goblin slaying team finds her. She has PTSD, and overall I found the character to be unlikable for the majority of the time.Characters:As I said before the nobles daughter is generally annoying. She pretty much demanded to be put into a place where she wasnt mentally ready for. And that's pretty much it, no character development for anyone. I...did enjoy how the goblins evolved. They even had more lore this time which made scenes intense.Overall:This just could've been a 2 episode OVA and literally no one would care.

No such luck.The second season was really more of a spin-off featuring the main characters rather than a progression of the overall story or a continuation of the first season. The so-called movie was really more of a glorified OVA-child of the second season and brought no closure to Goblin Slayer\'s main story.I would not recommend watching this and/or the second season.

If it\'s not ringing any bells, that\'s alright since it\'s from the mid-90s.Needless to say, the consortium was not impressed. mature in any considerable manner, or receive any greater clarity as to who the goblin-like figure in his memories really is.

Hanamaru Youchien,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6574/Hanamaru_Youchien,"['Let me start off by saying this is a cute and innocent anime. Despite having a similar premise, this series is nothing like the Pedobear anime Kodomo Jikan. I don\'t generally do early season reviews, but since the only other review gave it a 1/10 I think a less bias grade is necessary.Plot: The story revolves around a male kindergarten teacher\'s first class ever. He is shocked to see the job is a little harder than he thought it would be... especially since one of the little girls wants to marry him. So far (as of episode 2) the episodes have centered around the...three main girls doing cute and stupid things. This is a pretty mellow comedy series. It reminded me alot of the Yotsubato Manga series (made by the same author as azumanga daioh!). It also reminded me of Aishiteruze Baby.  If you are wanting gut busting laughs or ecchi comedy this isn\'t the anime you\'re looking for.Art: Standard-Dont\' have much to say about it. Mostly pastel colors appropriate for a show about kindergartners. The character designs are cute.Sound: Standard (I really enjoyed the second ending theme though.)Characters: I was going to give the characters an 8/10 till I realized that the character combination of this series is essentially the same as the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. You have the ""brave leader"" protagonist who is troublesome for everyone, You have the super smart cool and collected girl, and you have the shy, clumsy, and easily upset girl. The teacher can be Kyon just for consistency\'s sake. They may not be too original, but they\'re balanced and serve the plot of the show well.Enjoyment: So far this is the show I\'ve enjoyed most this season.

That is the last thing you\'d expect to hear in a show about kindergarteners. But Hanamaru Kindergarten is full of comments and moments where you stop and think to yourself, ""What are the children of humanity learning these days...?"". At least, that\'s what I was thinking the entire time.Anyways, Hanamaru Kindergarten is a sickeningly sweet anime that I just happened to find on Crunchyroll one day, and decided to watch it, thinking that it was about time I stopped watching action related shows for a while. So I watched the first episode. In...the beginning, I was taken back by the cuteness of the show, which was at a very high level. So I continued on, got some good laughs, and ended up finishing the show a few weeks later in my spare time. My initial thoughts were that I had found a cute and slightly rom-com anime. I was correct of course, it was well worth my time I put into watching it.As for a story, Hanamaru Kindergarten is one of those shows without a main plot. If you think of Azumanga Daioh, Lucky Star and Acchi Kocchi, this show runs along the same lines. A kindergarten girl falls in love with her new teacher, you know, the usual. Oh, wait, never mind, that\'s unusual. Every episode is filled with random comedy, moments of pure denseness, and just plain old fun. They failed to end the series with a good finale, it seemed like a completely normal episode to me, but overall I enjoyed it.When I told you I was taken back by the cuteness, I really was. It\'s one of those animes where you AOL (Aww Out Loud, not that crappy internet service). The cuteness is bombarded with comments that may make you spit out your drink in either laughter or sheer disbelief, but either way, they managed to make you wish for a daughter or a son that looks as cute as kindergarteners appear to be in Hanamaru Kindergarten. Other then the characters, they made the actual Kindergarten look like a place that you would have been dying to attend back when you were 5 years old, it is truly a kid\'s paradise. Equipped with a slide going down from the second floor, an amazing playground, and classrooms with fun everywhere, I\'m kind of wishing that the school I attend now was like that. Fantastic way to make students jealous.There is no English Dub for this show, and frankly, I thank God for that. It\'s hard to imagine what all 40 of the 5 year olds in this show would sound like if they were dubbed over, and I really wish not to, as they are loud and have high pitched voices. But thankfully the Japanese Dub tones the realism down a little bit, making them all sound cute and unobnoxious most of the time. I liked most of the voice actors and actresses, they played their parts well, overall a good job.Watching this made me excited to have kids. I\'ll probably be regretting it when the time comes around in certain moments of my life, but the characters in the show are portrayed in such a way that you wish all kids were like this. Anzu, the energetic romantic in the group manages to bring most of the comedy into the show due to all the fantasizing she does about the day she marries her teacher, while at the same time comes up with problems in her head that have absolutely no need to worry about. Then there\'s Hiiragi, the genius in the group, and I mean genius. She\'s smarter then most seniors in high school, maybe even college. She\'s the reason I now know what a Lunula is. At the same time, she also has a cute side to her with all of her costumes, mostly Panda Cat. And the last one is the shy and insanely adorable Koume. That\'s pretty much it. She\'s the kid that every parent wishes to have. Then there\'s Tsuchida-sensei. Frankly I\'m wondering who goes to look at ""adult magazines"" and drinks until he passes out, yet is still able to become a Kindergarten Teacher. I like him, he\'s funny, but seriously.I think the part I most enjoyed about this show was the Panda Neko dance. I was laughing so hard, due to the sheer hilariousness of it, and the absolute adorableness of it. I still have it stuck in my head. Overall, insanely cute show, got a lot of good laughs in there.

The first is that of simple pleasure found in watching an anime that has well-structured episodes and that make good use of humor. This is the view I have adopted, as each sub-episode contained within an episode is well planned and carries subtle undertones of moral conventions contrasted with and against accepted social attitudes.The anime itself is a set of twelve episodes, each containing two sub-episodes, that are loosely tied together through a plot-line based on the unrequited feelings of romance a kinder garden student, Anzu, has towards...her teacher, Tsuchida ‘sensei’, and the subsequent events that occur in their lives when together and apart. Anzu’s friends include Koume, a shy and gentle character, and Hiiragi, a cos-playing child prodigy. Strangely, yet with good reasoning, no other characters raise an objection to this blase relationship between student and teacher, and there is even some degree of acceptance, understanding and even support, especially by those that would normally be apposed to this behavior, such as the child’s parents. However, everyone manages to best live their lives alongside an almost sadistically humorous love triangle between Anzu, Tsuchida and the beautiful Yamamoto sensei.The second response to this anime is that it is boring, having no sufficient development in the storyline and lacking in length. This response is largely due to the viewer’s lack of understanding; yes, the episodes are loosely strung together by a thin plot, but this is not the defining point of the anime, such as it is with those that follow the gradual changes in characters. Rather, the two sub-episodes cover a specific time frame during one of the main character’s lives that makes others and themselves change and grow, yet cuts out all the unnecessary in-between events, delivering only the relative material to the audience to best outline the idea or value that is to be portrayed to the audience in that sub-episode, hence the room for split stories in one twenty minute time block. Also, another point is that this type of anime utilizes a stasis plot, which is used correctly in this case to allow the episodes to branch off into smaller sub-plots yet still retain a link to the main story.The final response is rather negative; heavy criticisms that are based on art, storyline and the characters of Anzu and Tsuchida. My views on storyline have already been outlined, so I shall proceed directly to the critiques on art. Once again, these criticisms are caused by lack of understanding. True, the artistic style used to draw the children is over-exaggerated, and detail is lost in the drawings of the adult characters and scenery. However, this is done to really drive home the idea of the distance between children and adults in society, and to present to the audience the view of the world from a ‘young child’s’ perspective, having alliterations to a child’s drawing and it’s innocent representations of character, giving rise to an almost childish drawing style that takes into account these factors.Though it involves many adult characters, this story is ultimately based on the idea of children living in an adult world. This is why Anzu can show unseemly displays of romance towards an older character and not be ostracized by society, and also why she has a very mature personality for her age that is readily accepted by the other characters.Though viewers may disagree with the anime on moral grounds, this is still a personal bias that doesn’t affect the quality of the anime. If taken into account the understanding of symbolism and important conventions that are often overlooked or mistaken as incorrect development, then the anime would truly have no criticisms. Of course, the average viewer does not consider these things when watching an anime for enjoyment, however it is important to note that harsh criticisms should be made after careful analysis.Though not on this site, I have seen many blatant reviews that dismiss this anime for the reasons mentioned above. Because of that, this review may seem like an over-endorsement or over-hyped defense of the anime, however all I wish to do is present a more deeper view into the some of the aspects of the anime that have been criticized too unfairly in ways that would put off someone from what I believe to be a very good anime that I have been looking forward to every Monday for the past twelve weeks. I also look foreword to the making of a second season, and hope that it will be as deeply satisfying as the first. her teacher, Tsuchida ‘sensei’, and the subsequent events that occur in their lives when together and apart.

So many people have preached that it\'s all about being cute and fluffy. Loli not pedo, that kind of stuff, but is it really? The focus of the grand majority of the series is about Anzu in love with Tsuchida and Tsuchida in love with Yamamoto. While I reasoned Anzu\'s attraction to Tsuchida was nothing but an innocent crush, her tenacity and attitude as the series progressed genuinely began to frighten me to the point where brushing this off as an innocent childhood experience was no longer an option. Anzu really loves...Tsuchida... and to make that the focus of the series is just creepy.In many ways, I can easily see where Hanamaru could have succeeded with its characters alone. While Anzu, Hiiragi, and Koume are all the standard genki girl/smart girl/little wife archetypes, they are neither overpowering in their prescribed personalities nor are they entirely cliched. Their mannerism and attitudes still reflect a great deal of their childishness. This only disappears when they start talking about matters of love, which unfortunately is at the core of this series. While some innocent talk and ""kids say the darndest things"" conversation is to be expected, the series pushes it repeatedly until it eventually reaches the point that I question what their parents are exposing them to at such a young age, especially Anzu\'s mother who is so liberal when it comes to her daughter\'s crush I don\'t think she even realizes how her daughter is interpreting her messages.Because of this, the story comes across very similar to the heavily controversial Kodomo no Jikan. However, because the little girls resemble blobs more than they do humans (how do they support their body on those twiggy legs?!), no viewer can really take it as seriously as KnJ\'s portrayal of the topic. This doesn\'t change the fact that this is a show about a kindergartener in love with her teacher. The story could have gone in one of two directions; follow Anzu and her friends on misadventures, or focus on Tsuchida and Yamamoto\'s relationship with some gentle humor provided by their students on their relationship. This series decided to do both and connected them in the most unsettling of ways. It\'s sad when you think what this show could have been and what it turned into in the end.The art is bright, cheery, and adorable. I have no problem with Anzu and her class being moeblobs as it highlights a lot of their innocence and how much they have to grow both physically and mentally. I also love the design of the kindergarten itself. I think we all wish we had gone to a kindergarten is awesome-looking as this one was.The soundtrack, playing with a lot of xylophone and percussion was pretty cute, though I don\'t know how I felt about needing a new ED every week. They peaked rather early with the epic second ED and after that they ranged from okay to bad to just plain inappropriate for a series of this nature. Kei Shindou as Anzu was a welcome treat. So often she plays brats so to hear her as a happy genki girl was a treat. Of course, only Erino Hazuki could pull off Yamamoto\'s effervescent brand of happiness with a shred of possibility of it being believable. Anyone else would have made that role unbearable, so kudos to her for her handling of an incredibly difficult role to make acceptable to the audience.Despite all of Hanamaru\'s many bright points, there\'s too much weighing it down to give this anything higher than a 7. This is a cute and fluffy show, but it\'s a cute and fluffy show about a kindergartener in love with her teacher. The fact that they try to make it as cute and innocent as they can despite Anzu being very set in her ways makes it just that much more unsettling. Kodomo no Jikan worked because there were psychological issues at hand that played well into the unsettling aspect of it, but Hanamaru has nothing to defend why a 5-year-old wants so desperately to marry her teacher. I could have done with a show about a kindergarten teacher who falls for his colleague, and I would have adored a show about kindergarteners being kindergarteners like a moeblob version of Rugrats, but this form of execution is just wrong, wrong, wrong.Overall, I give Hanamaru Kindergarten a 7 out of 10. Tsuchida... and to make that the focus of the series is just creepy.In many ways, I can easily see where Hanamaru could have succeeded with its characters alone. While Anzu, Hiiragi, and Koume are all the standard genki girl/smart girl/little wife archetypes, they are neither overpowering in their prescribed personalities nor are they entirely cliched.

Plus, she's barely scared when Anzu climbs up a gigantic tree and falls off it. Tsuchida, the teacher, is pretty unlikeable, since my entire impression of the first episode is 'he wants to get in Yamamoto's pants'. The characters suck but the art is cute.

Although some issues of this show tread on some people's line of morality, it shows what a crush really is in its purest form in both of a child and an adult. Each side plot is filled with good jokes and a small moral lesson, while maintaining a light hearted feel in the show. Those who don't like too much happiness should stay clear of this show.Art:The animation for this show completely suits the light hearted feel this...show tries to convey. It brings out simplistic drawings, and making them very cute. One key thing they did in this show was to make the children look unlike a real child and more into a cute lump of moving flesh. This turned possible perversion, into a cute first crush.Sound:The vast amount of ending songs was almost the highlight of my week. I was so excited every episode to see a new ending song, each with a laugh of its own. The background music helped the very light hearted atmosphere within the show.Characters:For the adults, they pulled out stereotypes and made a new standard for them. All the characters were used to never get old. For the children, every one showed a pure heart, and really gave a feel of real children and their emotions. Although the lead female kinder gardener was slightly forward in terms of her wishful relationship, what could have been perverted, was made so it just seemed like a joke.Enjoyment:This was my feel good anime every week. I would laugh out loud, and re-watch every episode right after I finished it for the first time. If you are looking for a show to sit back and smile, then you should watch it immediately.Overall:All the strings came together into the ultimate perversion-free romance comedy (when i say romance I mean using dating jokes). At first you might be a little discouraged by the animation as it might seem childish, and a little to bright and happy, but once yo adjust, I assure you will enjoy this show. show tries to convey.

Some moments were heartwarming, others just didn't add anything to the story.Hanamaru Youchien shows us the everyday life of a couple of toddlers and their teachers, how they overcome hardships and how they share their fun moments. Love is also a very important theme in the series. At some points the characters really drag you into their lives making your heart pound faster whenever something important happens. On the other hand there are many episodes were this feelgood-feeling just isn't present, making them random and unnecessary.Story: 5Hanamaru Youchien doesn't have much of a story. It's...a slice of life anime which tells about the adventures of three toddlers with Anzu and Tsuchida as the main characters. There is a lack of realism  which disturbed me, like 5-year olds running through town on their own and crawling on to people's shoulders. The strange thing is that in the episodes were the story becomes a little more serious, the script-writers really succeed into creating an emotionally strong anime. I don't understand why they didn't take more advantage of this, because Hanamru could be such a tearjerker. And even if they went for a more lighthearted story, it still could have been a lot better than it is.Maybe the end was disappointing for some. It could have been an episode in the middle of the series too, but that didn't bother me too much.Art: 5Nothing special here. Shading was very poor, facial expressions were alright. Nothing unique about the camerawork either though everything is shot from close against the floor. Mainly because the toddlers were very very small compared to the adult characters. The kindergarten was cute and well thought of. All of the other surrounding shots weren't too impressive.The toddlers did have something cute about them and the colorpallet was enjoyable.Sound: 3The version I watched had very poor sound quality so I can't say I enjoyed the intro nor any of the ending songs. And even though every episode had its own ending theme there wasn't any I really liked. Aside from the ending songs the soundtrack fitted the anime, though overall I did find it a bit boring.As for the voices they were alright at the beginning but at the end I couldn't help but get a headache. This goes especially for the kids and their teacher Yamamoto, whom sounded more like squirrels then humans.Character: 5I liked the characters but sometimes they were really annoying.Anzu brings the energy into the anime. She's madly in love with her teacher Tsuchida and very determent to marry him in the future. Tsuchida is a young man who starts working at the kindergarten and falls in love with another teacher, Yamamoto. He tries to confess his love to her but fails time after time.Hiiragi is Anzu's friend and the series' own Einstein, and Koume is the shy one who cries over nothing.Enjoyment: 7Though Hanamaru Youchien has many flaws if was a lot of fun to watch. It had many fun moments, a few touching moments, romantic moments... and all of these pull you into the story. I enjoyed seeing the children into trouble as well as seeing how similarly the adults encounter trouble.This is the main reason why I decided to continue watching.Overall: 6After watching the first episode, which is one of the best, I expected a great anime, and it was fun but not realistic nor too touching, which is why it doesn't get better grades. It did leave me behind with a good feeling.

Right away a bridge is established between the two groups, with Anzu being a flirt and madly in love with Tsuchida. It is very cute and endearing to start off with, but quickly becomes old and boring. The show even goes so far as to lay out exactly what the love triangle and love arc of the show is at one point. The sound gets a worse score here than it probably should, mainly because all of the kids make a squeaking noise with...every step they take. The characters are well done for what it matters, but I personally find the story lacking and too cliche driven, even for a genre made from cliches. every step they take. The characters are well done for what it matters, but I personally find the story lacking and too cliche driven, even for a genre made from cliches.', ""I remember watching Hanamaru Kindergarten when it first came out, and while I liked it to an extent, I kind of forgot about it. I found it to be fun and cute, even if it never reached any highs for me. But I was bored one day and decided to rewatch it for the purposes of reviewing it, and...I'm honestly shocked at how much went over my head when I first watched this in high school. Yes, really. Anyway, the show is about a guy named Tsuchida who becomes a kindergarten teacher. On his way to his job, he comes across a little girl, Anzu,...waiting for her mother, but Anzu thinks he's hitting on her. This isn't the case, obviously, but Tsuchida later finds out Anzu is the daughter of a girl he went to school with years ago. Anzu takes the whole flirting thing way too seriously and decides to become Tsuchida's wife...and her mother is totally okay with it for some dumb reason. And thus, the anime focuses on Anzu's day to day adventures with her friends and teachers.Did you know that Gainax worked on this series? Yeah, I bet you never expected Gainax of all companies, directed by the guy who worked on Gundam 00 and Fullmetal Alchemist, to make a light-hearted slice-of-life comedy series about cute kindergarteners and their teachers having fun every day. I mean, I'm all for trying out new things, but this was unexpected, and in a good way. The animation itself is okay, and I like how every ending theme has different styles, genres, and soundtracks, with some bordering on parody. I do think the soundtrack can be way too saccharine and treacly at times.My opinions on the characters are kind of mixed. Other than one character, the adult characters are pretty well written and nicely fleshed out. Tsuchida is pretty much your typical male anime lead, but he actually has a personality beyond just being a befuddled loser, actually has things he's good at, and his dynamic with the other adults allows his character to evolve rather than keep him as a stereotype. The other adults are great as well, and the series shows us why they decided to become teachers, their backgrounds, and their motivations, and they don't feel shallow at all. In that aspect, they actually trump the kid characters in the series...because let's face it, the kids in this show don't act like children. They're moeblob stereotypes shunted into toddler bodies, and they don't act like how four-year-olds typically act. For one, they talk way older than they should, are constantly harping about forbidden love, seem to understand concepts that no four-year-old should really know about, and while the fun role-playing and adventures they get into are entertaining to watch, Anzu in particular can really grate on your nerves. Also, why do the girls look like they're wearing oversized diapers? The kids aren't the only stereotypes in this, as Yamamoto, the female love interest, is basically a walking cliche amped up to eleven. I mean, how has this girl not sprouted wings and flown into heaven yet? Her whole character is that she's angelically nice and is such a ditz that she absolutely cannot figure out that guys are asking her out no matter how blatant they are about it. That cliche is overdone, and Yamamoto is the one dark spot among the adult cast, even though she does have her moments to shine here and there.But those aren't the only issues Hanamaru Kindergarten has. For one, its attempts at drama come across as really shallow, mainly because they rely on stock cliches that have been done to death and it doesn't try anything new with them. Hanamaru also seems like it wants to have romance between two of the main characters, but puts this brick wall between them and doesn't even bother to do anything more with it, even at the end. However, my biggest issue with the anime is this: Much like CardCaptor Sakura, Hanamaru Kindergarten has a pretty accepting view of age-gap romances, almost to the point of idealizing and romanticizing them, much more so than the former does. Anzu's mother dropped out of high school to marry her art teacher, and is pretty okay with her 4-year-old daughter chasing after her teacher, even encouraging it, and the show doesn't make the case that she's just humoring Anzu either. But they really shouldn't be encouraging Anzu's behavior towards her teacher. I know age-gap romances are more accepted in Japan, but in America, if stuff like that happened, the guys involved would be arrested, and I have no idea why Hanamaru Kindergarten is trying to make age-gap romances seem like a good thing when they really aren't.Of course, the series does succeed in being sufficiently entertaining, what with the show going buck wild with the kids' imaginations and showing off their crazy ideas, oftentimes using them for homages and parodies of Gainax's previous works. Hanamaru Kindergarten doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, and that's okay with me. waiting for her mother, but Anzu thinks he's hitting on her.

The show centres around Tsuchida Sensei a newly employed teacher who falls in love with one of the other teachers consequently Anzu chan falls for him, the children\'s antics grow increasingly cute and more random, and as a viewer you can\'t help but feel attached to every single character (at least thats how I felt).I don\'t want to drag this review on but this show is definitely worth a watch, I feel sorry for every single person who writes it off as a kodomo no jikan clone and doesn\'t give it the time of day (JUST WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE AND YOU\'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN)!!!NOW GET WATCHING children in this anime are comical at the most, none of them are taken seriously, its just all in good humour, so all of you lolicons just stay away .. unless you\'re into kindergarten students, which I hope you aren\'t cuz that\'d be downright disturbing.Anzu chan Hiragi and Koume Along with the staff of the nursery are the main characters.

This is one of them. And despite the many ""how the fuck"", and ""wtf"" moment. It\'s quite intriguing and cute as well. And  probably the best thing about this anime would be the voice actress/actors acting for the kindergarten kid in the anime. It was on point lmao. Even so, the anime is a pretty passive one with no and slow character/story development throughout the anime. So if you\'re not a big fan of an anime that has a very slow...story progression and development but always teases you into thinking that it might happen. This may not be the anime for you. But i gotta say this too, the anime itself is kinda promoting or contains alot of this... forbidden love thing. If you dont like that then just dont watch it ;) story progression and development but always teases you into thinking that it might happen. This may not be the anime for you. But i gotta say this too, the anime itself is kinda promoting or contains alot of this... forbidden love thing. If you dont like that then just dont watch it ;)', 'Remember Kindergarten Cop? Well Kindergarten teacher part aside, this isn\'t really like that at all...Tsuchida is a typical bumbling guy, he\'s awkward but somehow has a real knack with kids. He decides to become a kindergarten teacher and meets the daughter of his high school friend. Funny thing is, little Anzu-Chan takes QUITE the liking to our main guy Tsuchida. Surprise surprise, she\'s also one of his kindergarten students!!This show is a strange mix of slice of life comedy, and in a REALLY weird way, a romance love triangle as well. Tsuchida falls head over heels with another teacher at the school, but little...Anzu-Chan doesn\'t like that scenario at all. The show is a mix of short 10-15 minute ""episodes"" within an actual episode of the show. While Anzu tries all she can do to win Tsuchi over (despite the glaring age gap), Tsuchi tries to keep from hurting her feelings all while trying to confess his love to Yamamoto. Hilarity ensues, and boy does it ever...Art is nice and I\'d like to point out something I felt was very responsible of the animators. My sister pointed out that the padded-out clothes for the girls was a way to ward off crazed lolicons, something I found to be an excellent choice. Now the grown ladies are most ASSUREDLY where the fan service comes in, there were plenty of bouncing chests (ample ones at that) to go around. I\'m glad there wasn\'t any focus on the little girls like that, but I do feel they tried to use a loophole. In several scenes Anzu will either imagine or talk about herself as an adult. We are now transported to scenes where she is a busty young woman and trying to win over Tsuchi who still looks the same. A little awkward since her voice really doesn\'t change and you get that sort of mental image like in Big with Tom Hanks, it\'s a child trapped in an adult\'s body. That part kind of irked me, but other than that everything was spot on. You have to check your ego at the door and admit that the kids are cute as hell in this show, they did a real good job making them lovable and adorable. You wanna just pick em up and give them a hug!!Watched the subbed version, which seemed good enough. Voice acting seemed fine and the music was pretty good as well. Not much to comment on, got a 9 since nothing musically REALLY stood out to me (it\'s not K-On!, ya know?).Character was a tough one to call...lot of them aren\'t very original characters, but you love them anyways. The kids (like Hiiragi) really saved the rating on this, because the adults tended to be what drug the show down. You liked the adults anyways, but the kiddos could honestly have run the show all by themselves. Comedic elements of blending the adults and kids was used well, it just got bland when it was the adults and nobody else. Archetypes are nothing foreign to SoL comedies, but a little deviation would have been nice. As I said, soooo glad the kids are as fun and animated as they are.This totally deserved the 10 on enjoyment, it\'s a romping good time and I can\'t overstate how heartwarming the show is. The Anzu obsession with Tsuchi borders on creepy sometimes, but her coming over to take care of him when he\'s sick and other episodes are really sweet, kinda wish that was the focus of it more than some of the creepy innuendos. It\'s a great show to just sit down and watch, I could see myself watching it over and over again much like Azumanga Daioh. Not the manliest show to admit liking, but come on, real men can enjoy a show full of cute kids and still feel like a man.A really cute show that\'s funny and easy to sit down and enjoy. If cutesy stuff isn\'t your thing, you probably want to skip this. Not a lot of super deep storylines or action sequences, it\'s meant to be enjoyed like an Atari game. You don\'t need to invest a lot of time to sit down and have fun with it, and you can pick it back up again at any time. I think they toed the line with some of the Anzu grown up scenes, but for the most part they seemed to do well ""protecting"" the kids in this, nothing really uncomfortable comes up. It\'s also refreshing to see a story like this, a guy who feels he\'s a loser but his kiddos think the world of him. If you\'re a person who has kids, nieces/nephews, or little sibs this will be a nice thing to watch.

But I felt the need to review this one.I have seen a gif from this Anime so many times online and had to search for it until I found it. I originally thought it was just going to be a basic cutesy slice of life and didn't expect to really get as interested in it as I did. I liked it for the cutesy way the artists drew the kids and how the characters all conveyed emotion. It felt like something natural instead of forced.There are so many...moments in the series where Tsucchi makes an embarrassment of himself or like with the children's' crushes, the things they say or the way they perceive things, they seem like natural everyday things. We're told a few different stories, but it's not so confusing that we don't understand what's going on and they all tie together. Throughout the series, you're waiting for the episode for the guy to get the girl as well as being taught that looks can be deceiving.My only complaint is it feels like I was left hanging at the end. An extra episode or two would have been nice. moments in the series where Tsucchi makes an embarrassment of himself or like with the children's' crushes, the things they say or the way they perceive things, they seem like natural everyday things.

Also, this review does contain spoilers, as I was unable to elaborate on it properly without including them. But, it is an anime about little kids, so there is not much story involved anyway.Obviously, everybody is going to mention Kodomo no Jikan because it is more popular, but I did not think this anime was creepy. If anything, the only creepy part about it was how much intelligence Anzu had for age. It was understandable for...the child prodigy, Hiiragi, but it made no sense for Anzu to understand most things adult.Oh, and maybe the fact that Anzu was the only one to share a passionate kiss with ""Tsuchi"" as he is called by both Anzu and Sakura, that brought back heavy memories of Kodomo no Jikan. That, and how similar he looks to Daisuke.Still, I just want to make things clear right now before you walk away from the anime and think it\'s about pedophilia. Yes, it is true that she is the only one to kiss him and yes, it was passionate. However, this was in a dream sequence where she was as old as he was. It did take place throughout the entire segment, though. It is also the only time that you see Hiiragi\'s eyes, too. So, take that in if you always wanted to know what they look like.One last thing I want to note about that segment is that I actually enjoyed that kiss, cause I honestly hate a romance anime that ends on a note where nothing happens whatsoever and, even if it was in an alternate realm, it was nice to see Anzu end up with Naozumi and for any romance to have any sort of ending.I hate watching an anime that is quite obviously a ""romance,"" but ends on a very bland note where they are ""better friends"" or ""something will happen eventually."" They are just tedious at most and I have seen it too much to enjoy it anymore. At least, the ending part. Most of the buildups in them, alongside the comedy and drama that unfolds between them, is still enjoyable to me.Anyway, back to the anime. I thought it was ADORABLE. I do not care that Anzu was so mature for her age that her love for Naozumi could pass off as gerontophilic, those children were way too adorable and it was so nice to see an anime that is about those little characters. They are not even chibi, but actual children and they are just so adorable. I will be honest and admit that this bias aided its review score, but I do like it for more reasons.The romances, adult ones, were handled with care and very well written. I also enjoyed the very small teen romance between Hanamaru (funny how he is not a main character, despite his name being in the title of the anime) and Mayumi, despite how short it was. It still had a segment dedicated to it, which was nice.Oh, and I can not stress enough how sad it is at how little screen time Koume got. She is, by far, my favorite character in the entire anime. With very realistic mannerisms akin to a real child, innocence and a performance by Mako that is the most convincing Japanese child I have ever heard in an anime, up to the point where I almost believed a real Japanese child voiced her, she is for sure the most realistic child in the anime. And yet, she had so little screen time, but still had a few segments dedicated to her, which was very nice. Her brother was also a great character due to the unusual twist of him actually being very fond of his little sister, as opposed to having a disliking towards her like most anime brothers have with their sisters. Especially the race episode, which was indeed a big highlight.But, at the end of the day, the vast majority of the anime is pretty calm and there is not much else to talk about after I bring up the characters. There is no concrete plot and it simple follows the everyday life of kindergarten teachers. What more can I really say? It was still very enjoyable.Still, as you may have noticed when reading other reviews, the anime certainly hides a very peculiar plotline underneath all its innocence. As I first brought up, Anzu is quite obviously gerontophilic and I was meaning to save her as the last character I talk about because of the fact that she may be deserving of more time than the others. It is quite strange that, for an anime about kindergarten students, that one of them has a real obsession with their teacher. It honestly came out of the blue, too.I thought she was just a bystander that Naozumi greeted and would only see once, until I completely remembered that when I first saw a brief part of the opening (courtesy of a funny collab of the opening with a random rap song), she was in there. Though admittedly, I remembered this after she was clearly acknowledged to be the main character, so I am no grade A Sherlock here.It was also strange how her mom, Sakura, was encouraging her to go to him a lot (wondering if she meant it jokingly or for real, given her situation), even letting her walk a VERY long way to his apartment in one of the episodes (and yes, Naozumi himself confirmed that Sakura\'s own apartment was very far away from his) multiple times. And I am aware that Anzu walked, given Sakura was too busy with her work to do anything, let alone give her a ride. Then again, with Anzu having the intelligence that she has, it wouldn\'t surprise me that she could walk there by herself.Speaking of Sakura, yes I know I am bringing up another character after I said Anzu was the last, but I would like to elaborate on what I said in the parenthesis about her ""situation."" You see, Sakura married her teacher in high school, whom was noticeably older than her. And this leaves me to wonder if she wanted to test Anzu and see if she would love Naozumi until the day where she approached the legal age of consent (which, in Japan, is not very far away after all) to give herself to him for real. It would be sweet, but then it would just be a rehash of Sakura\'s own love story.So, overall, that is about all that I have to say about the anime. Very simple plot, VERY cute characters (honestly, I do not think any other anime will beat them in cuteness for a while) and I would definitely watch it again at some point. Only giving it a lower rating because it has so little episodes. I demand more episodes of this adorableness, or at least a few OVA specials. Can not recommend this one enough if you are a fan of cute characters.Oh, and yeah, the story is fine, too. A tad bit on the weird side, but nothing as controversial as Kodomo no Jikan was. Which, speaking of, still did very well. That anime was very good, too. I was expecting it to be worse.But, anyway, give it a go when you have the time. the child prodigy, Hiiragi, but it made no sense for Anzu to understand most things adult.Oh, and maybe the fact that Anzu was the only one to share a passionate kiss with ""Tsuchi"" as he is called by both Anzu and Sakura, that brought back heavy memories of Kodomo no Jikan.

For the most part, this anime delivers.Overall, this anime is very light and will leave you with the warm fuzzy feelings of watching cute kids dealing with everyday life, EXCEPT:The borderline creepy-as-hell relationship that develops between a kindergartner and an adult.  Since I do my best to be spoiler-free, I try not to add names, but the characters involved are made clear within the first...minute of the first episode.Everything starts off innocent enough with a bunch of funny misunderstandings, but as the anime progresses, the situations get stranger and makes you go ""WTF"".  Sure, you could pass it off as an innocent love from a 5-6 year old to an adult, but the scenarios the characters get into are just morally ambiguous.  Examples:  A parent allowing their child to roam the streets unsupervised to go to an adult\'s home and spend the night; kindergartners lopoking at ""porn"" and being fine with it; and an adult encouraging his pre-tween to start the process of getting engaged to an adult.I\'m pretty open-minded with anime situations and if this were done a different way, it probably wouldn\'t bother me.  For some reason though, for me, the way the anime plays itself out just seems to have some undertone of sketchiness.Everything else about the anime is done well, from the artwork to the character development.

There while teaching the kids and growing himself, Tsuchida or Tsucchi will try to court or attract the attention of Yamamoto sensei who's really clueless about hints while being all the while chased by Anzu(blonde and brunette haired little kid) whose being helped by Hiiragi (blue haired girl called Hii by others) and Koume (Brunette and shy girl) as well as her mother Sakura, who turned out to be a senpai of said Tsucchi.My thoughts on this one:A...cute anime which can bring a smile to almost anyone(almost because it might not appeal to some) and really wholesome. No dramas or the sorts, just a really slow but good slice of life. You might be disappointed by the ending but it leaves you wanting for more which is what the animators might have wanted in order to make you go look for the original material. This anime is more for relaxing purposes for adults as well as children. Basically if you're looking for an anime which you can watch with your family, Hanamaru Youchien is a good choice though I'm sure it won't be the first one to pop up in your mind since it isnt as much popular as in the ranks of Naruto or Bleach or One piece but if you're looking for something when you've already watched other animes, then I would recommend this one\ufeff cute anime which can bring a smile to almost anyone(almost because it might not appeal to some) and really wholesome.

And that's the reason I love watching it so much. It's also quite funny too.Story: 6/10There is no overall plot in Hanamaru Kindergarten, but the little individual stories are quite good. There is no particuarly clever storytelling, but it's not bad.Art: 8/10The artwork is bright and childish to suit the setting, and the children in the kindergarten look adorable. Not amazing, but still very nice.Sound: 7/10The music is fairly good, and suits the playful mood, though I didn't find any of it particuarly great. The voice acting is good- the children sound...really cute, especially Anzu.Character: 7/10I didn't really find any of the personalities very convincing; some of the kindergartners seemed to have unrealistic personalities (eg: the child genius, Hiigari, seemed a bit too clever). But to be honest, I am a bity fussy when it comes to characters. Design-wise, the characters look cute.Enjoyment: 8/10There are some funny moments throughout the anime, and the cute kids give it a happy, playful vibe. Though I didn't really enjoy the side-plot of the unrequited love between two of the kindergarten staff, as it seemed rather predictable.Overall: 8/10An entertaining anime that is sure to make you smile. But if you're not a fan of the cute and cuddly, it's best to give it a miss. really cute, especially Anzu.Character: 7/10I didn't really find any of the personalities very convincing; some of the kindergartners seemed to have unrealistic personalities (eg: the child genius, Hiigari, seemed a bit too clever).

It's not really something I would really recommend, but if you've already started, might as well finish it.Art style is okay, I don't know how I feel about it, though. I might rewatch it to check them.Characters are pretty cliche for anime, albiet being set in a kindergarten.I personally really like this. I'm a sucker for anime with no complicated story with plot twists. This is just what it is, a kindergarten comedy. "", ""When you were a child your perspective of the world and the things in it were very limited, as was your understanding of complex concepts like the feelings and thoughts of those around you.Hanamaru Youchien takes this idea of the mind of a child and builds on it through the story of a guy that just started his kindergarten teaching career with his old high school crush's daughter in his class, that begins to develop a crush on him. Getting jealous when she discovers his crush on another teacher.It's a fairly innocent idea, as a lot of children develop crushes on their teachers.This idea is...dramatized and exaggerated from the child's perspective to make the show more amusing.There isn't much of a story outside of the character's histories and the many attempts the child makes to convince her teacher that they are getting married, while he tries to confess his feelings to his overly dense coworker.Sound is fine but characters voices and the music in some scenes gets annoying after a while. I did like that they went the extra mile with the EDs and had some variety throughout.The characters are all pretty plain and one dimensional. It's a super idealized take on people but I wasn't expecting complex motives and character arcs from an anime about a 5 year old and her kindergarten teacher.It's a pretty fun show if you want to just sit back and watch something for a while, there are some touching moments too but those are few and far between. dramatized and exaggerated from the child's perspective to make the show more amusing.There isn't much of a story outside of the character's histories and the many attempts the child makes to convince her teacher that they are getting married, while he tries to confess his feelings to his overly dense coworker.Sound is fine but characters voices and the music in some scenes gets annoying after a while.

Considering how this is also episodic, you could have said it missed the chance but really, it was fine as it is. Another thing to point out is how the events here aren\'t just...forgotten as it moves on to the next short in play, everything seems to have some resonance somewhere down the line, which is nice to see as it makes for some nice little progressions for now and then to look back on. As for characters, they are one-dimensional, yes, but by no means bad, if anything, look at it as a way of praise, they aren\'t overly deep or complex for the sake of it, it\'s a simple story after all. They are a bit quirky but aren\'t anything different from regular tropes. I think the only thing I can say that is good about them is that they have some background that doesn\'t seem half-assed. Not exactly amazing, but enough to satisfy, hell, I still remember a few to this day.As for audiovisuals, the designs are pretty damn crazy for an anime like this. Those body proportions are something else and might have some getting used to. Other than that, fluid animation, sometimes wacky, and backgrounds are fine, for its time it is pretty good. Audio is fine as well, I don\'t think there was anything of groundbreaking quality. It had a wider variety of endings, something that I think does well depending on who you are, I came out remembering none but that is just me. On that note, OP is pretty good.Even when I randomly left this on hold for the longest minute for no real reason, I enjoyed this. I would say that this is for everyone looking for a somewhat cute and funny series that isn\'t too much to get from. I must also say that if you find the relationship presentations weird, you should stay away, you know who you are. Other than that, I don\'t really know any way someone could hate this, it is pretty inoffensive honestly. I would recommend this for sure, it is not really a hidden gem, but it is one of those titles that you don\'t hear every so often that seems to do as good of a job at giving what other similar anime do. So I would take this to pass the time with, only, you are enjoying what is on the screen, rather than just letting time pass like that.Overall - 6.2 (6)(Click ""Overall Rating"" for score breakdown)Imagine being 3 months late for a review.

Hatsukoi Limited.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5150/Hatsukoi_Limited,"['*One step at a time, slowly they find themselves falling in love.*“Geez, women are so hard to understand” – Etsu KusudaMost, if not all male viewers tend to agree with that statement. The various male characters in Hatsukoi Limited (literally means first love limited) all experienced the same problem. But before you get the wrong idea, it should mentioned that this anime is directed from the female perspective most of the time. Hatsukoi Limited explores the early love life of a group of teenage girls and how they cope with boys that they like (or don’t like). While 12 episodes are hardly enough to cover...any in depth relationship for over half a dozen girls, the story remains a highly enjoyable one. Simply put, Hatsukoi Limited is as close to an idealized slice of life / romance comedy one could find in the market now a day.Complex love web is one of the main elements in the story. However, viewers will have no trouble adapting to the environment as everything build on one another slowly one step at a time. In fact, the overall plot to the story tags along quite well with each major character’s development. One could even say the characters are a natural complement to the story or vice versa (this may be a natural thing to say, but in reality not a lot of shows can even do this properly).A well structured story must also have a logical order for presenting its characters and Hatsukoi Limited excel in this department as well, as previously mentioned. What most people worry about is the sudden rush of information in the early episodes (like just dumping all you need to know about all the characters in episode 1), but thankfully that is not the case for Hatsukoi Limited. In hindsight, starting the story with Ayumi was an obvious choice for the author although her character as a whole may not have been the easiest to accept by most audiences.Viewers will enjoy watching most of the characters grow and develop themselves along the way. Most have gotten more mature and act more reasonably, but there are some exceptions. Whether the lack of character development for these characters are attributed to the length of the series or the story was meant to be that way, is up to viewers to decide. However, it should be pointed out that all the characters have a sense of realism in them, nothing from their characteristics seem fictitious or too fantasy-like. Through the eyes of these 14 to 16 years old, one might even see a resemblance of your own younger self.Perhaps the most painful part of Hatsukoi Limited with regards to its characters is that, like most shounen shows out there, it has really wimpy, stupid, and annoying guys (to make matter worse, most of them look quite ugly too). On the other hand, the females characters are often really smart, kawaii, and gorgeous looking babes (yes Misaki, that means you)!Quite frankly, it was the character animation that first caught my attention to this wonderful romance comedy as the storyline sounded rather generic to me at first. As to be expect from J.C. Staff, they always deliver high quality animation (and consistent too). The backgrounds are often lacking in detail, but that help put the characters in focus and viewers will spend 90% of the time looking at the characters anyway, thus there isn’t much to complain about. It was also interesting to see that the characters in the anime seem to be an exact carbon copy of their original manga self. Believe it or not, it is not easy to find an anime adaptation that follows the manga as closely as Hatsukoi Limited, both in the looks of the characters and the story itself.Finally, music is THE area that surpirsed me the most throughout the show. First off, both OP and ED are just splendid. The additional BGM and soundtracks in between just amplifies whatever tiny emotion I had in my mind, making this series a bit more successful than it should have been in my eyes.

It covers the early part of their love lives and deals solely with the issue of love. So for those who enjoy school romance you will probably enjoy this series.The story i gave a 10 because it was clique but at the same time original at some points. While it\'s about a typical school romance it involves many characters that shape the story differently from a usual school romance. We get to see all sorts of love which is why i really enjoyed...the series. From unrequitted to mutual to family. All are touched upon. The story can be said to be quite light hearted as it involves a lot of humour, but it is not too slapstick and it does have its serious moments which make the story entetaining. I think what i enjoyed most was the realism in the story in that it\'s not always a happy ending but it still gives us the feeling that it is in its own way because of the way the characters feel or get out of the experiences. I also found it interesting how the story intertwines the characters such that there is always some relation to another character and we go like ""what a development! so complex!"".The art was appropriate for the series. The characters were drawn out vividly and colourful which suits the light heartednes of the story. The humour came out quite nicely as well as it\'s not like those blank face drawings you get in the more humourous animes and the scenery is done up quite nicely as well so 9 for art.The sound i gave an 8 because in relation to other animes i have seen it cannot match up to the wide selection that they give. But nonetheless, there were several endings used in different episodes that helped to bring out the mood at the end of the episode. Personally i felt the ending song was a more appropriate for this anime than the starting. So all in all an 8, because i think that it has potential for more.The characters were fantastic. I would give this anime a high9 which rounds off to 10. Considering the length of the anime, i think that the characters were given decent coverage and there is depth to most of the main characters. the only one who has little depth would be enomoto\'s sister whose love life was not covered. The story is really character-driven in that we get to see the story from many different angles depending on whose love life it is focussed on in each episode. Of course the main characters is still Ayumi but we get to see different points of view on love based on the different characters. This is what makes the story so colourful. Which is why i have to give both story and characters 10 as they go hand in hand. The characters have very real and different personalities which are explored in this story and help to make it intersting. I\'d say that almost all the characters are main characters because they get an equal coverage and hence it adds to the realism as it\'s not some anime where the main character always wins in the end.Overall, i think the anime was great in balancing the comedy and romance in the story. It can be said to be somewhat of a romantic comedy though there is no one focus. The episode length was actually quite adequate for this anime because of its ending which i will not spoil. For an anime of 12 episode, i must commend it for being one of the best i have seen in terms of character development and plot development.

Not with each other, or at least for now. It\'s all straight male-female puppy love first romance kitch. If you think you\'ve seen it before, you probably have.There is no twist, tho. There is no parallel universe. There are no giant robots. There are no dueling academies, aliens, spaceships, demons, futanari, or miko. There are also no harems, thankfully. What there is, is unrequited love, awkward moments, and lots of cameltoe, boob shots, and other ecchi scenarios with characters who...look like adult women, but, um, aren\'t.It\'s all pretty bland with the familiar situations of unrequited love, lost love, nerdy boys, shy girls with big tits, brother-sister incest, that kind of stuff. The animation is top notch. The characters and backgrounds are beautiful, especially during the Christmas episode.But there are only a limited amount of times you can see a little girl drop kicking a big guy and laughing or two teenagers blushing about what to do next (put it in).And that probably got out of your system a decade ago, or more than a decade for me.The girls aren\'t very personable, either. They\'re flat characters with little distinguishing factors, save for the ecchi conventions: shy girl with big tits (Meguru), brother complex girl (Koyoi), aloof ravenhair (Yamamoto), ditz (Arihara) etc. Each has their own ""unique"" design, but that just amounts to hair color and breast size, not personality.Strangely, the more engaging side arc was a love between Enomoto (a self-absorbed girl) who fell in love with a boy she called ""kappa (imp) face."" It actually felt genuine for a while, but then it was nothing more than a teenage romance, and immature at best. Two people see in each other more than what\'s on the surface. We all do that, but so what?This is what happens when slice of life goes bad. The ecchi angle doesn\'t carry the series. There aren\'t any good story arcs.It\'s just a slice of someone\'s mediocre life.We\'ve all been there, but most of us have forgotten it, because it wasn\'t that memorable. look like adult women, but, um, aren\'t.It\'s all pretty bland with the familiar situations of unrequited love, lost love, nerdy boys, shy girls with big tits, brother-sister incest, that kind of stuff.

A hidden gem amongst all of the shows in its genre. This is one of those shows that I feel doesn\'t get as much recognition as it deserves.Hatsukoi Limited, as you may be able to guess from its name, is a story about love. It\'s not just about love though, it\'s about many qualms an adolescent will face as they climb up the ladder to adulthood, their first love being one of the steps on the ladder. For many, we look to our first love fondly--those sweet elementary and junior high days spent with who we thought was ""the one"", and for...others, we look at our first loves and remember the pain of rejection and heartbreak. Hatsukoi Limited capitalizes on each of these joys and flaws. A story about how ten teenager\'s lives change as love meddles in their affairs for the very first time. A story about their hearts as they undulate like the tides; a timeless story about maturity and growth.There are many types of love in this world: filial, platonic, unconditional, and romantic (which splits into mutual and unrequited). Hatsukoi Limited touches on all these types of love. No words can truly do the complex feelings portrayed in this anime justice; the flood of raw emotions that is unleashed simply cannot be adequately expressed. The cast is so diverse, so dynamically human that it is hard not to like. The message the show gives its viewers ring with a sharp, down to earth tone that is hopeful yet poignant. The cast of this series is one of the most believable set of characters I\'ve ever seen. A beautifully told simple love story, combined with realistic characters makes for the perfect love story. Where some may argue the ending didn\'t do a show of this caliber justice, I applaud the producers and writers for such an ending, for I feel the exact opposite.Hatsukoi Limited is a show that will make you laugh, cry, and reflect on your past and current loves through the struggles that these characters face. I can\'t think of many romance shows that do this.If that doesn\'t warrant you to watch this show, I don\'t know what will. others, we look at our first loves and remember the pain of rejection and heartbreak. Hatsukoi Limited capitalizes on each of these joys and flaws. A story about how ten teenager\'s lives change as love meddles in their affairs for the very first time. A story about their hearts as they undulate like the tides; a timeless story about maturity and growth.There are many types of love in this world: filial, platonic, unconditional, and romantic (which splits into mutual and unrequited). Hatsukoi Limited touches on all these types of love. No words can truly do the complex feelings portrayed in this anime justice; the flood of raw emotions that is unleashed simply cannot be adequately expressed. The cast is so diverse, so dynamically human that it is hard not to like. The message the show gives its viewers ring with a sharp, down to earth tone that is hopeful yet poignant.

It’s about love affairs that can be ended to love struck.~Story~ [8]The stories between each of the characters are a bit specific, somewhat predictable and have the same issue. The issues bring a funny and interesting twist. We can call it a “love triangle or a misunderstanding love”.It's about middle-schoolers and high schoolers searching for their ideal prince and princess to be able to form their first love, and thinking optimistically to live a happy ever after but in the end they fall into some kind of other twist. Attitudes, appearances,...and traits are the basis on picking their ideal one’s that make a well-formed twist for them to encounter. But the question is, does the searching and making love improves on each episode, well there’s a little improvement on fulfilling it and if there’s a little improvement maybe we will come up on thinking that there will be minor details about it, and the answer of it “yes there is”, and on the other hand there’s always been a shock when cupid caught their hearts that became somewhat predictable and it’s always been alike on every character.Overall it has a little improvement but many twist to make fun around them, but though the story is not finished and already on the halfway probably on its following episodes it will get serious.~Art & Animation~ [7]The art is… well a bit ok for me, for the main characters to have a face that resembles a moon head figure. The art on the background is a bit faint and the characters are somewhat faded.  The animation is a bit daring for an ecchi; panties, boobs and naughty scenes are shown.~Sound~ [6.8]The OP and ED theme songs are a bit catchy and the voices of each character are an okay for me, nothing unusual to be thrilled on.~Characters~ [8]A group of middle-schoolers and some high schoolers that has distinct standard on picking their ideal partner. All of the characters have different characteristics and different affairs to encounter. Well this is not a shock that this idea will come up to the story, but come on can be this story be too simple, maybe not, but they come up on improvising character traits, attitudes and daring poses that will help to hold up viewers on watching, for me it rather looks like a little fun to watch yet it’s kind of a bit boring and for the whole thing this is all thanks for relying on naughty and romance display.~Enjoyment~  [7]Enjoyed some funny and daring scenes on watching, but it does not always gives such fun, and also by the help of the twist the story looks like a bit interesting so continuing it will not much harm yet it stills on the halfway of all its episodes, therefore, hopefully there will be more exciting scene to watch on its following episodes.~Overall~ {8 + 7 + 6.8 + 8 + 7 = 36.8 / 5} [7.36 or 7.4]A kind of unusual love affair between characters, it is somewhat unique because of the unusual attitudes of characters, it’s naughty and comedy scenes somewhat helps just to be on but thinking about it, it’s not attractive enough. Maybe the great factor here is the twist behind it. Well, it’s better to give it a try if you have much spare time to give on such anime.Maybe experiencing somnambulism will made it a lot more fun. @-@It might be updated when the series ends… and traits are the basis on picking their ideal one’s that make a well-formed twist for them to encounter.

The story follows a group of girls all ranging from different ages who fall in and out of love while also discovering what it actually means to love. It\'s not cheesy and the stories are realistic and often funny, and most of the jokes are very well placed.Art:The art works in favor for this anime because it\'s detailed in the character expressions and has this type of fluid...motions that really help the story progress. The facial expressions shown propell the story forwards and show that sometimes diaolouge (internal or not) isn\'t really needed.Sound:The opening was a little too cheesy for me, but the ending fit just fine. The music throughout the series was unnoticable (and I only say that because I don\'t remember it) except for one moment where all dialouge is cast out and is replaced by a song a few minutes before the show ends.Character:All of the characters are really fun and loveable. At first they seem to be pretty cookie cutter characters, and a few times they even mention thier ""complexes"" for thier preferance of boy or girl. Because of it\'s light-heartedness the characters range from being meek, to overly loud, to keeping everything hidden or over the top in some of their actions (but the series pulls it off very well). However, some characters featured in the intro or outro are hardly developed, the viewer sees them one time, they state what they do and they occasionally speak to the other characters but there is no real development. I just found it strange that they were added to the intro/outro in slightly memorable parts when they had little to deal with the actual show.Enjoyment:10/10. I couldn\'t wait to see the next episode, and sometimes I stayed up really late just to see as much as I could.Overall:It\'s a short series that ends on just the right note. It doesn\'t make the audience want MORE because everything concluded very well (it wasn\'t a fluffy ending, everyone had thier different realistic endings which was super refreshing). If it was any longer then I\'m not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much, but it\'s a great series to watch if you\'re in the mood for something not so much meaningful as it is entertaining in how relationships develop. motions that really help the story progress.

And frankly I have to agree with most that was said, a lot of these parings were bad or ridiculous, even when going in with the low expectations. And I\'ll start by explaining all the love parings this show has. Though I might end up spoiling who gets together I won\'t actually spoil too much of the show so you can enjoy it yourselves if you want to. Overall I find this show bad but there were some parts to it that made...it worth watching. So this should actuality be a 4.6 show for me.Ayumi/Zatsu/Misao (the two boys are brothers)Aihara, I don\'t have much to say about this girl just that she spent an awfully long time to think of a reply to a confession. Besides her actually calling Misao a monster she\'s alright, don\'t hate her don\'t like her.Zatsu, I would not be surprised at all if the writer just created him so they have another guy, but wait, what can I do to make the girl like him??  I know a scene with princess carrying and just gives him a dream of helping people and that\'s practically his whole character. He is awfully bland. Only other thing I need to mention is that he is part of a conflict because he likes another girl called MisakiMisao is just simply a terrifying appearance with the purest heart that\'s why I like him but dude you need to stop acting like a stalker and following her even though you were worried about her, but at least his heart was in a good place unlike some other character.Ennomoto (Girl) and Kusadai (Guy)At first she was okay and I actually liked her..... before she started liking the guy and turned out to be a tsundere. Now that itself isn\'t bad but now imagine one of the worst tsundere ever possible that\'s her. it is full on annoying how she keeps going about looks and full on disses on the guy she likes even. It took the guy to be so annoyed with it all for her actually confess. I argue that most of the fights were her fault and I don\'t think she would have given chocolates to him at all if he didn\'t say to her ""I wouldn\'t mind getting some chocolate from anyone"". Even when receiving the Christmas gloves instead of saying thanks she goes "" it looks good on me doesn\'t it""The guy on the other hand I really loved his joke about the movie with animals but all that went out the bag once he diberately put a girl to sleep using bad puns so that he could advise his friend to ""abandon logic"" like just no, There are several scenes where his pervert tendencies just goes overboard  but I\'m just gonna stop it there. He full on is just creepy for those who hate Mineta (MHA) I argue that he\'s just as bad if not worst. But I guess the writers realised this mistake and went oh no we need to give him a good quality, Thanks to that he went from absolute trash to can be decent person at times and I\'m so happy they reduced his level of creepiness and after he became much more bearable,  I could even like him maybe if he was like that at the very start. Now I don\'t really care how perveted he is but there is a line, a clear one that shouldn\'t be crossed. it\'s the Mineta line and if your character is as bad as him you are doing something very wrong.The relationship itself is actually one that has quite a lot of time dedicated to it so try to give it a chance for your own sake. As much as I didn\'t like the characters I could still enjoy their story even though there were bad and good bits to it. One scene I did like were when they were wearing each others presents in class.Watase and Takeiits a pretty plain and simple story, one people consider to be the weaker of the show unfortunately. I can see why people didn\'t like it so much but I found it durable enough like the part where she becomes a manager. Why I don\'t enjoy it much is that the comedy wasn\'t used much but hey if you want big boobs it\'s here. As boring as the story might be I like it better then others just because the pair were actually decent people and didn\'t have as much drama as the others. It kept things simple and did a good job of it. If you feel like it try giving it a shot, okay if you don\'t like it thoughGirl who\'s self conscious about her big boobs and her first love dude who sees her for more then a pair of boobs all of this combined with swimming. it\'s a pretty sweet paring. Unfortunately I don\'t really know how to describe them as they\'re both pretty ordinary, forgive me for leaving this one out okay.Dobashi (Girl) and Terai (Boy)This is one of the best ones in my opinion, When you first see the characters it can sort of be assumed these two would get together. what I love though is that once someone found out what was happening these two were already dating. It has none of those messy love plots where they had to go through a lot of stuff to be together and it\'s a first for each of them to the dating world.When first meeting Dobashi it\'s shown she is very respected for her talent in sport however we can also see how the boys around her saying how none of them would want to date her as I guess she would wear the ""pants"" in a relationship (she was the one that suggested to date after all). She has a strong personality but is normally closed off, though makes an effort to open her heart more often.Terai on the other hand is bad at sports as has a pretty weak personality. I love him though and he is one of my favourite male characters. He is a bit of a nervous wreck and he feels actually developed as he tries his very best to summon the courage to be a proper boyfriend. His internal struggles are made quite clear and they have a very natural romanceMisaki/Zaitsu/YoshihikoNow here is the ridiculous part of the story if it isn\'t ridiculous enough yet. Misaki is the love interest of these two boys. Zaitsu who is her friends brother and they all known each other for a long being neighbours and Yoshihiko who is a fellow school classmate. Yet another love triangle but this ones worst cuz it is way bigger then any triangle, maybe try polygon. Was the writer testing how many possible people he could get involved in this relationship problem or what. I feel as if this would get too complicated ad I don\'t want to spoil to much of the show so i\'ll stop here but in other words this is the biggest conflict of the show and I don\'t think it\'s a good one in my opinion. I don\'t like how it started but I do like how straightforward it was resolved.Misaki and YuujiNow wait a second this is the same person but with a different guy?? why don\'t you just include him on top. There are very simple reasons for one is it will make it even more complicated and I feel as if it will be easier to understand starting with this guy because there is so about this ship I want to talk about.Misaki gets confessed to a lot but turns them all down this is because she does not like anyone but beyond that she has never ever had a crush on anyone before so she doesn\'t get what it feels like. Yet one day this person who gave her a lollipop as a joke yes she falls for him. At least in the Valentine episode Misaki herself questions this love so the whole ridiculousness isn\'t just played of for laughs which is something I think I\'m happy about. Sad thing is he has a huge sister complex and considers her his most important person. That sister is Arihara. (the one with the brother love triangle). But I think everyone can all agree that this paring was one with the least time given to it. I want to say more about this but I don\'t want to give to much information for those who actually want to watch so I\'ll put the rest below.SPOILERS JUST SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPHI do appreciate that she didn\'t have to choose between the two boys that liked her but that ending where they got together was pretty terrible and kinda rushed when Arihara barely shown any signs at all that he liked her. Or also the fact the was barely any time on these two it felt very rushed at least to me.And now I regret writing so much about a show I don\'t even like that much. If someone has actually read any of this or if it has actually provided any help at all then thank you at least it wasn\'t a total waste I guess.. Feel free to disagree to anything I say as long as it\'s respectful. it worth watching.

The story is so educative I think, in fact it shows the different love problems the teenagers are having between hesitatation and temptation, the story is told in many diffrent scenarios and each time it focus on one character only.I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the...art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes)I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(. art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes)I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(.', 'When I first started to watch this show, there were a few titles that immediately popped to mind, School Rumble, KimiKiss, and Boys Be... I soon found that Hatsukoi Limited has more in common with Boys Be than the others, this is due to similar themes of young love, ensemble structure, soft almost idealized atmosphere, etc.  However, what really differentiates Hatsukoi Limited from Boys Be and what really surprised me about Hatsukoi Limited was the level of comedy/fun in each episode.Much of Hatsukoi Limited comedy was derived from its characters, timing, and a bit of slapstick.  I didn\'t really feel dumber and...rarely did things ever get really stupid for the sake of comedy.  In fact the many times I laughed I would have probably cringed in lesser titles.  This shows the level of skill that was used in creating this title.  However, the best part of the comedy is how well it integrates and transitions to the drama/poignant moments seamlessly even within the course of a single episode.  While Hatsukoi Limited is mostly a fun/enjoyable title to watch, there are plenty of poignant moments for example, Chikura arc and the end of the Valentines arc.Although I use the term \'arc\' to categorize the various stories, its not as distinct as your typical \'arc\'.  By this I mean the various stories are interspersed throughout the 12 episodes, these \'arcs\' don\'t begin and end within 1or 2 episode.  Yes, there are episodes that focus on certain stories but at the same time Hatsukoi Limited will address and move other storylines.  While, this may sound overly complicated, especially with its large cast, it never seems like that.  This is because, they introduce the various plotlines slowly and seamlessly.  It is only when you sit down and actually try to map out all the relationships will you realize how complex it is.  Plus at the same time you get to see most of the characters mature throughout the series.There is a catch concerning the story/characters, with such a large cast, a complex relationship chart, and only 12 episodes the characterization does suffer a bit.  A few of the characters could have been eliminated and I doubt anyone would really miss them, honestly I wish they did get rid of them as they were either annoying or boring.  Also, with such a huge cast, even some of the ""main"" characters lacked some development, this is why I said ""most"" in the previous paragraph.Despite the problems with the large cast of character and short time, I found most of the characters extremely likeable and can relate to them.  Also, if one looks at Hatsukoi Limited purely from theme point of view, it does capture the various aspects of a first love and to do this you need a large cast.Another complaint I have would be too much focus on the girls side, in particular the middle school girls, by the animators.   I\'m not implying that the male characters lacked any characterization/development or are weak characters, they just spend too much focusing on the girls point of view.  This was apparent by the last arc which has a strong focus on the middle school boys and I felt as if they needed a bit more time seeing things from their point of view in earlier episodes to make the final arc stronger.  Once again cutting down the cast and/or increasing the length would solve these problems.  I heard the manga (source) was cut short, so I guess it can\'t be helped however, J.C. Staff did an amazing job with what they had leaving me both wanting more and completely satisfied (sadly I can\'t make any comparisons to the manga as I have yet to read it...).Since this was done by a well known studio animation the expectations for animation quality was quite high.  In terms of consistency and animation they succeeded.  There was never a point I noticed any inconsistency with the character designs nor did the movements feel choppy (granted there wasn\'t much action...).   However, the backgrounds seemed almost missing at times, not really a major complaint as most of the time we\'re looking at the characters.  The character designs were done by Mizuki Kawashita, of Ichigo 100% fame, and are beautifully done.  Her designs seem to work perfectly with the watercolor-like animation and add to the soft, idealized, almost nostalgic feel of the series.  However, since she is also known for Ichigo 100%, we are treated to or forced to endure (depending on your view) fanservice moments.  Personally, I wasn\'t really distracted/annoyed by those moments, as it didn\'t feel overly forced.Hatsukoi Limited a well executed romance anime that focuses on ""first love"".  It also has very well timed jokes and a very endearing cast who are often the reason the jokes are funny instead of cringe worthy.  To show the various aspects of a first love Hatsukoi Limited has a huge cast but at the same time suffers due to this huge cast.  In particular, lack of characterization and development for many of the character, hell even a few of the main characters.  This made a few of the characters kind of worthless and will not be missed if written out.  However, since the manga was cut short and thus only 12 episodes, I can be lenient.  Nevertheless, JC Staff did an amazing job wtih the adaptation leaving me wanting more and completely satisfied.  JC Staff also did an amazing job on the animation and art and was also very consistent, granted the background lacks details.  KimiKiss, Toradora, and now Hatsukoi Limited, J.C. Staff is quickly becoming a studio I associate with quality romance anime. rarely did things ever get really stupid for the sake of comedy.  In fact the many times I laughed I would have probably cringed in lesser titles.  This shows the level of skill that was used in creating this title.  However, the best part of the comedy is how well it integrates and transitions to the drama/poignant moments seamlessly even within the course of a single episode.  While Hatsukoi Limited is mostly a fun/enjoyable title to watch, there are plenty of poignant moments for example, Chikura arc and the end of the Valentines arc.Although I use the term \'arc\' to categorize the various stories, its not as distinct as your typical \'arc\'.  By this I mean the various stories are interspersed throughout the 12 episodes, these \'arcs\' don\'t begin and end within 1or 2 episode.  Yes, there are episodes that focus on certain stories but at the same time Hatsukoi Limited will address and move other storylines.  While, this may sound overly complicated, especially with its large cast, it never seems like that.  This is because, they introduce the various plotlines slowly and seamlessly.  It is only when you sit down and actually try to map out all the relationships will you realize how complex it is.  Plus at the same time you get to see most of the characters mature throughout the series.There is a catch concerning the story/characters, with such a large cast, a complex relationship chart, and only 12 episodes the characterization does suffer a bit.  A few of the characters could have been eliminated and I doubt anyone would really miss them, honestly I wish they did get rid of them as they were either annoying or boring.  Also, with such a huge cast, even some of the ""main"" characters lacked some development, this is why I said ""most"" in the previous paragraph.Despite the problems with the large cast of character and short time, I found most of the characters extremely likeable and can relate to them.  Also, if one looks at Hatsukoi Limited purely from theme point of view, it does capture the various aspects of a first love and to do this you need a large cast.Another complaint I have would be too much focus on the girls side, in particular the middle school girls, by the animators.   I\'m not implying that the male characters lacked any characterization/development or are weak characters, they just spend too much focusing on the girls point of view.  This was apparent by the last arc which has a strong focus on the middle school boys and I felt as if they needed a bit more time seeing things from their point of view in earlier episodes to make the final arc stronger.  Once again cutting down the cast and/or increasing the length would solve these problems.  I heard the manga (source) was cut short, so I guess it can\'t be helped however, J.C. Staff did an amazing job with what they had leaving me both wanting more and completely satisfied (sadly I can\'t make any comparisons to the manga as I have yet to read it...).Since this was done by a well known studio animation the expectations for animation quality was quite high.  In terms of consistency and animation they succeeded.  There was never a point I noticed any inconsistency with the character designs nor did the movements feel choppy (granted there wasn\'t much action...).   However, the backgrounds seemed almost missing at times, not really a major complaint as most of the time we\'re looking at the characters.  The character designs were done by Mizuki Kawashita, of Ichigo 100% fame, and are beautifully done.  Her designs seem to work perfectly with the watercolor-like animation and add to the soft, idealized, almost nostalgic feel of the series.  However, since she is also known for Ichigo 100%, we are treated to or forced to endure (depending on your view) fanservice moments.  Personally, I wasn\'t really distracted/annoyed by those moments, as it didn\'t feel overly forced.Hatsukoi Limited a well executed romance anime that focuses on ""first love"".  It also has very well timed jokes and a very endearing cast who are often the reason the jokes are funny instead of cringe worthy.  To show the various aspects of a first love Hatsukoi Limited has a huge cast but at the same time suffers due to this huge cast.  In particular, lack of characterization and development for many of the character, hell even a few of the main characters.  This made a few of the characters kind of worthless and will not be missed if written out.  However, since the manga was cut short and thus only 12 episodes, I can be lenient.  Nevertheless, JC Staff did an amazing job wtih the adaptation leaving me wanting more and completely satisfied.  JC Staff also did an amazing job on the animation and art and was also very consistent, granted the background lacks details.  KimiKiss, Toradora, and now Hatsukoi Limited, J.C. Staff is quickly becoming a studio I associate with quality romance anime.', 'Hatsukoi Limited was good but it was not great. I would say it\'s worth mentioning but in all honesty, there are other anime that I would recommend over Hatsukoi Limited. When I saw the first episode, I immediately compared this anime to Amagami SS and I can see that many other people have done the same. I will have to agree with everybody and say that Amagami SS is better than Hatsukoi Limited. That doesn\'t mean that Hatsukoi Limited was not a good anime. I just felt that there was room for improvement. Let\'s start with the negatives and we\'ll work our way to the...positives because despite having some bad points, this anime is worth it for me to leave you, the reader, with a positive impression of it in the end.Negatives:I felt the storyline was very typical. Much more typical than other romance anime. What I found unique was that each character had her own story and in the end, it all tied together. Everybody\'s story tied together; however, I felt that the point of the anime started to stray off it\'s path and onto a different path. When the anime starts off, i felt that I was going to enjoy it because I get to learn about each character, go through their lives, their struggles, the love. However, towards the end of the anime, or about 2/3rds through, I felt that the anime started to focus more on one couple. Not only did it start to focus on this couple more but it was the most typical of the couple. You had the school\'s prettiest girl who starts off as shallow with a boy that constantly tease her. Both seem to hate each other but the tables are turned towards the end. I\'m not going to even consider this a spoiler because it\'s extremely obvious and very predicting. I was quite disappointed that the anime started to focus on this couple towards the end rather than to stick to a broad focus on all the characters. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the anime that I\'ve watched that had quite a handful of characters. This isn\'t a bad thing and I actually liked it; however, I was left disappointed with the character development. I felt that the anime rushed through some of the characters and spent more time with others. The anime made it clear that these people were the main characters, but then next episode it seems to just drop that character and move onto another. I wanted to know more about girl A or I wanted to know about the past of girl b. One girl that showed up quite a few times didn\'t even get a storyline nor a sweetheart. In fact, they introduced her as the older sister as one of the other main girls but they didn\'t even bother mentioning her name. They probably did mention it, but I don\'t remember it because they hardly mentioned her yet she showed up quite a few times and even interacted with all the characters. The creators put her on the cover with all the main girls, they put her in the opening, the closing, yet me as the viewer don\'t even get to know anything about her? What\'s up with that? One of the boy characters seemed to also have an interesting past yet they explained nothing of his past. All you know is that he is feared, he gets in a lot of fights, and he wins a lot of fights. However, I want to know why he gets in these fights, why is he like this, why do people want to beat him up, why is he undefeated? None of those questions were answered, he simply showed up as someone who is scary, can fight, and loves one of the girls. In one of the scenes towards the second half of the whole anime, one of the girls go ""you\'re fast right?!"" and she makes him run. I thought ""why is he fast and how did you know he was fast?"" Again, the question was left unanswered. One last negative was that one of the girl was shown as to having a boyfriend already; however, she did not start with the boy. The anime eventually explained how they met up but I felt that their story was the most rush as all this happens in approximately 1 episode. I want to know more, I want to know more of this girl\'s past and this boy\'s past. The character development was probably one of the worst aspect to this anime. I felt so empty from some of the characters.Positives:Despite some of the negatives, I felt that it did not really hinder the overall enjoyment of the anime. The stories were cute and very sweet despite being quite typical. One of the first story you are introduced to is a straight up copy of Beauty and the Beast. The title of the episode is even called Beauty and the Beast. However, despite being a story we all heard before, the way the creators tackled it was cute and very funny. I enjoyed the large amount of characters and I\'m glad they all had their own story and their own love interest. Some of the stories were much more unique than others and that\'s okay since the anime is composed of a bunch of short stories. One of my favorite aspect to the anime is that in the end, everyone\'s story ties together. Despite having some predictable scenes, it was still very cute and got me smiling when the scene came. EXAMPLE: Sure, you can watch an anime and say ""they\'re going to kiss"" but when the scene actually happens I can\'t help but still smiling due to how the creators really tackled it in Hatsukoi Limited. Each character is drawn very well and I just absolutely love the art style. It resembles the art style of Amagami SS which I think gives a very mature and real-life atmosphere to the anime. The art style didn\'t really exaggerate all the love in the air of the anime which really made everything so much sweeter.Overall, I give this anime an 8 out of 10. It would have gotten a 9 if the characters were further developed and the stories kept going but I felt that some stories were just too short and some were just too rushed. I would still recommend this anime to all your romance anime lovers but if you haven\'t seen Amagami SS then watch Hatsukoi Limited first, then watch Amagami SS. I would definitely rewatch Hatsukoi Limited but I probably wouldn\'t watch it more than twice. positives because despite having some bad points, this anime is worth it for me to leave you, the reader, with a positive impression of it in the end.Negatives:I felt the storyline was very typical.

I have to admit had seen this one in the myanimelist but I didnt think it would be that good so skipped it. However since he suggested and he knew what I liked I gave it a shot and I was totally taken by surprise.This anime deals with first love. First love of 16 characters. Yes you read that right, 16 characters. And surprisingly the story does not feel disjoint. Every character's life gets interwined with the others in one form or the other. And that is one of the greatest aspects of this anime. The story seems bland, a staple school life comedy for quite large sections of the anime and then it suddenly hits you with some mature handling of the embarrassment and confusion of first love and the depression of your first rejection. And yes there are quite a few situations of misunderstandings in the anime and they have actually been handled pretty well. They might seem really ordinary, but the way they are handled is what makes this anime really worth your watch.Animation is well not really that great, that the backgrounds are painted is actually pretty obvious in many places. The character drawings are decent. The music and OSTs will take you by surprise. Some romantic scenes have Clannad-esque OSTs(probably somebody from Clannad worked here) and the ending song was just amazing. It also had two different eneding for two of its episodes since the normal ending wouldnt have fit well, and it worked like a charm. And I was somehow impressed by the voice acting. They brought out the emotions really well. And as I had mentioned before the anime was coherent , they managed to interwine all the characters into one single big story really well.Final Verdict:- Of course at the end of the day this is a generic high school romance story but a high school romance story done right for the most part. Thats why it is not exceptional, but you cant miss it if you are a lover of this genre. a friend.

Though she claimed she would accept any offer, she is consistently unsettled by Zaizu\'s monstrous appearance. However, she shows she can be somewhat caring as well as crafty, you see her a little at the start where she is trying not to hurt Misao\'s feelings, when she then meets her ""First Love At First Sight"" who is Zaitzu\'s brother.she has to ask herself does Zaitzu\'s brother really love her or does she have feelings for Misao if she can look beyond his looks.Kei Enomoto- LOVE this storyline, Kei is apparently very popular with guys due to her ""mature"" face. However, she sees the attention she receives as a hassle, and believes confessions of love are just a chore if the feeling isn\'t mutual. She openly admits that looks are a major factor in choosing a relationship, but carries a love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with Kusuda, Who she nicknames ""Kappa Face"" they have a relationship where they both are too immature to realize there feelings, this part becomes the main storyline, for some the other characters story\'s may just get in the way of this one but i think its done perfectly and even this story NEEDED the others.Koyoi Bessho- Sub character really who is shown a few times, she mainly has a brother complex.Nao Chikura- Another sub character (Kinda) a guy who is connected to the story loves her but does she really love him or does she love a senpai she\'s known for years.Dobashi, Rika- The most level headed out of the group, Rika seems to enjoy teasing others. She is in Ayumi\'s grade. A well known tom-boy, Doba excels in athletics and has been stated to be domineering.Through athletics she finds a shy guy who loves her, they form a relationship straight away, she is featured a few times usually to balance out the group.There is PLENTY more characters who are also featured, they seem to all revolve around the brothers or the group of girls, some have strong points some don\'t but overall even in the sub characters they are really good to watch and make the whole show, a rare occasion is i didn\'t dislike anyone (well maybe 1 kind of).Conclusion-------------*A special menthion once again for the Enomoto/Kusuda storyline which was fantastic, the rest were really good and all different but compelling all the same, this is due to some AMAZING writing for this series.*The artwork is stunning and in Blu-ray it looks mindblowing at some points.*The sound is good nothing wrong with them, they suit the characters perfectly.*Character development is great you see them ALL progress which is rare to see.*I cannot get over how good the Enomoto/Kusuda storyline was its worth it just for that tbh, althought the ending is good but like many series in the Comedy/Romance section they end abruptly which is a bit dissapointing and lets it down (Slightly) for me, don\'t get me wrong this series is amazing but it just takes a edge of it which is why i give it an 9.

Hatsukoi (First Love) Limited. is basically a group of short stories about middle- and high-schoolers dealing with their first love that are somehow connected. The problem is, any of those couples could have their own show, and one or two episodes about them are just not enough. Still, the anime does turn out all right, with humour, sexiness, and drama included; not to mention romance, of course. Like I said in the forum, episode 9 is far and away my favorite, as it is the most...innocent, mature, and tragic.It is hard to tell the synopsis here because, as I just mentioned, there are a lot of tales, but let us pretend that the first one is the most important. Five middle-schoolers talk about love, and one in particular, Arihara Ayumi, dreams about being confessed to by a handsome prince. As they are leaving school, they are confronted by a scary, large man that looks like a beast and pulls something out of his pocket, making the terrified girls think he is taking out a knife. It turns out to be just a letter directed towards Arihara. He, Zaitsu Misao, leaves right after handing it to her. Actually, it is a love letter, which shatters Ayumi\'s romantic fantasies . . .Describing the characters in Hatsukoi Limited. is similar to drawing a relationship chart (which has already been done) since there are so many of them, but I will go ahead anyway for the sake of making the review complete. First off, there is the heroine (apparently), Arihara Ayumi, who is a feisty, strong girl that beats up her brother whenever he acts inappropriately. Her brother, Arihara Yuuji, loves his little sister a lot, but she does not feel the same way about him. His classmate, Bessho Yoshihiko, is in love with a girl in the same class, Misaki. Ayumi\'s classmate, Zaitsu Mamoru, also has a secret crush on Misaki, who is his neighbor. Yamamoto Misaki is Misao\'s childhood friend and is good at martial arts. Zaitsu Misao is Mamoru\'s older brother in high school that has a bad reputation and a scary face, frightening most of those that look at him; when he saw Mamoru\'s class picture one day, he fell for Ayumi, and realized his feelings later, after almost dying in a fight and being taken to the hospital. Bessho\'s little sister, Bessho Koyoi, is infatuated with her older brother, but does not realize that he likes someone else. Her friend, Chikura Nao, is in the art club and admires Renjou, a senpai whom she has never met, but has been drawn by his paintings; she has an older brother that is described as ""hot"" by Kei. Another classmate of theirs is my least favorite character, Dobashi, an athletic, sometimes quiet, girl who is in the tennis club and is secretly dating a boy in the same school, named Terai. Weak at sports, the glasses-wearing Terai could not keep up when playing tennis, so after getting private training from Dobashi, they started going out together. In the same class as her is Kusuda, a middle-schooler that likes dirty books; he often bickers with a girl called Kei, who says he has a kappa-(mythical creature that has a plate-like object over its head; in Nagasarete Airantou (Casted Away: Airan Island), it appears, but the protagonist, who is science-oriented, believes it to be a turtle)face. She, Enomoto Kei, is a beautiful girl that looks more mature than she really is, and thus is called an old woman by Kusuda; the two of them are supposed to pair up together, but they just do not fit each other. Zaitsu and Kusuda\'s circle completes with Sogabe, a quiet guy who is not in a hurry to find love. Finally, Watase Meguru, Yamamoto and Enomoto\'s older sister\'s classmate, used to be an Olympic candidate as a swimmer in middle school, but has since given it up to hide her enormous breasts, which got her teased; she used to like Takei, a senpai passionate for swimming, too.The seiyuu generally fit their respective characters. It is notable that Roronoa Zoro\'s voice actor from One Piece also plays Takei in First Love Limited. There is also a nice soundtrack. The opening sequence includes scenes of the middle school girls, whereas the ending sequence shows all the females in cosplay pictures.The artwork is at a high level. I may not like some character designs, but you can tell they were meant to look the way they are. The animators (and seiyuu) certainly did a way better job than the ones who did the author\'s more famous work, Ichigo (Strawberry) 100%, whose heroine, Toujou Aya is like a shy, weaker version of Yamamoto Misaki.This is another one of those anime that I do not regret watching, and, in fact, I would be willing to watch it again some day. The stories are mostly beautiful, lighthearted, romantic, naïve and hilarious (wait until you see episode 8, ""The Melancholy of the Chocolate Bomber""). The series has my stamp of approval. innocent, mature, and tragic.It is hard to tell the synopsis here because, as I just mentioned, there are a lot of tales, but let us pretend that the first one is the most important. Five middle-schoolers talk about love, and one in particular, Arihara Ayumi, dreams about being confessed to by a handsome prince. As they are leaving school, they are confronted by a scary, large man that looks like a beast and pulls something out of his pocket, making the terrified girls think he is taking out a knife. It turns out to be just a letter directed towards Arihara. He, Zaitsu Misao, leaves right after handing it to her. Actually, it is a love letter, which shatters Ayumi\'s romantic fantasies . . .Describing the characters in Hatsukoi Limited. is similar to drawing a relationship chart (which has already been done) since there are so many of them, but I will go ahead anyway for the sake of making the review complete. First off, there is the heroine (apparently), Arihara Ayumi, who is a feisty, strong girl that beats up her brother whenever he acts inappropriately. Her brother, Arihara Yuuji, loves his little sister a lot, but she does not feel the same way about him. His classmate, Bessho Yoshihiko, is in love with a girl in the same class, Misaki. Ayumi\'s classmate, Zaitsu Mamoru, also has a secret crush on Misaki, who is his neighbor. Yamamoto Misaki is Misao\'s childhood friend and is good at martial arts. Zaitsu Misao is Mamoru\'s older brother in high school that has a bad reputation and a scary face, frightening most of those that look at him; when he saw Mamoru\'s class picture one day, he fell for Ayumi, and realized his feelings later, after almost dying in a fight and being taken to the hospital. Bessho\'s little sister, Bessho Koyoi, is infatuated with her older brother, but does not realize that he likes someone else. Her friend, Chikura Nao, is in the art club and admires Renjou, a senpai whom she has never met, but has been drawn by his paintings; she has an older brother that is described as ""hot"" by Kei. Another classmate of theirs is my least favorite character, Dobashi, an athletic, sometimes quiet, girl who is in the tennis club and is secretly dating a boy in the same school, named Terai. Weak at sports, the glasses-wearing Terai could not keep up when playing tennis, so after getting private training from Dobashi, they started going out together. In the same class as her is Kusuda, a middle-schooler that likes dirty books; he often bickers with a girl called Kei, who says he has a kappa-(mythical creature that has a plate-like object over its head; in Nagasarete Airantou (Casted Away: Airan Island), it appears, but the protagonist, who is science-oriented, believes it to be a turtle)face. She, Enomoto Kei, is a beautiful girl that looks more mature than she really is, and thus is called an old woman by Kusuda; the two of them are supposed to pair up together, but they just do not fit each other. Zaitsu and Kusuda\'s circle completes with Sogabe, a quiet guy who is not in a hurry to find love. Finally, Watase Meguru, Yamamoto and Enomoto\'s older sister\'s classmate, used to be an Olympic candidate as a swimmer in middle school, but has since given it up to hide her enormous breasts, which got her teased; she used to like Takei, a senpai passionate for swimming, too.The seiyuu generally fit their respective characters. It is notable that Roronoa Zoro\'s voice actor from One Piece also plays Takei in First Love Limited. There is also a nice soundtrack.

Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there.As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females,...and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two.After the first few episodes I wasn't really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series.I'd suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure. and be both serious and ecchi at the same time.

It is essentially a relationship-based slice-of-life story. Though a show with many girls typically leads to a harem, this is definitely not so. Each of the girls has their own pick, and there are an equal numbers of supporting male characters.What makes Hatsukoi unique is the sheer number of relationships between the characters. If you don't like keeping track of who likes who and who did what to who, then stay away from this. This is a really hard series to judge as I feel that capping...the series at 12 episodes made the story progression rushed, especially at the end. Overal Hatsukoi was a fairly good watch, and the story is much improved from the author's previous work, Ichigo 100%.Animation:The animation quality is somewhat lackluster in my opinion. While I was very happy that this series had much less fan service than Ichigo, the overall design was a bit simplistic for its time. The color palette is a bit dull and backgrounds tend to be bland. The characters themselves are okay but nothing outstanding, probably because there were so many of them given the length of this series...Sound:The OP and ED are fair, though I have no idea why they show the characters in cosplay in the ED... The BGM is also fair but not very memorable. The VAs are good as usual, I liked Aki Toyosaki's performance as Koyoi, even though she hasn't had many major roles.Story:The series did a great job at developing the characters and establishing character relationships throughout the series. I had a lot of fun creating a graph of relationships just to keep track of what was happening in the show. There are a lot of ironic moments as well as some dramatic cliffhangers.My only major complaint is the one that I already pointed out; though the series concluded well, I didn't really know that I was at the end of the series or even that I had passed the climax until I was well into the last episode. My only other thought is that the show leaves an opening for further development, though obviously none has come in the past four years.Character:The sheer number of characters may be a bit overwhelming for such a short series. Though a lot of relationships are established between the characters, their appearance time is greatly varied. For instance, one character will become the protagonist for one episode before disappearing into a minor supporting role. There are also a lot of additional supporting characters that make only brief appearances in the series, which only makes the series even more cluttered. I really liked the development in this series but I they could have easily done just as well with fewer supporting characters.Value:This series was an interesting watch, and the developments were fun to keep track of. Knowing what the climax is now, a second watch puts the previous events in a new light. I'm certain that if they extended it to a 18-24 ep series, it would have been much more well rounded.

As it perfectly achieves what it set out to do, I think most of these negative reviews are based of people who just don\'t like romance in general. If the creator makes something that achieves entertainment in its own way, then it\'s a success. This is a must watch, and I\'ll tell you why. One of the most underrated and misjudged animes out there for sure.Hatsukoi limited\'s story...is pretty simple and straightforward, it primarily follows the lives of a group of teen girls from a middle school and how their ""first love"" I guess plays out, but the story also expands to the interactions between their fellows boys and other people, as well as a connected story with more mature high school girls and boys and their love. Sounds a bit confusing, but trust me this is the most perfectly balanced romance story ever.The story is absolutely amazing because although nothing too groundbreaking and special it makes you feel like you are experiencing something brand new and fresh each episode. For such a simple and casual story there are actually so many characters who each have their own personalities, quirks and fetishes lol. However what\'s most amazing is that the story is perfectly balanced on the drama/sadness and happy/fun scale. Some animes are just too fucking full of itself, you know those ones that thinks its being really smart and dramatic by smashing a shit ton of melodrama on to it eg. Hanabado, which is not bad but hilariously overdramatic and laughably over serious at times. This is not that at all, it\'s normal, and doesn\'t try flood you with drama and emotions, which makes the story and characters realistic and believable. The perfect romance for those who are sick and tired of overblown melodrama and unrealistic stories. That being said... Trust me this anime will make you have the feels when it wants to go hard, around about episode 6 shit really gets moody, not in a bad way, it\'s just emotionally intense. Fucking excellent absolutely love it, all this just means that the story is therefore a 10/10, I can\'t really give much of plot since any would be pretty much spoiling, all in all, theres humour, theres kinky panty shots, theres romance, theres drama, for only 12 episodes, the story opens and ends satisfyingly and ties the knot on the story, really difficult thing to do for some less able studios.The art and animation, ohhh my fuck the art in this is so good. For such a casual story, JC staff went all out on the appearance of it all. First of all the animation is spot on and amazing, frame by frame hand drawn and overlayed with hard work, everything and everyone moves clearly and smoothly, think a toned down version of kill la kill, yes thats how good the animation is. Which is a weak spot for most casual romance series\' eg.Wotakoi, where the animation is so fucking stiff and uninteresting. The light rays and blush effects are also beautiful to look at and add to the experience so much more. Damn JC really know how to make good looking animes and this was only 2009!!!!. The humour is also tied to the animations and expressions, there are some wacky as funny asf expressions in this which makes you laugh every time. The humor came out quite nicely as well as it\'s not like those overused blank face drawings and it gets pretty creative at time. BUT, the thing which makes this soooo amazing, is that the people, girls or boys whatever ACTUALLY LOOK GOOD AND CUTE. The faces are round and drawn nicely and everyone actually has a soul ffs, a weakness for many modern anime is that everyone just looks so fucken braindead and boring eg. Sailor moon crystal, which isn\'t bad story wise but visually yuck. All characters in this look really cute and sexy but not really moe or ecchi its just natural, and thats so good. Makes the romance work so much better as well. 100/10Sound is pretty good too, fun and lighthearted at times when it\'s funny and dramatic and emotional when it\'s trying to push the romance to you. The music just works really well overrall and adds to the whole experience much more. Especially the voice acting, done really well by actors and you really feel their emotions. 10/10The characters ultimately are the most amazing part of this anime. Absolutely amazing and everyone is so loveable in their own ways. Characters are complex and realistic and not one sided at all. Like eg. Youve got the bossy bitch that only likes boys for their looks, but then she sees that some boys can be attractive although they dont look that sexy anyway . There is HUUUUUGE character development in all characters. Considering the length of the anime, the characters were given decent coverage and there is depth to most of the main characters. The story is really character-driven in that we get to see the story from many different angles depending on whose love life it is focused on in each episode. The story is also done in a way that not all characters are introduced straight away, and that it focuses on the love of many characters whos stories interwine and connect together, as if all these people, although some don\'t actually know eachother are all in the same city and living similar lives, as if it\'s trying to say that all strangers have their own stories and secret lives that most people don\'t know, WOW ITS FUCKING AMAZING, also get that feeling that OH WOW there she is. Of course the main characters is still Ayumi but we get to see different points of view on love based on the different characters. This is what makes the story so colourful. Which is why i have to give both story and characters 10 as they go hand in hand. The characters have very real and different personalities which are explored in this story and help to make it interesting. I\'d say that almost all the characters are main characters because they get an equal coverage and hence it adds to the realism as it\'s not some anime where the main character always wins in the end.Overall, Fucking amazing rom com and one that you must watch to believe the hype. Perfect story, perfect likeable characters, perfect sound and voice acting and perfect artstyle and animation. There is not really an opening or ending for each episode which is all the better because it wastes no time. This is the perfect casual watch for romance animes and one of the most complex and envigorating yet lighthearted and kind experiences out there. go watch it right now trust me you\'ll not be disappointed.PS. go support this properly and dont you dare watch it through illegal streaming services, it a creators product is good and you like it it means that they should get praise and rewards. Either buy this or watch it on crunchyroll, trust me it\'s worth it and the creators, both The og manga creator and jc staff really deserve it is pretty simple and straightforward, it primarily follows the lives of a group of teen girls from a middle school and how their ""first love"" I guess plays out, but the story also expands to the interactions between their fellows boys and other people, as well as a connected story with more mature high school girls and boys and their love.

You're not going to see anything you haven't seen done before but everything here is done well and given time to breathe.Story - 8Like I said above, you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before but it's all done well and with care. The story focuses on a collection of students ranging from 14-16 years of age and their first experiences with love amongst each other. Every main character (and there are a bunch of them) gets their story told and surprisingly it...never feels rushed. Some characters have more interesting stories than others but they're all compelling for the most part. This is a bit of a slow build though in my opinion. I found the 2nd half to be a 9/10 and the first half to be a solid 7/10 so 8 felt like an appropriate score to give.Art- 9Art is always going to be a very subjective category when reviewing anime but I really enjoyed the art style here. As I'm writing this now the show is 10 years old so I think it's held up well over that time. Is it perfect? Of course not but nothing stood out to me that was distracting.Sounds - 9Sounds is either going to be really good or awful. There isn't a lot of in between with this category. I felt like the voice actors did a great job conveying the proper emotion with their lines. There were a few moments in particular that stood out as very good acting but I won't spoil anything.Characters - 10This is the part of the show I was so impressed with. Yes, there are a lot of typical character traits going on here but they're all done so well. With such a big cast and so many different love stories to tell it would be easy for some characters to be lifeless but I felt like everyone here could be real. Every character was given enough time to make me care about them and also enough time to experience some personal growth. With only 12 episodes to work with I find that to be very impressive.Enjoyment - 9I can't possibly give this anything lower than a 9. Like I said before, I didn't enjoy the first 5 episodes nearly as much as the last 7 but I was never bored once and as the last episode finished I had a big, dumb smile on my face. You really can't ask for much more than that with anime. If this were 24 episodes I could see myself getting a little tired but 12 episodes was surprisingly perfect. Usually I hate when a show I love only has 12 episodes.Overall - 9I was honestly giving this show an 8 after episode 10 but I really enjoyed the way this show wrapped up in the last 2 episodes. This show was a lot of fun overall. It's not a game changer or anything but it's definitely something I'll revisit in the future. It left enough of an impression on me to want to write this review at least. For anyone that enjoys a good ROMCOM, you'll appreciate this.Thanks for reading. never feels rushed.

You really can't ask for much more than that with anime. If this were 24 episodes I could see myself getting a little tired but 12 episodes was surprisingly perfect. Usually I hate when a show I love only has 12 episodes.Overall - 9I was honestly giving this show an 8 after episode 10 but I really enjoyed the way this show wrapped up in the last 2 episodes. This show was a lot of fun overall. It's not a game changer or anything but it's definitely something I'll revisit in the future. It left enough of an impression on me to want to write this review at least. For anyone that enjoys a good ROMCOM, you'll appreciate this.Thanks for reading."", ""for some people like me whose so picky in watching anime... when i first watched the episode 1 i find the anime boring but as i watch the anime until episode 6 the story's getting more and more interesting because first i was really captivated by the idea of the creator of this manga... you'll really wonder who's love will survive and in every episode it revolves each and every characters of the anime... slowly every character show their personal and emotional qualities and therefore we tend to know them in just 1 episode... and also most of the story in this anime happen in...real life and to anyone i'll really recommend watching this anime though it's a bit ecchi and some fanservice, the story's nice real life and to anyone i'll really recommend watching this anime though it's a bit ecchi and some fanservice, the story's nice"", '""If you\'re good on the inside, then looks don\'t matter!""""Boys do not equal their looks, if you look past that you\'ll see someone who acts with the purest of hearts.""Hatsukoi Limited. A lot to love, but also, at the same time, a a few things to dislike.The story as a whole is good. The way the first 9 or 10 episodes are made in such a way that the final two come together is a really nice touch. It really works. However that\'s all I can say that\'s good. At times, it\'s a little repetitive. The same characters doing...the same things to eachother is apparent. For some, it\'s going to be boring. Nevertheless if you stick with it the story couldn\'t end better.The programme is certainly great on the art front. All I\'m going to say is that the last episode has some stunning animation and design, it helps to bring the story itself to a close. It\'s that good.Sound wise, it\'s impressive. The piano on its own is always a good thing in a programme like this. The emotions are portrayed better that way. It helps you to immerse yourself in each characters situation and that\'s what I like so much about this anime.But, and this is about the biggest but you can get. The characters are let down by one thing: there\'s way too many. You can\'t place names, they don\'t get as developed as much as you want, and it all becomes very complicated. Because of that, the emotions of the characters are spoilt because sometimes you don\'t know exactly who they are, and who the emotions are linked to. It\'s a huge let down. It got to me, but it didn\'t make me stop watching it. It gets better at the end because you get to know who is with who, and by then you\'ll know names well. It\'s not good enough though, it would deter quite a few watchers away I think. What Im saying is, if you are going to get confused about who is who, or you will be annoyed at how the characters barely have the chance to develop, then I\'d be wary if watching.As for enjoyment though, it was good overall. Sure, the amount if characters are about as many as about three different series put together, and yes it ruins the development if them, it still pleases you. Because the end makes up for the shortcomings rather well. It will leave you with a smile on your face, and ends on a good moral. Something along the lines of ""don\'t judge a book by its cover"" is the best way of describing the message of Hatsukoi Limited. It makes up for its issues well, which is why 7/10 is appropriate. Also, in regards to length, it\'s great because the story is told, and you\'re not left wondering things. They could have made it immensely long to develop the characters but then it would have become boring on a monumental scale. I like it how it is.If you like a good romance, and you can get your head around 22 (Yes, Twenty-Two!) characters, this is worth a watch, I doubt you\'ll regret it.Thank you for reading,Reflex96 the same things to eachother is apparent.

Let\'s start with Ayumi Arihara voiced by Mariya Ise, one of the genki ditz of her girl group who has a crush on Mamoru Zaitsu voiced by Miyu Irino but his older brother Misao voiced by Kenji Nomura...also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality. Next we have Rika Dobashi voiced by Minako Kotobuki a calm yet athletic member of the girl group who has a nice romance with Haruto Terai voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in which they have this superiority inferiority complex towards each other. Next is Nao Chikura voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, one of the more shy member of the girl group and Hiroyuki Sogabe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai had a crush on her BUT she also has a fleeting romance with one of her former art club seniors by the form of Yukito Renjou voiced by Akira Ishida. Next (YES, there\'s still more!) is Misaki Yamamoto voiced by Rie Tanaka and Mamoru Zaitsu has a crush on her BUT Misaki likes Ayumi\'s older brother Yuuji voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino (in which HE has a sister complex and doesn\'t really have feelings for Misaki), next is Meguru Watase voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in which she and Gengorou Takei voiced by Kazuya Nakai DO have feelings for each other ALONG with their love of swimming but Meguru has other worries but that a bit later. Second to last is Koyoi Bessho voiced by Aki Toyosaki who has a brother complex to her older brother Yoshihiko Bessho voiced by Satoshi Hino in which he has feelings for Misaki and FINALLY we have Kei Enomoto voiced by Shizuka Ito, the alpha *ahem* bitch of the girl group in which she has a violent tsundere relationship with Etsu Kusuda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma the local pervert of the series and friends of Sogabe and Mamoru and later on Enomoto gets a rival in the form of Sumire Fudounomiya voiced by Ayako Kawasumi. Did you get all that???Ok in all honesty, the relationships ranges across the board and even the ""great relationships"" has skewed priorities to the ""horribly awful relationships"" have a silver lining. In terms of favourites and worst romances in the anime itself, LA thought that Chikura\'s and Dobashi\'s were some of the best one-shot romances with hardly a gleam of skewed priorities to them. Misaki\'s, Meguru\'s and Ayumi\'s were ok relationships with a few problems to them (Misaki\'s due to the fallout results concerning Mamoru, Meguru\'s for skewed priorities such as -sigh- her big boobs and Ayumi\'s for not being developed enough not just to Mamoru but to Misao as well and it\'s NEVER resolved...completely). LA would place Koyoi\'s relationship to be of comedic relief in a ways and NOT meant to be taken seriously, even if it\'s incest and you know LA rule with incest in anime (as long as it\'s their completely serious about it\'s subject matter of incest or it plays it up for the sake of comedy with no seriousness and dignity towards it\'s characters and Koyoi\'s is essentially this) thus Koyoi\'s only focus episode is a bit grating but it\'s only for the sake of comedy. -sigh- here we go...LA REALLY didn\'t like Enomoto and Kusuda\'s relationship, Enomoto for always having her belief that they need to be handsome and rich in order to even START dating her (see what LA means by alpha bitch?) AS well as Enomoto\'s CONSTANT tsun and violent verbal and sometimes physical abuse to Kusuda just because he\'s being perverted and eyeing someone else, Kusuda is no better as he\'s one of the main source of pervertedness in the anime besides the stray panty shots. Relationship-wise it\'s one of the most destructive relationship in the anime and by the end of it even with Enomoto and Kusuda\'s realization LA still hated the both of them by the end of it.Well here\'s also the thing, be it relationships that has no flaws and it\'s the perfect romance or one of the most destructive ones and LA didn\'t like them one bit, the perfect romance will have quips of completely idealistic to the destructive romances to be too harsh or unbelievably pessimistic and because of that LA chose Ayumi as LA\'s favourite she\'s in the middle of having flaws in her relationships but she\'s also idealistic in a ways.In terms of animation by JC Staff, the character designs were pretty to typical designs for the vast amount of characters in this anime and sometimes LA mistook characters for other similar looking characters (see Yoshihiko and Mamoru...no seriously...one time LA ACTUALLY thought this at one point), the backgrounding is typical but nothing to gawk at either. Finally the comedic moments does use the chibi visuals (both facial expressions and their entire body at times...Koyoi and Ayumi being the main culprit what with both of them being the comedic reliefs). The animation overall is decent with some level to detail on it\'s character designs but not much beyond that.In terms of voice acting, well this voice cast is JUST amazing, from Mariya Ise to Ayako Kawasumi and even Sayuri Yahagi!. Yes, LA did have a HUGE problem with Shizuka Ito\'s character but it is her CHARACTER LA didn\'t like, her vocals were still suited to Enomoto nonetheless. LA\'s favourite voice actor would go to Mariya Ise along with Ryoko Shiraishi. Nonetheless fantastic vocal line up!.Hatsukoi Limited for LA\'s experience in watching this anime ultimately depends on how you view the characters and their relationships in which they entail, you might hate some of the characters or you might love them and their relationships for the one true pairing or you see both the good or the bad towards one of the relationship. LA overall felt VERY divisive about this anime due to this but ALSO thought it had shades of wasted potential towards some of the relationships it had going for it. also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality.

In the end, the only ships I wound up caring about were Dobashi and Terai, and Enomoto and Kusuda. The dynamic of Enomoto and Kusuda was nice and sent out a good message, plus Dobashi and Terai were just simple and straightforward, plus totally supportive of each other and communicated well.The rest were just wtf to be honest. One that came close was Arihara and Yamamoto, but in the end I only cared about that one because Yamamoto is my preferred type of girl.In the end, I'd give it a 5.5...to 6 at best. Maybe it's just me, not shitting on anyone else who enjoyed it, but It didn't work for me. It was something nice to pass the time, but nothing much more than that unfortunately. I did enjoy Enomoto and Kusuda's relationship dynamic, and if there's other anime romances like theirs that have proper resolutions do recommend I'd love to check them out. But just not in this anime. If it was an anime focused purely on their relationship then sure, I might rank it higher and watch it more enthusiastically, but in this situation Hatsukoi Limited just doesn't work for me. to 6 at best.

StaffEpisodes 12 (6 extra - Limited Girl)Aired: April 12, 2009 to June 28, 2009Genre: Comedy, romance, School, Shounen""Geez, women are so hard to understand”...Hello dear readers, this is my first review so I hope you enjoy.IntroI watched this anime a week or so ago, and it was more or less what I expected when I read the synopsis, it is an anime about a group of girls and there quests for love, and I have to say that this anime does push the question of Can guys ever understand girls? I think it is a brilliant take on love life, and stereotypes of girls and boys.Do you think that guys could ever understand girls?Art.The artwork in this anime is perfect in my opinion, it\'s not too flashy, it doesn\'t follow down the path of fan service per say, the artwork never distracts you away from dialogue or characters, it helps the story in so many ways, if this anime had artwork like say ""High school of the dead"", it wouldn\'t be able to be taken seriously, but if the artwork was too plain, then viewers may lose interest.The effects of this artwork are to keep you interested and keep you focussed on the characters personalities and actions rather then their looks. I feel that the characters animation caught my eye the most, the background art always seemed to lack in detail but the characters would always make up for that loss. The artwork for the boys was a bit of a let down, but maybe the art was supposed to be this way, the art for the boys was small wimpy looking ""Ugly"" where as the girls were made to look glamourous, cute and good looking.7/10StoryA series relating the intertwined stories about the ""first loves"" of several middle-schoolers and high-schoolers. Each episode tends to focus on a different character, however the developments established during previous episodes continue to play smaller roles in those following. As the series progresses, an array of unusual and unexpected love webs begin to blossom.The story is fairly straight forward and each episode tends to focus on a different character, and as you progress through the anime I saw that each episodes has little effects on another, one action of a certain character can effect another.The story isn\'t very unique or mind blowing, but it doesn\'t fail to pull viewers in, it is simply a take on normal lives, it\'s natural. The story is well structured and never strays of its path, besides the information and story being rushed and pushed at you in the early episodes, it is consistant and never fails. The characters and story are almost attached, with the story following character develpoment. You get to watch the characters grow and mature over the 12 episodes.7/10Sound.I personally thouroughly enjoyed the music throughout this anime, I feel that the music complimented the anime, when there was a funny scene, music that fitted that scene would be played, when there was a serious scene, music that fitted was played, I think the creators did a great job with the music.The vocals were good throughout, I wouldn\'t say they were perfect but they weren\'t bad, the only bad thing is that typically the vocals were wimpy and stupid in certain parts, which lets the anime down in some ways, but also fits in with stereotypes.The sound effects made me chuckle on the odd occasion, I feel that the sound effects give the anime that comedy feel, when something funny happens the sound effects are always there to add that extra humor, and in contrast, they were also there when serious dialogue or actions were taking place.The opening theme was short and simple, and the music was calm and soothing, and the ending theme was fantastic.9/10Characters.The main protagonist is Ayumi Arihara the second year middle school student who is the cute good looking normal girl, who follows a normal teenage life.Other main characters in this anime are the rest of the girls in the group, Koyoi Bessho, Nao Chikura, Rika Dobashi, Kei enomoto. These girls follow certain stereypes with in my opinion enomoto being the most stereotypical, at the start she talks about how looks are more important then anything else but her opinion begins to change as the anime progresses.Koyoi is the brother loving happy go lucky character that never seems to be sad. She is a bit weird and will do anything to for her brother.Nao is a jealous, art loving character who\'s story follows her love for art and how she grows close to a fellow artist.Rika is the most level headed out of the girls, she enjoys mocking and teasing and is knows as a ""tom-boy"", due to her athletic ability.Then you get the boys, who range from the shy and wimpy, to the perverted and ballsy.Etsu Kusuda is the pervert who has a talent for putting girls to sleep.Hiroyuki Sogabe is a friend of kusuda, he\'s insecure and a narcissistic.Mamoru Zaitsu is the happy go lucky wannabe paramedic.I feel like these characters are natural, it doesn\'t feel forced when these characters interact bar the odd occasion, it has the feel of a normal teenagers life. I feel the characters reactions to certain situations show that it is natural and this helps the story progress as it feels as if I was watching an animated version of someones life through the eyes of serveral characters.8/10Enjoyment.This anime is good because of many reasons, it is a simple slice of life romantic comedy that takes the subject of love and teaches it so brilliantly, the characters compliment the anime and vice versa, the music and sound were fantastic and consistant, I loved the artwork in this anime, it is simple yet so very effective.The bad points for this anime are that it doesn\'t appeal to the male audiences as much as female which is to be expected, the story is very generic and the anime isn\'t very unique. Although I feel that this anime is very well done and is brilliant, it never really appealed to me, I could only watch a few episodes a night, it strayed to much on the girly side of anime for me to ever enjoy it to the full extent.6.5/10Goal of the anime.The goal of this anime was simply to show how understanding girls can be very difficult and near impossible, it is showing that love can happen between any two random people, no matter how much you know about one another.Scores.Art: 7/10Story: 7/10Sound: 9/10Characters: 8/10Enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall: 7.5/10 Hello dear readers, this is my first review so I hope you enjoy.IntroI watched this anime a week or so ago, and it was more or less what I expected when I read the synopsis, it is an anime about a group of girls and there quests for love, and I have to say that this anime does push the question of Can guys ever understand girls?

Although I feel that this anime is very well done and is brilliant, it never really appealed to me, I could only watch a few episodes a night, it strayed to much on the girly side of anime for me to ever enjoy it to the full extent.6.5/10Goal of the anime.The goal of this anime was simply to show how understanding girls can be very difficult and near impossible, it is showing that love can happen between any two random people, no matter how much you know about one another.Scores.Art: 7/10Story: 7/10Sound: 9/10Characters: 8/10Enjoyment: 6.5/10Overall: 7.5/10', ""Done watching HATSUKOI LIMITED and it was a blast that I couldn't stop until I finish it!!! The story is pretty interesting and full of comedy cliches which makes it fun to binge watch. It involves a mix of unrequited, mutual, friendship and family love of the characters... in short a complex love setting! xD HAHAHAHA!!! I really enjoy how each characters love story has a little bit of influence to one another till the end. It's one of those shows that leaves you smiling and begging for more episodes!

The ending song is...pretty catchy too!!! <3 9/10! pretty catchy too!!! <3 9/10!"", 'Has very strong first 2 episodes, but goes downhill afterwards.It starts by introducing the relationship mentioned in the synopsis, which threatens to equally likely fall into either the ""Gentle Giant + Loli"" trope you may have seen in other shows if you are a romcom fan or some stalker horror story. It quickly grows into a triangle in the very first episode, and there is sort of a resolution at least about the fear aspect that\'s simultaneously a bit cliched and with an interesting twist at the end.In the second episode another relationship is tacked on to the chain and I\'m almost sad that the...focus is shifted away from what I thought was the main theme. The growing relationship network is perhaps a bit more boring as it now has two clear favorite sides and a doomed side between them, but the situation is still ok. The new character certainly is interesting enough to make me forgive the distraction. It still seems like a potential 10/10 story show at this point.As we go on further however, the relationship web keeps expanding until we have a whole football team of ""main"" characters with a whole lot of ""setup"" and very little ""development"". This makes the show way too bloated, each particular sub-story too brief and watered down by the others, the details of the initially introduced relations (or any other for that matter) that originally seemed interesting become unimportant, etc. Towards the end we do get some progress for several of the central relationships ""in bulk"", but not a conclusive resolution to most so the show feels unfinished and unsatisfying.Ultimately, I am disappointed.

Happy endings for some though not for all. Nothing too incredibly sad or depressing. Good character development; some characters grow and change. Overall plot is not incredibly original, but that is not usually the reason one watches this genre. The only thing that caused my rating to be so low was the constant unnecessary fan-service. But that is just my personal tastes and I realize not a particularly popular one. If that really isn’t a problem for you then I would recommend this show. It’s an easy watch...without much thought required. without much thought required.', ""Hatsukoi Limited is a show wherein in they displayed the love life of different characters that are related to one another. there's no real focus but the story revolved around the group of girls and their siblings and colleagues. It was fun to watch from start to end, the story became more interesting towards the end. It showcased the reality of falling in love and the excitement as well as frustrations that comes with it.I would say that this anime is on point, looking back at my past journeys, there were a couple to several times i have experienced such heart beating/aching events. I cant...help but reminisce and laugh out loud as i watch the characters go thru this bitter sweet feeling called love.Just like in the anime, in reality most often than not, its just not meant to be and that one sided love will stay the same until you find someone who will return the favor. There will come a time that hate can be converted to love that can bloom into a beautiful relationship.I was able to feel the emotions in this anime and it made my heart flutter. I have to say this is one of the best romantic comedy animes of all time. And again what made this anime special and above others was the fact that it was able to make a lot of characters partake in a love story flawlessly and still had that impact.In addition, I have to give credits to the ending anime, it really went well with the anime and each of the episodes.

Blend S,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34618/Blend_S,"['What’s better than a cafe with delicious food? A cafe with cute girls to serve you of course! It gets even better. These girls have some exaggerated personalities. From sadistic to tsundere, it’s a place that really gives customers a hell of an experience. Blend S is honestly an anime that I found ridiculously fun to watch.Starting from the beginning, it shouldn’t take long for viewers to recognize that the anime has a lot of fun with itself. The selling point of show is the comedy as every main female characters’ personalities are beyond the normal norm. Honestly, I lost count how many times...I laughed in this show because how over the top it is. From Maika’s sadism to Miu’s older sister behavior, it’s a series that really became self-aware of its intentions. Indeed, Blend S’ storytelling isn’t accomplished through its plot. Every day consist of workplace sitcoms that cleverly delivers its humor. I’m also surprised how smooth the pacing the show felt. It felt like every episode is able to connect with each other and staying true to its premise and genres. The show doesn’t need to really rely on story at all to deliver satisfaction.Of course, it’s the characters that puts value into the comedy. Here’s the thing: the female characters that work there have some deceptive personalities. Maika is one of the guiltiest examples as she displays traits of sadism in almost every episode. Early impressions of Maika can be surprising as such a sweet innocent girl that can be deceptively sadistic on paper. The words she use and way she talks to her customers become a source of recurring humor. However, be aware that it’s pretty much a parody. Maika isn’t truly malevolent and actually worries about how to treat customers better. The way she snaps back to a more apologetic personality is infectiously amusing to watch. Then, there’s Kaho Hinata, a girl that plays the role of a tsundere. In truth, she’s not a tsundere although the anime really try to get her over as one. Mafuyu Hoshikawa brings in a feel of innocence because of her appearance although in truth, her age is older than she appears to be. In fact, she is one of the more mature characters in the show. This trio is mainly the core of the series that are able to capitalize their personality to astonishing levels.There are also some other characters that are worth taking notice too. This includes the inspiring idol trap Hideri Kanzaki and the older sister role model, Miu. Although not featured as prominently as the core characters, they still bring it a lot of personality. Through character chemistry, they bring a handful amount of colorful moments to the show that can be deceptively fun to watch. On the other hand, I can’t really say the guys in this anime are memorable. Dino and Koyou are the only two main guys although their role is portrayed more as side characters. They only shine best through character interactions with others (especially Maika and Dino) rather than by themselves. In fact, Dino is portrayed more as a butt monkey that no one can take seriously. This anime also does a fair amount of ship teasing between the cast although nothing really gets serious. Remember, it’s a show that make fun of the working environment. Working at a cafe is mostly seen as part of the blue collar occupation category yet this anime is able to bring the fun out of that. Also do note that the series does occasionally go beyond their restaurant such as the outdoors and even the beach.As a comedy-slice of life, I think Blend S simply did the best with what it had to work with. Some viewers will point fingers at the dead plot or repetitive jokes. However, I confess that it always feels refreshing to see a show like this step up to the plate. I’ve only read parts of the manga but to say the least, the anime captures the overall mood of the anime accurately and consistent with the character personalities. The way it expresses them is what really gives this show its meaningful value.I was surprised that A-1 Pictures were announced to be adapting this anime. It didn’t really fit with their style but thankfully, they manage to pull it off. For starters, Café Stile has a surprisingly amount of realism. If you ever walked into a café, then you would expect it to look something very similar to the one in this show. Then, there are the character designs. The waitresses in the show wear their work outfits with certain colors. It’s adorably charming and very fitting for a show especially since the waitresses are the main attraction. Character traits are also evident such as Maika’s height (and occasional ponytail hairstyle), Miu’s oneesama face, Kaho’s signature twin tails, or Hideri’s deceptive look. However, the biggest selling point of the visual style is the character expressions. It reflects the false personalities of the characters as parodies and works in wonder. Maika’s “sadistic” smirk and Kaho’s tsundere reactions are just a few examples. To say the least, A-1 Pictures convince me that they can handle a show like Blend S. Oh and there is some fan service but rather than adapting it in some alluring way, it’s used to portray the credibility of the setting.Oh boy, the OP song. “Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service” became a meme that went over. You can look up the song on Youtube or some popular video streaming site and see many parodies of it. Those words reflect the fake identity and personalities of the characters. Beyond that, I am also somewhat impressed by the character voices in this show. Maika in particular is noticeable for her ability to shift her tone of voice through certain frames. Miu’s oneesama voice gives off a mixture of mature and sexy vibe that is hard to ignore. Finally, there’s Hideri…and the character is really able to surprise you because of the voice.Blend S is hardly blend but instead takes great care of its characters. Through their personalities, they are able to sell the show’s immense amount of humor to viewers. Playing as characters that go against stereotypical archetypes isn’t easy but to me, Blend S really worked itself to accomplish that. I laughed in this show because how over the top it is.

We are Stile!Blend S is already one of my favourite SOL anime of all time due to its amazing characters, beautiful art and awesome soundtrack.The story first revolves around Maika and how she can't get a job due to her unnatural scary look. She comes across this cafe, but not just any cafe, this is a cafe out of the ordinary. Luckily for Maika, her unnatural scary look might come in handy. This cafe takes certain archetypes of characters and apply them to our main characters.Maika is supposed to act like the Sadist in the Cafe, in...this case, she can easily succeed in doing so without knowing it. Our beautiful character Kaho (Yunno, the one with huge boobs) is in charge of being the Tsundere. Hoshikawa has the Imouto role, Miu with the Older Sister role, and Hideki with the idol role.Seeing these types of characters in one single place working, you can see why I treasure this series. It's super funny and super adorable, and the opening is starting to become a meme.The story so far isn't too plot heavy ofc since it is an SOL series. However, it does kinda focus on Maika and her life at the Cafe and how she improves her Sadist character. While she does that there seems to be a click between her and the Manager. The manager is 26 and Maika is 16. So it's not like that can't work, I mean, a ten year difference??? Idk tho actually lol. They might fit some sort of romantic situation between the two, which is A Ok for me.Overall this series is super fun and the opening is amazing. This is recommended for anyone who enjoys workplace animes with amazing characters, fun interactions, and great comedy. You should watch this last after watching some heavy anime this fall. It would be a good way to end a nice Saturday. :) this case, she can easily succeed in doing so without knowing it.

Blend S doesn’t boast an intricate plot with elaborate detail and it quite frankly doesn’t need one to be successful. This is a very Sweet anime that managed to be enjoyable and consistently entertaining, which was honestly a Surprise to me since I didn't really have any expectations coming into this anime. Maika with her unintentionally Sadistic looks ended up being my favorite part of the show, though this doesn’t mean that she overshadowed the rest of the cast, who all managed to stand out in their own ways. Even the...really minor characters, like Maika’s Sister, had their moments. Overall, I’d have to say that A-1 pictures did a fine Service to the anime industry by releasing this show.The basic premise of the show is that a high school girl named Maika wants to get a job so she can pay for the expenses to study abroad. There’s just one problem; nobody wants to hire her because she has a naturally nasty look in her eyes. Feeling dejected, Maika’s fortune changes for the better when the Italian manager of Cafe Stile, Dino, hires her because she’d be perfect at playing a sadistic waitress in his restaurant. His strong penchant for dark haired Japanese girls also played a part in his hiring of Maika. Long story short, Maika finds success at her job and formulates strong friendships with her coworkers.Basically, each episode showcases different scenarios in which the characters end up in comedic situations. Now these types of shows can either be hits or misses. It ultimately depends on the quality of the characters and the jokes. Fortunately for Blend S, it got both departments right. Let’s briefly analyze the prominent characters to see why they positively contribute to the success of the show.Maika is the protagonist, and she really is a gentle and innocent girl. She wants to make customers smile and always tries to do her best. Though thanks to her menacing glare and awkwardness, she oftentimes ends up being a picture perfect sadist, much to her chagrin. Though its her unintentional tendency to act like a sadist that makes me and the customers at Cafe Stile adore her so. I was afraid that the emphasis on her vicious glare would end up getting old, but it actually didn’t. It was used in many different scenarios throughout the anime’s runtime that kept the humor revolving around it fresh and fun. Though she’s great on her own, what really makes her shine is her chemistry with the other characters, specifically Dino.Dino is the manager of Cafe Stile, and its very clear that he is a masochist (and a pervert in the eyes of his employees). He has a one sided love for Maika and has nosebleeds whenever she does something remotely cute. He’s actually one of the better male leads that I’ve seen in recent memory, because while many act too serious to be entertaining characters, Dino’s silliness makes him very fun to watch. Whether it be happily getting stepped on by Maika or failing to get his feelings across to her, Dino never failed to bring a smile to my face whenever he appeared on screen.Kaho acts as the tsundere at the cafe, though in reality she would be better described as a game addicted shut in. She’s a nice character, though I personally like her best when she interacts with Akizuki, the chef at the cafe. He’s also a recluse and has no experience with women, so his interactions with Kaho usually end up being both cute and comical. Mafuyu is the final original cast member and is the little sister at the cafe. When she works, she puts on a smile that could melt even the coldest of hearts and acts like a loving, bubbly imouto. However, she really is a 20 year old college student who rarely shows emotion. Its an amusing contrast, and since I’m a fan of both of her personality types, I ended up really liking her character.The other two characters worth giving a shoutout to are Miu and Hideri, who start working at the cafe in the latter portion of the anime. Miu is a dōjinshi artist and a pervert while Hideri is…well, lets just say that Hideri is the “surprise.” Now all of these characters are decent on their own, but  when blended together, they really stand out. They just compliment each other remarkably well, which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience.Blend S was refreshing. Many anime that I’ve seen recently have tried to construct an intricate story filled to the brim with “epic” plot twists and the like. While some succeed, many more ultimately fail, and watching them ends up becoming more of a chore than a pleasant viewing experience. With Blend S, I was able to relax and just enjoy some light hearted comedy, which can honestly be all that’s needed to make a show great. Blend S is by no means spectacular, but it's a nice show to watch if you just want to see some lighthearted fun. really minor characters, like Maika’s Sister, had their moments.

It\'s like they don\'t even try to hide it anymore.I originally started watching this solely because I\'ve been craving some good old CGDQT, and found out Sora Tokui was in the cast, so it seemed like a no brainer to give it a shot. I\'m glad I did, now I can move on - shame that I didn\'t get to see her character in action.This is supposed to be a comedy. I\'m sorry but I do not find excessive shouting to be hilarious, otherwise I would...be watching Black Clover. I find characters like Dino to be the most annoying pieces of work one can come across when watching anime. Other than that, despite having very few moments where one may smirk, the comedy as a whole falls horribly flat. Turns out relying on cringy otaku humor gets old after a while. Yes I get it, he stays up watching anime until it\'s late, and she likes going to the arcade, yes she has a mean glare and utters words that happen to luckily fit the \'sadistic\' shtick. It\'s cool. Don\'t get me wrong though, it can work with proper timing, better characters and a better straight man / tsukkomi, but that doesn\'t happen in here.This is supposed to be a slice of life. I cannot think of a single interaction in this show that was realistic. Not one. From the way they hire people, to the way the characters behave and react to pretty much anything. Yes I know there are actual weeb cafes in real life, but I\'m not talking about that. Nosebleeds, violence, manager getting yelled at by everyone, clients receiving garbage food and treatment yet enjoying it, sleeping in ones lap, manager passing out all over the place and people sitting / stomping on him, having dates and giving presents after knowing each other like a month at most. It all adds up until it kills any suspension of disbelief, something that is quite an achievement considering this is just a non-serious slice of life show, it still manages to do it. Congratulations Blend-S, you\'ve done the impossible.Characters are tropes, that\'s fine. They\'re alright for the most part. Maika is the \'normie\' and her sadistic trope gets overplayed to extremes in just 5 episodes. Kaho likes online games. Mafuyu is a deadpan loli with the classic \'looks 10 but is actually much older\' character ""trait"", she likes mahou shoujo. Miu(?) writes doujins. The green haired guy is probably the most bearable of all the characters. There isn\'t much to say about Dino. I didn\'t like Ouran High, and he reminds me a lot of the main blonde dude in there, who I also didn\'t like one bit. Seems petty, but I honestly find that kind of ""humor"" very annoying.Most of the times it will be:1. Female character (mostly Maika) does something.2. Dino gets swoon in moeness from it, proceeds to do something weird.3. Insert any of the other characters playing a rather poor tsukkomi role.It really gets tiring.Art is great as usual, A-1 pictures pays extra attention in making the characters have their conversations in the dressing room. I\'m no SJW so I don\'t care if they show skin, but damn, I do hate getting treated like those are the things that are supposed to get me to watch these shows in the first place. It\'s jarring and insulting. Add the usual jiggly physics, sexy costumes and interesting camera angles, and you have an A-1 pictures anime! Even if it doesn\'t fit the theme at all, they\'ll feed it to you, forcefully.Sound, OP and ED are... ok. I like how the ED seems to be updating as more characters are introduced. Voice acting, it shows that Maika\'s VA is pretty much a newbie. Much like Dino, she\'s always almost-shouting, and her delivery seems very inconsistent. I\'m no VA expert, but that much I could tell at least. Other characters are alright.I bought into the hype, guys. I thought this was gonna be an interesting ride but boy was I mistaken. To be quite frank, the humor present in many of the shows that I actually enjoyed mostly wasn\'t laugh-out-loud worthy, but at least it was bearable even at the times where the jokes fell short. Why? because the characters actually carried those shows. I don\'t recommend watching this, even if you\'re a Sora Tokui fan. be watching Black Clover. I find characters like Dino to be the most annoying pieces of work one can come across when watching anime. Other than that, despite having very few moments where one may smirk, the comedy as a whole falls horribly flat. Turns out relying on cringy otaku humor gets old after a while. Yes I get it, he stays up watching anime until it\'s late, and she likes going to the arcade, yes she has a mean glare and utters words that happen to luckily fit the \'sadistic\' shtick. It\'s cool. Don\'t get me wrong though, it can work with proper timing, better characters and a better straight man / tsukkomi, but that doesn\'t happen in here.This is supposed to be a slice of life. I cannot think of a single interaction in this show that was realistic. Not one. From the way they hire people, to the way the characters behave and react to pretty much anything. Yes I know there are actual weeb cafes in real life, but I\'m not talking about that. Nosebleeds, violence, manager getting yelled at by everyone, clients receiving garbage food and treatment yet enjoying it, sleeping in ones lap, manager passing out all over the place and people sitting / stomping on him, having dates and giving presents after knowing each other like a month at most. It all adds up until it kills any suspension of disbelief, something that is quite an achievement considering this is just a non-serious slice of life show, it still manages to do it. Congratulations Blend-S, you\'ve done the impossible.Characters are tropes, that\'s fine. They\'re alright for the most part. Maika is the \'normie\' and her sadistic trope gets overplayed to extremes in just 5 episodes. Kaho likes online games. Mafuyu is a deadpan loli with the classic \'looks 10 but is actually much older\' character ""trait"", she likes mahou shoujo. Miu(?) writes doujins. The green haired guy is probably the most bearable of all the characters. There isn\'t much to say about Dino. I didn\'t like Ouran High, and he reminds me a lot of the main blonde dude in there, who I also didn\'t like one bit.

Can anyone even have common sense? 10 years difference in age, like what the fuck? Honestly tried so hard to get though a ep and managed to get by because of the other characters and now where I'm at, theres a whole ep for this shitty 10 years difference pedo ship. Imagine a 26 year old getting a boner at a 16 year old, wouldn't that be creepy as fuck? Well that is what is happening is this perfectly good moe anime that would of made me finish it if it wasn't for the pedo guy. Dropped it. "", 'There are six words starting with ""S"" you should remember, plus another word starting with ""S"" you have to add to make it an internet pride.""Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service"" -  these are the holy words that starts with ""S"" that summarizes the whole anime itself. I was wondering why its called ""Blend S"".... Now when I finished it, my first guess was correct (though this is my opinion only).  A mix of attributes of the characters. Words that starts with ""S"" that characters are assigned to.  Blend S is an anime this Fall 2017 that offers us a cafe...that have the employees acting like anime characters. Though this cafe is not an ordinary cafe you always go to like Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The cafe is called ""Cafe Stile"", owned by an Italian manager. A crazy one. The staff composes of 5 girls and 2 boys (4 girls and 3 boys specifically when you watched it). Maika, the clumsy employee who smile in a sadist way, which makes the people keep on going in there (along with the manager liking her so much).Kaho, the gamer who blushes to customers... Basically she\'s a tsundere...Mafuyu, the most smallest one, though the most mature one in concept. Although on service, she is the ""imouto"" type (little sister). Well she is technically a dangerous loli. Miu, a doujinshi author who.. writes those stuffs and have imagination like those. She is the ""Onee-san"" type (big-sister) who always seduce the customers (not in a bad way though). Hideri, the ""suprise"" character from the six words. She is the ""idol"" type who always wants to step on stage to reveal her cuteness (i dont know if I should put ""she"" or ""he"" on this person). Then comes the boys which are Dino, the manager and Kouyou, the shut-in gamer but the one who always helps Dino.Story:The story follows Maika, who recently got employed in a cafe. A weird cafe. That is the starting of the story of Blend S. We were shown that Maika will be one of the main focus on the plot and as the episode goes the story revolves not only to Maika but the other staff of Cafe Stile as well.With all of them getting screentime on almost every episode, it is reassuring that all of them have important roles to the progression of the plot up to the ending. I\'m going to tell you this. Blend S\' focus (On my opinion) of the story or product of it is quite difficult to understand. Summarizing it is possible but not quite easy as each episode is like this episode happens on the other day while this happened on that day etc etc. Or should I say in safer side, the story goes in random places though there are a linkage on some episode... Although I can see as a random anime full of colors, there is one obvious good thing that this anime offers. We see this thing on every characters especially the main girls of the series. They have different traits, though this trait doesnt really show them what they are at homes, school or online. Right.. This girls offers us that a person can be sweet, loving or a tsundere but only on the outside. What matters most is on the inside. We have seen characters revealing theretrue identity behind doors of the cafe. They always have hidden things lying in the hearts of them and this things should never be taken light of outside. It is with their own privacy although all of them seems fine showing it to other staff members (as I guess they are friends). Although this inside traits cannot be fulfilled on strangers. Why? The answer is work itself.Many people tend to have different personalities either they are at school, work and especially at home. Everyone wears a mask outside and pulls it out at home. All of us have unique personalities that not even our parents know about. It is a matter of being human. It\'s life. Here on this anime we saw the struggles of Maika of how can she express her natural emotions to be appealing to customer. Turns out her sadistic side is very pleasable to the folks of the cafe as well as the other characters. Each one have secrets that they do not reveal often to strangers but to those only for their friends. Those who can trust him/her. For example, it is stated in an episode with Mafuyu (when someone asked Mafuyu to go on a date) that no one will like her if the customer will know the truth. People like her for having a childish personality, though she is sure that no one will like her if she shows her true attitude. Blend S gives us a trip to a happy, cheerful and joyful anime, though have some hidden values regarding their own personal roles.Characters:There are limited characters here on the story. You can count the characters by your fingers I bet, though this gives this anime an advantage. English teachers will always say that when writing a story, the fewer the characters, the easy and good the story will be. Though the characters of Blend S are not few or not more (its in between), this gives the author as well as the director a good screentime for every character. Come up with a good situation that the character will participate then finish. I already explained the main ones though there are still some like \'Owner\' (the dog) and Maika\'s brother and sister. There is really not much of an importance to this characters but there is one. It gives information to the characters involved with it. Sure the dog is for Maika and Dino and Maika\'s brother and sister is for Maika. What about the others? Well, simple. Others will share. For example, Kaho behind the scenes is a shut-in gamer. This attitude applies to Kouyou also so both of them have sharing traits. Miu writes doujins so she knows those things. There is an episode when Kouyou stopped her to say a word that doesnt know the meaning by the other characters so they share personlities as well. Mafuyu\'s scene with Kaho having study sessions also shows that Mafuyu has an attitude of a mother then Hideri being the idol is very obvious that she wants to stand out more. Finally there\'s Dino, whom we all know the personality because of his persevarance and so much love sick to Maika.  All of the are on phase and makes the anime watchable.Art:There\'s nothing really to talk about with the art here. I can describe the art like a white light going into a triangular glass prism then divides into different colors. Thus, the art is like painting. Lots of colors though its rather simple. Its appeal to the audience is fine and pleasant.Sound:You know the opening is already good when it turns into something that the people of the internet will be happy on. The ending is quite unique as it features chibi characters which is cute and nice on my perspective.Overall thoughts and Enjoyment:I am not a fan of this type of anime out there, though I have to be honest that I enjoyed watching it. We encountered different traits of the characters reflecting different anime personalities, as well as their hidden personalities relating to our real life attitude at work, school or at home.Therefore, I recommend you to watch it as its score for me is decent.

This show has truly been doing its best out of what a cute-girls-4koma adaption could possibly do in every aspect.Before I dig deeper, let me share some fun I found on Blend S\'s official website first. This thing - The Maika\'s Maika-lendar - has somehow become my daily motivation xDhttp://blend-s.jp/cp/calendar/STORY = 7/10. This is a little more than your typical cute-girls slice-of-life. It has good comedy with a touch of romance, along with interesting character motives and backstory. I especially like how they handled the comedy. We have the main girl, clueless and innocent, with her expressive vs. natural character problem....Other girls and guys with their own switches to flip. All that contrast created a minefield full of misunderstandings and gags.ART = 7/10. A bright and fluffy-feeling colour pallette. Cute but somehow cliched character designs. Nothing special, really. You might\'ve seen this style all over the place already, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s bad. The animating is slightly well done imo. In addition, at times you\'ll be rewarded with Aiura-tier thighs. Oh how I wanna bury my face in them.SOUND = 8/10. Character\'s voices suit them so well it hurts. Well there\'s this cast full of rising stars as well as skillful famous veterans afterall. So far soundtrack doesn\'t really have much impact. However they have really good OP/ED songs. Personally I think Blend S\'s OP is the second best this season (after Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoko\'s).CHARACTER = 9/10. The best part about this anime. Foremost, cute girls equipped with well-portraited characteristics and resonable amount of moe (this is important). Second, the guys. I mean, actually funny and interesting guys among cute girls? A rare sight. These guys should be put under national protection. They\'re all somewhat special because each one has not only one, but two ""attributes"" to their characteristics. Moreover, almost every character is an otaku to some points. Not creepy (like me for example), but enthusiastic and lovely otakus. It\'d be way too easy to simpathize with them if you\'ve had a bit of knowledge about anime/manga/doujin industry.ENJOYMENT = 9/10. Yes, I might have favoured this show a bit since I\'m a fan of CGDCT and slice-of-life. But I think Blend S is good both in its own genre as well as in general. It should be easy to tell from the recommendations section, that if you\'ve enjoyed Working!\'s comedic story telling and unique characters or GochiUsa\'s relaxing vibe and gorgeus artwork, then Blend S would much likely be your cup of tea. And also, cameos await.Well yes, I did enjoy this anime very much. I did admit that Maika-lendar has become my daily motivation. But it\'s not like something inside me has been awakened or anything. I certainly feel nothing over having Maika-sama steps on my face, or glares upon me disgustingly as if she were looking at a squished cockcroach. Being honest here. Trust me.

Trust me.', '*insert original ""S"" joke*Blend S is A-1\'s attempt at making Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu Ka?, and it\'s a fair attempt, that falls short because of the bland unlikable characters, unlike the characters of GochiUsa. I had high hopes for Blend S, I thought it would be the first A-1 show that I actually like, but sadly, I was wrong.Story: 3/10What story? Do you really think A-1 would try to compliment this show with an overarching story like the one in New Game? A story in a Slice of Life CGDCT show is something that can make said show even better, because the events happening compliment...each other instead of being random one-shot episodes. Blend S does not have a story. It tried to, with various character introductions that come later on in the show and the last """"""confession"""""" episode, but it fails at doing so.Basically, Blend S goes as following: Character introduction>episode dedicated to the character>random episode>character introduction>rinse repeat. This would be fine if the characters in the show were actually charismatic and fun, which they are not, something I\'ll address in the Character section.The humor in Blend S relies mainly on visual gags. It\'s the typical humor you\'d expect from a CGDCT show. It\'s boring, unoriginal, and didn\'t make me laugh a single time. Although, I wasn\'t really expecting high comedic value out of a show like this.All in all, Blend S presents episodic stories that could only be interesting or fun to watch to the crowd that enjoyed Gabriel Dropout earlier this year.Art: 7/10For once A-1 do not have a noticeable animation drop in their show. The art style is similar to the one in Eromanga-sensei. It\'s simple and ""gets the job done"", after all, I wouldn\'t be expecting a memorable art style from a CGDCT A-1 show.Sound: 5/10The opening is catchy, especially since the ""Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise"" sequence made itself into a meme. What this shows suffers on is the unremarkable voice acting. Aside from Hideri who is voiced by the one and only Tokui Sora (Nico Yazawa\'s voice actor), who did an amazing job at her role of sounding like a girl and a boy at the same time, the rest of the cast is quite bland and doesn\'t really stand out.Character: 2/10Good thing that Kaho exists, because dear lord the rest of the cast was painful to watch. The cast would be fine if this show were a short, because the characters wouldn\'t get boring by episode 6, but the same cannot be said for a full 12 episode show. As you\'d expect from the premise of the show, every character is reduced to 1 or 2 traits. These traits are kept as they are since episode 1, and get little to no development. If every character was introduced in episode 1, you could literally watch every episode in the order you liked. Worst part, is that one of my favourite character types, the onee-san, ended up being sidelined, and thus, being bland.The problem here is the untapped potential of the situation the characters are being put into. Personally, watching Blend S, I expected that at some moment the theme of ""faking character"" was to be brought up, you know, ""Forgetting their own personality because they have to fake one for the job they have to do"". This theme would make for some interesting character interactions and/or development, but apparently this was too much effort for the scriptwriters.Enjoyment: 3/10I gradually started watching this show just for the moments with Akizuki and Kaho. Since the show is way too centered around Maika than it should be, if you do not like Maika, you won\'t enjoy the show.Overall: 3/10Blend S should truly just be called ""Bland S""If you\'re part of the crowd that enjoys shows with zero character development and no plot like Gabriel Dropout, go ahead and watch Blend S, as you\'d surely enjoy it.Would I recommend Blend S?Just go watch GochiUsa. each other instead of being random one-shot episodes.

This is a really great anime to relief stress after going home from work yourself.Story is easy to follow because there aren't like big plot or something. Just some schoolgirl doing a part time job...to go overseas. The shenanigan Cafe Stile produce is so entertaining to not make it a boring anime, considering this anime premise is not engaging. Every episode filled with hillarious moment. And the joke delivery is on point. I never gone an episode without laughing. One problem tho. The only thing that makes the story looks like progressing is when they introduce a character. So when an episode doesnt introduce characters, it feels like just exist to fill the 12 episode count. Because there are hardly any meaningful story at all.The series also does a great job of introducing the other characters and their roles at the café. Each character has their own unique personality and backstory, and the series does a great job of exploring them. The anime OP point that out. Everyone except the cook have 2 personality. What I love about it even more is they're not perfect. So we can relate to them, its a hospitality job after all. Sometimes their true personality slipped out in front of customers. Always interesting to watch them interact with each other in the backrooms, their rich personality and the context given. The series also does a good job of balancing the comedy with more serious and heartfelt moments, making it an enjoyable watch throughout.The animation is of course a good quality, with detailed and expressive character designs. The voice acting need to be praised too, with the actors bringing the characters to life in a charming and humorous way. Not to mention they also sing the OP and ED song. Both of it are in my playlist now. Most of the time, its all takes place inside a room. And when they go outside. They didn't miss the opportunity to make the background so beautiful.Really enjoy this anime, definitely will rewatch this in near future. Oh yeah and read the manga too. This anime is so iconic with that OP. There are tons of people creating memes with various scene and characters, which makes it even more popular. I decided to watch this anime because me myself get my first job too. Although it is not a part time work. I can relate and relax watching it after my 12 hour shift.

A phrase commonly used by my friend to show interest, love and compasion for a certain someone or something. I can assure you that I am not lying when I say that the amount of bdogs that I popped was over the count of 3 while viewing this anime. If you desire to be overwhelmed with different characters all while being dressed up as maids with some slick animation, oh boy, this is the anime for you. Speaking of characters, the charactersitics that come along with them are nonetheless...refreshing. Each one bringing a new feature to the table whether it be sadistic or tsundere. It may be a slice of life but I feel as if you are given the full cake, my dude. When it comes to comedy, Blend S does it perfectly. The comedic aspects always left a smile on the face, a slap on the knee and a bdog in the pants.

Beyond the pedophile manager’s (aged 26) attraction to the mc Maika (aged 16), the anime fails to go anywhere in terms of plot despite introducing multiple new characters throughout the season. Despite being a moe anime with constant attempts to break the fourth wall to appeal to ‘otaku’ viewers, the jokes play on overused tropes and come off as cringe-worthy. It’s characters, each with their own ‘gimmick’ and role they play at the café, experience no character development, growth or change. Coupled with...the fact that the plot itself doesn’t go anywhere, the whole anime feels like a series of filler episodes from start to finish. If you skipped this anime back in 2017, it probably isn’t worth your time picking it up now. the fact that the plot itself doesn’t go anywhere, the whole anime feels like a series of filler episodes from start to finish.

Make no mistake, the show is a witty comedy first and a SoL second. If I had to say something bad about Blend-S it would be the plot. Like any other SoL there isn't a sense of anything important happening anytime soon, expect a ton of pointless goofing off. Music has a very smooth selection of instruments (like you'd see at a real cafe) that are low-key and relaxing, though a bit underwhelming.Pieces are overly simple in my opinion, though fitting. If I had to say something good...about Blend-S it would be the comedy. Brilliant lines are delivered with a great deal of personality. The voice acting and lines combine for a surprisingly funny experience. Visuals are well above average. Everything from backgrounds, to character art, and animation are very pleasing and well detailed. The fast paced episode format is very entertaining, never slowing down for a second of idle, dry dialogue. It will definitely remind you of the 4-panel slapstick comedy manga style.Overall there are some weaknesses, but as long as you're in this for the comedic content it is quite satisfying.

Although I did get this, many factors that comprise this show make it a lot worse than it actually could have been.Story 3/10: Not much to expect story-wise from a show about girls working in a cafe. Overall, not a good story, but this show was never meant to have a deep story anyways. Because of this, the story of the show will not have a major part in the overall score of this review.Art 7/10: The characters are very easy to look at and each have their...own design. The differing color schemes in each character make the character designs somewhat unique. The backgrounds for this show are usually bright and well detailed. However, the art can get a bit lazy regarding background characters, as they are not detailed or shaded in the slightest.Sound 8/10: The OP is very catchy, and has spread across the internet of late. The background songs are also well-fitting for the scenarios.Character 3/10: The characters in this show are very copy-paste, with no development what-so-ever. They are all very standard and stereotypical characters with little to them outside of their ""roles"" in the cafe. Maika is an aspiring world-traveler, who is looking for a job, but cannot get one because of her ""evil-glare"", which is made to be much worse than it actually is. Because of this she is the ""sadist"" in the cafe, who is somehow bad at her job and doesn\'t do it half of the time. Kaho is the ""gamer-girl"" who wastes all her money and time playing games and is a tsundere at the cafe. Nothing much else there. Mafuyu is the college-age midget, who beats up on Dino and plays the ""little sister"" role. Miu is an author who works at the cafe for ""inspiration"" in the doujinshi she writes. She plays the big sister. Dino is the foreign manager pervert guy, who lusts over Maika every episode and barely does his job. Koyo is the cuckold, girl-on-girl liking cook, who is afraid of women. Hideri is the idol, who has more secrets than I or anybody else wanted to know.

Blend S is not a good show that explores the human psyche but it neither is an insultingly bad show or one that is boring. I think the main Issue is that the show isn’t really capturing the zeitgeist of slice of life and decided to be kind of dull. Slice of Life anime’s are about growth and character interaction. This show is completely one note in that regard. None of them felt like they grown as a character or have that much of an...interesting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely. Of course this isn’t to say that all slice of life should be about growth theres plenty out there that is good that isn’t “Mangaka and His Assistant”, “D-Frag” or “Oshiete Galko-Chan” are prime examples of that. But those shows are far funnier and had some interesting dynamics in the show that kept it above from the rest.Blend S is an anime based on the manga of the same name. The show is similar to Working and Is This Order a Rabbit, where it is mostly work slice of life that takes place in a café/restaurant. The show centres around Maika a High School girl, who got a job in a “wacky maid café” where all the girls plays an anime quirk whetter it’s tsundere, little sister, or an Idol.  Which is an interesting concept and they even played with it being that the jokes centre in their clashing personality of each of the character and the quirk they play. Kaho is a sweet heart who has to play a tsundere, Mafuyu is a stone faced mature 20 year old who has to play a little sister etc etc. This is all fine and good but though I chuckle and even laugh once or twice, a level of growth or anything interesting done with it. The jokes in the end were just “ HAHAHA KAHO HAS TITS” or “HAHAHAHAH MAFUYU IS A LOLI”. Which plays in the biggest issue this show has the show lacked so much personality. Though I think the characters are fine, I feel a majority is kind of one note the exception being Mafuyu and Maika.  The are a lot of wasted potential here an example would be Kaho and Akizuki, who are shown to have somewhat an on screen romance, but it never went anywhere. Akizuki is a fish eyed weeb whos awkward around women and Kaho is a cheerful beautiful weeb who spends all of her time playing games but is also a massive scaredy cat. They did play with it here and there. But they were forgettable, and the dialogue they share wasn’t interesting. It wasn’t, as funny and intelligent like in Lucky Star where the dialogue felt like satire or as memorable and cutthroat like in Bakemonogatari. Overall it just felt dull. The main character though not completely one note didn’t really grow on me, she was the most boring character I the fray. As her arch of wanting to learn about other culture was barely mentioned and her romance with the manager Dino which had some pretty funny moments such as when Dino was arrested for when he got to close to Maika. Felt manufactured, its your typical “Oh he’s in love with me…. Oh I’m tooo dense to notice hahahah tehehe~” It was disappointing to say the least. The show could have benefited greatly if it stopped emulating popular tropes and instead playing around with it. The beach episode was one of the worst beach episodes; it was just dull and insultingly boring, the side characters were also a huge let down. To the shows credit however, I want bored at least not all the time. Most of the time I feel the show had a little bit charm into it, its dull and repetitive with them repeating the same joke just with a little variety. But part of it has grown on me and some episodes aren’t as bad as the others. I like the part where Mafuyu talks about relationship and her interaction with the cast. I think Kaho and Akizuki though I’ve mention to be kind off dull. I think has some potential into it.Animation wise, its pretty, A1 picture the cancer of the studio they are can make some good visuals, though not very interesting it’s at least pleasing to the eyes. I particularly like how they animate Mafuyu and Hideri. Character design wise ill give them prop a majority of them I do like. Mafuyu, Maika and Kaho are pretty design though a little uninspired they have interesting facial expressions and overall I find kind of a good blend (Pun not intended) of interesting design choices. Note Kaho is like incredibly hot and Mafuyu is like incredibly cute while Maika is kind of a sweet spot design where it just kind of works.Music wise its……. serviceable no pun intended. Though its not all over the place like some other A1 shows, it’s definitely not catchy or memorable. It goes for the OP and E. D was kind of disappointed I expected better. Voice acting is pretty good; it features a lot of newcomers, though I do feel the Seiyou for Akizauki and Miu can pretty bad. With Miu a lot of the times I kind of wished she more of memorable voiced, but in the end it felt so boring and even when she’s being a perv she doesn’t really do much with her vocal range. With Akizuki it was ok but anyone could have played this role. If this anime’s goal was to build new seiyou stars, then it failed. None but a few of the cast really showed their range or show how unique their voice. I think the show could have benefited from having Veteran seiyous on the show voicing the supporting characters.Is it a bad show definitely not there’s moments that I genuinely laugh or even chuckle a little. There’s no one particularly annoying or even insultingly bad. The show is not great or even good. But its definitely not a bad time waster or a good laugh or even an introduction to slice of life that isn’t too slow….. Just don’t expect to come out of it completely satisfied. The show was too busy emulating what was popular it never became it’s own thing and if it wasn’t for the Meme it spawned I don’t think anyone would bat an eye watching it. I came in the show with low expectation and I wasn’t blown away but I wasn’t horrified with what I find. Overall it’s ok; personally check out the show I mention in the first paragraph instead, but if you find the show entertaining I get it, the wacky and warm setting is still welcomed but in the sea of anime this is one that isn’t special or anything. I’m feeling a decent 5 to a Hard 5 on this.Best Girl: Mafuyu Hoshikawa (Will actually waifu)Best Boy: Akizuki KouyouBest Episodes: Episode 10, 8, 5, 3Worst Episode: Episode 7, 115/10 interesting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely.

It does a great job of incorporating comedy routines in the show, so your always laughing. While each character is strictly archetypal, with not too much personal depth, they combine together very well with the well-written script and comedy.  To me personally, I enjoyed the show so much with its romance-comedy aspects that I don\'t even care about how ""deep"" the characters are. I also want to add that I find the art used in Blend S stunning.I love the romance comedy that is...Blend S, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is just looking for a lighthearted anime to watch. Its funny, pretty, but most of all enjoyable. Watch Blend S! Blend S, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is just looking for a lighthearted anime to watch. Its funny, pretty, but most of all enjoyable. Watch Blend S!', 'Spoiler-free review incoming.To note: Blend S is an anime adaptation of a manga series by the same name. The following review is based off the merits of the show as an anime, and the existence of the source material will be ignored.The Premise:Blend S is a wonderful show that follows the adventures of Maika, a girl who has a naturally scary face due to her eyes, and her friends and co-workers at the themed cafe, Stile. The cafe is themed so that every waitress has a ""character"" to play to entertain the guests.The Story:Blend S is structured so that each episode has its own little...story or two to tell. As such, there\'s not really a large overarching plot. There is, however, and overarching theme that is present throughout the show, and that is purely a story of friendship and relationships. As the show progresses, we see more of how the characters interact with one another, and how their involvement with each other might have caused them to change over time.The individual stories we see in each episode, however, are not to be ignored. They\'re all quirky and downright enjoyable. Truly a comedic slice of life with some substance.The Characters:In Blend S, each character has their own personality that is unique to them, as well as the ""character"" they have to play for work at the cafe. Maika is a sweet and innocent girl who plays a ""sadistic"" role as a waitress, with varying levels of difficulty, of course. Due to her normally sweet disposition, she often has trouble being sadistic when she puts effort into it, but funnily enough has no trouble at all being sadistic by accident. Her friend Kaho is another girl Maika\'s age who is really into playing video games and plays a ""tsundere"" character for the cafe. Serious college student Mafuyu plays an""imouto"" character in a complete 180 from her usual disposition. Miu is a teenaged adult manga artist who ends up playing a...questionable ""onee-san"" character. And Hideri shows up to play a very energetic ""idol"" character. Along with Akizuki the chef and Dino the Manager who are both otakus, we have a wonderfully quirky cast to follow.The characters don\'t necessarily receive large amounts of development all throughout the show, but they all have a few episodes where they really get to shine. We get to learn more about these characters, and they often times learn lessons, leading to some amount of development as time goes on.The Art:The art of Blend S is right up A-1 Pictures\' alley. All of the characters are distinct and have a very typical A-1 style. If you generally like their art, you\'ll probably like the art in this show. The colors are bright and vibrant. The animation is nothing mind blowing, but you generally don\'t see any mind blowing animation in slice of life shows, anyway. It\'s overall very solid in that regard.The Sound:To start with the voice acting, I have not seen the English dub of the show, so I can\'t speak on that front. As for the Japanese VAs, I feel that they all were able to solidly nail the personalities of the characters they voiced, even more so because some of them had essentially two characters to voice depending on the cafe character associated with their main role. The background soundtrack was nice and nothing was overbearing. Of special note, of course, is the show\'s opening, Bon Appétit, which was catchy and entertaining enough to spawn the ""S Stands For..."" meme that overtook the internet for a short bit.The Conclusion:Blend S was fantastically quirky and enjoyable. The cute characters always managed to find themselves in entertaining situations, and the ""characters"" they had to play always gave a reason to laugh. Admittedly, I would have liked to see more of the actual cafe work so we could see more of those ""characters,"" but I still enjoyed what we got. The individual stories were all fun, and I really like the show overall. I would certainly give this delightful show a watch if you\'re wanting a nice slice of life comedy.As a side note, however, if you\'re not a fan of fanservice, you might want to evaluate whether or not this is something out of the realm of possibility. This show does have some fanservice in there. But as someone who doesn\'t find needless fanservice appealing, I didn\'t mind anything so much in Blend S. I feel in the instances where it existed it served a purpose, and nothing was over the top or anything like that.And now a recommendation for your alternate viewing pleasure. If you just so happened to enjoy Blend S, I would send you to take a look at Wagnaria, also known as working. It\'s another show placed in the setting of a restaurant, but it has more of an overarching story and the characters are just as quirky. Really enjoyable show.Thanks for reading. o/ story or two to tell. As such, there\'s not really a large overarching plot. There is, however, and overarching theme that is present throughout the show, and that is purely a story of friendship and relationships. As the show progresses, we see more of how the characters interact with one another, and how their involvement with each other might have caused them to change over time.The individual stories we see in each episode, however, are not to be ignored. They\'re all quirky and downright enjoyable. Truly a comedic slice of life with some substance.The Characters:In Blend S, each character has their own personality that is unique to them, as well as the ""character"" they have to play for work at the cafe. Maika is a sweet and innocent girl who plays a ""sadistic"" role as a waitress, with varying levels of difficulty, of course. Due to her normally sweet disposition, she often has trouble being sadistic when she puts effort into it, but funnily enough has no trouble at all being sadistic by accident. Her friend Kaho is another girl Maika\'s age who is really into playing video games and plays a ""tsundere"" character for the cafe. Serious college student Mafuyu plays an""imouto"" character in a complete 180 from her usual disposition. Miu is a teenaged adult manga artist who ends up playing a...questionable ""onee-san"" character. And Hideri shows up to play a very energetic ""idol"" character. Along with Akizuki the chef and Dino the Manager who are both otakus, we have a wonderfully quirky cast to follow.The characters don\'t necessarily receive large amounts of development all throughout the show, but they all have a few episodes where they really get to shine. We get to learn more about these characters, and they often times learn lessons, leading to some amount of development as time goes on.The Art:The art of Blend S is right up A-1 Pictures\' alley. All of the characters are distinct and have a very typical A-1 style. If you generally like their art, you\'ll probably like the art in this show. The colors are bright and vibrant. The animation is nothing mind blowing, but you generally don\'t see any mind blowing animation in slice of life shows, anyway. It\'s overall very solid in that regard.The Sound:To start with the voice acting, I have not seen the English dub of the show, so I can\'t speak on that front. As for the Japanese VAs, I feel that they all were able to solidly nail the personalities of the characters they voiced, even more so because some of them had essentially two characters to voice depending on the cafe character associated with their main role. The background soundtrack was nice and nothing was overbearing. Of special note, of course, is the show\'s opening, Bon Appétit, which was catchy and entertaining enough to spawn the ""S Stands For..."" meme that overtook the internet for a short bit.The Conclusion:Blend S was fantastically quirky and enjoyable. The cute characters always managed to find themselves in entertaining situations, and the ""characters"" they had to play always gave a reason to laugh. Admittedly, I would have liked to see more of the actual cafe work so we could see more of those ""characters,"" but I still enjoyed what we got. The individual stories were all fun, and I really like the show overall. I would certainly give this delightful show a watch if you\'re wanting a nice slice of life comedy.As a side note, however, if you\'re not a fan of fanservice, you might want to evaluate whether or not this is something out of the realm of possibility.

Whether they can be enjoyable to watch or not is anyone’s prerogative. But how often do we get these shows? Entirely too often, in my opinion. With that said, when one of them clicks, they become a worthwhile, laugh-out-loud experience.Blend S proved to be the funniest slice of life anime of 2017. It comes down to the jokes, characters, comedic situations, and dialogue. These aspects meld together successfully to make an enjoyable anime that pulls off even the most stereotypical jokes that have become...a staple in anime of this nature to the point of mockery. So how do each of these four aspects work great with each other?For starters, the jokes are very quirky and over-the-top. If you aren’t a fan of that style of humor, then Blend S may prove to be difficult to muster. It isn’t incredibly over-the-top like Seto no Hanayome or, more recently, Himouto Umaru-chan. It’s over-the-top when it needs to be. Whenever the animation switches from the standard designs of the characters to the dis-formed, chibi-like art style, that is where the comedy shines brightly. Thanks to its hilarious-looking art style and great performances by the main cast, most of the jokes hit than miss in every which way. A few times, they repeat the same jokes, and they do not necessarily hit as hard as they did the first time, but they don’t completely sour the experience too much.The characters each have a distinct characteristic that gives them a unique feel to one another. Sure they aren’t anything new to see, but Blend S knows this and plays around with these stereotypes for us to laugh at and marvel at how it treats them. However, they don’t just treat them as stereotypes and nothing more. That would make them seem hollow and uninteresting. They still have a bit of depth to them in terms of how they portray their distinct quirks with each episodic theme they are put into. All of the voice actors play a significant role in this success. The biggest highlight of the cast would have to be Azumi Waki as Maika. She can portray a female character with a darling personality without it being too sugary for some, with the dark, sadistic side to counteract it to balance it out; hopefully, she will get a ton of more lead roles after this one.While each character holds themselves up tremendously, what sells this show significantly is the chemistry between them. It is always a blast to watch an episode and see what kind of things they will say to one another or what type of situation one gets into and how the others will react to it. The dialogue plays a part in this success and also comedic timing. There have been times when I went crazy with laughter at what characters say to each other and their reactions. Especially with the character, Dino, who is played masterfully by Tomoaki Maeno, who you can tell is having a blast playing as him. Whenever Dino and Maika are on-screen together, it almost always ends with someone having a cramp from hysterical laughing.I have mentioned before how art design and animation play a huge role in magnifying the show's humor. Looking at it beyond that, it’s a relatively simple-looking anime. Nothing stands out as anything eye-catching to write home about. Nevertheless, simplicity does not always mean a negative in some cases. Especially regarding the slice of life shows which can be limited to how you can animate them. What does out is how beautiful the colors are in the background and characters. All of the characters have a great look and make them shine to grab your attention.A feel-good anime is something anyone would love to see now and again. Blend S is one that I think fits that description accurately. There is no tough melodrama involved, no violence, no sharp conflict, and no significant threat looming in the shadows. Just an anime, you can pop up at any time and feel good the following day. Ain’t nothing wrong with that.Grade: A- a staple in anime of this nature to the point of mockery.

Sounds like a perfect utopia to me, but what do I know. The anime in general has a fresh touch of all of them combined. All of them well mixed to the story, brought out with the art, sound and characters for the maximum enjoyment. (Friendly reminder - the following is purely based on my opinion).• Long story short, the story is great. It\'s like a revamped version of all our loved and...stale anime series. It had the story that you\'d expect from an anime that looks like this, but it has extra spice. Spice that just makes it perfect, in a way that you know you shouldn\'t like it, but you still do. In summary, it has everything that you could ask for, plus more - it\'s a perfect dealio. There were moments where it was getting a bit repetitive, but it was overlapped by new and surprising (semi-)funny skits and scenes, which made it exxxtra enjoyable.I rate the story 8/10• The art is amazing - it brought out the characters and their specialties really well. From their cute looks to sadistic eyesights - it managed to show the emotions in every situation. Different scenes had different feels to it, thanks to it being animated with different and variating styles. Also I have to mention that the background imagery was veri gud, having it\'s own style of ""sketched""/unfinished characters on the background. One would argue that it\'s laziness, but it honestly fits and onlyI rate the art 9/10.• There isn\'t too much to say about sounds. It was good as expected. It had quality voice acting and music to back it up - Pretty gud overall.I rate the sounds 8/10.• I personally absolutely loved the characters and the design of them. It had something for every taste - big titties for normies, cute looks for weebs, a loli for perverts and last but not least, a trap for dem geis. Every single one of them looked according to their role and had their ""special personality"" (which really was the main point of the anime). The way that they all had different personalities and the play on differencing \'real\' and \'staged\', really made the anime, what it is - a semi-masterpiece.Really loved the characters - I rate them 10/10.• Enjoyment - I absolutely loved its fun way to bring out different styles and personalities. Honestly surprised how this overmemed and simple looking anime about a cafe could bring me this much enjoyment.Personally, I really enjoyed watching it - I rate the enjoyment 9/10.Overall - Blend S is overall lovely.

The usual  anime stereotypes :tsundere, imouto, sadistic,trap etc. are well used for the ironic comedy in this anime.Don't be fooled by the cute girls and moe atmosphere its content has a lot to offer.The story is set in a cafe were a bunch of cute girls who let's say have a unique personality work, using their other personality trait to please the needs of customers.Despite having a moe atmosphere overall the final product is a really enjoyable anime with some references from...old gold anime (Ashita no Joe) and ironic comedy for the purpose of  criticizing the japanese society  making you laugh until you get a stomach ache.The characters are cute ,sweet and adorable  the perfect stuff for this genre. The funny interactions between them but also the slice of life elements manage to flesh out their unique personality traits, their odd side but also their lovely, adorable and serious character. Everyone in this show is interesting and appealing even the dog manages to stand out in a positive light.Unfortunatelly some characters weren't explored enough and the show focused too much on Maya casting a shadow on the other girls and guys who work at the cafe. Still it's worth your time and you will have a blast watching it! old gold anime (Ashita no Joe) and ironic comedy for the purpose of  criticizing the japanese society  making you laugh until you get a stomach ache.The characters are cute ,sweet and adorable  the perfect stuff for this genre.

Some jokes are moderately funny, none of the characters have any development besides like one or two traits and maybe something to motivate them, and there is literally no story. (Not that that's a bad thing no matter what, some really great anime like non non biyori don't have a story.) Not having a story in this case is a detriment, however. I would not recommend this, it's not so bad it's good and it's not so good that it's good,...it's right in the middle. Overall, this was a mildly enjoyable yet somewhat boring experience. it's right in the middle. Overall, this was a mildly enjoyable yet somewhat boring experience."", ""There's a 26 year old who is openly in love with a 16 year old, and everyone's fine with it. That aspect of the show made me completely unable to watch the rest of it, because no matter how cheerful and slice-of-life and whatever the show tried to be, it didn't take away from the fact that a 26 year old was into teenage girls. Sure, it may be legal over there in Japan, but it doesn't make it any more fucked up than it actually is. There's no reason for that to be a plot point. The animation is good, the sound is actually...really nice, the characters are pretty generic but likeable at points, but the thought that everyone, unilaterally, is ok with a much older man dating a teenager disgusts me too much to even give this series anything more than a 2. Even the one character, the cook, who seems to be the straight man of the whole operation, because the paedo creep owner Dino is absolutely useless, even he is fine with Dino hitting on the teenager. Even though he says MULTIPLE TIMES that he's not ok with it, and that he thinks Dino is weird and a creep, he acts as his wingman multiple times. The show pretty much consciously endorses this sort of behaviour as likeable, or that the viewer should be sympathetic to the absolute roach Dino, which is absolutely ridiculous. Spoiler for a completely different show ahead: In the ending of the Usagi Drop manga, a 16 year old decides to marry and have a baby with a 42 year old man - her adoptive father - and that was completely dropped from the anime, so I don't see why this incredibly unnerving part of an otherwise happy-go-lucky workplace show had to stay, and had to be such an incredibly strong part of the plot. Maika could have been made 19, or 20, or something, not an innocent, naive teenager who is easy prey to a man ten years her elder.

Those cafés are more appreciated for their atmosphere and special customer service which make you feel like a legitimate duke being served his afternoon cup of tea.But, of course, everything can be parodied, or at least copied to an extent. With the rise of Anime, Otakus were flooding from nowhere replacing the stereotypical millennials demanding a freedom of speech for their fresh odd tastes, and so there was an explosion in the medium of Otaku cafés where waitresses and...waiters (mostly waitresses for reasons) cosplay as a specific Anime character and server their customers on a more Anime-like way. That intro took long enough. “Blend S” is a wholesome slice of life light-hearted comedy show with 12 episodes that expands on this idea. But instead of experiencing the life-changing experience (according to Weaboos) that is being in on of those cafés, and keep in mind, it's past 2010, so as most people enjoy looking at other people play games, you could possibly get an enjoyment out of seeing imaginary customers being served the traditional Anime way. Or maybe, you know, enough of imaginary things, and actually go outside and make some actual friends. If you'd rather not, then stick along the review.- Story (7.0/10):Sakuranomiya Maika, a high school student with charming black hear lacks confidence in her casual smile as referred by pretty much everyone to be vicious, and that of a sadist, having spent a long time looking for a part-time job but with no luck whatsoever to be accepted in one. One day while she's running to catch a job interview in time, she dumps into a foreigner from Italy, that's where she met her new job's manager, Dino. Well, lucky her, she gets recruited into an Otaku café called “Stile” where all the waitress are supposed to play a stereotypical treat from the wide weird world of Anime, and she just happens to put her sadist smile into work, and be the sadistic Anime character that disses and humiliates customers out of service, I know, I also have an exclamation point of view on these type of fetishes myself. The story plays out nice and at a considerable story progression that gives you something out of everything. Fanservice is, of course, present, but thank God they weren't suggestive with it, so rare and knows its time that it lets you beg if there was more. Along the way, the manager struggles to spend time with Maika who he develops a crush on, but thanks to their strong friendship bonds they make it out of every other bitter-sweet day of work.- Art (7.5/10):This is one type of animation that I really enjoy. On wholesome and quite slice of life shows like this one, you don't really need the near perfect fluid animation to keep you focused as it lacks punch exchanges and epic bullet time stunts. All you will ever need is a clean, well maintained and consistent art style, and that's what Blend S delivers on. The color palette, for instance, is very vibrant and open, you see a variation of tints all at once, for each character theirs, no gloomy lighting or dark lazy colors, everything from the hair or the shiny eyes feels full of life, and compliments one's characteristics and treats. The alteration between the main art style and its respective minimalistic chibi version is only fermented by the smooth translations between serious and comedic conversations.- Sound (8.0/10):In general, the voice acting cast did a great job. So as lovely as the character designs are, they get cute feminine voices to add the topping on an already tasty looking cake (No sexual meaning after this). There were some near perfect English lines here and there that weren't worth the cringe shivers at all and were actually above average from what you'd expect from Japanese voice actors.The opening and theme songs were just as good, speaking about the opening in more specification. After all, it's thanks to it we got the legendary “Blend W” parody that makes me shed tears every time I listen to it, if you still haven't seen it, then you're missing a lot, but just don't fall under the mistake of seeing it before you get familiar with the show's opening, that would sure give you some nasty nightmares.- Character (7.0/10):This is, for me at least, a rare moment, to find a slice of life with no annoying characters is just glorious on its own. I enjoyed every single character and what it had to offer. With Stile being an Otaku like café, it presented a fitting roaster of employees, first you have the sadist Maika, and then the Tsundere Kaho, then enters the young sister Mafuyu (an actual adult in a loli body, so you're safe their boys), there is also the big sister figure Miu, and lately, the surprise character ;) (I know some people aren't going to like this one, at least I didn't), Hideri. And with that we conclude the female employees, leaving the manager Dino, and the chef Akizuki.What's great about these characters is everyone is unique, every character has at least two episodes centered on them, giving them the leading spotlight to express on themselves, leaving at least compatibility with a possible pair from the other side, which starts a cult of shipping very early on.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):Slice of life anime should all be enjoyed the same, that's a type of shows that isn't meant to hype you up or anything, but rather to enjoy while you're chilling after a hard day of work or school. The show addresses a lot of problems with its character, resulting in a variety of topics to discuss each episode, which doesn't render the events predictable and repetitive. I had my couple of laughs along the way, I shipped the two I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed in anything the show fails to deliver upon. Not what I would call a yearly-rewatch material, but it wouldn't hurt to see it with another friend.- Overall (7.3/10):Yes, aside from the memes, which in this Anime's case are dead (sorry for that, but facts are facts), you should probably clear some time and give “Blend S” a try. It's not by any means some life-changing experience Anime that you must see, but it doesn't fall short from entertaining you, which is a rule of thumb of every show. And rest assured, the content is (considering there are few sexual sighting and references) semi-family friendly that you could recommend out loud without having fingers pointed at you. waiters (mostly waitresses for reasons) cosplay as a specific Anime character and server their customers on a more Anime-like way.

After all, it's thanks to it we got the legendary “Blend W” parody that makes me shed tears every time I listen to it, if you still haven't seen it, then you're missing a lot, but just don't fall under the mistake of seeing it before you get familiar with the show's opening, that would sure give you some nasty nightmares.- Character (7.0/10):This is, for me at least, a rare moment, to find a slice of life with no annoying characters is just glorious on its own. I enjoyed every single character and what it had to offer. With Stile being an Otaku like café, it presented a fitting roaster of employees, first you have the sadist Maika, and then the Tsundere Kaho, then enters the young sister Mafuyu (an actual adult in a loli body, so you're safe their boys), there is also the big sister figure Miu, and lately, the surprise character ;) (I know some people aren't going to like this one, at least I didn't), Hideri. And with that we conclude the female employees, leaving the manager Dino, and the chef Akizuki.What's great about these characters is everyone is unique, every character has at least two episodes centered on them, giving them the leading spotlight to express on themselves, leaving at least compatibility with a possible pair from the other side, which starts a cult of shipping very early on.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):Slice of life anime should all be enjoyed the same, that's a type of shows that isn't meant to hype you up or anything, but rather to enjoy while you're chilling after a hard day of work or school. The show addresses a lot of problems with its character, resulting in a variety of topics to discuss each episode, which doesn't render the events predictable and repetitive. I had my couple of laughs along the way, I shipped the two I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed in anything the show fails to deliver upon. Not what I would call a yearly-rewatch material, but it wouldn't hurt to see it with another friend.- Overall (7.3/10):Yes, aside from the memes, which in this Anime's case are dead (sorry for that, but facts are facts), you should probably clear some time and give “Blend S” a try. It's not by any means some life-changing experience Anime that you must see, but it doesn't fall short from entertaining you, which is a rule of thumb of every show. And rest assured, the content is (considering there are few sexual sighting and references) semi-family friendly that you could recommend out loud without having fingers pointed at you."", '***spoiler free***Before we start I should let you know how I rank my anime. To start off I don\'t rank anything below 5, I just feel like an awful human being. This means if I rank something 5, it\'s pretty much the worst thing I\'ve ever seen. A 6 is yeah it has some good points but still pretty bad, 7 means it\'s average, i might be able to see how people can get enjoyment, however, I didn\'t get any enjoyment. 8 is my average where I get a bit of enjoyment and I don\'t think I need to go any higher.Now onto the review!!!If...you read my previous paragraph you will see what I said about a rating of 7 (which I gave this). After reading other reviews people said they couldn\'t stop laughing/smiling. I could. In fact, for a comedy, I think this show maybe got 2 sharp exhales through my nose that some people may consider a laugh. For a comedy to get 2 laughs out of me, that\'s pretty weak. But hey maybe I just don\'t have a high enough IQ.The main point that I can\'t stand about this show is the creepy pedo vibe that comes with it, let me go a bit more in-depth about that. The main character Maika Sakuranomiya can\'t find a job and Dino/The Manager offers her a job at his cafe because for him it was love at first sight. However, let me note that Dino is 26 and Maika is 16. A ten year age difference. Is this not a little creepy to anybody else? The best way I can describe it was a similar feeling to what I got when watching Eromanga Sensei when the MC has a harem of lolis. Maika is also completely oblivious to this when it comes to love she is about as thick as Ichika Orimura, the MC from Infinite Stratos. If you\'re trying to tell me this isn\'t creepy what about the episode where this 26-year-old guy is helping a 16-year-old girl look for a swimsuit.Ok back to the normal review formatStory - 6Minimal story except for the characters getting more friendly with each other.

Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! & Service!They are the words of which describe the beloved characters of the cafe which has their waitresses perform their jobs while acting out a certain character trait.While I watched Blend S, I thought at first it could\'ve just been anther moe slice of life anime, but getting into it, it created it\'s own style which lets it stand out from other shows of such, severing it from being just a generic slice of life.StoryThere really isn\'t much of a story that progresses on as it\'s basically just...showing their lives in the cafe most of the time. The story begins with the original main character Sakuranomiya Maika, who has a hard time talking to people because of her having a horrific glare, this of which had been giving her a very hard time finding a part-time job. She soon bumps into a man named Dino, who soon takes a liking to her later on. Dino offers to hire her as she has a particular look he thinks would work in his cafe. This is the start of Maika and her newly found occupation where she plays the ""sadistic"" character along with a few other people with other character personalities. The show, like most moe slice of life shows is episodic, as in newer episodes there is a new day and a new situation going on with the characters and their interactions with the other characters of the show. The most notable aspect that this show has that plays a part throughout the whole show is the feelings that the character named Dino gets toward Maika. This is like the running gag of the show as he\'ll try getting Maika\'s attention through some way in just about every episode. There are also 2 sub relationships that get a little buildup including Kaho, the tsundere character.Characters.Maika is the ""sadistic"" character. She\'s a sweet girl, who ironically plays a character who trash talks the customers. She has a bit of a hard time playing her character because she really just wants to be a nice person to the customers, but she grows into the role. Outside of work, she is misunderstood and seen as a sadist, though she\'s nothing close to one. She has a strong interest in foreign countries, and isn\'t too much of a fan for Japanese stuff, which helps build some fascination for Dino.Kaho is the ""tsundere"" character. She\'s a tad bit introverted, but mostly a well rounded gamer.  As you may expect from a tsundere, she\'ll give the customers that difficult and reluctant personality when serving customers.Mafuyu is the ""imouto character. When she serves customers, she acts out of her normal character and acts just like a cute girl scout trying to sell cookies. While she may look like a young loli, she isn\'t at all. She\'s in her 20s and is a college student. While she plays the little sister character, she occasionally acts as the big sister towards the younger members of Stile.Dino is the manager of Stile & an Italian chef. He\'s a serious otaku, doing things from collecting figurines and watching anime. He has an attraction for Japanese girls, notably with black hair, which is one of the aspect which had him attracted to Maika.Kanzaki HideriHideri is the ""idol"" character. Hideri is notably the character who has aspirations to be an idol & can be referred to with the word Surprise!Akizuki KouyouKouyou is a cook for the restaurant along with Dino. He\'s into yuri and really wants more female customers in the cafe. He\'s probably the closest to normal of the whole cast.Amano MiuMiu is the ""onee-chan"" character. She comes in near the middle of the series, so we don\'t really get to know her character much aside from her being a doujinshi maker outside of work and she\'s always looking over people for some content.To sum up all of that, the characters mostly take up normal traits of anime characters in general, though just slightly different enough to stand out a bit.SoundBlend S\'s OST does well capturing a warm cafe-esque. It\'s nothing special, but it fits the environment well.The OP is the most notable aspect of it. The OP is catchy, fun, upbeat, and engaging. Whenever the show would start, I would never skip the OP because it properly kickstarted me.The ED was nice, though not as notable as the OP, it\'s good and feels gentle to listen to as it gives off a dream like state of comfort.ArtThere isn\'t much to say about the art. It\'s pretty nice and doesn\'t feel lackluster in any way. It\'s cute. The character designs have this sweet little charm to them as well.OverallThis was a refreshing slice of life to watch. It felt like moe slice of lifes were toning down, then this came around and it was fresh air. An area I think it could\'ve worked on was character development. You\'ll get insight on Maika & Dino though the rest could\'ve gotten more story behind them.

This comedy in the workplace of some waitresses who must pass themselves off as what they are not was the most fun of the fall season.And besides, it was an inexhaustible source of memes, thanks to its catchy opening and the hidden power of...the letter S.In the case of Blend S, the mix of an attractive cast and funny situations is enough to create an effective comedy. This series does not have an argument to highlight, beyond the simple premise of a café in which the waitresses must interpret being a stereotype for their customers.Its central nucleus is made up of three waitresses who are very different from the stereotype they represent. Then they introduced us other characters, but Maika, Kaho and Mafuyu form the core of Blend S and are the key to its success. I began to see this story without expectations and therefore I ended up enjoying it more than I expected, because although it is not at all memorable, it has a definite goal and fulfills it to the letter: Blend S is consistently entertaining.The basic premise is that a high school girl named Maika wants a job to save money and go abroad to study. Her problem is that nobody wants to hire her because of her murderous look. It is not intentional, but that serves to perfection to play the role of a waitress who abuses their customers at Café Stile.There he meets Kaho, who is a very open and friendly girl with a huge fondness for video games. However, his character in the cafe demands that he pass himself off as a Tsundere. Meanwhile, Mafuyu is a woman, but her appearance as a girl helps her pretend to be the character of the ""little sister"" in Café Stile. The business is run by Dino, an Italian obsessed with dark-haired Japanese beauties and who is attracted to Maika.Each episode focuses on putting the characters before different scenarios and generate funny situations. Blend S manages to do both. I was afraid that Maika\'s joke and sadistic look in contrast to her sweet personality would lose grace, but it is not so. In the 12 episodes it was used a lot yet, remained cool. This had to do much with his chemistry with the other characters, especially with Dino, whose masochistic tendencies fit perfectly as a counterweight to the false ""sadism"" of Maika.The interactions between Kaho, the waitress Tsundere who is actually an addict gamer, and Akizuki, the restaurant\'s chef, are also entertaining. He is also a bit weird and does not know how to deal with women, so both end up involved in various hilarious situations. Then we have Mafuyu, who works while looking like the sweetest younger sister in the universe, but outside work is serious and frankly ruthless with Dino. Later on Miu, a very perverted doujinshi artist and Hideri, the surprise of which the opening speaks.Turning to technical assessments, except for the entertaining opening, the series does not have any highlight in animation. Its character design is adequate, but completely within the Moe norm, that is, it does not contribute anything really distinctive. Due to its nature of situation comedy, the direction and the assembly are not brilliant, but highly effective in giving impact to the comedy.The soundtrack is just right, but its sticky and addictive opening is the material from which the dreams of the creators of memes are made. That they have no doubt, just google ""S Stands For"" and see what I\'m talking about.In conclusion, a refreshing mixThere is little that can be said about Blend S. It is perfectly forgettable as anime, except for the memes it leaves behind. Those will survive in digital memory. However, it is the kind of light and refreshing entertainment that is sometimes needed. While other anime try to be legendary with intricate arguments and twists in history that surprise, this follows the opposite route, that of simplicity. It is full of anime stereotypes, but with the twist that its characters are not such a thing.With these features, Blend S depends almost exclusively on its characters and knows it. That is why it cares for them and uses them effectively. Through his personalities, both real and feigned, it sells simple but effective humor to have a good time. And we buy it. If you have not seen it and you are just looking for a laugh, then this is the anime for you. the letter S.In the case of Blend S, the mix of an attractive cast and funny situations is enough to create an effective comedy.

The story is meh, the characters are pretty simple, and it\'s not doing anything groundbreaking, but it\'s definitely a show you can sit down, turn off your brain, and get more than a few laughs from it.Story: 3This is a slice-of-life, moe anime so as you might expect there\'s not much of a story line. The premise itself caters to your heavy anime watcher so it\'s not something you would recommend to someone getting introduced to anime. Maika Sakuranomiya is a girl trying to find a job to raise money in...order to travel abroad, but having no luck due to her scary glare. However, Dino, the owner of a cafe that contains waitresses with different personalities (i.e. tsundere, imouto, etc) scouts her out as his ""sadistic"" girl. This does sound a little creepy considering Dino is an older Italian man with a weird black hair fetish and Maika is a high school girl, but nothing really happens. I will admit an anime covering this premise itself sounds interesting but also very cringe at the same time. However, I decided to give it a try due to the iconic opening/meme, ""smile, sweet, sadistic.."" and did not regret the decision.Art: 8Personally I enjoyed the art style a lot. It\'s definitely more to the moe end, but all the characters have unique designs that makes them stand out. I also haven\'t seen the little fuzzballs used on Maika\'s hair in anime before so that was definitely a nice change up. Also, I loved the art style for Maika\'s sadistic faces. Even if it got repetitive, I found it hilarious every time.Sound: 8For me, the OP and ED are the main things I listen to for sound in addition to the voice actors. The main way I measure how good an OP and ED is depends on how many times I skipped them and I can gladly say that I did not skip Blend S\'s OP or ED once. I\'m sure if you\'re familiar with even a little of internet culture, then you\'ll know the iconic beginning of the opening. There\'s a reason it became viral because it\'s soooo catchy. The rest of opening is pretty solid as well. I definitely will have nostalgia when hearing it in the future and the animation that goes with the opening is great. The ED isn\'t as good as the OP, but the little animation that they had going on kept me every time as it shows Maika traveling and meeting all the characters and evolves as the show goes on and she meets new characters (which I love). The voice actors are pretty solid. None of them stood out exceptionally to me, but they were able to express themselves well.Character: 6The characters by themselves are pretty 1-dimensional. Dino is middle aged man in love with a high school girl, which seems to be his main personality trait. Maika is a timid, clumsy girl who tries her best to be nice and give good service but that only ends up making her even more sadistic, playing into her role. Kaho is a gamer girl who plays a tsundere in the cafe. Akizuki is probably the self-insert character as he is also a gamer and seems to have a thing going with Kaho. Miu is forgettable. Mafuyu plays the imouto (younger sister), but is ironically older than both Kaho and Maika. She is the ""straight woman"" for Dino. Hideri is an idol who comes later.I would say the main strength is how the characters interact with each other, which often lead to comedic situations. I will mention there are even interactions shown between the members without Maika, which I liked as it makes them seem like their whole personality and life is not dependent on the MC (something that I feel is way too common in anime). I wasn\'t a big fan of the Hideri-Miu interaction, but I loved the Kaho-Mufuyu one and thought that added a lot of depth to both characters.Enjoyment: 8I would definitely classify Blend S as a ""guilty pleasure."" It\'s that cute anime that you watch but don\'t talk about with other people since it\'s also kind of cringe. The characters were a lot of fun to watch for me and watching Maika try so hard to only end up scaring the customers even more with her sadistic look was entertaining.Overall: 7Blend S is not something that I would recommend as an anime you should see before you die, but it\'s definitely a show that can help you relax if you\'ve had a tough day or are looking for a short show to binge in between the intense 100 episode action anime you just finished and the next one you\'re about to start.

Hideri Kanzaki, the idol, is freaking hilarious. Owner is adorable, and Mafuyu is awesome. I did wish they showed a bit more of other characters. Hideri, for example, was introduced late in the show so we didn't see a lot of him. That...was quite disappointing.I absolutely hate anime that zoom in on a girl's boobs or butts every 2 seconds. They did Kaho dirty. Drew her with huge boobs and constantly made jokes about it. I don't find that funny. This happened literally every episode.The anime should have had more plot. It was getting kind of boring after a while. Same thing every episode. Maika does something, Dino gets a nosebleed and tries to hang out with her, He ultimately fails to convey his feelings for her, he has a breakdown. Very predictable.This is where I'll end it.

However, it let this premise down with terrible performance in nearly every category. You’d think that a show with such a self-aware plot could deliver to most otaku flawlessly, right?Plot- 4/10A highschool student named Maika finds a job at a cafe where all waiters must fulfill the role of an anime/manga character cliche. Instead of making bright remarks on the plethora of overused gags and character traits in anime, Blend-S proceeds to bombard viewers with fanservice and over-the-top one liners. Either way this ruins the “slice-of-life” aspect as...absolutely nothing feels natural in this anime. Comedy is key for such an anime’s plot yet it seems completely deprived of any decent comedical material.Characters- 1/10Blend-S manages to have the most dislikable cast I’ve seen in any slice-of-life anime thus far. Nobody acts like an average, believable human being except some side characters. What I found most jarring about the cast of characters is that after work where they’re paid to be cliches, they still are completely summed up by another cliche.Maika in-work is sadistic while out-of-work she simply looks sadistic and glares menacingly at everyone accidentally. Like that’s believable. Dino is a borderline pedophile, Miu is a pervert, Kaho is a gamer, etcetera. I’ve seen harems with more character quality than Blend-S.Art- 5/10In one word, average. Very average. This seems to be the norm with most slice-of-life’s, but in most cases art direction is accompanied with a clever joke setup and punchline. Blend-S falls short here thus the art really doesn’t have any support.Sound- 5/10Aside from the opening there are virtually no memorable tracks.

I only managed to laugh once through roughly 4.6 hours worth of content. Simply put, Blend-S isn’t very enjoyable.Overall- 3/10Blend-S really isn’t worth watching due to the lack of plot and decent comedy. The only likable scene in the entirety of this anime was the nighttime conversation between Kaho and Akizuki in episode 5.

Honestly the Akizuki and Kaho sublot was far more interesting than Dino and Maika. Speaking of Dino and Maika - they had absolutely no problem just casually dropping the fact they have a 10 year age gap. Whenever I see Dino I get pissed off. And whenever I see Maika I get pissed off as well cause of how...boring she is.But Dino has to take the cake here - 26 year old man hitting on a high school girl. And it\'s being sold off as comedy. Even worse - romance. I have to laugh.The supporting cast\'s charms (except the loli) were able to save this anime somehow. But it\'s still subpar for what it is. There\'s better SOL romcoms out there. That aren\'t borderline pedophilia.Weak 7/10.

I needed something fun and cute, and Blend-S is exactly that! Blend-S is a really fun and adorable story of a cafe where cute girls serve clients as characters. With Maika being the main character, someone who tries to be cute but always ends up looking sadistic with her scary eyes. She works in this cafe with many other girls and a boss who she likes and he likes her as well (lol).Let's start with the animation and art. The characters look very good and nice and are pretty fun to watch, but the show...does make MANY corner cuts and its pretty obvious. Background characters are most of the time not even draw, they just are grey silhouettes, and if they are animated they don't even have a face! Even the main characters sometimes become extremely cartoonish and overly simple. To be honest though, the extremely cartoonish scene works because of the shows already very cartoony nature.The plot is basic, but that's expected in a slice of life anime. The only big plot point is the relationship between Maika and Dino, which is really fun to see.And the main pro of the show is its fun and really enjoyable characters.

There’s nothing that really stands out. It was pretty fun to watch in the beginning and I really enjoyed it. Enough to give it an 8.Though after the fifth episode I was mostly forcing myself to get through it since I only had about half of the episodes left. Every episode after number five was pretty boring and felt like it took forever to finish.It didn’t have a great plot or story and just took a maid cafe and tried to change it so that it would seem different. The plot can be summed...up as a bunch of cute girls working at a cafe. I didn’t really realize that it was a comedy until I looked at the genre. The jokes were bland and didn’t make me laugh. An example of an anime with great jokes that made laugh is Hataraku Maou-sama. I was just bored and it was too slow paced for my liking. This is coming from a person that has watched every filler in Naruto and thoroughly enjoyed it.The art and soundtrack didn’t differentiate itself either. The art style was generic and nothing out of the ordinary. Just what you would see in a stereotypical slice of life anime. Although I really did like the illustration they showed at the end of the last episode. The soundtrack had one good song and that was the opening. It’s really catchy and a great template for memes. The rest of the music wasn’t bad but wasn’t good. They fit in with the context of the scene and that’s about it.The characters were mostly just a bunch of tropes but that’s all there was for most of the characters. Ouran high school host club is a good example of a show that does their characters good. Though they are based on tropes there’s more to them an they’re all unique in their own way. Maika was a bit too dense for me and reminded me of Kirito. Mafuyu was just a short, aloof kuudere. I liked Kaho’s character the best because she had quite a few traits but she wasn’t the best either. She was like a reliable older sister that enjoyed video games and isn’t too good at school. Amano is just a hentai artist. Kanzaki is just a femboy. Dino is just an otaku that likes Maika and I still don’t know much about Akizuki except for that he’s into yuri and cute girls. The last four characters didn’t have much of a personality and are just there. The character designs were also pretty bland although I really liked Kaho’s design. The characters weren’t too memorable and I only remembered two of their names.

', ""BLEND-S is an anime I wish more people had watched instead of just meme'd because while it's not perfect, it's charming and contributes to the under-serviced genre that is workplace comedies. In fact, one of my biggest qualms about BLEND-S is how it could have done more with its angle than it did, but wound up going towards the generic more often than not.The first few episodes of the series are the best in my opinion, showcasing Cafe Stile and its inhabitants and making it a place I'd want to work at. Later episodes feel a little like a bait and switch; the show keeps...introducing new characters who'd be interesting to watch working in the cafe, but we don't actually get much of this because the story turns to focussing on its romantic plotline. I'm a huge romance nerd; when I'm complaining about a show getting more heavily into its romantic plotline, there's a problem.

Frankly, the anime community desperately needs another DENKI GAI."", 'LA\'s guiltiest pleasure anime for Fall 2017.Blend S is by all means for LA what LA wanted in the Fall of 2017 season, lots of verbal slapstick with defying character traits all wrapped up into a working place comedy and sure not every joke landed but nonetheless...Before LA goes full fanboying over this anime. LA would like to bring up the ""implications and faults"" in this anime first. First would be the puppy love sadomasochistic relationship between the Manager Dino voiced by Tomoaki Maeno and Maika Sakuranomiya voiced by Azumi Waki as for one, they never explicitly say how old Dino is and that uhhh...can lead to some bad situations but considering this is a comedy, LA would think Maika is old enough...or Dino is in his early 20\'s at least. Secondly would be the running gags that sometimes fall flat and considering this is a character-jabbing comedy it\'s a given that it\'s implied many fo the characters to have their running gags and LA is completely ok with this, as Blend S manages to at least bring us differing settings as well as other character interacting with each other (instead of being close net) that makes for differing comedic situations. Lastly would be again Dino and Maika\'s relationship again and how the finale portrayed it, yes it\'s typical as to how it handled it...but again it\'s a comedy...LA was expecting this and what with how Blend S likes to skirt this topic it was BOUND to happen.Ok with the flaws  out of the way let\'s talk why LA has just a guilty pleasure over Blend S.Character-wise, the anime gives us the notion of character who are not how they seem, from Maika\'s cute yet unintentional sadistic nature to Kaho Hinata\'s tsundere act when it comes to games but she too is a normal girl (probably the most normal one in this entire cast) to Mafuyu\'s sister act when she\'s really around her 20\'s and is the strictest among the cast and is one of the minders to Dino and his antics. Kouyou Akizuki, the kitchen staff who is a yuri fan and is actually more of tsundere than Kaho is! Miu Amano, a famous doujin artist who acts like the older sister and Hideri Kanzaki who acts cutezy and girly but is actually and uhhh spoilers...a guy. So essentially the entire cast have a two-face deal to them and the comedy revolves around this and that\'s kinda what LA has been craving for some time...which leads LA to...The voice acting, ok so Maika Sakuranomiya is voiced by Azumi Waki, she\'s voiced Galko from Oshiete Galko-chan! ANOTHER anime about looking beyond the covers of typical character stereotypes and here she voices a cute yet clumsy character with an unintentional sadistic streak. To Kaho Hinata (LA\'s favourite character in Blend S) voiced by Akari Kito...hmmm LA heard of that name..ohh right she voiced the tsundere Suzune Horikata from Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e where Akari is essentially doing a parody of the tsundere archetype, to LA best example of how self-aware the ADR is about this voice casting for Blend S being Sora Tokui as Hideri in voicing a character wanting to be an idol even with his secret of being a guy. Besides the literal cross dressing what does ""a character wanting be an idol"" and ""Sora Tokui"" have in common ohh yeah...Sora Tokui voiced Nico Yazawa from Love Live!. LA just loved this voice cast if that wasn\'t obvious and how the ADR liked to add subtle nods to not only the characters playing off and parodying their own voice actors but how that works as a huge advantage to Blend S\' own comedy at the same time!. LA will never look as Azumi Waki\'s voice acting the same way again...In terms of animation by A1-Pictures, the animation is by all, in typical fair of a working place comedy anime, from chibified character designs for the awkward/comedic moments to the moe character designs of every character, but LA would like to say that A1-Pictures nailed the atmosphere of the anime whenever it was needed, by that LA means the timing to how the animation works to it\'s own favour (such as Maika\'s unintentional sadism).Blend S may have it\'s own problems that even LA noticed but LA can excuse it as there was just something that clicked with LA for Blend S (and LA thinks it\'s the obvious voice cast that LA just adored from start to finish) that LA can excuse it\'s running gags, jokes not landing and the unfortunate implications and typical moeness that might detract some audience members.

The characters are vibrant and well-acted all around. There is lots to be said for the comedic timing in this series, as well as the airtight chemistry of the cast. I would be remiss not to mention the fantastic opening, which drew so many people, including myself, to the series.I think that another thing this show has going for it, possibly the biggest, is the sheer production value.

I could watch and enjoy Blend-S with no subtitles, just because it is that pretty and pleasant to observe and listen to.But I watched it with subtitles, and I think that this series, while enjoyable in many ways, sums up the grander issue facing the slice-of-life genre: diminishing returns. We have a set of relationships that define the ensemble, breaking them up into groups of 2 and 3 for most scenes. I would say that this drove the series nicely for about a quarter to half of the episodes, but it gets tiring.

Some episodes just don't have the same deliberate feeling of something like Haganai, or Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid.Lastly, I will say that I think the romance aspect of the show was weak and problematic, not for the substance of what occurs, but because of the implications behind the premise of romance. I will decline to spoil any details, but I recommend looking up the ages of the characters after watching, and seeing how that sits with you.

After watching Blend S I felt obliged to write this review, as this show fits that bill perfectly in my opinion.As I said just now, the premise of this show was fine: we have a girl who has a distinctive “creepy smile” which caused her to not be able to find a job. Luckily for her she finds a café which specializes in having maids...with different persona’s and they are looking for a “sadistic” one. Rounding up the cast of persona’s will be (as seen in the opening): a tsundere, a little sister, a big sister and an idol. More than enough variety to keep things interesting right? At least that was what I was thinking after episode 1.The biggest problem for me was that instead of moving forward the show just kept repeating itself, over, and over again. I know this is supposed to be an episodic anime but that’s not the point I’m trying to make here. Characters and situations don’t evolve over time but stay the same as they were from the start. Take the protagonist Maika for example. In the first episode it is shown that she has a “creepy smile”, she likes foreign things, she is very self-conscious, she apologizes a lot and she cannot read the situation most of the time concerning Dino (the manager who has a crush on her). That may seem like a big list, but the thing is all of this is shown in episode 1, and in the entirety of episodes 2 through 12 nothing is added, removed or changed from that list. Someone who watches the first episode basically knows as much about Maika (both her personality and her background) as someone who finished the entire show.But unfortunately Maika isn’t the only one with this problem.Not only is this the case for almost all of the other characters as well, the humor itself also suffers from it. The joke that Maika says something that causes Dino to get a nosebleed and then showing Maika not knowing why this happened has been made about 4 times each episode, and I do not think that is exaggerated at all. The first two times it was hilarious, the six times after that it was still funny, but then there were 10 episodes more to go. Again, the humor itself isn’t the problem. In fact, I was enjoying myself quite a lot in the beginning, but they are just so repetitive. That’s why I found myself laughing just a couple of times in the last six episodes: When they occasionally made a new joke.Lastly I would like to point out another frustration I had while watching this anime, which is the “delay of Hideri”. Hideri is the final character that was supposed to be added to the group and *SMALL SPOILER ALERT* is besides an idol persona also a trap, a fact that made me curious as to how this character was handled. *SPOILER END* As the rest of the show didn’t really impress me after episode 4 I was kind of waiting for Hideri to save it. Unfortunately, Hideri first showed up in episode 8. Out of 12. Yeah. If I had known that I probably would have either skipped episode 5 through 7 or dropped it entirely.In short, this is a fun anime and great overall, if it was three episodes long. For the length that is has right now it’s too short on original jokes, by far. But hey, there’s always the next show about characters running a café or something like that. Personally I’m still planning to watch ‘Working!!’ and ‘Servant x Service’ so I still have my hopes up for this genre.You should watch this if:- You are a complete sucker for one or more of the mentioned persona’s- You really love maid café’s- You like a good laugh (only the first few episodes really)You shouldn't watch this if:- You expect to see one or more of the mentioned persona’s being fleshed out- You dislike Dino and Maika’s relationship in episode 1 (because you’ll get a LOT more of that)- You are easily annoyed by jokes getting repeated over and overInitial score: 7.5/10Final score: 6/10[This is only my second review, so please feel free to tell me if I did something wrong or did something right!] with different persona’s and they are looking for a “sadistic” one.

I didn't expect much. But now that I have seen it I can say that I'm glad I gave it a shot.The first thing I'll touch upon is the overall story/plot. I'm not a huge fan of slice of life so I was surprised that I enjoyed this show as much as I did. But Blend s has so much more to offer. The different characters and the role that they play is so enjoyable to me. You see things like Mafuya playing the...little sister when in reality she's more mature and isn't always as nice as she makes her character out to be. And then there's Maika who plays the sadistic character, which is fitting because of her natural sadist look, but she's very sweet and doesn't like being rude to customers. Another thing that really got me hooked was the kinda romance side of it. I was honestly surprised this didn't have a romance tag. It doesn't just acknowledge the main (obvious) ship it shows different pairings too such as Kaho and Akizuki or Miu and Hideri. It was a very comical anime and I can say I did have a good laugh or two. Which is again kind of surprising because I rarely think most comedy anime are funny.Not only did it have a good storyline and likable characters but the music and the art was phenomenal. A-1 pictures definitely did their job right. It was a very pretty anime and that did contribute to my liking of it. I really enjoyed the opening too. Not only was the op song good but again, the animation was great. Not gonna lie I am one to skip over opening and endings but for this one I didn't feel the need to.Overall no matter who you are or what kind of stuff you're into I think you won't be disappointed. It's a good watch. It wasn't anything where you had to think deep about something and the plot in all wasn't anything spectacular but it definitely was good. At least give it a shot.

She was shy and awkward all the time."", ""WARNING: This review contains some spoilers.Blend S, where many types of anime personalities are thrown into to get a surprising and funny blend of pure entertainment and romantic fanservice provided by the cast.-Story: The story is pretty simple, Maika Sakuranomiya is a cosmopolitan Japanese girl who wants to get a part-time job in order to travel the world, but can’t get any job or gets fired easily due to his “sadistic” face. Then finally gets a job in a café called “Stile” where an Italian guy called Dino is the Manager and has gotten quite attached to Japanese culture, who gets infatuated with Maika for...his Japanese outlook. This anime is presented in an episodic way and has a great continuum along the 12 episodes, and while the premise of the show is simplistic, it doesn’t disappoint and gives a lot of entertainment and good romance and implicit dirty talking along the way.Blend S often presents progressive attitudes well related to our current culture, such as Dino getting arrested for presumably having misconducts with the girls to the point of even kidnapping, and Akizuki groping Kaho just because he was upset for the jungle theme. Also mention Hideri’s desire to be a girl idol while being a boy. And while this may alienate many conservatives just by hearing these things, it won’t, quite the contrary I say, because the virtue is that Blend S pulls off these situations in a subtle and funny way, it’s not forced like most of the Western shows. (8/10)-Art: The art is a really strong point, because all of the characters are pretty distinguishable from each other and matches very well to their personality, Maika’s Japanese heritage is clearly represented with the straight black hair and her schoolgirl attire. The backgrounds are good, but not memorable, especially in the outdoors. And the animation is extremely great with all the expressions flowing all around our eyes, and never seeming out of place at any moment, well crafted and very consistent along the full 12 episodes. (9/10)-Sound: The sound is pretty subtle and mostly goes with the scenes of the shows, but it doesn’t stand out and can be easily forgotten. The opening has the catchiest intro that I've heard in several years, such famous that it has already became a meme with the Sweet, Smile, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise and similar comparisons with the S letter, but it’s also worth mentioning that the ending is pretty plain, even considering the good ending scenes.I have no complaints with the seiyuu cast, most of them are close to the character that are voice acting and express most of what it’s said. But it’d be better if Dino could have a more “accento straniero” to give him more distinction to his already crazy personality, and more importantly, show that he’s an Italian, of course his seiyuu personified really well Dino’s eternal struggles with himself. While Japanese and Italian are pretty simple languages to speak, Italian is spoken more softly and more romantic, thing that Dino doesn’t have. (6/10)-Characters: Here’s where the show is at its strongest, all 7 main characters have marked personalities and never seem to put off the others by any mean. The 5 waitress attend the customers with a specific personality in order to maintain the customers happy. It’s no coincidence that Maika is assigned the sadistic personality, much to her reluctance and will to present herself as a charming and smiling waitress. Kaho Hinata, while being a massive sweetheart and the most popular waitress of Stile, behaves like a tsundere when treating the customers. Mafuyu Hoshikawa, the most mature and the most closed minded of the cast delivers a little sis behaviour in excellent form due to her small stature. Miu Amano, a +18 doujinshi artist who has a penchant to ship everybody in the café gets the big sister status, never letting a brainstorm going to waste. And Hideri Kanzaki is literally the surprise of the waiters cast.Hideri is without doubt the best character and the perfect bridge between the girls and the boys, often helping someone to understand better the other ones. Such is the case when he constantly helps Dino with his quest to conquer Maika’s heart, often involving real, and sometimes, crazy advices to his cause, but always in good nature; same with Kouyou Akizuki with his several misunderstandings and mixed feelings with Kaho.Dino is the Manager and has a massive obsession with anime, which tires him out on the nights, often lazing around when working and trying to flirt every single girl close to her, sometimes getting over the limit and then getting arrested. Kouyou Akizuki is the responsible chef and Dino’s ground cable to reality, in spite of this, he has a massive problem to interact with girls in most situations, clearly expressed in his bluntness when talking to Kaho and still hiding his feelings to her. (10/10)-Enjoyment: A slice-of-life that doesn’t have enjoyment is not a good slice-of-life is my motto. Blend S provides several moments of enjoyment with the daily interaction between the cast, the more intricate and funny intimate scenes, the working habits of the main cast, some exceptional situations like the mandatory beach and snow episodes, and specially the overall light heart approach of the show. All in all, if you’re very well versed on the slice of life genre, you won’t be disappointed at all, no second is lost by watching this anime, it’s pretty simple and conventional, but remarks clearly why this genre will never die. (8/10) his Japanese outlook. This anime is presented in an episodic way and has a great continuum along the 12 episodes, and while the premise of the show is simplistic, it doesn’t disappoint and gives a lot of entertainment and good romance and implicit dirty talking along the way.Blend S often presents progressive attitudes well related to our current culture, such as Dino getting arrested for presumably having misconducts with the girls to the point of even kidnapping, and Akizuki groping Kaho just because he was upset for the jungle theme. Also mention Hideri’s desire to be a girl idol while being a boy. And while this may alienate many conservatives just by hearing these things, it won’t, quite the contrary I say, because the virtue is that Blend S pulls off these situations in a subtle and funny way, it’s not forced like most of the Western shows. (8/10)-Art: The art is a really strong point, because all of the characters are pretty distinguishable from each other and matches very well to their personality, Maika’s Japanese heritage is clearly represented with the straight black hair and her schoolgirl attire. The backgrounds are good, but not memorable, especially in the outdoors. And the animation is extremely great with all the expressions flowing all around our eyes, and never seeming out of place at any moment, well crafted and very consistent along the full 12 episodes. (9/10)-Sound: The sound is pretty subtle and mostly goes with the scenes of the shows, but it doesn’t stand out and can be easily forgotten. The opening has the catchiest intro that I've heard in several years, such famous that it has already became a meme with the Sweet, Smile, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise and similar comparisons with the S letter, but it’s also worth mentioning that the ending is pretty plain, even considering the good ending scenes.I have no complaints with the seiyuu cast, most of them are close to the character that are voice acting and express most of what it’s said. But it’d be better if Dino could have a more “accento straniero” to give him more distinction to his already crazy personality, and more importantly, show that he’s an Italian, of course his seiyuu personified really well Dino’s eternal struggles with himself. While Japanese and Italian are pretty simple languages to speak, Italian is spoken more softly and more romantic, thing that Dino doesn’t have. (6/10)-Characters: Here’s where the show is at its strongest, all 7 main characters have marked personalities and never seem to put off the others by any mean. The 5 waitress attend the customers with a specific personality in order to maintain the customers happy. It’s no coincidence that Maika is assigned the sadistic personality, much to her reluctance and will to present herself as a charming and smiling waitress. Kaho Hinata, while being a massive sweetheart and the most popular waitress of Stile, behaves like a tsundere when treating the customers. Mafuyu Hoshikawa, the most mature and the most closed minded of the cast delivers a little sis behaviour in excellent form due to her small stature. Miu Amano, a +18 doujinshi artist who has a penchant to ship everybody in the café gets the big sister status, never letting a brainstorm going to waste. And Hideri Kanzaki is literally the surprise of the waiters cast.Hideri is without doubt the best character and the perfect bridge between the girls and the boys, often helping someone to understand better the other ones. Such is the case when he constantly helps Dino with his quest to conquer Maika’s heart, often involving real, and sometimes, crazy advices to his cause, but always in good nature; same with Kouyou Akizuki with his several misunderstandings and mixed feelings with Kaho.Dino is the Manager and has a massive obsession with anime, which tires him out on the nights, often lazing around when working and trying to flirt every single girl close to her, sometimes getting over the limit and then getting arrested. Kouyou Akizuki is the responsible chef and Dino’s ground cable to reality, in spite of this, he has a massive problem to interact with girls in most situations, clearly expressed in his bluntness when talking to Kaho and still hiding his feelings to her. (10/10)-Enjoyment: A slice-of-life that doesn’t have enjoyment is not a good slice-of-life is my motto. Blend S provides several moments of enjoyment with the daily interaction between the cast, the more intricate and funny intimate scenes, the working habits of the main cast, some exceptional situations like the mandatory beach and snow episodes, and specially the overall light heart approach of the show. All in all, if you’re very well versed on the slice of life genre, you won’t be disappointed at all, no second is lost by watching this anime, it’s pretty simple and conventional, but remarks clearly why this genre will never die.

Which can be found through my profile.------Self-Note: ""Review"" might require clarity revamp at some point in future.-----✦StoryTo sum it up it\'s slice-of-life working Anime with absolutely lovable characters and quirks. As most of the story is basically about character daily life at their workplace, we also get spice of romance. I found story element fairly enjoyable and simple, it\'s bright, pleasurable and simply fun.Main issue I have with the story is simply the amount of episodes. I do absolutely hope seeing this story to the end.I do have to mention another Anime...""Working!"" , which has very similar vibe and I as well loved. What made that specific Anime throughout splendid, is that it got sequel after sequel and story got wrapped up.Same thing I pray for this Anime. Simply hope to see it fully animated and have everything wrapped up including romance aspect.Whilst this season, did give us initial insight of possible couples, it would still be absolute bliss to see them realized and as well discover possible love interest of characters that didn\'t get their match this season.TLDR; To sum it up, its very fun, quirky, cute, sweet and simplistic story. But the whole emotions and colors this Anime gives off, makes it superb. Might be a bit convoluted explanation, but I feel that is the closest I can explain regarding story.✦Art & SoundArt and animation is colorful, lively, sweet and straightforward. Very fitting and enjoyable.As for music, well obviously the almighty ""Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service..."" is been a overly used thing in the world of internet. Putting that aside, I found it good enough and catchy. Rest of the OST had some presence and was as well simply good enough. But overall it wasn\'t anything special.As well wanted to add. The facial expressions and richness and variety of them is topnotch. Adorable smiles are big bonus.✦CharacterI probably would write very long paragraphs about almost every character, but in order to avoid cluster and useless rant and feelings I had about each character I will keep it extremely general.This Anime has absolutely superb cast. Not only I loved main characters, I did absolutely enjoy side-characters as well. All of the characters have for starters superb stereotype presentation as their working character/personality. After all Anime is basically about ""cosplay cafe"", but more of a ""impersonation cafe/character cafe/stereotype cafe"". Of which each character was absolutely superb at. Second thing, is that their actual/real personality were as well extremely fun and lovable, whereas their real characters had as well two sides to them. So In a sense it\'s Anime about stereotype cafe, whilst actual character has as well some sort of a different stereotype with an undertone of other characteristics.In another words the way how characters are presented is simply one of the best things I\'ve ever seen in history of watching Anime. Type of characters/cast that I feel that I loved each of every one of them and wish they were real in a sense.In brighter, slice-of-life Anime with fantastic use of stereotypes, whilst giving them quirks is simply beautiful.Now you can Image how long this review could be if I would include piece by piece every character and let all thoughts and feelings I had regarding them flow in freeform review. It would be absolutely long, consider from a simple fact how long already general gist about characters is.TLDR; Superb use of stereotypes and various layers of different characters plus entirely fun cast including the side-characters.✦Enjoyment & OverallAside everything mentioned from before. I simply can\'t give it 10 as I feel it lacks something that I cannot explain. It\'s very possible that lack of something could be fulfilled by seeing this Anime reaching it conclusion. I might even end up reading Manga from lack of patience.Also gotta add, at start I thought I\'ll attach it tag ""BFBNF - Bloody Fun but Not Fav"", but you know what. Considering how much I loved this Anime even though it giving off feeling of ""it lacks something"", I changed my mind. This Anime definitely is going to my list of favorites.

Not fun as in action-packed and filled with cliff-hanger moments, but fun in the way only good slice-of-life can be. Looking at the characters and their happy lives just gives you a warm feeling in your stomach, while at the same time making you wish your own life was that happy-go-lucky. Seriously, these characters looked forward to every new day, and I looked forward to every new episode.Note: it’s not a high school anime, even though some of the characters are that age. It’s a workplace anime, albeit the workplace is a maid café.Each character was innately...likeable. Especially the parodies of the tropes: The tsundere(s), the sweet-natured sadist, the college age-imouto, the trap…even the more one-dimensional characters were portrayed well enough that watching them was entertaining.The manager’s relationship with Maika was plain adorable; despite their age gap I was cheering them on. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the anime brought in gamers and otaku – and realistically too! The teasing was good-natured and just served to show how comfortable they all were with each other. They were all basically one big family, and watching them brought a smile to my face.It didn’t matter what they did; none of the activities would have been particularly exciting in themselves. There’s the daily life of running the café and interactions with customers, the shopping episode, the obligatory beach and onsen episodes and the ‘date’ episode. Nothing original, but the characters make watching it all worthwhile. Even the fanservice was tastefully done and not shoved in your face all the time.The art is sweet, and the animation is passable. Good on the main characters, but no detail spent on any of the minor characters (most of them don’t even have eyes). The music was marvellous. Bonus points for the opening; love the memes.In short, it’s a nice easy watch if you’re looking for a way to pass some time. A rom-com slice-of-life anime that’s a level above most.

I couldn\'t believe that this series was not greatly appreciated by many and it was set aside as something plain and stereotypical. Average story, I agree but a unique plot. Or maybe not that really unique. It has its own good sides though. The comedy factor of this show was actually off the charts. As soon as you start watching, you\'ll get hooked on right away. The best part...of this show was probably the art and animation and I see that A-1 pictures spared no effort just like with their more popular series. I can say the same for the soundtrack and voice acting as it seemed that everything fit in nicely. Regarding the ""surprise"" character, it seemed different from the usual kinds and this one isn\'t something that needs protecc-tion and it\'s not really exaggerating or stereotypical unlike the ones of its kind. Aside from that, the I loved the rest of the characters and their synergy with each other is just so perfect. I was thinking that I enjoyed this show more than I should have but.. it went well for me anyway. The ending was decent and maybe a good choice of ending.

Ir had been a long time since this genre had such a good show.

Tho it was a great year for the community, in the end, it didn't had that many great anime. Sure, some were great, but I am speaking numbers. It were few good anime, and in the romcom genre, it had...2-3 tops. Blend-S was the fresh breeze of the last season of this complicated year. Usually, the ending on a somesortof cliffhanger would annoy me, but due to its popularity, I am not even considering getting conserned about a second season. It is happening.

Dot.-8/10Will rewatch, will protect, will watch season 2."", ""Blend-S is the story of Maika, a girl who can't help but seem to come off as having a sadistic smile, but she's really sweet and innocent, she can't help how she smiles! She also has a love for anything of the western culture. In the first episode she come across the manager of a themed café. The theme is that it has servers of your stereotypical anime girl, so there is a tsundere, and the little sister type at the start. Because of Maika's smile, he wants her to work as the sadist type of character.And so we follow these main two characters as...they add new people to the café and they try to dance around the fact that they love each other, but can't really say it. One because the manager is too timid, and the other being that Maika is either the most oblivious person ever, or she's just totally keeping him in the friend zone.Taste: Have you ever had something that you thought was tasty at first, but as you kept eating it, you got pretty tired of it pretty quick? That's this show. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this show can be a prime reason as to why a love triangle is better for story telling. The other thing that they really failed to explore, was the workplace itself. All of our stories basically revolve around what everyone is up to, before or after work.Next the characters don't really have much that really has them stick out. I think a reason for this is that we don't really see much in the way of struggle. Koho has an episode where she needs to study, but I can't think of anything else where things got away from things being easy going. Now, I get that this is mostly a romantic comedy sort of show, and that drama doesn't need to take place to get things going, but they just kinda fail in the romantic, and miss too much in the comedy.Maika, our main character, really needs to be that sadist she's trying to play as, and the show makes her too cute. Which makes her bland. Her art most of the time is that of a cute anime girl, even when she's smiling and being nice to the customers. I come off as thinking that the writer wanted to have their cake, and then also eat their cake. By this I mean. She's billed as being accidentally sadistic. But she never comes across as that way. She's always super nice, cute. Eh. I'm going with a 4 on taste. If this was like five episodes it would rank high though. 4 out 10Presentation: The art style is cute, and the music fits I'd say. Much like the rest of the show, nothing really stands out. I think they go to chibi too much, and the nose bleed is over done. I do like that they mix up hair styles at times, which is a nice attention to detail. I think they missed a great opportunity with Maika in how they booked and presented her though. And that causes me to dock the score. Like, say you're told you're food was going to be really spicy, but it just isn't. 2 out of 5Originality: The idea of this is that guy likes girl. Girl likes guy. But they can't admit these feelings. In a lot of shows it can be because the characters don't get their own feelings. Maybe because of their our issues. Or there can be conflict just getting in the way of things. This show makes it more seem like it's just the guy being gutless. I think the idea of a story being told within this fetish café could be really fun, but they kinda didn't do that so another 2 out of 5.In conclusion, Blend-S is a cute show, it has cute characters, and it has cute stories. Everything is cute. Forever cute. There is only cute. Nothing happens, only cute. They even have a character who is a trap. Everything is cute. This score is not cute. 8 out of 20 they add new people to the café and they try to dance around the fact that they love each other, but can't really say it.

Which makes her bland. Her art most of the time is that of a cute anime girl, even when she's smiling and being nice to the customers. I come off as thinking that the writer wanted to have their cake, and then also eat their cake. By this I mean. She's billed as being accidentally sadistic. But she never comes across as that way. She's always super nice, cute. Eh. I'm going with a 4 on taste. If this was like five episodes it would rank high though. 4 out 10Presentation: The art style is cute, and the music fits I'd say. Much like the rest of the show, nothing really stands out. I think they go to chibi too much, and the nose bleed is over done. I do like that they mix up hair styles at times, which is a nice attention to detail. I think they missed a great opportunity with Maika in how they booked and presented her though. And that causes me to dock the score. Like, say you're told you're food was going to be really spicy, but it just isn't. 2 out of 5Originality: The idea of this is that guy likes girl. Girl likes guy. But they can't admit these feelings. In a lot of shows it can be because the characters don't get their own feelings. Maybe because of their our issues. Or there can be conflict just getting in the way of things. This show makes it more seem like it's just the guy being gutless. I think the idea of a story being told within this fetish café could be really fun, but they kinda didn't do that so another 2 out of 5.In conclusion, Blend-S is a cute show, it has cute characters, and it has cute stories. Everything is cute. Forever cute. There is only cute. Nothing happens, only cute. They even have a character who is a trap. Everything is cute. This score is not cute. 8 out of 20"", ""Continuing on with my love of SoL anime is Blend S, which is basically a laugh all the way anime. Very enjoyable and definitely one of the best comedy SoL animes I've seen.*SPOILER ALERT*Story: The story begins with Maika trying to find a job to try and get rid of her sadistic self. She meets up with Dino, the owner of Cafe Stille(not sure whether I'm spelling correctly), who immediately recruits her to be a waitress(cos he likes her, duh). The story follows Maika and her interactions with the other staff of Stille, the Manager Dino and the customers of the cafe. Even though...she doesn't manage to get rid of her sadistic self in the end, she does manage to build a family-like relationship with the staff of Cafe Stille, with loads of laughs along the way with the manager faffing around and always getting into other peoples' way. I like how the story takes place in a cafe setting, makes me wanna go to a cafe😂😂😂(Akihabara/Ikebukuro I'm coming for you!!!!) Probably one of the best and definitely the funniest story I've seen in an SoL anime.Rating: 10/10Animation: The animation is quite detailed and very colorful, especially with the different colored maid suits which the characters wear and the occasional change of setting.Rating: 9/10Sound: Catchy opening and somewhat decent endingRating: 8/10Characters: One of the best and most diverse set of characters I've seen in a SoL anime. There are loads of different personalities associated with the characters, when working and when they're not. For example, Mafuyu isn't the most kind and gentle kind of personality, but when she's working, she transitions to the little sister personality which really impressed me. I do have a favorite character in the series, that being Maika/Kaho cuz sadism and tsundereism.They're pretty cute in spite of their sadism/tsundereism.Rating: 10/10Conclusion: Yea, the SoL animes in the future will face a huge pressure trying to impress me with masterpieces like Yuru Camp and Blend setting the standard. Definitely an anime I'll rewatch in the future!Final rating: 10/10 she doesn't manage to get rid of her sadistic self in the end, she does manage to build a family-like relationship with the staff of Cafe Stille, with loads of laughs along the way with the manager faffing around and always getting into other peoples' way.

This anime is so cute, I love the characters, I love the story, I love it all!I didn't think I'd like the comedy genre of anime very much, but damn it, this one is just so perfect! Akizuki is my bae, my boo. But honestly, I love each and every character so, so much. The best part is, they're SUPPOSED to be cliche. It's always annoying to watch something that's supposed to be series but turns out totally cliche, but these characters are meant to be the way they are, and...it's awesome!I'm just obsessed. I had so much fun watching Blend S. I saw the intro on Pewdiepie's channel, and he said it was a good anime, so I gave it a shot, and it. was. worth. it.I want everybody to watch it and gush over it with me. Oh my goodness, it was so great. I also love that there is a cisgendered crossdresser in this anime. Like, how cool is that???

Not to mention the cutest puppy in the whole wide anime world.Watch it!!"", ""Blend S was not the first show I picked off my to-watch list last season since it did not really pique my interest. At first, I felt like it was gonna be one of those shows that tried too hard to be cute and moe in order to catch viewers' attentions. But boy, was I wrong. This will be explained further in the later parts of my review.Well, let's start off with the show's Story(7):I gave this show's story a 7 (which is an average in my standards), mainly due to the fact that this show does not really have a central focus. I know...that this show is a comedy and does not have a main plotline to follow, but that also gives me a much more difficult way to provide a proper score. The show also has different pairings all throughout the series, but the main issue is the different plot holes and questions that arise inside the viewers' head about the relationships between those pairings even after the show has concluded. Basically, there are some parts left unanswered and that in itself may leave the viewers unsatisfied with how the show went.The show's Art(9):The show has a vibrant and colorful art style which gives off a very entertaining and fun vibe. This kind of art is common nowadays, especially in comedy shows as it accentuates the humour used in the show, making it easier for the viewers to understand the joke.The Sound(8):The show has a very catchy opening song, which has become viral due to the first few seconds of the song being turned into numerous jokes on the internet. The ending song does not stray from the main theme of the show, which is being cute. The choice of background music is also brilliant due to the amazing comedic timing this show possesses.The Characters(8):The characters in Blend S are lovable in a way that even when a character is designed to be annoying, you will not grow tired of them of wish for them to get removed from the show since they coordinate perfectly with the other members of the cast.Personal rating on Enjoyment(10):As I stated in the first part of the review, I thought that this was gonna be another try hard cute anime that repeat the same joke from the past decades, I was mistaken. I personally enjoyed this show to the point that I could not stop laughing everytime a comical seen pops out or a rather simple joke is spoken by one of the characters. There were even times when I would not realize how long it takes for me to watch one episode due to my constant rewinding to a certain scene in the episode.Overall, I recommend this series to those looking for a romantic comedy that provides you with different types of jokes in each episode. Although there may be times when a joke is reused, you will surely never fail to laugh due to the amazing execution done by the show. that this show is a comedy and does not have a main plotline to follow, but that also gives me a much more difficult way to provide a proper score.

It was too enjoyable.I never get bored of anime like this one; honestly, there would not be enough time in the world. It's not perfect in all aspects, but something about it just resonates with my being. Deep stuff.I honestly hope there will be a season 2, because the voice actors did a great job. My favourite character has to be Mafuyu. Having said that, whenever Hideri speaks normally he becomes the funniest character (which is not often enough sadly). Comedy 10/10I just wish it was longer. Also I really want to see some Kahozuki.AND please.... wife Mafuyu up...damn it. Endless potential. damn it. Endless potential."", ""Smile! Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! This show has such a huge hype during its airing that i could see the 5 S everywhere.  Well, after giving it a spin, i found it to be quite entertaining as a comedy relief with a little romantic spin and... that's it. While wholly entertaining, i didn't understand why everybody was super crazy over it. Sure, there were cute girls, the show's quite funny and the plotline is interesting but... that's it? The show isn't particularly Spectacular in any of the related terms. The only thing i could see being overhyped about was the opening, which really it...deserved one of the top spots on my cute anime OP list, close to Himouto and Gabriel Dropout. Everything else was somewhat a little above if not just average.Story: 7 / 10Yes, the story is funny, admittedly funny and the plotline is interesting : A girl who has an unnatural scary smile is put to work at Cafe Stille as a Sadistic role play. I really like the way this story is set, different girls with different personalities set to role play completely contrasting roles. Sweet to sadistic, otaku to tsundere, ecchi to sister, etc. It really gives a fresh perspective into the comedy genre and has a lot of new angle to work off on. It really did pay off, as the accidental sadistic nature of Maika is uncanny and funny as hell. On the other hand, the romance in this show feels unneeded and a bit forced. Sure, it was still funny how Maika's sadistic nature of turning the Manager down keeps you laughing but behind it all, the question that'll pop up is... Why? First of all, there's no real if not Any chemistry between the two at all (I know sometimes chemistry is not needed but that in itself already minus points). Secondly, Maika's reaction to the Manager's 'feelings' towards her is so deeply dense to the point it gets really annoying. Third, why is it needed!? With or without it, the show moves on fine, and since the romance doesn't get anywhere, it feels really unnecessary to the show. If you think about it seriously, it only serves as more comedic relief to the already funny show, which i believe could be dedicated more towards the girls and their role-plays (the 2nd minor problem of the show). Another problem to the otherwise great plot is the lack of roleplaying. Honestly, i would be more invested in the show if i was shown more of the girls and their roleplaying life in the cafe. Granted, there were scenes of them roleplaying but as it gets deeper into the show, the essence of it seems to just be gone, especially with the latter characters. It get a 7 for being pleasing to watch even with the lack of roleplay and the unneeded romance.Art 8 / 10:Not really anything much to talk about. The art is vibrant and its good use of effects for the different roleplays are suitable as well.Sound: 9 / 10This is where i feel the show really shines and is the crux of all the fan hype. The opening is refreshing because it's different, in the sense that it revolves itself around the word S, something that an anime has never done before. Paired with the catch fast beat and fresh way of singing, it becomes the epitome of cuteness for a song. (Though, the cuteness still can't compare to Himouto, IMO). The sountrack of the light skipping flute is soft on the ears and just puts a smile on your face as well.Character 5 / 10I love the characters and that's why i feel a 5 is needed. As i have explained above, the girls don't really get much of a development, both as a character and as a roleplay maid, especially with the two latter characters (Maika aside). With the story set in such a setting, it is such a waste that the story decided to focus more on Maika and the manager's working romance rather than more on the individuals as maids in the cafe. It is unfair to say there weren't any showings of their roles as maids or their personal lives, but i had hoped that the focus on each of them as a character would be more in depth. There also isn't much interaction (only the most minimal conversation and comments) between any of them apart from the 3 main maids and the interaction between the guys, which is a real pity since there were some really great scenes in the show that could help bridge that gap (the jungle theme scene). It is considered to be even more of a waste when their base character traits were already that solid, and have a good grasp on positive first impression on viewers. So, a 5 mark is given for the lovable yet not stretched to full potential characters.Enjoyment: 8 / 10Despite all i have said, i really like this show. It's one of the better comedy shows i've seen in quite a while, full of laughter, cute girls, lovable songs and a unique plot. But i feel that such a great anime could be better.Recommendation? Yes, definitely. Even though i can't think of why it's so hyped up, i would still recommend anyone who enjoys a good comedy to watch it, even more so if you love watching different character stereotypes, since it has a whole BLEND of Super Sweet Sadistic Surprises in store for you ;) ;) ;) deserved one of the top spots on my cute anime OP list, close to Himouto and Gabriel Dropout.

Even her siblings find her face unsettling. One day, she encounters a blondé man at the train station. The man seems interested in the girl, but he doesn't say anything. They do eventually meet each other again, this time the man offers Maika a job, and after being denied from so many, you know she's desperate. She accepts, and becomes an employee at Café Stile, which is basically a maid café.This is where we're introduced to our...cast. I forgot to mention that at Café Stile the maids are supposed to have a specific character trait. It's all just an act so the customers can have a better time. Maika is the sadistic character; her scary looks came in handy for her in the end. The customers seem to really enjoy her sadism. (Most of the customers are guys.) The man who offered Maika a job, his name is Dino Roma, the manager. His obsession with Maika is a little creepy. Akizuki is the chef of Café Stile. He seems like one of the more normal characters in the show, yet he does act a little goofy sometimes with his love for manga. Kaho is the big breasted broad who adores gaming. Her character trait is the tsundere. Mafuyu, the college student who looks like a elementary school student. I appreciate Mafuyu's character a lot, because she looks much younger than she actually is, and I can relate. When I got my first part-time job, many of the customers and some of my co-workers were confused by me, because they thought I was too young to be working there. Mafuyu is probably my favorite girl in the show. She loves collecting figures and watching anime. She plays the imouto character. Next, we have Miu.

But that\'s to be expected, and if you\'re watching a slice of life anime, you probably already know that.Even if slice of life isn\'t really your thing, I\'d still recommend at least giving the show a few episodes. There are plenty of genuinely funny moments and lots of laughs to be had.The characters were all very cliché,...but the show is so self aware about it that it just about gets away with it.

She gets hired, and the rest is history. You get to see the daily working lives of these people, throw in a potential romance or two that end up going nowhere and you\'ve got yourself a show. It doesn\'t get much deeper than that though. We get a little more of a detailed look at a couple of the characters but for the most part, what you see is what you get.The art style was good, very clean looking and well animated. The show often took on a more chibi animation style, this was usually done for comedic affect, but was sometimes a little distracting.

If you like deep and well thought anime this show ain't for you. The lack of character development and goal of the series is rather too distracting if you watch it for the story and criticism.Art: Well What can I say? The art is outstanding for a slice of life anime. TBH I prefer A-1 pictures to produce this kind of...shows rather than fantasy/action ones. The detail given to the characters are awesome though you can sometimes notice still frames it's part of the budget cutting anime industries use. I was distracted on how well they animate kaho's tits jigling and doesn't give great detail to certain scenes.

Blend S.Blend S is one of the cutest and most wholesome series that I've ever watched which is really surprising when you read the description that the main character is a sadistic one but the series manages to turn them into some of the cutest characters I've ever seen. The cast for Blend S are all funny and unique with the characters they have to play in the store which creates some great comedy to see the disparity between their character and real self. Maika and Mafuyu being the best...examples with Maika's unintentional sadistic remarks and expressions being the best part of the series in my opinion. Its a hilarious running joke that Maika wants to be nicer to the customers but ends up just being more sadistic which that in itself is enough reason to watch the series.The soundtrack of the series is to be expected cute and catchy to match the theme of the anime with some nice insert songs with some of the montages throughout the show. The OP being one of the most recognisable and catchy I've ever seen with the well know Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service which reinforces the theme of the anime which I really like.One of my favourite parts of the anime is the relationship between the Manager and Maika and the hilarious scenes that come out of the manager trying to confess his love to Maika which adds another layer of wholesomeness.The art style is very nice to look at having that smooth wholesome look really makes the character designs look even better.The series has major re-watchablility so if you want a series you can go back to Blend S is great. No matter how many times I go back to this series I never get sick of the jokes and Maika's hilarious sadistic expressions.Overall an amazing series and I'd highly recommend to those who either love slice of life or wholesome anime.9/10 will definitely re-watch over and over again. examples with Maika's unintentional sadistic remarks and expressions being the best part of the series in my opinion.

I laughed out loud, like hard, at least once every episode.-The girls are super cute and very love-able. Mafuyu is best girl. The service dudes are hilarious.-Not much of a story, but each ep is it's own tale. Pro tip: beach ep is #6.-Sound is great, there's a reason the OP is a meme but it's catchy as hell.

That\'s not the only use of the meme, it also sums up this anime, they are stile and this is their everyday lives. But the problem of this anime is that you can\'t differentiate this from other Slice of Life anime. The only thing differing this from the other SoL anime is the meme and the concept (and possibly the trap too.). Why? You\'ll see why.Let\'s start with the story, the anime is about...Cafe Stile\'s employees and their lives. Pretty simple, right? But the thing is, they have to act according to their persona while working, which is pretty different than other feel-good SoL anime. There isn\'t any action or drama whatsoever happening in the story rather than romance. I rate the story a 7. It\'s good, it\'s a good plot.The art is good, nice character design, if you see their silhouettes, you\'ll know it\'s the Blend S cast immediately. It is also suited for this kind of story, the light feeling of the art. Therefore it\'s a 9.The opening and the ending is nice! Especially the opening, not because of the memes, it\'s because of the upbeat feeling! You\'ll pretty much be in a happy mood after hearing the opening. And the ending, it\'s so calming even if it\'s an upbeat song... The opening and the ending is like complete opposites, while the opening makes you hyped up for the episode, the ending calms you down because the episode ended. The OST isn\'t really special howsoever, but it\'s normal for a SoL anime. I give it an 8.The characters are quite original for a SoL anime, there\'s the accidental sadist Maika Sakuranomiya, where she has a sadistic smile and accidentally do things that are sadistic therefore her personality while working is sadistic, she can be differentiated by the other waitresses because of her personality. The normal girl Kaho Hinata, which is a gamer. Her personality in the cafe is tsundere, however is different when you mention games in front of her. She\'s well, pretty cute and doesn\'t really have a over exaggerated personality. The real sadist Mafuyu Hoshikawa, she\'s a mature girl despite her height, she\'s a little sister while working, she\'s a good character, but this character is cliche. The older sister-like perverted girl Miu Amano, she\'s a nice character, you can differentiate her from other waitresses too. The trap idol, Hideri Kanzaki, well, we all know this one. The manager, Dino, he\'s a funny character that has a crush for Maika, he\'s got a nice personality and all, but it\'s pretty... uh, normal. And the cook, Kouyou Akizuki, which is a normal person, well, that\'s it.The only problem of these characters is the later episode characters, they have interesting concept and design, but they have minor roles after their introductions. So I give it a 6.Enjoyment is 8 for a feel-good anime, it does succeed to amuse me each episode.Therefore, the overall score is 6, it\'s a pretty normal feel-good anime if you realize later on and doesn\'t really give an impact to your mind.Thank you for taking the time to read this review and see you next time.

Although the show is in it's first few episodes as of this review it became apparent to me early on that the show was a lot more funny than what I initially perceived a show like this to be. It's like all the slice of life tropes were merged into one and this is the hilariously cringe love child that I thoroughly enjoyed. You feel more interconnected with the cast as each episode sails past. It's the kind of show you...just want to kick up and watch in an entire day. I loved the art style and was what was originally, aside from the meme notoriety, the reason i picked up the show. The story was very interesting to say the least but I had a blast watching it making it a very entertaining watch. just want to kick up and watch in an entire day.

The characters overall don't have any deep developments. All in all its a light hearted comedy and the first one I have seen with a sadist with a gap moe. Most like this focus on the tsundere or yandere angle so this gap sadist was a fun and cute change.While Maika's sadist looks are the main focus all the characters have a bit of a gap making they all different and unique.Since the show has not real progressive plot so it can be hard to watch but if you're just looking...for a laugh this is good show. for a laugh this is good show."", ""**ADDS TO FAVOURITES**I was first drawn to watch this anime just because the main character, Maika, looks a whole lot like Ririchiyo from Inu x Boku SS, an anime I really liked and watched at least 7 times already.I don't even need to finish the anime to say that it's already one of my favourites! I'm very picky when it comes to SOL animes, but this one got me hooked from the very beginning with its amusing, funny and charming plot!I love the chemistry between the main two characters, and the personalities of all the characters are just as great!Its funny, it has its...romantic parts that make you ship REAL BAD and just everything about it is just so perfect!

That\'s exactly what I got in Blend S, although with a few added bonuses.Just a notice, if this review seems a bit jumpy and less focused, it\'s probably because I just finished 3 series today without stopping. With that in mind, have fun reading!Story: Blend S, in my opinion, doesn\'t have an actual story. It has a ""4-koma feel"", mainly because its antics seem like they could be watched in any order as long as you know the characters in the event. So, instead of...talking about story, let me talk about the comedy aspect. Blend S does a nice job of showing the characters using their antics and occasionally failures. The comedy aspect shows up whenever the characters have to assume their roles within the cafe. This especially shows whenever Maika\'s sadistic face is shown to Dino, despite the fact it is always unintentional. However, despite being a comedy, Blend S also fits in another category: romance! Because you can create 3 ships within this anime, it makes for an obvious rom-com feel. (By the way, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ARGUE KAHO X AKIZUKI IS STILL THE BEST SHIP)Art: Blend S\' art is pretty normal. It doesn\'t have much that would stand out, aside from Maika\'s sadistic face and the fact that Hideri always has a cat face. Speaking of cats, is he trying to copy Rin? i thought he was nicoSound: Voice acting in Blend S was really good. Maika\'s transitions from normal to sadistic worked out well, and the complete character changes needed between the different characters all were well done. I especially liked when Mafuyu went from sounding like a college student that has no will to live to a character that sounds like complete and udder jailbait. Also, could I have a moment to talk about that theme song? It\'s amazing.Character: The character aspect was supposed to be the strongest point in Blend S, and I think it was. However, there were still some things that could have been done better. The characters were built up, and each had a distinct character, but I thought that there could have been more done for them. Maika ends up being a misunderstood person with a sadistic face, but there isn\'t much else to her character except for the fact that she\'s oblivious to Dino\'s confessions. Before I go ramble on about the other characters in depth, I think it\'d be better if I gave an opinion on them.Akizuki is a great straight man, and I think he was well done, especially with the antics he gets into with Kaho. Dino is an ok character, really only used to build up Maika, and for the occasional police joke. Kaho was done using the power of an episode featuring her and Mafuyu, which showed both of their true personalities, but ended up making them not stand out as much to me. Miu, on the other hand, was the most attention grabbing for me. Not only was she paired with Hideri to produce some questionable scenes, but she also was the Shimoneta-esque kind of character who was used time and time again. Lastly, Hideri. Hideri joined in late, but struggled for to grab my attention aside from the fact that his VA is also Nico and the fact that he\'s a trap. if Hideri was given an episode with Miu, I think his character could have gone deeper.Enjoyment: Wow, that was a long character segment. Anyways, Blend S, in my opinion, was a pretty good anime. It had me smirking at certain moments, which is rare seeing how I watch anime without showing much emotion. Miu\'s antics were usually the culprit for my smirks, seeing how my humour is similar to hers.Overall: Blend S was a nice experience for me. It had its flaws, but I always came back to watch the same loveable cast of characters. However, I would say that if someone wanted to watch Blend S, they should have some fun in dirty jokes and such, seeing how it\'s something used fairly often. That being said, if that\'s what you\'re into, I\'d totally recommend Blend S for those days where you need an extra meme in your day. talking about story, let me talk about the comedy aspect.

The characters are good they develop relationships over time and have their work personalities.

Now the cafe is rather odd as are the people working there, but there are no unlikable or patently ridiculous characters. I'm not saying everyone loves each other, I'm just saying they get along in entertaining and unique ways.As a slice-of-life, I expect enjoyable characters and funny or witty content that doesn't necessarily have to be related, and with Blend S, my appetite is fulfilled without it being too repetitive with its characters and tropes, a trap other slice-of-life's tend to fall...into.

To me the most important thing in this anime was the cafe and seeing how the characters developed and acted, sadly the cafe got somewhat irrelevant after a while. For me thats where the anime went from a great promising anime to a ""fine"" anime. Its surely still good, and I\'d recommend to watch it. I just think it could\'ve been done better if they had focussed more in the cafe. After a while I had...totally forgotten that the anime was about a cafe that had thematic waitresses with different personalities. It was just... not relevant to the story anymore. totally forgotten that the anime was about a cafe that had thematic waitresses with different personalities.

It\'s just a girl who works at a cafe where she plays a sadistic character. But, what she does is hilarious.Art (10/10): It\'s very nice and has a ""moe"" vibe. A-1 Pictures is very good at adapting multiple art styles and I think that they or Kyoto Animation are the best picks for the art.Sound (8/10): The opening is a mediocre ""girly"" anime opening, but it\'s very funny, I\'d say.

The love contradictions between the Manager and Maika were very entertaining simply because of the small misunderstandings that occurred between each other. My major highlights are when the police are involved (when a police officer...rests his hands on manager because he believes that the manager may be a criminal or when Akizuki walks in on manager and Maika while misinterpreting the scene.) This is what made me single-handedly enjoy watching every episode of this series, However, that being said how the story wrapped up was a bit half-hearted when Maika reveals that she loves manager and everyone else equally. Apart from that I enjoyed the blissful strand of events by this questionable misunderstanding of a series... anyway 8/10Art & SoundThe art style reminds me of 'moe' which makes sense because the topic of moe is mentioned several times throughout the duration of this series. I do feel that this is the most suitable form of animation for the genre and an eye catching style as well. After reading many manhwa, coming back to anime with this style is certainly refreshing. The VA is suspicious af out of context, how the female characters grunt is similar of H* which made it extremely difficult watching without headphones but I do appreciate the effort to produce such interesting quality of sound. overall both are deserving of * 7/10 - art * * 8/10 - sound *Character:I found it interesting how the character palette was progressive, the characters weren't all apart of the cafe. Moreso, I enjoyed the introduction of each characters and their backgrounds since they somehow felt appropriate for the mood of the waitress' personality (i.e Maika tends to have harsh eyes so it makes sense that her eyes along with a sadistic tone of voice could compliment a sadistic waitress personality) In my opinion, the characters are very minimal yet develop with their own diverse traits and backgrounds. Very enjoyable to watch simply due to catering to variety!9/10 for character :)Enjoyment:As an action/Mecha/opmc fan, I didn't have much trouble watching this series but it was good they decided to opt for 12 episodes. This is generally my attention span for Slice of Life/Comedy series as they tend to lose their value because of repetition or bland/no plot - (either focus on comedy or slice of life as the sole attraction) However, I would say this was fairly interesting to watch especially with the addition of Hideri! - Enjoyment 8/10 rests his hands on manager because he believes that the manager may be a criminal or when Akizuki walks in on manager and Maika while misinterpreting the scene.)

That\'s common in CGDCT and most of the time it\'s fine if they know what they\'re doing. The problem with Blend S is that it didn\'t know how to use their uniqueness as opportunity to make the show better than average. Actually, they probably don\'t even know how to do CGDCT properly.All CGDCT anime have the same main point: To make cute girl doing cute thing. So almost if not all of it will be very generic and have little to no story at all. However, what separate...good show away from other is how it utilize the small uniqueness of it and how they make it enjoyable. Blend S have it uniqueness too, they have all kind of well-known personality in Japan: Tsundere, Yandere, Imouto, Oneesan and Idol. This can be used as opportunity to make the show climb away for average point (even though it might not be that far even when utilized it anyway by how generic it is.)However, Blend S didn\'t utilize those personality. They do, but only when girls are serving in cafe which surprisingly didn\'t have much screen time either. Most of the time being used during all 12 episodes are on behind the scene nonsense stuff of cafe instead. It\'s not that horrible idea and might be better than using all 12 episodes to serving in cafe only but this idea make the uniqueness of the show even lower to non-existence.Another problem is Blend S lacking of fan service. When CGDCT have nothing to show, at least give some fan service is decent idea. Blend S barely do fan service at all beside beach episode. Honestly, I don\'t even feel like it\'s fan service in beach episode either.....Blend S also have main focus heavily on Maika. Like c\'mon I know Maika supposed to be main focus but at least put somewhat focus on other girl too? Other girl barely have main screen time at all. It\'s all Maika accidentally do scary face all over and over again.So in the end, it\'s CGDCT anime that cute girl barely doing actual cute thing. Main focus is only on Maika and fan service is lacking. Those ""Smile, sweet, sister, sadistic, surprise, service"" only have sadistic of Maika.

The fact is, many anime are aiming at this otaku cliché (you know : an ugly disgusting shut-in that likes young girls skirts and is afraid of reality).The thing is, the anime community has grown so much, that this otaku cliché is now barely a fraction of the actual market. Now would be a good time for anime studios to realize that.Because if kids would like such a childish anime, clearly they are not the target.STORYIt\'s about...a café who hires young girls as ""actor-maids"": they have to serve a client, while playing a role.Now the concept is interesting.

But anime wouldn\'t let me. F to pay respects. In watching anime, I have grown many strange attributes to encompass my otaku shell, one of those attributes was my immense love for females who are unable/have trouble expressing emotion. This class of 2D girl is dubbed as the kuudere, or emotionless girl if you want to separate with respect to the technicalities. With this incredible desire...for such a woman to coexist with me. I can only wonder what life will be like if such a human being actually existed.Although Blend S doesn\'t really answer that question it is a fantasy that I would love to mix with the kind of woman of my interest. With, yes, maid Cafes. Why not go wild and just mix your fantasies with other fantasies. God bless Japan. You are welcome to end my life. If that should be what you want to do.Narrative:Blend S is a normal s.o.l anime, you can expect no end goal with the only story being told is that of the time our protagonist, Maika Sakuranomiya, as she works for the maid cafe ""Stile"". You can also expect that one beach episode and the odd day or two off from work. I suppose relatively speaking it is a rather generic anime with a story, though as a standalone it isn\'t so bad. No real bad writing could come with s.o.l like so if I am honest, though there wasn\'t an attempt for the anime to get any better as well. Could it have been done? I would imagine it couldn\'t, considering the realm it fortified itself into. But again, nothing bad.Onto the characters and it is in the same wave as the story, no one exceptional, though no one detestable, disregarding personal preferences in who you like when it comes to a unique personality someone possesses. I feel like the characters were all made in a good way, conveying real personality to them with each individual. Sometimes I feel like Dino\'s character is unrealistic at times, using the easy way out of being that one silly guy getting himself into trouble, whilst concurrently behaving as he should at times. Other characters usually stick to their guns with no inconsistencies at any point. Dino really feels like that one dude who can change whenever the writing says so just because.Audiovisuals:For a 2017 anime, relatively speaking, the show could be so much better than what it has presented. The aesthetics really isn\'t anything new and you could probably get something similar a few years prior to this airing. As a standalone though, this is good. It looks nice to watch but doesn\'t really show off anything. It is visually ok. The audio side of things and it was the same with the visuals, no real-time to shine, which was a shame, but by no means was it anything distasteful, not that I remember half the OST, but it was indeed nice in the moment, otherwise, I would have complained about that. OP and ED were pretty good. Considering the OP is already a meme, you will probably love listening to it, assuming you like meme culture. ED was good in itself, I liked it more than the OP to be honest. Nothing bad in any case for the two.Enjoyment:Like pretty much every s.o.l ever, with no character development or ending goal to be reached, there needs to be some kind of universal enjoyment factor for it to at least be worth the while, not good, but worth the time. It will obviously vary from person to person, however, Blend S is clever, I haven\'t watched a ton of anime that centre around maid cafes but considering the entwinement of the otaku culture and maid cafes, well, all the jokes in between can let loose! I think the relatableness of Blend S can make it a very enjoyable experience for any anime fan simply because it is relatable. A dude who loves yuri, a gamer girl, an ecchi doujinshi creator, a real surprise, an adult who loves bishoujo figures, it goes on and on with no end, and it doesn\'t even try that hard, which makes it better. I think you can get a thing or two out of the anime with regards to enjoyment no matter who you are, the anime in itself pokes the otaku culture with the concept itself.That is really the only enjoyment in the anime, there isn\'t anything else really that Blend S does that is what I would call some form of organic comedy. Everything seems to have been picked out from what was already there instead of trying to invent some new ideas itself. I guess you could say it was doomed in that aspect as thinking about it now, there really isn\'t a place where such original comedy could come about. In any case, however, it is a pretty joyous experience.Overall - 6.4 (6)----------TLDR Review:Story - 6: Working at an eccentric maid cafe and the life behind itAudio - 6: ""in the moment"" sounds, most likely won\'t come out remembering these OST. But OP and ED were fine.Visuals - 6: Fine visuals. Nothing too good though.Character - 7: Fine characters, each with their own fun and real personalitiesEnjoyment - 7: Otaku culture jokes! Can\'t go wrong with that.Overall - 6.4 (6)----------And so, I leave Blend S with yet another fantasy to think upon, and an even stronger will to reach the East Asian country ""日本"". Honestly, this probably won\'t go down as anything special in my anime life, but I feel the anime is one that will be memorable in some shape as you go forward with this cursed rabbit hole of nonstop good and bad cartoons with Japanese speakers. Where did I go wrong?I would recommend this to anyone, though, I feel as if it would be a better watch if you:1. Have watched a decent bit of anime multiple genres2. Understand a little bit about borderline hardcore otakus and the culture3. Are an open-minded personOtherwise, this anime might go wrong for you.Saremo lieti di rivedervi presto! for such a woman to coexist with me.

Where did I go wrong?I would recommend this to anyone, though, I feel as if it would be a better watch if you:1. Have watched a decent bit of anime multiple genres2. Understand a little bit about borderline hardcore otakus and the culture3. Are an open-minded personOtherwise, this anime might go wrong for you.Saremo lieti di rivedervi presto!', ""I liked this Anime because of the funny characters and their traits. The OP was amazing and every character was entertaining.They all had there little quirks and outside of there work they also had diffrent personalities.

Sakuranomiya Maika, our heroine, is trying so hard to be a self-sufficient working teenager only to be constantly rejected due to her cute-yet-sadistic eyes. Fortunately, she finally gets to use such fierce quality for the better, that is by part-timing as a sadistic waitress at a character-esque otaku cafe. Most otaku would probably join onboard Blend S for the idiosyncrasy of the waitresses...at Stile Cafe (one of the waitresses is even a femboy waiter), but that would have also been a soft insult for the good people of A-1 Pictures. Looking closer and without wearing the googly-googly bifocals, it can be seen that A-1 Pictures had truly done their homework to a ""T"" and therefore, deserves better credit.Taking out the cuteness of K-On!, the camaraderie of Working!!, and the unexpected elements of Nozaki-kun, it is as if A-1 Pictures had put all of those key ingredients into a bowl, then boiled them, spiced the whole combo with pampering key background art and catchy songs, and finally, we had our Christmas entertainment. Of course, though, Blend S is not a perfect anime itself. Sometimes the humor could get inconsistent and the introduction of new supporting characters could have taken place on earlier episodes (which is usually a typical flaw of rom-com anime, i.e. Wotakoi). The series finale also feels more like an afterthought as opposed to the ribbon that puts the whole 12 episodes together as a perfect Christmas gift for its fans.At the end of the day, there is always something to be grateful for after enjoying an almost-perfect anime.

Being set in a character cafe ends up being pretty much irrelevant as far as the show\'s comedy goes, with the same gags being repeated so often it\'s as if the writers ran out of ideas past the fourth or fifth episode. Eventually, the show resorts to changing settings in order to generate new situations, yet these fail to produce anything novel or interesting.This wouldn\'t be such a problem if the cast of Blend S were interesting by themselves, but even by a comedy\'s standards they\'re flat and trope-y....The introduction of new characters did little to change the existing dynamics within the cast, and progress the ""story"" forward (although, to be fair, there isn\'t really a story to begin with). Again it feels like the writers ran out of steam and failed to come up with new ways for the characters to express themselves and distinguish themselves from existing tropes, so what\'s left are boring interactions that drag on well past their welcome towards the latter half of the season. I also felt that the characters seemed a bit inconsistent, like Maika\'s ditziness getting more and more exaggerated towards the end. Normally this wouldn\'t be an issue, except for this show it felt like a desperate attempt to find new punchlines.The art is good, if not particularly unique.

Tight your butler suit and be ready to say a ton of s-words, here is my review of Blend S.Story: 7/10 {spoiler free}Maika is a 16-year old girl who wants to learn to earn money by herself and she ends up in Stile, a...maid cafe. But Stile is a special maid cafe, because it has multiple kinds of 'lewd' characters: Sadistic, Tsundere, Sister, Older Sister and Idol.

And when I say random, it meant going on an anime picker site and relying on my luck that I’ll be able to spend my time well. Well, as fate would have it, luck was on my side.Here’s my review on another cute series, Blend S.StoryBlend S pretty much laid out its intentions from the get-go: it’s a comedy focused on making fun of itself. You don’t even need to guess which tropes the show will fulfil since you’ll know from the first line of their iconic opening song. We’re made to expect...the ‘Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service’ set of characters in the show, hence ‘Blend S’. The cast is filled with over-the-top personalities and exaggerated slice-of-life moments, making Blend S a light, easy watch.Aside from the setup of how Maika joined the café, there isn’t much of a storyline. The cast just goes on about their day-to-day lives as they work, stressing out over the smallest of things and bonding over them. Such scenes add a realistic touch to the otherwise excessive reactions the characters put on.The closest thing we got in terms of story development is the love lines forming among the staff: Maika and Dino, and Kaho and Kouyou. While I do find these pairings adorable, I find the awkward KahoxKouyou pair more enjoyable to watch. This pairing just seemed natural. Though it didn’t negatively affect my perspective on this couple too much, the age gap between MaikaxDino paired with Dino’s obsession with Japanese culture as a foreigner just didn’t sit right with me.The only thing that did bother me on the second half of the series was that Miu and Hideri’s coverage felt insufficient. It could be due to the short episodes and that they were introduced later, but it’s a shame that we didn’t get to know them as well as the other characters. They didn’t get to do much apart from just filling in the missing pieces of the trope package.CharactersEvery single member of the cast has their own roles to play that make them quite adorable, even the side characters like Maika’s eccentric older siblings. But while each one has its cute attributes, it’s their interactions with each other that stood out more for me.I felt that in general due to the lack of depth and opportunity to explore these characters, they are very much one-dimensional. There isn’t much complexity to the cast and what you see is what you get when it comes to them.MaikaThe art style is probably most likely to blame with this one, but they didn’t balance out her cuteness with her supposed mean look. If we don’t get the constant reminders about her eyes, viewers will have a hard time figuring out what about her appearance is scary-looking. While her clumsiness and unintentional sadism show the dark side of her character, that doesn’t really explain the initial problem we were told she has.All I saw was this small ball of cute.DinoI get that the highlight of the show and café are the girls in the show, but I wished they tried harder in setting him apart from other weird otaku foreigners found in other shows. A blond, blue-eyed guy binge-watching anime until late at night and obsessed with Japanese culture (not that I can blame him but still)… What’s worse is that he’s a bit too obsessed over a 16-year-old girl that fits his delusions about the ideal Japanese woman.They framed the manager and Maika’s scenes and relationship in a good light and we’re supposed to feel the romantic atmosphere around them. But while those are cute, the context of the whole setup is just too weird that no number of fluffy moments could hide that. I just turn my brain off, so I can enjoy the rest of the show…Art and animationA-1 Pictures nailed the art and animation for this series. The bright pastel colours and crisp lines make it a delightful show to watch. Even the food in the show makes me drool! Food in anime can be unfairly appetising.I liked how each character has their own colour that represents them, and this is reflected in the uniforms worn as well. The character designs are cute, but not necessarily unique. But as mentioned previously, they may have overdone the cuteness factor that then affects the credibility of Maika’s dilemma.SoundtrackWhen it comes to the music, I can’t mention their opening song, ‘Bon Appetit’ by Blend A (the VAs of Maika, Kayo and Mafuyu). Never thought I’d hear the word ‘sadistic’ sung/spoken in such a manner. Unfortunately, the opening song made such a strong impression that the rest of the music of the series kinda got overshadowed by it. I don’t really feel the other tracks stuck to my head.Final ScoreIf you’re looking for a unique storyline with solid character design/development, this is probably not for you. Despite that, Blend S is a great show to wind down to and relax with. It doesn’t try to take itself too seriously and is a good series if you just need a bit of a laugh. Maybe I’ve been taken in with the great animations, as even with its lack of depth this was an enjoyable watch, earning an 8/10 for me. the ‘Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service’ set of characters in the show, hence ‘Blend S’.

This show is exceptionally unexceptional. The show stars various characters working together at a maid café, and interacting with their customers with their own unique personalities to which they are assigned upon being hired. That is essentially it. Now don't get me wrong, my absolute favorite type of anime to watch is slice of life, maybe that's an unpopular opinion but honestly I can watch anime blobs just existing and doing nothing and have a great time, however this... this is just too boring even for me. The idea of maid cafés doesn't really entice me,...and I don't really care much about any of the characters here outside of the brilliant Hideri Kanzaki who remains the one thing keeping me returning to the show. The reason why K-On!! and shows like it work is because I can (and do) grow to love the characters in such a short amount of time that anything and everything they do is wonderful and a joy for me to watch, but if I can't even get behind the characters and the one amazing character doesn't show up until nearly the end of the series I have a lot more trouble getting into it. It's not a bad show by any means and I actually think it's alright, but honestly I just don't think this is anything too extraordinary or interesting.

It is a pure gem of fun and Maika being maika.', ""Blend S is a comedy romance with a lot of potential that seems to just barely miss the mark of being a good anime.Blend S has a somewhat novel take on the moe characteristics of the main heroine, Maika - she's an accidental sadist! While not something I thought I would enjoy, the character design is superb! She manages to come across the perfect amount of cute and hopeless <3Most of the rest of the main cast is equally wonderful in its design. This is the greatest strength of the anime as a whole. The juxtapositions between how each girl behaves in character vs...out of character keeps the anime fluid and dynamic - while also allowing a good deal of both comedy and romantic tension.By far the best use of this juxtaposition is the budding romantic tension between Kaho (the girl who roleplays as a Tsundere but is actually quite earnest) and her coworker Kouyou (the worker who is the true Tsundere). The chemistry between these two characters is endearing, believable, sweet and wholesome all at the same time!Unfortunately, with so many wonderful character designs, it is inevitable that some feel a bit underdeveloped. For instance, Miu (the Oneesan roleplayer) feels largely untapped through the runtime of the series.As for the actual story, it is primarily cute. The dynamic between the main cast of characters is comedic and earned some very hardy laughs from this viewer at least. I find myself routing for the characters to do their best and can't wait to see how the characters come to life on screen.Regardless, there are some notable issues with the main cast. While I have no issue with femme boys in general, there are a few too many scenes where the handling of Hideri leaves much to be desired. For instance, there is a scene where Hideri (passingly dressed as a girl) needs to use the bathroom and heads to the women's room. Miu, the doujinshi artist, forcibly stops him and directs him to the men's restroom. A bunch of Japanese men then rush out with noticeable confusion their faces. The audience is supposed to find this... funny? However, I am just left scratching my head going - why not just use the girl's restroom? Wouldn't that be more discrete?Further, the premise of the relationship between Maika and Dino is a bit problematic. Dino is the manager of the cafe and an adult foreigner. Maika is a high school student and seems somewhat unaware of her bosses affections. While I have no issue with the age difference or power dynamic differences in these sorts of anime (taboo fantasy fulfillment is kind of the point) the way they play off Dino as comic relief is kind of confusing to the tone of the anime in general. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but there is even real world consequences to his expression of interest in Maika that ends up being played off as funny, but should be quite serious. Realistically, nothing would have been lost in the anime if they had just made Dino another worker and like 19 instead of an older manager. Honestly, I kind of wish they just did that. It would even make more sense as to why he's so inept with women.In terms of animation quality, A1 pictures gives us a peek at perfection but takes some major shortcuts. They have really hit their stride in capturing the unique moe designs of the main cast. However the silhouetting of background characters comes across as sloppy and distracting. For the studio that showed us it can create beautiful settings and characters with SAO and Eromanga Sensei, these kinds of shortcuts feel more at home in an indie studio than a major animation studio.As with many anime that have ongoing source material, I didn't expect a definitive answer to the will they won't they question from the ending of season 1. As expected we did not get that. I would like to point out that both the official and fan translations for the manga are behind even what the anime adapted. So unless you know Japanese, this anime and its source manga will not satisfy your curiosity for the development of the characters for a long long time. While the lack of fan translations is hardly the studios fault,I cannot overlook that reality. Having something resembling a satisfying arc really helps with the feeling of a progressing story and the story just lacks something resembling true progression by the end of season 1.Blend S is an anime with cute designs and amazing potential that has some notable flaws in terms of story and execution. While the anime pokes fun at some tropes and will earn some laughs, I cannot really recommend this anime unless you are some sort of masochist that likes reading incomplete arcs. 6/10 out of character keeps the anime fluid and dynamic - while also allowing a good deal of both comedy and romantic tension.By far the best use of this juxtaposition is the budding romantic tension between Kaho (the girl who roleplays as a Tsundere but is actually quite earnest) and her coworker Kouyou (the worker who is the true Tsundere). The chemistry between these two characters is endearing, believable, sweet and wholesome all at the same time!Unfortunately, with so many wonderful character designs, it is inevitable that some feel a bit underdeveloped. For instance, Miu (the Oneesan roleplayer) feels largely untapped through the runtime of the series.As for the actual story, it is primarily cute. The dynamic between the main cast of characters is comedic and earned some very hardy laughs from this viewer at least. I find myself routing for the characters to do their best and can't wait to see how the characters come to life on screen.Regardless, there are some notable issues with the main cast. While I have no issue with femme boys in general, there are a few too many scenes where the handling of Hideri leaves much to be desired. For instance, there is a scene where Hideri (passingly dressed as a girl) needs to use the bathroom and heads to the women's room. Miu, the doujinshi artist, forcibly stops him and directs him to the men's restroom. A bunch of Japanese men then rush out with noticeable confusion their faces. The audience is supposed to find this... funny? However, I am just left scratching my head going - why not just use the girl's restroom?

I enjoyed every time she brought it out. I enjoyed most of the cast. They all fall into tropes more or less, but that's expected of this genre and doesn't detract from it at all. It's fun watching the characters interact.Nice art style too, it's got a nice color palette and pretty clean looking.Funny show, exactly what you'd expect to get from a light, SoL comedy show. It's all character driven and the comedy comes from watching the characters interact and how...their assigned personas in store contrast with their real personalities.Minor spoilers:The main reason this rating is a bit harsher than the rest of the review would indicate is specifically because of Maika and Dino. Once the show gets towards the last few eps it starts putting more focus on their relationship and developing it further in a way that implies it's not just unrequited. This felt really weird because Maika is very much a school girl, and Dino is an adult who runs a business.  He's 10 years older than her, and this isn't necessarily a problem, but in this case it just feels gross. The difference between where they are in life is too large. It started derailing the show in a direction that it really didn't need to go. If it stayed as a pure comedy all the way through this would have been about 7. their assigned personas in store contrast with their real personalities.Minor spoilers:The main reason this rating is a bit harsher than the rest of the review would indicate is specifically because of Maika and Dino.

It wants to be a show about moe anime girls working at a cafe and the antics that arise while working there. From the first few episodes it will be evident if the viewer will enjoy the series or not.The daily events that happen during the series can be cute, but overall feel forgettable. Many of the events or gags I could not remember soon after finishing the...series.As a comedy it also fails to cause laughter. During the entire series I probably only chuckled and genuinely laughed a couple times, but I mostly just sat in front of my laptop feeling either bored or annoyed with what was happening. Basic gags arise from the fact that the servers tend to be the opposite of what they play, with the Tsundere Kaho being really sweet and the Imouto Mafuyu being a cold-hearted college student. There are also a lot of jokes relating to Otaku culture that can sometimes hit, but still miss a lot of the time.Many stories during episodes feel like they abruptly end just so they can start doing something new without a proper conclusion. Stuff like Maika saving up money to move away is just forgotten about. It's a shame since they could have been used for decent comedic moments in the future.The show sometimes goes against itself, as earlier in the series we are told Maika wasn’t able to make friends until she started working but later she is shown to have friends at her highschool whom she interacts with and talks about her personal life. It’s not even presented as her being able to make new friends because of what's happening at work, rather she had these friends the whole time.There is also the romance between Maika and Dino which I found impossible to care about. The relationship boils down to Dino simping hard over Maika, but she is too dense to realise anything. Dino also has enough nose bleeds to probably save a life with the amount that gushes out everytime Maika does something sadistic. The comedy that comes from these situations aren’t anything special while I found Maika’s obliviousness to be more annoying to watch than endearing.Dino also comes off as a massive creep. Dude is a 26 year old trying to get with a high school girl 10 years younger than himself. Combined with his overall desperate vibe for love and attention, you kinda hope him and Maika never end up in a relationship.Most of the other characters aren’t that interesting either. When I think of these characters I can only remember the one thing about them like Miu being a doujinshi artist or Hideri being a trap. Unlike Dino the rest of the cast have a likeable charm, but they don't do anything interesting or funny to stay memorable.Two things I can give praise to would be the opening and art. While the opening got meme’d to death, I am able to get unironic fun out of watching it. The song is catchy and gives a good idea about who the characters are and what the show is about. The background art is nice for the different environments seen like the park or the ski resort. While the faces may feel copy & pasted and Hideri’s design just looks off, overall the different characters have decent designs that don’t hamper the viewing experience.In its final attempt to impress, the show ends on a bit of a whimper. The comedy and moe moments are up to the similar standard of the previous episodes. However the climax of Maika’s and Dino love arc is rather disappointing. Even as someone who was not invested in this love story I felt cheated by what unfolded. It just felt like a cop out when a natural conclusion could have been reached.I found Blend S kinda shit. The comedy and cute antics mostly failed to make me laugh or smile, but instead stare at my screen mostly disinterested. The story is nothing special, being filled with forgettable characters and scenarios that cause you not to care about what's going on. The romantic subplot of Dino and Maika came off more as a creepy simp trying to get their favourite streamer’s attention rather than cute and genuine.I understand why some may enjoy the show as comedy is subjective, along with moe moments that can be fun to watch coupled with good art, animation and music. For me however the few moments of enjoyment I got easily became outnumbered with feelings of annoyance and boredom.If you’re somewhat interested, at least give the first 2 or 3 episodes a shot. You will learn quickly if this show is for you or not.*Original Vid- https://youtu.be/GvlSwRCLDi0 series.As a comedy it also fails to cause laughter.

I had watched the meme of this intro for the past few years as it did grow to be quite the funny meme. But enough of that, I loved this show. It was rather cute and adorable to watch. The relationship between Dino and Maika is a bit weird what with how Dino likes an underage girl, but he is at least smart about it and doesn't make any real advances. Though that's partially due to him being a chicken. I found the introduction of the trap to be cute and the dog, even more so. The dog...was very funny in how it acted like Maika. I would have to say that my favorite episode is the one where they turn the shop into a jungle. I thought it was hilarious how they made it seem like it was so much bigger because of the plants. Overall, this was a great show and I would highly recommend it.Music:I really loved the intro and outro for this anime. I thought it was really cute and very upbeat. I had heard of the intro when the anime was coming out as it became the big meme that we all know and love. The voice acting was good and I enjoyed all of the sound effects. Overall, no complains sound or music wise!Characters:There was some good character development throughout the show, both in Dino and in Maika. I have to say that personally, I thought it was weird that Dino, a 26 year old is so interested in a little 16 year old. That was odd and I'm surprised there wasn't more pushback from the other co-workers, but I guess it never got too weird. I was when they introduced Hideri, as I was not expecting a male character like that. My favorite character from the show was Miu though. I loved how she acted and how her mind just go so quickly filled with sexy ideas.Story:I felt like the story was rather clear and friendly to the viewer, in that we got to know Maika and how and why Maika acts the way she does. Again, the story was a little weird with a guy like Dino drooling over Maika, but I guess its legal in Japan? I don't know, I would've slapped some sense into Dino either way. It was fun to watch all the characters get introduced throughout the episodes and to learn of some little secrets of each of them. I really feel like more of a bond could've been made between Kaho and Kouyou, but I digress. Each episode is fun to watch, and overall I liked how it progressed to the end where practically everyone knows the kinda love that Dino meant, but couldn't fully express. was very funny in how it acted like Maika.

It's like the anime culture and humor in a nutshell, so this is defnitely entertaining to all the otakus out there. Sometimes, the jokes aren't funny and there are also some cliche scenes. I was very excited when I started to watch the first episode especially when the beautiful opening started. However, I wish they dwell more into building up the story like hardships and challenges in the cafe or even relationship. But in the first place, it's not the sole purpose of the show. It just wants...to make people laugh and love the characters in the story. I would definitely recommend this to the people who are not new in watching anime because they're the ones who could appreciate this show more. to make people laugh and love the characters in the story.

Jk I loved this show but that is almost what I thought at the beginning of the show but I did get hooked after a few episodes. It isn't an action packed or romance filled show that has you on the edge of your seat so it might not be the best anime to binge watch. If you don't like Slice of Life anime I wouldn't recommend because that is its main genre with comedy added in. Like most comedy animes there is a lot of exaggeration but  most of the events are realistic in Blend S and...somewhat relatable. As I mentioned earlier there isn't much romance but there is some and I love it. The opening and ending are pretty good, I usually skip openings and endings but these were a little catchy.The characters aren't super deep and the story isn't very intricate but somehow its pretty entertaining.

The setting and the characters drive the show, making the initial viewing different than your standard SOL series. Once the romance subplot takes center stage the interest kind of takes a nose dive and it becomes a pretty weak romcom.I'm not a fan of the art style but I can see why it appeals to others. The main cast are all very distinct...and fit their tropes. The VAs are pretty good but other than the OP nothing memorable musically.The characters are interesting because you see their interactions with eachother how they normally are and their interactions with customers in their cafe when they're putting on their character acts for work. These dual personalities makes the minimal casting never feel too limited or underdeveloped. The weakest character would be the manager of the cafe, who's sole purpose is just to fawn over one of his employees and serve as the catalyst for the romance subplot to pick up.Blend S is pretty enjoyable but around the midway point the series starts to lose it's momentum. Worth a watch but by no means incredible. and fit their tropes.

This show can be simplified down to being a poor mans Working!!.The story revolves around Maika who is a girl with some troubles. She is unable to find a job because of her cold eyes and smile. However one day a manager for a cafe gives her a job. This cafe is basically a maid cafe but each female member of the staff role plays a personality. Maika is assigned the sadistic character trait because she has that cold look in her eyes.The characters were fun to watch. The gap between their real personality and...their work personality was sizable and seeing them go between them was fun. However everything is rather surface level. They take a few episodes to try and develop characters but it wasn\'t done very well.Overall I enjoyed the show. It was cute, funny and just a relaxing show in general. However its not really great in any department. Characters are flat, and only fun because of their work personalities. At first I thought the show would be more focused on that side of things, but they wind up going for the ""will these two characters get together"" story line. This really degrades the show as a whole, because they don\'t focus on the characters enough for you to care about them, and it kills of the simplistic comedy of the maid cafe. It winds up being forgettable.TLDR: Poor mans Working!!. Kinda cute, kinda funny, but just meh by the end. their work personality was sizable and seeing them go between them was fun.

Kinda cute, kinda funny, but just meh by the end.', 'A quick summary of how I felt about Blend S would be: a weaker version of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.The story I found to be pretty okay. The premise was interesting enough for me to watch it. Other than that the story really loses it self on figuring out when to focus on the romance between Maika and Dino, the relationship among the cast, or landing the right joke. The jokes were solid and some were genuinely hilarious (that whole river trip was gold). As for the ""real"" plot stuff, I think it could have been better. The stories tries to split itself between characters that...are interesting on screen together. This lead to some character set piece episodes like the one with Kaho and Mafuyu or the one with Miu and Hideri. There were developments that really didn\'t lead anywhere and I honestly think that could have been time making more jokes or better progression for the whole story. However as a SoL/romance/comedy I don\'t expect good story.Although I usually don\'t like it when shows put almost 0 effort in drawing background characters (no eyes and/or no color in almost every case) , I think Blend S can be forgiven for it. Its female characters are drawn very vibrant and cute which is all you really want from a show. What I do appreciate it for is the small things. Like Mafuyu only has her head showing when there are reaction shots to the cast. I found that really funny and a nice touch to the humor of the show. Also the photograph tuna during the river trip was way too funny not to bump them up a score. In the end its nothing remarkable but not horrible to look at.Not much to say about the sound. The OP and ED are fun and catchy. The incidental music is unremarkable but don\'t detract from the show either. I think it meets the minimum requirement for a show\'s soundtrack, nothing more, nothing less.Characters are probably why I enjoyed this show so much. Mafuyu playing the straight-man in this comedy carried the whole show. Although Mafuyu had her own quirks, her wit and real personality really helped liven up the entire cast and comic moments. Dino and Maika are entirely unremarkable to me but they are the tropey main characters so I ignored them for the most part. Kaho took the role of both the genki, otaku, and tsundere girl all rolled up into one. Also having her show semi-realistic insecurities and growth in her episode with Mafuyu was really enjoyable. Also her relationship with Akizuki is way too cute. Speaking of Akizuki also helped play a straight-man role alongside Mafuyu to a smaller degree. He seems to be the only one who actually cares about the financial stability of Cafe Stiles... Poor guy, he deserves better. Miu was fun in small increments and they did a good job of pacing her ""adult"" humor and making sure that the viewer wasn\'t swamped with multiple ""oh lol I think dirty thoughts"" jokes per episode. Hideri is also unremarkable and literally could be removed from the show and nothing would change.All in all it was a pretty enjoyable show. It\'s cute and has some pretty funny moments. I would probably have scored it better if they weren\'t so intent on Maika x Dino but I guess the show really wanted to press the romance. That\'s why I compared to Nozaki-kun because they share that core premise of hilarious scenarios occurring that revolves around a oblivious unrequited love scenario. Nozaki-kun knew when to develop that relationship and when to let the rest of the cast carry the show through their own dynamics and humor.

I know that the series is self aware of the genre and even kind of pokes fun at it... but that isn\'t enough to make it anything special.It\'s very middle of the road and stereotypical for the genre even as it tries to add it\'s own spin.The first thing you will experience is the OP, and I tell you the music is great. the song and music in this anime is actually pretty good and one of the...better parts.The visual style of the show, like many slice of life anime is ... pretty safe and basic. This is A-1 Pictures doing their usual thing with slice of life, but I personally found it pretty simplistic even for them (especially compared to other Slice of Life shows that they\'ve done). It isn\'t ugly at all though, it\'s clean, sharp, nice to look at, but it blends in with every other average show out there.The whole premise of the show is probably the weakest part. The story revolves around Maika Sakuranomiya supposedly having a scary looking smile. This is the hook of the whole show for the most part... and it\'s how she gets hired to fill a stereotypical role as a maid at a cafe. The thing is... her smile isn\'t that scary... actually the show tends to show her smiling like any normal anime girl quite a lot at random occasions. They just didn\'t push this enough... her scary smile really doesn\'t cause any problems with her and her co-workers, or like hilarious situations where they miss read how she actually feels or creates misunderstanding.The other members fill other stereotypical anime girl roles in the cafe, and in most cases their personalities are the exact opposite of their cafe persona. This contrast is again rarely played up. I believe there was one episode where they would start to break character as a maid. This was possibly one of the more interesting moments in it\'s 12 episode run.There\'s also an underlying romance in the show between Sakuranomiya and her manager Dino. You get the typical ""will they won\'t they"" romantic subplot going on that happens in a lot of slice of life anime that like most others... is left with little development cause they can\'t commit to pushing any sort of narrative to get invested in.__________________________________________The Bottom Line:It\'s average, mediocre fair even by Slice of Life standards...  and even A-1 pictures had already done another Anime in this genre a lot better. If you enjoyed this anime, I highly recommend the Working! series (although the original not the WWW. follow up). You get all the elements of Blend S with far better characterizations, more interesting story arcs and all in all a pretty solid conclusion to it.Who knows this was just the first Season, and it might get a lot better, but generally speaking it was just very plain. A short distraction from the every day, but something you will soon forget. better parts.The visual style of the show, like many slice of life anime is ... pretty safe and basic.

Being a total idiot about it.Really it\'s been so long since I disliked a characted that much, it\'s just a worthless character that gets rewarded for being an idiot, not helping at all or being a little responsible for his workplace, getting jellous so bad he doesn\'t want to even get more masculine personal.. And please, he\'s even jellous over a dog, and no, I\'m not joking...The only real reason that I got to finish this anime is because I wanted to see if something was going to happen between Akizuki and Kaho and it started to go well but sadly the anime ended before something happened, I really enjoyed those two and please notice that Akizuki was the only character that actually made me laugh...Please do not watch this, there are pleeenty better animes to watch but this... a student that is the core of the anime story, yes, people seems to be oblivious to the fact that ""tenshou-san"" is actually a 22 years old guy trying to get a 17 years old student to be his GF, in the most disgusting way..

For Schlappy.  There, I contributed to the meme.  I am now garbage.  Memes aside, it's Blend S everyone, let's just get into the analysis.Story:Sakuranomiya Maika is a girl with a naturally scary face, known to inflict terror into all that either accidentally or purposefully meet her gaze.  On one fateful encounter (if you can call it that), she meets a man by the name of Dino, who worryingly offers a job as a waitress in a cafe named 'Stile', where in the job description, she has to use her naturally scary expression as...a means to attract customers and embody the sadistic character that she was always meant to be.Ever seen that show 'Working!'?  Think of this show like that, but with more of your typical slice of life elements like 'the beach episode' and 'the hot springs episode' put into it instead of the characters just standing around in one setting, hardly moving around in the workplace that they spend time with.  At its core, Blend S is really just another slice of life show that you'd be able to throw into the mountain of hundreds upon thousands of similar shows like it.  It anything, the setting poses as a somewhat unique place to have a story, since the place isn't supposed to be a cafe for otakus, but it ends up being that way cause all of the female characters (and one surprise) embody a different character type to adhere to the customers' preference types.The one thing I do find a bit strange is how the show tries to approach the romance angle.  It gets a bit awkward at times (especially since the main couple is a 26 year old man who lives alone creepily and constantly fawning over a 16 year old high schooler), and sure it doesn't go anywhere cause status quo is something you have to always return back to in these sorts of things, but I don't think it was really all that needed.  Or at least to the extent that the show tries to push this kind of agenda into the plot when especially the source material is formatted in a 4-koma, a storytelling style that typically doesn't have much actual progression in its format.All in all, the story of Blend S is...just there really.  You see enough slice of life to get to the point that you expect certain plot points, so you don't really get excited or upset when they get to a certain trope episode that has become commonplace in this age of the medium.  The show's story far from terrible, and it does have its shining moments sometimes, but it's worth noting that those moments are often overshadowed by everything else that you can see almost everywhere else.Overview:+ Does have its shining moments+/- But is for the most part an average storyCharacters:If there's one thing the show has to its credit, it's the fact that the characters are interesting enough to keep the series afloat.  Practically member of the Stile cafe's workforce has a personality opposite to their first impression, and it becomes rather amusing to watch the weird twists we get from this.While I wouldn't really pin her as an 'otaku' character as compared to literally any other member of the cast, Sakuranomiya Maika is a girl that in enthralled by anything foreign so much so that you can kind of see her as one.  Her desire to go abroad has lead her to be fascinated by anything not from Japan to an almost creepily hilarious level that we're shown many times in the show, especially when it comes to the manager, Dino.  Aside from that, her naturally scary face and sadistic character in the cafe is a stark contrast to the sweet but sheltered rich girl which proves to be amusing every time.Then there's Dino, an italian man who despite his regal and upstanding stature is a 26 year old shut-in who spends his time fawning over moe (Maika in particular) and a waste of space in society for a majority of the show.  Dino's role is to be the bucket that is to be kicked, constantly making him the butt of all jokes as his antics take a majority of the screentime and on occasion lead to some...unique outcomes that I think I repressed in my memory.  There's not much to say about him personally though because much of who he is feeds off of Maika, so that about ends his bit of the review.The rest of the cast falls into this conundrum of comedic irony that range from the sweet big sister being a lewd writer who should really get some help for her 'people-watching' problem, to the tsundere who's actually a gamer girl who wouldn't harm a fly.  Compared to most slice of life shows, this cast is surprisingly memorable and really shows that if you actually try in this genre, you can stand above the rest.Overview:+ Surprisingly memorable castArt:Produced by A-1 Pictures, the quality for Blend S is sweet, shining, and sunny.  (Because clearly we haven't even seen the lengths this meme will go.)  With quality up to the company's usual standards, the show is both bright and colorful, exuding a simple moe style that of course fits with the show's fluffy exterior and plethora of 'cute girls'.  (I am still not over Hideri.)  So really, no complaints there.  Comedy-wise, the show is pretty standard with what it does, utilizing chibis, simplification of facial expressions, and exaggerated deformations and whatnot to exemplify comdy in any given situation.  Yes it's standard, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.Sound:Ah, Bon Appétit♡S, the OP that took the internet by storm this Fall 2017.  Unless you live under a rock, you were not able to escape this 'Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic-' and all this other S crap that lit a fire under the community and memers alike.  If nothing else, the show's intro is catchy to a fault, while the rest is kinda...there.  Seiyuu songs are seiyuu songs, and this time around, they're not outstanding.  True, they hardly are, but at least this time around we have something to remember the show by because eventually, everything turns to Jojo, and we cannot come back from that.Personal Enjoyment:On the spectrum of moe, Blend S for me ranks higher than most, but less than some.  It's a fine show that's honestly pretty natural about what it is and never feels like it tries too hard, but I just couldn't get behind it fully to the extent of really liking the show for what it is.  More than anything, it was the staple 'slice of life' show of the season for me, so it became the fallback show for me when I stared at my huge backlog of shows to review for the season and decided not to touch on some of the other shows that were lagging behind and watch this instead.  So my feelings are neutral.  But I wouldn't say that's a bad thing cause hey, it was kind of fun to watch.Did I like this show?I enjoyed it, and I think that's the most important thing.  Nothing about it stood out to me as bad and at the end of the day, it was entertaining.What didn't I like about the show?Hideri...  I refuse to acknowledge the existence of THAT.  Always feel mildly uncomfortable when things like IT pop up.Would I recommend this show?On the spectrum of slice of life moe shows, this is one of the better picks.  It's a low commitment fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously and can be a good watch just to have a laugh.  Personally I'd say the implied romance is an unneeded and sometimes uncalled for addition to the plot in its entirety, but that's just the opinion of one reviewer, and even then I'd say the show stands on its own merits enough so that doesn't stand to be an issue.And so, I leave you with this:  Schadenfreude (I mean...I tried.  There was an attempt.  Not really.) a means to attract customers and embody the sadistic character that she was always meant to be.Ever seen that show 'Working!'?

This time we have Cafe Stile where all of the waitresses have certain characteristics when serving their guests. This was enough to get me hooked on this anime, but when you find out they're in character it makes it even more enjoyable. It was nice to get some out of work moments as well, it really made the story a lot better.Art and Animation: The details in this anime was amazing. The art and animation really was top notch. I felt like A-1 Pictures really went above and...beyond for Blend S.Sound: Well the op was honestly one of the best of the season which resulted in some of the best Meme's of the year. The BGM was really good as well. Again basically flawless.Characters: When you get 3-4 characters who are a certain character and they have to act like another certain character you get a full mix of everything! I really loved all the characters because they all we're unique in their own way. Such a great cast.Enjoyment: Episode one I was laughing literally the entire episode, I could not stop. Blend S gave me enjoyment every week because the comedy was really well done and the romance in it was sweet at points.Overall: Blend S was honestly one of the best anime of 2017. And probably second best of the Fall season in my opinion. This anime had everything in it that warrants a great romantic comedy. if you have not watched Blend S yet, you should. it is a necessity for any anime fan to watch. beyond for Blend S.Sound: Well the op was honestly one of the best of the season which resulted in some of the best Meme's of the year.

In-depth commentary on socio-economic woes? Love? Evidently not all are present in Blend S, but it sure makes for a fun workplace comedy!Starting of as a common workplace comedy, it’s easy to see the appeal to Blend S. Working comedies are heavily reliant on the audience’s empathy and connection with the characters, and I’m pleased to say that Blend S manages this on a commendable level. Excels at it, even. The character interactions especially a highlight ; any two characters can be paired with each other and have their segments be completely unique from any other pairing, making for good comedy.Surprisingly, the gimmick...of the characters playing characters outside of their actual personalities isn’t brought up more often. It’s mostly for a few gags near the beginning of the series. Since this gimmick isn’t brought up nearly as often as I’d had hoped, the anime does lose something that would distinguish it from other similar working comedies. The author avatar Miu and the crossdressing Hideri aside, the main cast falls into familiar archetypes common to this genre : Akidzuki is the tsundere, Kaho is the hyperactive girl, Maika is the meek polite girl and Dino is the bumbling fool. Even so, this isn’t as major an issue as you may think, since the use of cliches and established character archetypes are never an issue, it’s the method in which these characters are used to convey the plot, or in this case, the comedy. Rightfully so, Blend S is able to articulate its comedy in ways sufficient to entertain even the most crusty of viewers.Seeing as this is primarily a slice-of-life comedy, the plot is fairly thin. At least the plot threads and arc of the main duo, Dino and Maika, are given a satisfactory buildup and development (not so much on resolution). Dino’s bumbling and otaku nature are an absolute joy to watch, and his antics in courting the oblivious Maika are not only the catalyst to plot progression, but also give the viewer a reason to keep tuning in : “how will his endeavours turn out” is a prevalent enough motivation to latch onto every upcoming episode. I personally found the subplot on Kaho and Akidzuki’s possible budding romance to be much weaker in comparison, in part due to a lesser emphasis and henceforth less screentime, but I still found their interactions to be enjoyable.Still, this writer’s personal favourite character is Hideri. To say that he’s merely an “otoko-no-ko” character or to say that “the creators drew a girl and called them a guy” is an inherently flaudruant statement. In fact, Hideri’s character is without a doubt the most interesting of the bunch, his motivations for crossdressing and looking cute are stated fairly and understandable, and his voice that fluctuates between over-the-top girly to normal boyish is perfectly delivered by his seiyuu, Tokui Sora. Criminally, he isn’t given as much screentime as the other characters due to his late introduction to the series.Seeing as I’ve described the series’ comedic elements enough, I’ll take a moment here to write about the more relaxing aspects of Blend S. Unusually for a primarily comedy-driven anime, Blend S has a surprisingly relaxing atmosphere to it usually exclusive to more relaxation-focused slice of life anime. Really, just watching this makes one feel like one’s in a nice, small cafe away from the busy hustle bustle of Tokyo, while a sadistic waitress serves you coffee laced with Tobasco. Precisely how it achieved this effect eludes me, but I’d wager it’s the use of a light, watercolor palette combined with a smooth soundtrack that gives Blend S its iyashikei quality. Risk-taking this anime is not. It’s a soothing anime that’s pleasant, but ultimately not outstanding. Supplanting itself as a competent anime . Entertaining it definitely is, but regrettably not bold.So, in conclusion, while Blend S offers little in the way of innovation or originality, it’s still a perfectly serviceable workplace comedy. Even calling it Bland S would be a disservice to the comedy and relaxation it offers. Really, if all you’re looking for is a pleasant, if safe and riskless, comedy to relax to, Blend S is a good choice. Visually appealing, if a little sterile at times, and not without its memorable moments. It’s ultimately a fine show, nothing outstanding, but nothing particularly bad about it. Certainly wouldn’t be forgetting about this show any time soon. Especially that catchy as hell OP theme song.WE ARE STILE!5/10 of the characters playing characters outside of their actual personalities isn’t brought up more often.

There has been a big surge with this whole cute high school girl harem where all of the girls have specific personalities. Of course that genre has been milked drier than the Sahara with only the whole trapped in another world being drier. But this show does it right I think. First of all, the amount of self awareness in this show is 10/10 and almost makes it a parody of itself but not quite. If you enjoy moe girls working in...a maid cafe and there being no real plot then you will enjoy this. If you hate moe girls working in a maid cafe and there being no plot you can also enjoy this just because of how ironic the show is. It is a good show if you want to just watch something more relaxed and simple. No strong emotion, no shonen flashbacks, no complicated story line.

You won't have the tension where the characters struggle to decide to put a name on their feeling. Male MC knows he's in love in episode one, and because of his love we get some of the most hilarious dumb shit i've ever seen in anime. This one is truly funny, it reminded me of Tamaki Suou's level of idiocy. He fails at everything he attempts to do, following the traditions...of classic comedy movies of the past. The plot is non-existent, this is a slice of life anime after all, the only plot there is are the two romantic storylines. At the end, we can't really call this show a proper romance, but if you are looking for genuine heartfelt interactions between two characters of the opposite sex then this is for you. The art is pretty, it feels like 2017 anime in general have this new thing where all the characters are drawn in the american shot, which is extremely weird to see, but the effect is not as bad when you get used to it. The sound is nothing exceptional except two or three lines in the op. The characters were wonderful, you take every clichè in the genre and you deconstruct it, what you get is Blend S. It's a deconstruction of the Cute Girls Doing Cute Things genre. We do have Cute Girls Doing Cute Things but.... The tsundere is and inept, the loli has a really mature mentality, the idol is a ### and we have two guys who they have romantic storylines with. Which ends up being hilarious.Overall: 10subscribe on youtube: talkshh of classic comedy movies of the past.

Every episode has made me laugh and also been heartwarming (especially episode 12). The characters were all great, especially Maika. Every episode is entertaining and when I finished one I was annoyed that I had to wait a week for another one. Blend S is a good example of a proper slice of life comedy anime. It's one of the best in 2017. I really hope there's a season 2 of it (if it's been popular enough in Japan then there most likely will be). Honestly, I've loved this show the whole way...through. Also I'm glad they didn't go to far and make Maika x Dino canon, which i was afraid of when i started watching it. Basically, this show is funny, heartwarming and generally just entertaining. Is it as good as legends like Azumanga Daioh and Nichijou? No, but it's still pretty good and I honestly think it has the potential to be as good as Azumanga Daioh was. I can also relate with Maika and somewhat with Kaho.Negatives:I feel that not enough attention has been payed to Miu. She's a likeable character and has had her funny moments but like i said, not enough attention has been payed to her. I hope she has an episode or 2 in season 2 as well as generally just having more attention put on her.I also want to know more about Maika's school life, which i feel can be explored more. This isn't really a negative but I'm still a bit disappointing that it hasn't been explored more yet. I think this because at the beginning of one of the episodes, Maika is seen sitting in a classroom and a girl is talking to her. This only lasts for about 30 seconds though before it's cut to the cafe.I love Kaho but I 80% like her because of her personality. I think the show should focus more on her personality and maybe make some possible small changes to it that are just right so that people won't just focus on her boobs.Conclusion:As i said before, this anime is pretty amazing. It's funny, heartwarming (although comedy is much more common, which makes sense for the genre) and generally entertaining. The negatives are not enough attention being payed towards Miu and a Kaho lacking the amount of personality so that people focus on something other than her boobs. Her personality is good but i feel a bit more could be done.I give Blend S 9/10. through.

If anything, I’m glad it was (mildly) better than I expected, yet I’d still have a hard time describing it as anything other than mediocre-bordering-on-decent.Character (6/10)The story is non-existent, and frankly, not important for this genre. Good character is more – much more – important. Unfortunately, most of the characters are bland and have little personality. Too often, their entire personality borders down to a single character trait. Only a handful of characters get focus, and at least two of the main...characters get less focus than the dog.That being said, some of the romantic interactions (mostly between Akizuki and Kaho, but some between the main “couple”) are genuinely heartwarming and easily the highlight of the show for me.Art (5/10)The visuals are as average as average can be. Nothing particularly bad – but nothing that good either. Simple A-1 art style.Sound (5/10)Other than the meme OP, there isn't much that really stands out. About 8 episodes in, I caught myself thinking that – I hadn’t really thought about the music. It’s completely in the background.The voice acting is standard. Tokui Sora’s work for Hideri (the crossdresser type) stands out, being masculine enough when needed. Some voices I’d describe as mildly annoying – one being Mafuyu’s high pitched voice as the little sister type  – though this might just be according to my own tastes.Enjoyment (6/10)As mentioned above, the interactions between Akizuki and Kaho were the highlight of the show. The OP, besides being a meme, is actually very good, and one I watched every time before the episode. Despite characters being mostly flat and one-dimensional, I did get some enjoyment out of the humor (standard fare as it might be). If you don’t care too much about how “good” a show is, and just want to relax, Blend S could be a cautious recommendation (though there are certainly better offerings). Particularly if you like cute girls doing cute things shows, this might be up your alley. I might watch a season 2 if there’s one.Overall, 5/10.Summary: Blend S does nothing very well, but nothing so badly that it’d deserve a score lower than a 5. Virtually everything about the show screams “just-okay”, and if you’re looking into it for more than the OP, you’re not going to get much more. characters get less focus than the dog.That being said, some of the romantic interactions (mostly between Akizuki and Kaho, but some between the main “couple”) are genuinely heartwarming and easily the highlight of the show for me.Art (5/10)The visuals are as average as average can be.

I wasn\'t sure what to expect from this anime as I hadn\'t looked into it in too much depth, all I knew is that they follow a character and worked in a maid cafe. So what does this entail? Each character has a unique characteristic they follow while working...in the cafe - this determines how they interact with customers such as a big sister character, or a sadistic approach. The show shows these characters all interacting with each other during and out of work in what I think is a truly nice blend of showing a group of co-workers becoming friends.The show mostly is from Maika\'s perspective, she\'s a cheerful character who can\'t help looking at anyone with a sadistic glare. Overall she is sweet but clumsy meaning she often causes accidents that fit within the characteristic she is roleplaying.Blend S is a slice of life, without much of a complex plot. It\'s just showing the group\'s everyday goings in different situations.""Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service""No doubt you have seen this on various memes, and you are greeted with it upon watching the show. You will understand what this means when you begin the show. However, I can say that the show does make you smile, it\'s a sweet show following characters such as sister and sadistic that was a surprise to me. I didn\'t know what to expect but I still had a lot of fun watching this slice of life.I struggled with the rating for this, it went from an eight to a nine then finally to a ten. Like I first mentioned this is primarily because I am a weak man for this particular formula of anime - just look at my Chuunibyou review and you\'ll see what I mean. Maybe once the hype has died down a little from only just watching it I\'ll drop it to a nine, but as of now, I feel like it has rightfully earned its place.If you like cutesy anime, that is lighthearted, fun and can give you a smile you\'ll love this. in the cafe - this determines how they interact with customers such as a big sister character, or a sadistic approach.

This isn\'t my type of anime, so I kinda knew from the beginning that I wouldn\'t like it, but I gave it a chance anyways. And I was wrong, it was much, much more worse than I could have ever imagined. It\'s basically everything wrong with the anime industry in only twelve episodes.We\'ve got the same old main character, Maika, who\'s a bit of a klutz but...she tries her best! She\'s supposed to play the sadistic character but she is a sweet person so it\'s hard for her. Even then, she somehow always succeeds at being sadistic, most of the time by trying to be sweet. This wasn\'t very funny to begin with, but going through twelve episodes of that is pretty tough, especially since it\'s so easily predictable.As always, this main character is a self-hating japanese who is obsessed with the west and blond hair. Where could I have seen such a character before?Then you\'ve got Kaho, who plays the same old otaku character, as opposed to Maika who plays the ""normie"". However, I believe that a supposed otaku character whose only passion is to play video games on her phone or IPad might actually makes the otaku audience flee, even though the original goal was to pander to them.Then you\'ve got the same old deadpan loli ""who looks like she\'s ten but she\'s actually 20!"". It might have been interesting to give her the sadistic role to try something slightly more original, but they went for the safe imouto role instead.Then you\'ve got the same old pervert character who makes doujins and starts drawing really fast at the mere mention of something slightly lewd. Don\'t forget to show the Comiket at least once to make the otaku feel like he\'s part of a secret club.But hey, at least, there wasn\'t an episode solely on Comiket, which is pretty rare. (Yuru Yuri, Maid dragon, Lucky star, etc)Then you\'ve got the trap. Can\'t be fully unoriginal unless there\'s a trap, you know? Don\'t forget to make him do smug faces and let him with the pervert to make sure you can mention as many fetishes as possible.Another important thing is to include a serious character who overreacts everytime another character does something slightly odd. In our case, this character is Kouyou.Dino might be the only character in the bunch who is slightly original, altough it doesn\'t change the fact that he\'s still bad and that his whole character is ""Oh my god, Maika just touched me, my nose is bleeding, aaah, I\'m in heaven !""But the characters being unoriginal is not all. The ""plot"" is at least as unoriginal as them. I\'m so happy I could witness this little group of friends setting up a barbecue near a river. Or going to the beach. I literally have never seen this before and I love it. I also never saw a group of cute girls working in a café, and I\'m happy I had the chance to witness it.All in all, Bland S is a fitting title. Everything is bland, nothing is new, nothing is original. The animation might be good, it might be colorful, but there is nothing behind it, there is no soul, there is no content.Pandering to otakus is something a lot of studios have tried since KyoAni made Lucky Star. Unfortunately, Blend S is yet another failure.I recommand Blend S to all the people who either :-Want to increase the amount of animes they have watched-Want to show to someone (or witness with their own eyes) how low the anime industry can getTo the others, I say don\'t watch it, there are many other anime out there who succeed at being SoL, or a comedy, or both. she tries her best!

Maika is having trouble finding a job because of her scary appearance, until she meets up with Dino (often referred to as simply Manager) who thinks her scary appearance is a perfect fit for the role of sadist in his theme cafe. Already working at the cafe are Mafuyu (the ""little sister""), Kaho (the ""tsundere"") and chef Akizuki. Three other characters are introduced over the course of the series, Miu (""big sister""), Hideri (""idol""), and Owner, a corgi (possibly a tip of the hat to ""Cowboy Bebop"").I wanted to like the series more than I did, but by...the end of the series what could have been awesome felt mediocre. Too many of the episodes relied on misunderstanding, and the nosebleed trope was overused. Meanwhile some of the more interesting aspects of characters went unexplored, such as Maika\'s interest in international travel (though it\'s sort of featured in the end title sequence). There could have been more cafe operations showing the servers playing their roles with customers. Some of the characters aren\'t developed to any appreciable degree.There were, however, some positives. One of the more enjoyable episodes centers around the relationship between Kaho and Mafuyu. Despite the issues discussed above, the series was on the whole amusing and enjoyable to watch. By the end of the season it felt like they had just gotten done introducing all the characters and laid the groundwork for future episodes. As most of my complaints were of the unrealized potential variety, it will be interesting to see what they can do with it in the future should they decide to extend the series into one or more additional seasons. the end of the series what could have been awesome felt mediocre.

Especially Mafuyu and Miu, both with little screen time yet they still leave a solid impression. Also, unlike other comedy animes I\'ve seen, Blend S...finishes with a satisfying ending. It wasn\'t anything with exaggerated randomness, or something rushed. I guess the fact that this series ended around new years (and I am also a working adult), co-workers reminiscing about the past from the first day they started working, has a nice vibe and left me satisfied enough to give this anime a decent score.Overall, Blend S is a good anime to fill in your time like any other good comedy animes and I give my stamp of recommendation. finishes with a satisfying ending.

If you want to have a smile, and a laugh then you need to watch this. This is in fact one of the many anime's, that I have really enjoyed. I especially enjoyed the character of Maika-chan, since when she turns into her sadistic character, it's like a flip of the mirror. From one side she's a shy girl, but when she's in work mode she turns into a sadist. Overall all of the characters had great personalities, and there is simply nothing else I can say about it. All I can...say though, is if you enjoy comedy anime, and want to have a laugh then you need to watch Blend S. say though, is if you enjoy comedy anime, and want to have a laugh then you need to watch Blend S."", ""SPOILER FREE!!Blend S should not be seen as an anime that takes itself seriously. It's a feel-good anime with many hilarious scenes. This show is sooooooooo adorable. I genuinely love every main character in the story.

They all fit the characters well.I love every character. Especially Maika. She's ADORABLE!Makes me happy just to watch.

Recommend it to people who love slice of life and cutesy shows."", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I like to think that I’m an okay kind of dude. So, my opposite alter ego, if I were ever to have one, would be someone downright dastardly. He would perform misdeeds like wearing mismatched socks and inserting a silent “m” at the beginning of every word he spoke out loud.Such super-evil antics would befit his own motives and contrast my own personality. If I could control this hypothetical alternate self of mine, I could then potentially earn a job at Stile, the fictional maid café of Blend S where the employees’ own personas balance...out into a straightforward experience.STORYPeople are multifaceted creatures. They have many skills they hone, and they have many thoughts in their brains. They also have emotions and personality traits that “betray” who they “normally” happen to be.A quiet, solemn person could in fact be a race caller at a local betting arena in his or her spare time. Someone who looks gruff and menacing with a skull tattoo doesn’t mean that he or she cannot collect flowery stamps on the side. No matter the case, the platitude “what you see isn’t always what you get” rings true for nearly everybody on the planet.Blend S takes this phrase to a dichotomous extreme in the comedy it creates. The staff at Stile roleplay particularly classic styles within the medium: the sadist, the tsundere, the imouto, the onee-san, and the idol. The catch is that their actual personalities are almost the complete opposite. For example, Maika is the designated sadist, but she is the nicest person imaginable. Or there’s Mafuyu, the designated imouto who is really a college student with an unforgiving attitude.With such contrasts at the show’s disposal, hilarity forms naturally as the ladies engage with their guests and deal with each other. Kaho the “tsundere” will give in to her gaming tendencies, Miu the “onee-san” will punch (rather softly), and Hideri the “idol” will make a lewd hand gesture without fear. By sticking so closely to its premise, relying so much on these huge self-made gaps, the anime not only remains consistent in its delivery but also cycles through a diverse amount of comedy.Perhaps surprisingly, a large chunk of Blend S takes place away from the café, leading to the slice-of-life label attached to this show. Events at the beach, the mountains, the city, and the parks allow for some variety in the setting and, aligning with the premise of the show, form yet another dichotomy between the everyday happenings abroad and their concentrated shenanigans over at the restaurant.The core of this anime does not extend a whole lot further, though. Its faint romantic elements merely scratch that lovey-dovey itch. Its episodic nature does not attempt for anything too adventurous. Its meager life lessons, while wholesome, do not have much thematic weight to them.Altogether, this story about a bunch of silly guys and gals at a local café may not be the most interesting, but its forms a likable-enough comedic base to make this contrast-filled trip at least a stamp worthy of a bet.ART & ANIMATIONPerhaps its biggest strength, the artistic direction within Blend S provides the anime with the visual niceties and comedic gags it so heavily leverages.No doubt near the top sit the designs for the ladies in all their cute and colorful splendor. Vibrant eyes entice the eyes, but their frilly maid outfits welcome the audience with open arms as their casual looks once again contribute to the leitmotif of stark contrast which laces this show.Employing a chibi style at times, squashing and rounding the characters’ features, likewise gets at their silly brand of comedy. Same goes for overexaggerating proportions, “dumbing down” reactions, playfully toying with the movement to fit the needs for a given scene, and even pasting in a literal picture of a giant tuna. Indeed, Blend S switches rather effortlessly between its normal presentation and this fun concoction, demonstrating a keen grasp of timing for its laugh-inducing ventures.While its grip isn’t as powerful when it comes to its backgrounds and its settings, these find a foothold within the show, too. The backgrounds flit between many shapes, hues, and imaginations for added delight, and the treks to other areas break up the monotony of the rather plain café. Otherwise, these parts let the flashier details in front of them do most of the Blend S talking.Other elements help, too. Off-camera speech bubbles. Nondescript guests. A nice feel for scene lighting. Wacky visuals for the opening and ending tracks. The soft layout in general. When everything melds together, the anime clearly stands strong, proud of the artistry it touts.CHARACTERSFor an anime such as Blend S, it makes total sense for it to put its comedic foot forward for most of its run, granting Maika, Kaho, Mafuyu, Miu, Hideri, Dino, and Kouyou a chance at hilarity. But the anime also tries to avoid the devoid when it comes to having more to say about them beyond the giggles they serve.For instance, Maika accidentally frightens others with her menacing smile, so her “evil” behavior turns into a source of laughs for the audience. However, she has much more normal traits to speak of. She adores items and locations and people of a foreign status, and her siblings back home look after her dearly as they wish only for the best for their sweet younger sister. So, her charge to get out there and do more to achieve her dreams acts as a neat part to her characterization.Kaho also earns similar words for herself. Her infectious happiness as she indulges in her favorite games and recreational activities paints her as an energetic and likable lady. Yet she cannot always burst with positivity, especially where her math exam scores are concerned. Thus, the magical-girl-loving Mafuyu steps up to bring her kouhai some guidance, solidifying the friendship shared between the two.These details, both the funny side and the serious side, bring about a welcome balance for Blend S and its characters. The show can swing back and forth between either, allowing for a lot of silliness one moment and a wave of wholesomeness the next. Granted, neither half is particularly elaborate nor complex, meaning the level of writing and nuance overall cannot exactly be called captivating. Nevertheless, the show does what it can to intertwine these halves, and it fares all the better because of it.Speaking of balance, Dino, Kouyou, and eventually Owner round out the crew even more. The two men ensure that the show (for the most part) avoids pigeonholing itself into the cute-girls-doing-cute-things (or CGDCT for short) genre, and the cool dog brings about different ways in which the anime can approach its interactions. In either case, they inject diversity into the group, leading to a better form for the anime overall.Not everything goes well for Blend S, for it unfortunately succumbs to poor decisions that diminish certain characters and their impact. Specifically, Miu, Hideri, and Dino fall further on the wayside than perhaps intended. Miu ends up oddly absent for a lot of the later parts of the season. Hideri is introduced a tad too late to have a meaningful presence despite the interesting role. And Dino, with his fixation on Maika, can tread into strange or eyebrow-raising territory often (despite playing it up for laughs here and there).So, much like the story, the characters may not be the most interesting bunch the medium has ever seen. However, thanks to their good comedic fun and their lighthearted connections, they give this show another passable part to own.MUSIC & SOUNDThe audio elements within Blend S also deserve some praise right alongside their visual brethren.And it starts with a string of six words: “Smile! Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! Service!” These lyrics swept through a large swath of the Internet outside of the anime community when they spawned a meme craze of “S”-related proportions.Such catchy and fun content must certainly count in the show’s favor, and the remainder of “Bon Appétit♡S” (the title of the song itself) is no slouch either. The blaring trumpets elevate the piece onto a grand scale. The multiple female vocalists add lots of deliveries and flavors. The instrumentation in general – sweeping piano keys, claps, drum patterns – quicken the pace for higher energy. And the various switches to musical beats and flow keep the song light and dancing. It all combines into a big ball (or, more relevantly, a sphere) of fun worth jamming along to again and again.The original soundtrack also has a lot of appeal. Its piano tunes flit and laze about as appropriate for those chaotic and mellow times. Acoustic guitar and electric guitar fill the air with a bittersweet sound during those emotional moments. Accordions and bongos incorporate a foreign feel to go along with its foreign motif. And the xylophones, the flutes, and the violins allow for stronger musicality in general.A set of swell voice-acting performances also pop up in Blend S for both the men and the women. Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Kouyou stumbles forward in his embarrassment and frustration; Atsumi Tanezaki as Miu soothes the ears with her sultry tones; and Sora Tokui as Hideri uses a somewhat androgynous inflection to fit the character as well as can be.The only real “letdown” is the ending track, “Detarame na Minus to Plus ni Okeru Blend Kou”, since it doesn’t quite reach the same level as the other musical or sound-related aspects. Not that its multiple vocalists, guitar segments, and twinkling chimes fail to get at a cute song. The dreamlike, happy composition of the tune helps, too. But it does lack that same intrigue or nod-in-appreciation factor that most everything else achieves.Still, after listening to each offering, Blend S no doubt caps off its production values with nice audio elements and direction, giving it more clout to its signature.ENJOYMENTAs a mega-fan of moe, this anime was right up my alley.My two big favorites were Kaho and Maika. Kaho was a bundle of joy that made me all smiley and jubilant as she made up songs and reacted in earnest. As for Maika, she was a kind and sweet girl. So, seeing her always try her hardest to put her best foot forward, regardless of the inevitable misunderstandings which plagued her efforts, had me liking her determination and sincerity.Other funny interactions and moments also kept the entertainment going. Hideri was almost always a hoot when present, Mafuyu wasn’t afraid to lay on the harshness when required, and Miu got overly into debauchery due to her writing background. For the most part, the anime gave its characters and its events the room to shine, and that glow made my time with it all a likable one.To be fair, though, the show isn’t very exciting or noteworthy, given its not-all-that-unique setup. It also doesn’t leave much of an impression after the fact. And it could possibly be argued that it went on a tad too long as the outcomes rarely deviated from expectation. Still, it sustained its cuteness and its jokes throughout its twelve episodes, making me laugh in the process. At the end of the day, I must give props to the show for that.Blend S reaches that slightly above-average line. The episodic content and the silly characters may not be the most memorable imaginable, but the strong audio elements and the even stronger sense of visual comedy boost it one espresso higher. Alongside its consistent entertainment value, mthis manime mgets ma mpassing mgrade.SUMMARYStory: Fine, dichotomy abounds in this slice-of-life outing, featuring a handful of grounded events and not much elseArt & Animation: Great, the looks, the reactions, the movements, the backgrounds, and the details stir into a hearty stew of comedic artistryCharacters: Fine, Maika and the rest of the staff have their funny and serious sides, lending to some okay back-and-forth, but Miu and a few others fall by the wayside on occasionMusic & Sound: Good, the OP bursts into meme history, the OST and the VA performances rock, but the ED doesn’t quite step up to their same levelEnjoyment: Fine, cute and likable and fun but refrains from standing out otherwiseFinal Score: 6/10 out into a straightforward experience.STORYPeople are multifaceted creatures.

While it had its moments and got some laughs out of me, it never managed to keep a consistent level of enjoyment. I found myself getting incredibly bored between any funny bits there were, sometimes for entire episodes, and, at the end, felt like I'd only finished watching it to finish watching it. Part comedy, part slice-of-life, it is neither entertaining enough to be a good specimen of the former nor atmospheric enough to be a good specimen of the latter.At the beginning, most of the jokes revolve around Maika's...expression, and though the show manages to move on from that before it becomes overdone, it doesn't manage to replace it with anything fresh. As a result, it still works as a gag, but by the time they bring it back it feels out of place. The comedic timing, setup, and general pacing could all use work.Most of the characters are likeable, but they end up being fairly one-note and their interactions just aren't written well enough to carry the show through its dull moments. Exhibit A here is the romance, which is inconsequential and meaningless. It's a joke - and that is not a criticism, I mean it really just serves as joke material - but it's presented in such a way as to be taken seriously within the story. Reflective of the show as a whole, it's neither good comedy nor good romance. I'm hard-pressed to say this is a better love story than Twilight. It really might not be.Now, don't get me wrong - this is not a bad anime. There is nothing obviously bad about it. I didn't throw up my hands in disappointment or sigh with disgust at any of the flat jokes or the dull romance. As I said, it had its moments, and overall I derived a mild amount of amusement from it. The character designs are cute. The voice acting is good. The characters' quirks are interesting. But it is simply bland overall. This is a light watch, and only recommended for the undiscerning viewer with time to kill. expression, and though the show manages to move on from that before it becomes overdone, it doesn't manage to replace it with anything fresh.

I only really laughed out loud at a few bits, which isn't very much for how little the rest of the show has to offer.It's designed for you to pick your favorite girls, but then 2 of them got basically no screen time at all, which felt a little unfair.Also, the story definitely gravitates towards a shoujo romance in the latter half and it is less of a comedy. It has the normal shoujo comedic clichés like the badly timed confession, misunderstandings, etc. The...first half of the show I really liked, while the second I wouldn't bother besides the character centered episodes.If you have nothing better, it is a fun little time though it drags in the second half overall. first half of the show I really liked, while the second I wouldn't bother besides the character centered episodes.If you have nothing better, it is a fun little time though it drags in the second half overall."", ""Reviews in 100 words or less:BlendS really hits all the stuff I love in anime. I found the whole premise of Maika very interesting; the accidental sadistic never failed to amuse. Music on point, and the other girls have a reasonable amount of depth to them too. My one problem was the dynamic between Dino and Maika, it's strangely pedophilic and was never really funny, and I felt like the writers kept pushing the topic over and over. Overall, the comedy is there, but this show borders on what is funny and what is weird. Just cut the weird stuff and this show is great. "", 'I\'ll probably won\'t make a long review of it, I\'ll just make it brief and simple with explanation on why.I\'ve notice Blend S in few of Facebook pages as a meme for it\'s very catchy song and it spread like a plague because of it\'s meme material. Out of curiosity I watched it, I did enjoy but apparently it doesn\'t make me laugh hard as Comedy genre is indicated. So Here is my review (This is my personal view on Blend S aka my opinion)Story: 3/10Story? What Story? It is just ""My everyday life at Cafe"" type of story, randomness at it\'s...finest. Throw everything random and it will be fine, apparently not. The story revolves around Maika Sakuranomiya with a nasty glare, accidentally bumped to Dino the cafe manager of Stile. Do I have to explain it? Random events after that.Art: 8/10It is pretty nice and definitely a sore in your eyes. There is nothing much to say.Sound: 7/10SMILE, SWEET, SISTER, SADISTIC, SURPRISE, SERVICE *INSERT MEME*. The OP theme is a meme material because of catchiness but this is the reason why I\'ve watched the anime. Backgrounds sounds as well as ED song is nice as well.Character: 5/10There is no surprising factor in the characters, in fact they are your generic characters and they have no development throughout the entire series. If you like CGDCT girls you will have no problem watching them. Otherwise they are fine in general.Enjoyment 6/10I guess I did enjoy some of the ""comedy"" shown in the series, though it is not that ""Laugh out loud"" thing but a slight chuckle. But I am bothered that Dino (a 26 year old guy) loves Maika (a 16 year old girl). Love has no boundaries eh?.Overall: 6/10I did enjoy at least but not that much, a bit of chuckle but I expect a story but kinda disappointed when I did find one. Would I share it with my friends? probably i\'ll share it to people who finds moe an extreme element in anime whether the anime had a story or none.KAHO X AKIZUKI finest.

She starts working in a café, where she has to work as a waitress. But it is not an ordinary café. In this each employee has his own role, which he has to indulge in. The roles are distributed from ""Little Sister, Tsundere, to Sadistic and Big Sister"". The protagonist is shown the role of the sadist because of her already evil look and her illogical urge for sadism.All right, it sounds bizarre, whatever it was. However, the anime had too many similarities to the similar title ""Working"" and I could only see everything...that was done right there and what failed here.The characters were a colorful bunch,  their personalities and their character, was too dull to be able to develop in the work in any way, especially that of the protagonist.As said, she was given the role of the sadist.

There is no further selection anyway.Even though the restaurant was almost never the focus of the work, which makes it difficult to rate it as a café anime.

There were different characters that ticked in their own way. On a positive note, there were no real ""-Your"" types like ""Tsundere"" characters and etc.The problem, however, was that it was difficult to take the female protagonist seriously, because she only looked like a funny character, just like the boss.

But that\'s just not enough to make it up for all the bad gags.You can watch it , if you have enough free time. that was done right there and what failed here.The characters were a colorful bunch,  their personalities and their character, was too dull to be able to develop in the work in any way, especially that of the protagonist.As said, she was given the role of the sadist.

Disclaimer I haven’t read the manga but I plan to. I’ll admit it took me a while to get into the show since the plot is pretty slow moving. Blend-s takes place in a small cafe run and I believe owned by Dino. Here highschool and college students work to make a pay all saving up for different reasons. On myanimelist.net it is labeled as a slice of life and comedy anime although I would add romance to the list as most of this anime is also based around the relationship between Maika and Dino....Though they never officially start dating in the anime it is implied as they go on dates and even end up kind of sharing a dog. Another important thing to note is that all of the characters working at the cafe were assigned character traits that they were to use with the customers. I think all the characters were assigned perfect roles for their personality. So although this wasn’t my personal favorite I would still recommend it. Also the OP is super good.

I saw up to episode 8, and was still at a loss as to what the whole thing was driving up to. I literally started dozing off by the middle of episode 8. There are a few good jokes here and there, but most of them seemed forced, buttressed by a lot of screaming (as if the more the character screams, the funnier it should be). The comedic misunderstandings were frustratingly stupid instead of amusing. For instance, the main character is supposed to be...a sweet, charming girl, except that she comes across as sadistic because of her unusual stare and clumsy way of speaking. This worked the first couple of times, but it\'s a running ""gag"" that becomes less and less funny and plausible as the show progresses. Also, usually the love interest in these kinds of shows is made implicit and delayed in order to create some tension to be resolved in a satisfying ending. Here it\'s declared openly and insistently from the very beginning, so that there is no tension for us, the viewers. And yet, for some reason, the main character is somehow unaware of this obvious love interest. Lastly, the most unfunny part has to be, for me, the manager\'s character: too over the top in terms of wimpiness and lack of common sense. Again, I get the feeling that the authors thought that if the manager were just loud and obnoxious enough, he\'d be funnier.

It's fine to look at, In particular the bright colors help the anime stand out at least a little bit, and I think the color choices work in its favor. Theme song is catchy. Characters are painfully shallow with very little development. Plot is thin, which is to be expected from a slice of life anime like this, but at least make it entertaining. Really was nothing more than flavor of the season. Maybe I'm wrong for going into this expecting more, but there are plenty of other shows that accomplish...nothing which are still very entertaining to watch.

Didn't exactly see the point of making so many conversations in the changing room, made me more than a little uncomfortable.

Unfortunately, it went the way of all seasonal anime and will probably never get a season 2, so ending and overall...story is... really crap. story is... really crap."", 'Blend S was a fun show to watch. I found about the show through the opening and the memes. The show was focused around the girls playing a part in the cafe. Maika’s personality fits her role at the cate but it seems that the other girls didnt. Maika just wanted to be an assertive person but ends up scaring people off and people end up calling her a sadist, which is the opposite of what she wants to be. The anime was. A lot of fun to watch, but Maika is usually the focus so the rest of the cast is overshadowed.

""And we finally got to today. Blend S was an anime that had been on my waiting list for a long time, as I...thought it would be just another regular anime of cute girls doing cute things, but I decided to give it a try. The first episodes don\'t stray too far from the standard Slice of Life scheme: we have a protagonist who is the most ""normal"" of the group (Maika), a Fan Service girl (Kaho), a loli (Mafuyu), a romantic couple for the protagonist who also serves as a comic relief (Dino) and some auxiliary characters (Akizuki, Hideri, Miu and the puppy Dono). The big difference for me is that the jokes are really funny, with a good combination of timming / sound effects / visual appeal (I highlight a joke made at the end of episode two, where the manager tastes the dessert prepared by Maika and crumbles into powder ). The small amount of Fan Service used as a comedy in the work stands out, which for the genre is something surprising. The opening is very captivating and makes you smile for nothing, the ending is very lively and relaxing, but I missed a more striking soundtrack, which characterized the situation in which the characters find themselves.I have criticisms too. Miu\'s character is very poorly used in the anime, she appears so little that you don\'t even remember she exists and can\'t empathize. She probably has a better use in the manga, but in the anime she is forgettable (I would even say that Hideri is forgettable, but because of the amount of memes that were created about him I decided not to mention it). Character development is very weak, they are pretty much the same from start to finish. About animation... Well... I don\'t have much to talk about animation because it\'s so common that it\'s hard to describe it. Make no mistake, it\'s not bad, but the trait is extremely generic, if I took an image of one of the characters and asked someone who likes anime who he is I wouldn\'t know. The characters even have a visual identity, but nothing too remarkable.n conclusion: The anime must be seen with a mind free from prejudice. Don\'t expect anything special beyond what the anime presents, it even has points that make it unique, but the generic streak combined with the clichés makes it seem like it\'s just an ordinary work by cute girls. He certainly deserves a second season, as he might be able to develop the characters better. The anime has a less than eye-catching surface, but its filling is made up of a mixture of sweet, salty and sour flavors, where you laugh at jokes and blush with moe situations, like a delicious strawberry Parfait.PT-BR: ""Um dia, em uma tarde muito distante, um jovem, cansado da monotonia da vida adolescente, se depara com um vídeo estranhamente chamativo, seu nome era \'Blend W\'.

Blend S era um anime que estava a muito tempo na minha lista de espera, pois pensava que seria só mais um anime comum de garotas fofas fazendo coisas fofas, mas decidi dar uma chance.

O grande diferencial para mim é que as piadas são realmente engraçadas, com uma boa combinação de timming/efeitos sonoros/recurso visual (destaco uma piada feita no final do episódio dois, onde o gerente prova a sobremesa preparada por Maika e se desfaz em pó).

A opening é muito cativante e te faz sorrir por nada, a ending é bem animada e relaxante, porém senti falta de uma trilha sonora mais marcante, que caracterizasse a situação em que os personagens se encontram.Tenho críticas também. A personagem da Miu é muito mal aproveitada no anime, ela aparece tão pouco que você nem se lembra que ela existe e não consegue criar empatia. Provavelmente ela tem um aproveitamento melhor no mangá, mas no anime ela é esquecível (diria até que o Hideri é esquecível, mas pela quantidade de memes que foram criados sobre ele decidi não citar).
