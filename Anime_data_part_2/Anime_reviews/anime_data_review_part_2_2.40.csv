Li Linke de Xiao Guaner 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54014/Li_Linke_de_Xiao_Guaner_2nd_Season,"['This was another very enjoyable season, I even think I liked it slightly more than the first season.The visuals are the same quality as last season. The background art and food porn is illustrated very well, plus I appreciated the unique art style of the character designs. The stories in each episode were good, despite only being one or a couple episodes each they managed to feel very real and compelling. My favorite was episode 2. I liked all the new characters, and grew more attached to the two main characters Lee Link and Xiao Lu. The OP and ED were also nice. ']"
K: Seven Stories Movie 2 - Side:Blue - Tenrou no Gotoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37303/K__Seven_Stories_Movie_2_-_Side_Blue_-_Tenrou_no_Gotoku,"[""Quick take: K:7S S:B gives us the origin story of SCEPTRE 4's power and influence.If you liked the original series K, you'll like the second movie in K:7S. The story line is decent, but lacks much of the charm and mystery the original series provided. I found the story to be slightly better than the first movie, but it still lacked quite a bit of depth leaving many serious and tragic moments feeling extremely lackluster.Art is good and on par with the original series, much like sound. Much of the great music is back, but there are also new tracks which I felt didn't live...up to the original. Voice acting (Japanese) is good, but for the first time, I have to say I preferred the dub voice acting from the original series in my opinion.Characters are fair, but again lacks the depth the original series offer. I found the character arcs somewhat lame.Overall, I enjoyed K:7S S:B, but don't think it's anything better than a good anime. up to the original.

Saki Achiga-hen: Episode of Side-A,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10884/Saki_Achiga-hen__Episode_of_Side-A,"[""A couple years ago when I started Saki, I didn't think I would enjoy a series about mahjong because I knew next to nothing about mahjong but Saki sure did change my mind. So when Saki: Achiga-hen was announced I just had to watch it, even though it focused on another set of characters. Although it was not as well done and as memorable as the original, it is still an enjoyable series and very entertaining even if you have no knowledge about the game of mahjong.Compared to the original season, Achiga-hen is much shorter in length so the pacing of this season is extremely...fast until the last couple of episodes which is a major weakness. The fast pacing allows the story to progress faster than the original season (as this season just blazed by the prefectures). However, the reason why the original season is so enjoyable, is because of the intense rounds of mahjong that happen. These matches were very enjoyable to watch because of the epic battles between characters where each displayed their play style and their super natural ability (if they had one). In Achiga-hen we get very little of that until they face off against Senriyama in the quarter finals. During this time, the series really starts to pick up because we get to start seeing some action. The actual story itself is nothing spectacular but it is still fun to watch these girls on their journey to the final table and the struggles they endure to get there.The girls of Achiga aren't as overpowered, and aren't as thoroughly explored as the girls in Kiyosumi. I think Shizuno is supposed to be the main character but we only get to see her play in one hand. Out of all the main characters in Achiga-hen, Kuro is the only one that develops at all (as we see her overcome one of her hurdles in life) which makes her stand out a bit from the other main characters. However the character that stands out the most in this series is Toki, who is a side character, the reason why she stands out the most is because we get to see her past, how she became part of Senriyama's team and her relationship with Ryuuka. She also makes all the matches in this series fun to watch. Other than that no other character is explored that much, making this cast of characters not very memorable.  However each character is still likable, fits well in the series and each have their own unique playing style(even though I don't know what some of character's playing styles are).The art is different from the original. The colour tone is a bit lighter and the character designs look cuter. In my opinion, this style of art actually fits the series. However the art is still nothing spectacular and nothing really stands out. Here's a fun fact, if you watch the animation of both seasons, you will see that they are nearly identical.The sound is also done well, each of the voice actors do a good job voicing their characters, they all match their personalities. The opening Miracle Rush really fits the series because this season is more light hearted than the original. There are two endings for this series, SquarePanicSerenade which is very similar to the ending of the original series, which is sung by the voice actors of the main characters which is used when the mood of the episode is light hearted and Futuristic Player, a more serious ending which is used when the mood of the series is more serious. Both endings fit the series but are not too memorable.Overall, the series is still very enjoyable, unique and still has that Saki charm. It's fun to watch but not as well executed as the original season because of the horrible pacing. Also I still can't wait for the last 3 episodes. fast until the last couple of episodes which is a major weakness.

In the beginning, it was cute, funny.....but then Nodoka left, and just like how the girls were trying their best to catch up to Nodoka, this anime was trying it's absolute hardest to catch up to the greatness of it's parent story.For the entire first half of the series, everything felt rushed. You don't see any real majong games, and although you know the girls have grown in talent, you don't actually get to see it happen. It was almost like a summery, rather than it's own show....Then once they finally catch up to the prequel, it slows down and becomes a great show. By the last handful of episodes, it really finds it's flow, and you get to see great majong games and great characters. You get to see the personality of Saki's sister, and you actually get to see her play :) Old friends show up in this anime, and new ones are made. If you loved the Prequel to this anime, then you will really like this one!Story - starts at a 7 and ends at an 8, almost 9. It was cute, but maybe instead of rushing through the entire first half, they could have broken the series into 2 seasons, or spread the story out over more episodes.Art - I liked the characters in Saki. As always, some of the hairstyles draw a huge question mark for me, but I didn't see any real flaws in it. It wasn't the best art out there in my eyes, but it was really good....actually, to be more precise, it was very CUTE. This anime was more so CUTE than it's predecessor. So in art, I'll give it a 9.Sound - I'll give it a 9. It extraordinary, but it wasn't bad at all. I like the voices of the characters.....but I do question if Teru's voice was that high in the first series of Saki...I know she only spoke once, but I could've sworn the timbre of her voice and the tone was a little different...........but maybe it doesn't really matter since she only said like 1 word in the prequel (as far as I can recall)Character - I'm tempted to compare these characters to the prequel. But in truth, the reason why I liked the Saki characters better than the Achiga girls, is because I got to know them better. This show was so busy trying to catch up, that you didn't get to really know the characters as well as you may have wanted to.Enjoyment - I really enjoyed the show! However, because of the rushing to catch up, I really thought the were headed to the exact match that the previous show left off at.....ok, I don't want to write any spoilers, so I'm going to stop here and leave it at that. This show is cute, and by the end, it reminds you of why you like the Saki series so much! :D I give it an 8.Overall - 8. This show had lots of potential, and even with the few hiccups the series had, the show managed to find its pace and hold its own.

It was very good :)"", 'Appreciating side dishes after you have tasted the main cuisine is something I don\'t find feasible.That\'s the case when I started watching Saki - Side A.It wise to rate the story at the range of 6-7. Doing a side story had the potential to dive into the a whole new dimension and Saki - Side A gave a solid writing to support their cause. Side A chose to do a special adaptation to a group of girls who are directly connected to Haramura Nodoka, a deuteragonist of the Saki series. Much to my surprise is, it is given a 16 episode run which is something...I find wasteful.As the story goes, it was the usual Saki mahjong content. A lot of occult and 1/100th chance of it happening in real games, a lot of extravagant special mahjong effects, the good mind game dialogues. However, the pacing on Side - A exceeds the main story. They literally jumped from starting point in order to catch up to the main story\'s plot time and connected them fluidly in order to broaden the horizon of the Saki series. Unlike the main Saki story, I found Saki - Side A too less impressive.Adapting a main cast of boring characters, seemed to ticked me off the whole 16 episode run. I was always thinking after an episode, ""Why did they bother making a 16-episode story for this bunch of characters? They should\'ve use the budget for the Zenkoku!"". It was like that until the end.As far as the content is concern, the only interesting parts for me are the cameos of the main Saki casts. They were literally limited to just 3-4 lines which is a sad watch for me. I ended up falling asleep at some intervals and never bother re-watching the missed parts. However, if I were to disregard the relation to the main Saki series, Side A should\'ve been able to touch at least the border of my interested portion however, it was like convincing myself that 1+1=3 which spells impossible from the very start.Art and Sound remained faithful. Aside from the OP/ED themes, the bgms were still retained in order to drag the feel of the original Saki series to this side story. The character designs also remained similar and is visibly better than the 2009 version.To be fair, Side A finishes strong however, it still drives me nuts as to why this was adapted to a 16 episode run. A 5-episode OVA compressed should\'ve done the trick. The adaptation is full of annoying flashbacks that will either reveal a trick or two, or some 3rd rate drama to make the audience empathize with the characters but in my case, OH CRAP. I felt uninterested all throughout.Finishing, Side A had some good scenes however, it felt they have overdone their part as a side story. For spoilers, pardon me, I cannot help but root for their adversaries in the whole 16 episode run and I don\'t feel like cheering for the Achiga girls in the finals.

But I went and watched it anyway since it wouldn\'t hurt.It\'s more of the same: CGDCT (""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things)"". The dreaded ""moe"" animu; and said cute thing is mahjong.The lot of them have weird powers to help them win. And IMMHO, this BULL$#!7 needs to stop. Else, they need to use their powers on something a bit more fruitful than playing games. (I heard ""taking over the world"" is pretty popular. :P )And, as with the lot of CGDCT animu, there are TOO many cute girls herein. I stand by my opinion...that Koihime Musou is created only because the reality-challenged slobbering otaku-base would rather masturbate to cartoon girls instead of actually learn history. But this takes the same amount of teeth-rotting cake.Not to say that guys shouldn\'t run behind the skirts of animu chicks in order to escape the harshness of reality. But watching animu like this reminds me of visiting a mosque (that one day, long time ago) where the opposite sexes aren\'t allowed to intermingle. It all felt pointless and it\'s something I should never invest my time and money into.It would be nice if animu wasn\'t created by and for grass-eating herbivores... that Koihime Musou is created only because the reality-challenged slobbering otaku-base would rather masturbate to cartoon girls instead of actually learn history.

However rather than calling it a sequel, I would much prefer to call it a side story.For viewers who have not watched the original ""Saki"", I will try to keep the spoilers to a minimum, but however since you are already watching a sequel, the viewer will obviously know some spoilers for the original.As the girls of Kiyosumi High battle their way through the national mahjong tournament. A small group of friends of the moe, popular side...character Hanamura Nodoka saw Nodoka winning the middle school championship on television. They got motivated to revive their childhood mahjong club in hopes of someday meeting and playing again with Nodoka. Hence starting the Achiga Girls\' High School Mahjong Club, and aims for the national championships as well.For viewers who have not watched or finished the original ""Saki"". Since there were so many participating schools, the national tournament groups were split into two. Kiyosumi High drew the brackets for ""side B"" of the tournament group, and the story of the Achiga Girls tells the story and battles that were occuring through ""side A"" (hence the title)I am going to draw some comparisons to my earlier review of the original ""Saki"" anime, which you can check out here:http://myanimelist.net/profile/Fate25/reviewsMost of the good points from the original anime were carried into this side story/sequel. First is the introduction of a huge cast of characters. Each equipped with fully distinct colourful looks and personality. So much so that you will never notice that the story surprisingly does not have a main character. Since every single character is so interesting in this anime, there wasn\'t a need for a main character to carry the story.Second is that the anime dedicates a huge amount of time to developing the stories of its side characters, even the opponents that the Achiga girls face. So much so that you even feel sorry for the opponents when they lose to the heroines.The anime is dedicated to creating an emotional bond between the viewers and all its characters. Even if the opponents initially appear cold and ruthless in their attempted destruction of the Achiga Girls tournament hopes, in the following episode you will see the emotional story from the opponent\'s viewpoint. Seeing that in the end, every one of them are just sweet high school girls who fight hard to keep the hopes and dreams of their precious teammates and friends alive. Every single girl has deep emotional bonds with their supporting family and friends, and doesn\'t want to let them down, which creates a valid reason for them to fight so hard.In my opinion this is the greatest appeal of this anime, all those moments which make you feel ""awww.... she\'s just such a sweet girl...."". So much so that you actually feel really sad when the girls lose their tournament matches and breaks down crying, as they get overcome with emotion from letting their precious friends and family down.The third plus point is in the ""special moves"". Ever since the days of Dragonball Z and their super saiyans, good shonen anime has always followed the example of exaggerating their special or finishing moves with added animation and silly over-the-top names. It continues to work in this anime. With the new characters come new special moves, with the highlight being that you get to see Saki\'s undefeatable sister, the last boss Miyanaga Teru, in action.The sequel also does well to remove what I consider to be a slightly negative part of the original ""Saki"". Lesbian, aka ""yuri"" themes resound strongly in the original ""Saki"". Even though there no hentai girl on girl scenes, I do feel that the lesbianism in the original went overboard and this sequel tones that part down considerably. Making the viewing experience more smooth and enjoyable, as you don\'t get sudden, uncomfortable lesbian moments interrupting the development of the emotional character backstory, and makes the anime more acceptable by the mainstream viewing audience.In summary, Saki: Achiga-hen is a enjoyable anime, especially if you have watched the original. A huge cast of varied, adorable and sincere high school girls trying their best. The shonen-esque animations and special moves. The emotional connections you feel for these girls, as they battle their hearts out on the mahjong table, will keep you waiting eagerly for every next episode. character Hanamura Nodoka saw Nodoka winning the middle school championship on television.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryAbout Saki side-characters and their adventure through tournaments. I\'ll be honest, It\'s been a while since I watched Saki and I cannot really remember most of it let alone side-characters. But nevertheless I found this series fairly enjoyable and cute. It had fair flair of drama and also impact packing mahjong games as always. Not really much else to comment. A fair enough moe show about mahjong.✦Art & SoundNot impressive, not bad. Fitting enough, bright and enjoyable. Gotta love the ""no pan"" style. It\'s always a mystery...whenever they wear anything or not.Also, Nodoka confuses me as always. She feels so out of place with her giant melons. And her large/loose and light shirt with tie inbetween of her breast does not help. Funny to say, but she feels immersion breaking. Obviously not in a serious manner, but her way too giant melons bother me in this specific franchise.As for OST and music. Some were memorable and okay, rest really didn\'t notice. So good enough.✦Character3 things.1. Sakurako Gibbard adorable. (the side-side character. The cheerful minigirl with adorable facial expressions.)2. Toki, love her soothing voice (She looks like warai neko character and has same VA)3. Arai Satomi (VA). Love her voice anywhere.Aside that, cute enough characters, some adorable stereotypes. For example the always cold/shaking girl. And ones I mentioned previously. (excluding Arai Satomi voice acted character. I simply love the voice actor). Can\'t say there was much development, aside the ""battle hardening"" and some flashbacks regarding their past. So once again, overall good enough.✦Enjoyment & OverallWasn\'t sure whenever to ""review"" or not, but eh, screw it. Quite a solid 6 Anime, not bad, nor good. Not too interesting nor boring. I don\'t care about mahjong nor really sure of how game works. But it was presented in an enjoyable moeblob way with some impactful battles and a bit drama. whenever they wear anything or not.Also, Nodoka confuses me as always.

Side-A cuts out most of Saki\'s original grievances while being even better at what Saki did best: Intense, chaotic, and ridiculous mahjong battles.In fact, since 95% of this anime doesn\'t rely on the original Saki, it\'s completely watchable as a standalone. Just make sure that you know the rules of mahjong, because there isn\'t as much time to explain everything like in Saki....If anything I said about the original Saki worries you about that series (I wrote a review on it if you want more detail), I recommend giving Side-A a try instead.If you watched Saki or any sports anime, Side-A has a lot of what you\'d expect: A simple school-tournament plot structure, games full of twists and turns, and fun/exciting/beautiful animation flourishes to emphasize the characters\' emotions after pulling off a daring play or a nail-biting victory.The difference for me is mostly in the characters. Saki leans too hard into making every character gimmicky with lots of unfunny running gags to make sure that you remember everyone, even if you also hate them in the process. Meanwhile, Side-A immediately introduces compelling reasons for all of the main girls to want to win the mahjong inter-high. With maybe one exception, they are more believable and more characterized than much of Saki\'s main cast, so it\'s much easier to get invested in their journey right from the start. It\'s almost jarring how much more respectful Side-A treats its characters compared to Saki, like an actual sports/game anime.And by the end, the mahjong tournament battles DO deliver--in spades. Mahjong being a 4-player game, like in Saki, allows for complex yet emotionally charged battles of wits that leave you on the edge of your seat. Any player can be a relevant threat, and sometimes you never know who will take over the narrative in the end. And this aspect of chaos and unpredictability is even stronger than it is in Saki, which was what made that series refreshing to me as a sports/game anime in the first place.This is also where the Saki series turns up its superpower tag to 11.*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*Side-A starts with one character with an incredibly impossible mahjong ""talent"" in episode one, and then continues to introduce some of the most ridiculous ""totally-not-superpowers"" I\'ve ever seen in sports/game anime. And it\'s great, because every one of them has clear strengths and weaknesses and can be played around within the rules of the game, and they\'ll also have some crazy interaction with another character\'s almost-equally ridiculous superpower. And even with all this craziness, the superpowers never manage to truly overshadow the actual game of mahjong, so it just adds another layer of excitement and intrigue.*MINOR SPOILERS END*The biggest storytelling obstacle in these matches is the need to establish every character\'s background, personality, and playstyle during the match, and it\'s really difficult to do this without bogging down the pacing with constant flashbacks. However, Side-A manages to avoid this problem well enough by the end. There aren\'t excessive flashbacks to bog down the final matches\' pacing, the characters are given just enough characterization to establish entertaining dynamics, and the buildup to the climax is just superb.Now for the elephant in the room, while I do like the characters and characterization in Side-A better than in Saki overall, they are still quite weak, especially in the middle portion of the anime. Saki will at least drip feed interesting mahjong plays before moving onto the tournament, but Side-A isn\'t interested in showing the main girls\' intermediate steps toward the mahjong inter-high. There might be a training montage but without delving into what they learned or improved on, which hurts the overall emotional payoff when they actually do win over a tough-looking opponent. I think the final matches succeed in spite of that, but it does hurt that a third of the anime feels like a slog to get through.But none of those dull moments were painful like in Saki. I can at least excuse Side-A for rushing to the main event when it knew it didn\'t have much time to do so. The result is still that Side-A accomplishes more in SIXTEEN episodes than Saki does in 25. (The ""Specials"" episodes are just the last four episodes of the anime. They are a direct continuation and you should watch them after finishing the first 12.)With maybe more effort put into the characters and drama in the middle episodes of the anime, Side-A could have easily been an 8 for me, regardless of its dressing as a mere side story to Saki. It\'s kind of depressing to me that Side-A will just be in the shadow of Saki forever because of that. Despite its flaws, Side-A manages to simultaneously be the more entertaining and the more well-rounded experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who knows or is willing to learn the rules of mahjong--and isn\'t afraid of a little zaniness in their battle-of-wits. If anything I said about the original Saki worries you about that series (I wrote a review on it if you want more detail), I recommend giving Side-A a try instead.If you watched Saki or any sports anime, Side-A has a lot of what you\'d expect: A simple school-tournament plot structure, games full of twists and turns, and fun/exciting/beautiful animation flourishes to emphasize the characters\' emotions after pulling off a daring play or a nail-biting victory.The difference for me is mostly in the characters. Saki leans too hard into making every character gimmicky with lots of unfunny running gags to make sure that you remember everyone, even if you also hate them in the process. Meanwhile, Side-A immediately introduces compelling reasons for all of the main girls to want to win the mahjong inter-high.

That being said, Kowarekake no Orgol is a story of an unusual summer, when Keiichiro found a person ( of sorts ) who helped him to get out of the misery life put him trough.Though many compare the storyline to Chobits, I dare say it has little to nothing to do with it aside from an artificial...person. Firstly, this is not a love nor ecchi story ( nor is it shitty ). It is romantic in terms of the setting and story progress more than the relationship. Sometimes cliched but pulls it off nicely. Bittersweet ending that might have some of us in tears and shit.I was honestly surprised by how much of an eye-candy it was, with beautiful scenery and living, vivid animation. The character design is also awesome, although Flower may look a bit too much ""moe"" for some tastes.Simple but well fleshed out characters, considering the story length.Though far from a perfect watch, this show knows what it wants and for the most part figured out how to present it to its audience.

Here goes nothing.Well not to spoil this OVA (yes it is a OVA, even though some viewers don't like to watch OVA of anime because sometimes they aren't good enough) but there isn't much to write about.[Story: 8/10]The storyline I thoroughly enjoyed because it was lighthearted and easygoing. Yet I wish there was more and this did have (notice: did have) potential to be a good anime.[Art: 9/10]I went into this thinking that the art was going to be bad, because I have seen some OVA where the producers don't even care about this and just threw stuff together....This surprised me it was very good, and even though this is my first time reviewing I've watched many anime already and I always have an opinion. Good job producers on this short work.[Character: 6/10]OK this department sort of failed for me. The characters do develop but, not just enough for me. Of course I will let the viewer decide.[Enjoyment: 10/10]I thoroughly enjoyed this. The ED was great and man if anybody have the song PM me or something. Yes this OVA has surprised me in more ways than one so Good Job. Not only that but this did make me write my first review so awesome.[Overall: 8/10]Yes very good for a OVA. If you are looking for a sort of lighthearted, easygoing, yet has potential for a series, or just watching on a whim then try this. I highly recommend this for it was just a small company that made this so give them credit they did good.

We can say ""Sora no Otonoshimo, chobits, Eve no jikan, and many others"". They present the same things, its about an android (a robot that looks like a human) that helping their master. But neither those anime really hook me off, until i met Kowarekake no Orgel.STORY (9/10)There isnt any strong linear plot on this anime. but basically, Kowarekake no Orgel is focussing on how Keiichiro Kawada spending time with Flower (his android) on the summer days. So what\'s the fun?The synopsis may sounds boring, but dont...be arrogant. Honestly this anime is great at presenting the story especially the drama within in the story. While many 1 episode anime is rushing the story, but not in Kowareka no Orgel. The story is quite slow and very alluring,furthermore the way how the present every scenes its  pretty enchanting and . The way how they bring the audience feelings (in this case, me) is pretty smooth. There isnt any exaggerate moments, Kowarekake made it naturally like the water flow in the river even in the ending, i dont realize if my tears had fallen.ART (8/10)The art in this anime is pretty nice. The background is so bright and pretty details too. Furthermore, its really suitable with the animation itself. The background itself improving the atmosphere that happen in the series, like colorful and bright background makes us (the viewers) realize that this is on happy and cheerful moments and we cant help to feel the happy too. But beside of all that, the quality in this art is pretty common for the other anime.The character design is pretty much adorable too. Especially flower, she is pretty cute and really likeable character.SOUND (8/10)As for the ""music"" genre, i didnt really notice any songs in this anime. But beside of that, the BGM in this anime is really touchy and improving the emotion feels. With some piano sound, its really hyped up the mood. Especially in the ending, the BGM that using music boxes is pretty calming and touching. At that time, i cant help to shed my tears. and for The voice actor, they did a good job, every seiyuu in this anime really liven up the characters.CHARACTER (9/10)The characters in this anime is really likeable. Like i said before, Flower is maybe can turn you into a lolicon. The cheerful and clumsy personality that she has really makes the show became more attractive and beside Flower, we have Keiichiro as the main character. Keiichiro is more taciturn and quiet, but thats what makes this pairing become more interesting since they\'re filling each of their shortage. and within 28 minutes of the show, we will see a great development character especially on Keiichiro.OVERALL (9/10)Kowarekake no Orgel is an amazing one episode anime. With just 28 minutes, we like having a complex package of emotional things. You will feel happy at the moment but after a while you will feel sad or maybe ended up crying. What i really love is the way how this anime ended up, The ending is really satisfying and the most important thing is logic. So, basically if you want to have a  heartwarming stories with some deeply emotion on it, This anime is the one i can recommend to you.*I really appreciate any feedbacks, comments, or even critize* be arrogant.

They're nothing like the OVAs we had back in the old days (like, oh, I don't know, Legend of the Galactic Heroes!?). But this is a first in this time: a totally original one episode doujin anime OVA featuring a totally original story! I don't know the history of doujin OVAs (or OVAs in general, though I know the first OVA ever was Dallos, made in 1983 though it was a flop), but this one seemed...to touch a lot of people. A little OVA called Kowarekake no Orgel (Half-Broken Music Box).One thing that really surprised me was the animation. This anime was created by a bunch of newbies in a totally independent studio. I have no idea where the heck they got their budget from, but they sure used it well! Every scene is richly detailed and exquisite, even the characters' small movements and small things in the environment, like a water drop falling off of a flower. Seriously, how did a newbie studio get such a good budget for a one episode anime!? Wanna know what's even more crazy? This is a TOTALLY original independent project with absolutely no relation to any other anime, manga, light novel, visual novel, or any other media. EVER. That's what's great about it.I don't remember much about the soundtrack, but I remember most of the BGMs fit the moods of various scenes nicely. And the characters were very nice too! Keiichiro's just a guy who used to love playing music and his family until he lost the latter and gave up the former, along with his dreams. Flower's a discarded robot who's lost her memory and wants to help Keiichiro. I couldn't help but love the bond that they developed as they spent time together. It really shows what a great influence an innocent person can have on someone's broken life. I know that through experience. I wish some of the side-characters were a bit more developed and had more screen time, but I bet the creators didn't have much budget for more than one episode so I guess it's really not their fault. They serve their purpose well and they serve it to the end. Nothing more, nothing less.What I love most about it are the morals behind it. This anime is basically about letting go of the past, accepting the present, realizing that life is too short to be wasted, and moving forward. I love stories like that (if they're not bad or produced poorly, of course). Plus it doesn't try to preach to it's audience either. It just simply shows two broken souls trying to mend each other's broken hearts (or in this case, memories and dreams) and living their lives to the fullest, no matter how short it is. I do wish they showed what happened to Flower, but I think the creators want the audience to decide.All in all, Kowarekake no Orgel is a very sweet, gentle, and pleasant little OVA that will certainly touch the hearts of those who have lost something in life and have trouble moving forward. I certainly love it! Why don't you try it out? I wish it was a bit longer, but that's alright. Nothing in life is perfect. to touch a lot of people.

Flower has trouble retaining her memory so Keiichiro bought her a notebook which will be...later used by her as a diary so that she will no longer worry about losing what’s important to her. Each day of that summer season is a brand new experience for Flower as Keiichiro integrates her to society; gaining new experience, learning new things, meeting and socializing with other androids and humans.Not everything is sugary sweet for the two main characters thought.

Eventually some hints of Keiichiro’s past will be revealed during their interactions that he cannot seem to move on. Flower, being a helpful android she is tried some very amusing ways to help Keiichiro off his problems. All these are packed on a 30-minute short animation, as a viewer, I wished for more, but it could not be help; still the OVA gave a satisfying and wonderful story with a satisfactory ending.The animation of the OVA is great. A lot of attention is given to the environment making it very detailed. The color tones are bright and crisp looking, providing some very visually impressive backgrounds. The character designs for the androids are wonderful and very cute looking; all the attention was given to make sure the androids are very good looking in every camera angle, every movement, and every eye and facial expression they make. The same thing cannot be said on the human characters though; they are generic looking with noticeably less detail on their designs. In addition, Keiichiro and also other young male characters have spiky hair styles which I’m not a big fan of.The OVA has some very nice background music that complements the animation really well, giving the much needed impact intended to provoke emotions from the viewers. Also has an ending theme that is really good to listen having a lyrics that conveys the story nicely. Voice acting is also well done; I particularly like the voice of Asano Masumi as Flower, she handled her character really well. The same thing can also be said to the other characters.As for the characters, I like how Keiichiro and Flower has enough screen time to have some proper character development despite the relative shortness of the OVA, making them likeable and someone that the viewers can relate on.

The movie leaves things open for the viewer to figure out as they are watching it. Many of the few characters were bland, in fact there was only one character I really enjoyed, and it was because in the beginning she was too cute to hate. It was a short movie, that I myself wouldn't have mind if it was a 12 episode series. If it was a series I would be more inclined to grow attached to the characters. The emotions the show tried to bring didn't really come to...me, so it sadly failed at that. Over all, it wasn't bad, just too short. me, so it sadly failed at that.

Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54233/Sasayaku_You_ni_Koi_wo_Utau,"['This is a review of the anime as a production; not the actual show. Its sad that this is a common issue.The show was fine. A solid 6/10 cutesy yuri. You can bump the score up because it wasnt yuri baiting; its explicitly about girls dating. You can bump the score up even more if you want because there didnt seem to be any fan service. It respected the characters and the audience by not having perverted shots or compromising positions for comedy.By all means, i think i would have enjoyed this show.But there was an issue with the production thats common these days. They...animated (competently, but nothing special) the first few episodes. This gave enough material to make a trailer and an air date that was entirely too soon. Eventually, the airing of the show caught up with the production, and they were ""finishing"" an episode just hours before it aired.Make no mistake, they didn\'t ""finish"" the episode. They hit the deadline and had to submit the incomplete product as is. The episode featured important objects that were left out of a shot (notably, a microphone on stage), facial features that werent lined up and falling out of proportion or perspective. The animation was just straight up not acceptable.This was followed by an announcement that after only 8 episodes, we are to receive two recap episodes. You read that right:  TWO recap episodes.I feel like my time was wasted, and i just dont understand why they would ruin a show like this.Of course, no blame can be put on the animators or the rest of the creative team. This is purely from the show airing too soon and then impossible deadlines are placed. Why not just wait till its done? This show could have been bumped off 1 season and end up being a great production that will be loved for years to come. People fondly remember lesser stories from 20 years ago simply because they had solid productions.This was a story that deserved better. The characters were fun, the interactions were cute, and it was a rare thing for a respectful yuri to even exist. It was refreshing how the characters just talked about their feelings and resolved things instead of meandering about it till the finale.Its a shame, but I\'m not sticking around for two recaps and then more janky production.

Please don\'t listen to people who are commenting on what kind of romance this is without even watching it(only three episodes are released yet!).

I know that I\'ll surely savor this anime and if you\'re someone looking for yuri which makes you smile, this might be it.

The sweet, slightly ""dramatic"", and wholesome story, coupled with great art style, are all contributors to why I love this series. I also thought that the characters were relatively well-written in the source material. When I heard that this is getting an animation, I was excited to see the characters finally come to life.I really wanted to like this animation, but I can\'t. From the first PV I had my suspicions that the art used in this anime will drop in quality as the episodes aired, and I am not glad to...see that I was right. The latest episode (ep.7) had a significant art quality drop from the first frame Yori and Aki\'s faces are shown. The fact that this anime was also delayed from its original January 2024 air date to April also seem to indicate that there were production issues. The consistency in animation quality is very noticeable.The way the anime was directed and handled were jarring; each scene is literally taken frame by frame from the source material. The anime can literally be manga panels with voice over and there wouldn\'t be much difference. To be honest, it probably would have been better if they have done it that way and just add colour to the manga panels. I do not like how this anime was directed, and I\'m sure I\'m not the only one.At the end of the day, you have to like the series for its story, art style, music, and characters. Because I am biased from the source material, I rated this a 7/10, but it probably deserves a 6/10 at best.

The main focus is on romance in a general sense, then it shifts to music and the high school club scene, friendship stuff. Not a mature story with adults, more geared towards young teens. I think the story flows well and the romance feels natural, not forced or awkward. It's easy to binge-watch and really cute, though not mind-blowing, you kinda get hooked. It's rare to find such a nice yuri anime with a good story and naturally lovable characters, so it's refreshing. Hopefully,...we'll see more yuri anime like this in the future! we'll see more yuri anime like this in the future!"", ""In a genre often full of melodrama and often times contrived roadblocks to romantic progression, Whisper Me A love song is extremely refreshing in how open and direct the characters are with their feelings. As much as some juicy romantic drama can enhance a show, if done poorly the drama becomes a detriment and is a headache. As of episode 3, this is not a problem with this anime! Very early on these characters have admitted their feelings to each other, and they've been very open about how they feel about their relationship and it all feels so healthy and heartwarming.Within their openness about...their feelings comes natural conflict when they realize that their feelings of love for each other aren't exactly the same. And instead of taking 3 episodes to resolve this conflict, they instead give each other some time, talk to friends to sort out their thoughts, and come back to explain to each other how they feel! I really love how love isn't portrayed as entirely romantic in this anime. It goes through the nuances of figuring out loving someone and wanting to go out with them without it having that romantic label and what it all means. I find this acknowledgement that some people don't feel love particularly romantically but still feel strong love for others really relatable. Sometimes love will morph into something we'd call romance, and sometimes it stays as simply love for another, and I think that's really cool. There also seems to be a subtle unrequited love in this series that I'm interested to see play outAs for the art in Whisper Me A Love Song, it's pretty run-of-the-mill. Not amazing, not bad by any means, just perfectly fine and captures the characters emotions well! This anime does this thing where it'll frame scenes in cropped rectangles and have them fade out for a lot of its transitions. While some have criticized this for feeling like a basic function on a video editor, I actually quite like it. These transitions, while simple, give the anime a unique identity and really stood out to me.So far for the first three episodes I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it! At first, I found Kino's immediate openness about how much she loved Izumi a bit fast-paced, but now knowing how she sees love it makes way more sense!

It's mindless romance, consumed like one would watch a cheesy, stale romance movie and forget about it as soon as the credits roll.If I had to compare it to another yuri, I'd say it's a worse copy of Bloom into You, with a similar idea, but even worse animation quality.The animation is a gamble between good or bad, the moment you notice how often they compensate the lack of animation with panning and zooming stills, you can't unsee them anymore.As well as fade...out effects like I'm watching a video edited with Windows Movie Maker.Not to mention, you can also expect very bad background character CG, but that's probably a modern anime curse in general.

Kidou Senshi Gundam 00 Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6288/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_00_Movie__A_Wakening_of_the_Trailblazer,"['First original Gundam theatrical feature in almost two decades. The directorial talent behind Fullmetal Alchemist. The musical scoring of Kenji Kawai. The inclusion of aliens for the first time in the franchise\'s thirty year history. The namesake of a cultural phenomenon. To the cynical mind, Awakening of the Trailblazer could have almost instantly been dismissed as a failure due to the surrounding hype, the general attitude of indifference many fans have adopted thanks to Sunrise\'s shaky track record, and just the general air of disapproval by the die-hard Universal Century fans arguing that Gundam has just \'lost\' its way.Which actually brings up an interesting quirk...about Gundam 00. For a series that has drawn a huge number of parallels to Gundam Wing, and even Zeta Gundam thanks to the introduction of A-Laws (a la the Titans) in the second season, it\'s fascinating to see the movie component of the series turn out so fresh, and so originally its own piece of work; it\'s especially puzzling considering this movie almost has a doomsday quality to it, and where the focus and foundation of the series seems to borrow more from the likes of Evangelion than any Gundam show, it\'s almost as if Mizushima grew tired of Gundam and just decided to make a science-fiction flick however he wanted it to be.Story:The real interesting bit about the story is that it completely disregards any Gundam conventions, especially the almost collective defining theme for the franchise: human vs human conflict, and its effects on both soldiers and civilians. Instead you have, for the first time ever, a human vs alien conflict; granted the aliens are conceptual, and nothing really humanoid, which is a wise choice considering a franchise so deeply rooted in traditions would have felt cheated if the aliens were anything like those found in Macross. Likewise, this movie has no masked villain, and maybe the biggest slap to the face, is the ending, which averts the big showdown between protagonist vs villain found in almost every main Gundam series and seems to be more rooted among the lines of something you would find in Evangelion, though certainly more optimistic. The whole story gets very psychological and metaphysical towards the endConcepts aside, the story itself is a bit inconsistent. The story can be easily separated into two parts: the calm and happenings before the storm, and the storm. Though as a whole, the story is wobbly because it feels like two different people directed different parts of the story. The first half of the story is character centric and surprisingly dark, in that it almost possesses an apocalyptic air to it all, and the general sense of confusion, and fear is especially well portrayed in the events, ultimately creating an atmosphere of chaos while under the supervision of a useless government that has become radically pacifist. This half of the story is really uncharacteristically edgy and dark, and it\'s interesting because Gundam shows aren\'t like this at all, it is radical, and it is refreshing from the staple Gundam formula.The second half is where this movie treads back into standard Gundam territory, there is a huge fight that literally lasts for at least 1/3 of the movie and towards the end of it all, things get Evangelion-esque psychological (a la metaphysical visions and pseudo-philosophical babbling), and the prominent (admittedly cheeky) theme that peace can only be achieved when all living things can understand each other, rears its head to solve the problem and by the end, things get a bit ... flowery (literally). It is ideological, but at the core of this radical movie, it is still a Gundam.The problem with the story is that it is a bit of a roller coaster ride in keeping a consistent atmosphere, it\'s all over the place in keeping the same tone. Likewise, Mizushima tries too hard to provide us differing \'perspectives\' on this story with the segments including Marina, Saji, and Billy essentially doing ... nothing. Though I think that\'s something that should be blamed on the Anno Domini series in general and not exclusively criticism just for this movie. This story sometimes has a hard time of knowing where it\'s going, and the convoluted writing seems like it\'s almost teasing fans.Also, this story happens to have the most unnecessarily misleading subplot ever.Art and Animation:Production values are, as expected from a Gundam feature film, pretty high. The animation quality during the battle scenes are incredibly fluid, though inconsistent animation is prevalent in non-fight scenes, and the mixture of CGI and 2D animation is awkward at best.The character design is pretty consistent, some characters have had redesigns to show growth, though not too apparent. The innovator/clones concept may be looked by some as storytelling, but by others as taking a shortcut in character design (e.g. Mina and Nena similarities). Likewise, mobile suit designs are mainly rehashed or just colored with a different color palette, and the new Gundams look the same with the exception of Tieria\'s Raphael Gundam.The aliens (the ELS), are a mixed bag in terms of design, they\'re just parasitic fragments of metal, which doesn\'t make for the most visually appealing villain of the series. But it works because, Gundam as a series, has always had a very visual enemy to fight against (e.g. enemy mobile suits, mobile armor etc.), and having something as abstract as the ELS to fight against is both refreshing and innovative for a franchise so stubbornly rooted in its old ways.Sound:The score for this film is a bit of a disappointment, it uses the same tracks as the ones found in the first season. Though there is an Evangelion-like ominous chant track found towards the end that accommodates the scene effectively, that one effective track is boggled down by a horrible song (courtesy of UVERworld), and some very generic J-pop played during one of the battles in a misguided attempt at creating a ""valiant moment"", or something among those lines. It should be noted that this film actually doesn\'t have much background music throughout the majority of its course.Character:In many ways, Setsuna\'s condition is very similar to how Cloud Strife was in Advent Children. Both are lost, contemplative, and trapped in their own psych, but where Cloud fought and inexplicably, and suddenly, found a purpose. Setsuna slowly comes to the realization of his purpose, and why he is what he is. The social disconnection and isolation brought on by becoming an Innovator is a theme portrayed in Setsuna, as a character, much more effectively than the likes of Amuro Ray ever was.The emergence of Feldt as the traditional main pilot love interest is the standard Gundam trope, though Feldt is slightly more interesting because of her progression as a character throughout the series. The rest of the cast is pretty monotonous, relying on their character progression from the past seasons to establish their character, they aren\'t progressed mentally in the movie in any way. The lack of explanation for the emergence of Hallelujah, and the complete irrelevance of Descartes Shaman as a character makes the quality of the writing quite questionable.The main issue with characters for this movie is the size of the Gundam 00 cast, and Mizushima\'s inexplicable need to reintroduce every one of them (if not in a sloppily rushed way). Further adding to the problem is that these characters were never relevant, nor were they developed in any way, even in the series; so why Mizushima feels the need to include them in the movie is beyond me. Does anyone remember Klaus and Andrei? Me neither.Enjoyment:Awakening of the Trailblazer is quite a strange piece of work. On one hand, it\'s the most refreshing, and exciting Gundam installment in well over a decade, on the other hand, it is sloppy, it is convoluted, and it is embarrassingly idealistic. One moment it\'s a doomsday thriller, the next moment it\'s a hallucinogenic acid trip. It is real robot, it is super robot, it is psychological, it is science-fiction. Awakening of the Trailblazer is purely interesting, it\'s not a spectacular film, but it is very interesting, so for that factor alone, it is worth watching as a film that runs more on ideas than execution.Overall:It\'s important to point out that this movie is not the second coming of Char\'s Counterattack, nor does it traditionally define Gundam, in fact, it\'s not even an example of a good film. Rather, this movie is something conceptual, it has the right ideas, and the concepts are fascinating, but the convoluted writing and the inherent flaws of the series prevent this film from reaching its full potential. This movie is a raw engine running on ideas alone, with sometimes directionless execution. Though maybe one day, in retrospect, this will be a Gundam looked back on as a transitional piece into something even better. For a franchise so locked in traditions, Awakening of the Trailblazer is a flawed step into the right direction. about Gundam 00. For a series that has drawn a huge number of parallels to Gundam Wing, and even Zeta Gundam thanks to the introduction of A-Laws (a la the Titans) in the second season, it\'s fascinating to see the movie component of the series turn out so fresh, and so originally its own piece of work; it\'s especially puzzling considering this movie almost has a doomsday quality to it, and where the focus and foundation of the series seems to borrow more from the likes of Evangelion than any Gundam show, it\'s almost as if Mizushima grew tired of Gundam and just decided to make a science-fiction flick however he wanted it to be.Story:The real interesting bit about the story is that it completely disregards any Gundam conventions, especially the almost collective defining theme for the franchise: human vs human conflict, and its effects on both soldiers and civilians. Instead you have, for the first time ever, a human vs alien conflict; granted the aliens are conceptual, and nothing really humanoid, which is a wise choice considering a franchise so deeply rooted in traditions would have felt cheated if the aliens were anything like those found in Macross. Likewise, this movie has no masked villain, and maybe the biggest slap to the face, is the ending, which averts the big showdown between protagonist vs villain found in almost every main Gundam series and seems to be more rooted among the lines of something you would find in Evangelion, though certainly more optimistic. The whole story gets very psychological and metaphysical towards the endConcepts aside, the story itself is a bit inconsistent. The story can be easily separated into two parts: the calm and happenings before the storm, and the storm. Though as a whole, the story is wobbly because it feels like two different people directed different parts of the story. The first half of the story is character centric and surprisingly dark, in that it almost possesses an apocalyptic air to it all, and the general sense of confusion, and fear is especially well portrayed in the events, ultimately creating an atmosphere of chaos while under the supervision of a useless government that has become radically pacifist. This half of the story is really uncharacteristically edgy and dark, and it\'s interesting because Gundam shows aren\'t like this at all, it is radical, and it is refreshing from the staple Gundam formula.The second half is where this movie treads back into standard Gundam territory, there is a huge fight that literally lasts for at least 1/3 of the movie and towards the end of it all, things get Evangelion-esque psychological (a la metaphysical visions and pseudo-philosophical babbling), and the prominent (admittedly cheeky) theme that peace can only be achieved when all living things can understand each other, rears its head to solve the problem and by the end, things get a bit ... flowery (literally). It is ideological, but at the core of this radical movie, it is still a Gundam.The problem with the story is that it is a bit of a roller coaster ride in keeping a consistent atmosphere, it\'s all over the place in keeping the same tone. Likewise, Mizushima tries too hard to provide us differing \'perspectives\' on this story with the segments including Marina, Saji, and Billy essentially doing ... nothing. Though I think that\'s something that should be blamed on the Anno Domini series in general and not exclusively criticism just for this movie. This story sometimes has a hard time of knowing where it\'s going, and the convoluted writing seems like it\'s almost teasing fans.Also, this story happens to have the most unnecessarily misleading subplot ever.Art and Animation:Production values are, as expected from a Gundam feature film, pretty high. The animation quality during the battle scenes are incredibly fluid, though inconsistent animation is prevalent in non-fight scenes, and the mixture of CGI and 2D animation is awkward at best.The character design is pretty consistent, some characters have had redesigns to show growth, though not too apparent. The innovator/clones concept may be looked by some as storytelling, but by others as taking a shortcut in character design (e.g. Mina and Nena similarities).

For a franchise so locked in traditions, Awakening of the Trailblazer is a flawed step into the right direction.', ""When Gundam 00 finished its broadcast, I was quite excited to hear that there was going to be a film sequel to resolve the last part of Aeolia's plan mentioned in the TV series and that it would be the first Gundam iteration in the 30 years of its existence that would actually have aliens included in the story.A Wakening of the Trailblazer takes place 2 years after the end of season 2 where peace is slowly starting to come true with the A-Laws disbanded, but with the arrival of a bizarre alien life form called the ELS from a space ship sent to Jupiter...over a hundred years ago, all hell breaks loose and Celestial Being must step in again to save humanity.Even with this basic plot, I was very excited to actually be able to see this film because I am a rather big fan of Gundam, but upon viewing it, I was both satisfied and disappointed at the same time.First the good.The animation looks very similar to the TV series(which isn't a bad thing) but it is of significantly higher quality and shows it off especially during the action sequences. Speaking of action, the movie is full of it. Almost the entire film consists of insane, fast paced mecha battles that made us watch 00 in the first place, you won't be disappointed. The opening scene of the film is hilarious and parodies the series along with making a tribute to the ever popular Gurren Lagann and somewhat referencing the battle of A Baoa Qu from the original Gundam. Also the mecha designs are still as unique as ever, I couldn't tell you how many times I geeked out whenever they started to show off the new Flag mobile suits(ie Braves).Now for the bad(and sadly there is a lot of it)The story is VERY generic and any actual plot movement is nonexistent. The only thing that really moves the film's plot is the arrival of the ELS and the constant jibber jabber that minor characters make about stopping them before they reach Earth.  If there wasn't any of the fast paced fight scenes, I highly doubt anyone would have wanted to watch this film, there is no point to the story really.The ELS are fairly underwhelming as alien antagonists. Other mecha series such as Macross were able to successfully utilize aliens into the story by making them unique and interesting with a good backstory. Come on, how are 40 ft aliens who are afraid of affection and culture not interesting? Liquid metal aliens that are fleeing from their destroyed home planet simply doesn't cut it and their assimilation into vehicles on Earth are not frightening nor interesting, they're actually quite hilarious.The next major problem with the film was its handling of its characters. Several new characters are introduced to the film( ie Descartes Shaman and Meena Carmine) but add nothing to the story, it wouldn't make a difference if they didn't even appear at all. Shaman's character managed to disappoint me the most, as previews made him out to be a major character, instead he gets very little screen time and is there only to be cannonfodder. The returning characters also get very little screen time and most of their appearances are rather pointless, rendering them very one dimensional personalities. Saji and Louise were used in the TV series to show how ordinary people could get involved in conflicts that they don't think would affect them, but they don't serve any purpose in the film they're just there, much like Marina whose appearance seems even more pointless. I don't even know what their purpose was in being shown, despite the fact that they were there. These characters don't even progress any further in film or are the given any sort of epilogue at the end like in season 2, with the exception of a few characters in the last bonus scene.Besides all of my ramblings about how flawed Trailblazer is, the film is still very entertaining to watch because of its fast paced action sequences and high quality animation. You won't get much depth out of its non existent story and one dimensional characters, but if you want to watch giant robots blow the crap out of each other in fast paced battles, look no further. However, if you are somewhat of a perfectionist and wants to get the ultimate satisfaction out of watching the 00 series, ignore the film completely and just pretend the whole series concludes with season 2. over a hundred years ago, all hell breaks loose and Celestial Being must step in again to save humanity.Even with this basic plot, I was very excited to actually be able to see this film because I am a rather big fan of Gundam, but upon viewing it, I was both satisfied and disappointed at the same time.First the good.The animation looks very similar to the TV series(which isn't a bad thing) but it is of significantly higher quality and shows it off especially during the action sequences.

Although I did keep a few lingering doubts in my mind to make sure that the hype didn\'t ruin the film for me. Obviously being a movie, certain elements have to be condensed in order to function, so the question is: does Awakening of the Trailblazer serve as a fitting conclusion to Gundam 00? Well...Yes and no. Let\'s go over the main aspects of the story. This is the first entry in the franchise to introduce aliens, which is of course one of the film\'s biggest...selling points. The ELS do make for interesting obstacles, as merely touching them can mean a slow painful death. Combined with the fact that they\'re literally everywhere on the battlefield adds a feeling of horror and suspense that (let\'s be honest here) is rarely seen in Gundam. For the most part the film does a good job at building up the ELS as a legit threat. However Gundam\'s strong point has always been about the characters being more interesting than the mechs they pilot, so sadly we don\'t get any bouts between main characters since all of humanity has banded together to go up against this alien menace. Not to mention, if you never saw the TV Series, then the presence of aliens in a Gundam-related work can be very jarring, since it\'s only hinted at in Season 2. However my biggest gripe overall is the way the film handles it\'s characters. There\'s virtually little character development. Again, watching the TV Series is essential since it\'s there that all the characters reach the peak of their development. Feldt is the only one who gets any sort of relevant change and she\'s not even a main character. Because there\'s little development, I couldn\'t help but question the presence of two of the new characters: Mena who looks and sounds like Nena Trinity (something which is never explained) mostly serves as Billy\'s new love interest and does provide us some info on the ELS, but not much else. And then there\'s Descartes Shaman. The trailers seemed to hype him up as the potential new rival to Celestial Being, and honestly he was the character I was most looking forward to since I always felt that 00\'s villains were lacking compared to antagonists of the past. Sadly Descartes is merely a throwaway character. Although I will give props to the film for redeeming Graham Aker. Thank God he dropped that whole Mr. Bushido nonsense. However for a sequel to be good it needs to properly re-establish the returning cast (assuming they do return), and the story needs to stand out without needing to rely on past sources. Don\'t believe me? Watch Terminator 2. In the end much of my enjoyment for the film\'s characters and story was mainly due to the fact that I liked the TV series and I wanted to see how it all ended. But if you never saw the series, you won\'t understand why there are aliens, and you won\'t understand the relationships of the characters or their motivations.From a visual standpoint, Trailblazer looks pretty good, but when you go back and watch the TV Series, it doesn\'t seem like that much of an improvement. Don\'t get me wrong, the animation is smoother and the art is fairly detailed, but it\'s not like in Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa where the already good visuals that the TV series boasted where upped two times over. Still the visuals don\'t disappoint, though I am still annoyed by the male characters looking effeminate. The mech designs is one area that will be hit or miss with some people. I do find the designs of the new Gundams fairly unique. They take some of the elements from their Season 1 predecessors (such as the vent-less mouths) while still retaining the bulkier look of their Season 2 predecessors. Though I do admit that the Zabanya (Lockon\'s new Gundam) does look goofy with those picket fences hanging on it\'s hips. The ELS on the other hand remind of the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Hm. No wonder they\'re intimidating. However as far as battles go, they\'re fast paced, explosive, and damn entertaining, but I was disappointed by the lack of screen time that two of the main Gundam\'s have in the film (not gonna say which ones. If you saw the movie, you know which ones I\'m talking about). The 00 Raiser does appear again although I was disappointed by the way it\'s final moments were depicted.Much like the series, the music is pleasing to the ears. The opening song ""Closed World"" by the Back Horn does have some of that heavy dark mood that L\'arc En Ciel\'s ""Daybreak\'s Bell"" opening had, but without any of the hopefulness, and comes off as more impending. The ending theme ""Qualia"" is performed by Uverworld, who sang Season 2\'s first opening song. Personally I wish they got L\'arc back for the movie, but I guess beggars can\'t be choosers. Much of the background music is from the TV series, which is okay by me since they suit the scenes just right, and fit in with the tone of the film.In the end Gundam 00 Awakening of the Trailblazer does succeed in being an entertaining action film but it stumbles in doing so. From a thematic standpoint I was able to understand what Director Mizushima was trying to get across with the show\'s themes about ending war and understanding one another. These are themes that date back to the original Gundam series, and for the most part it deals with it in it\'s own way, but it didn\'t work for me until I sat down and thought about it. Because of that, I feel that the movie does get better with time, but then again that could just be me thinking too much about it. I liked the movie. It was fun, it was entertaining, but there were things about it that disappointed me. I\'d say the film is on par with Gundam F91, but not as good as Char\'s Counterattack. Still if you liked the series, I say watch the film and decide for yourself. selling points. The ELS do make for interesting obstacles, as merely touching them can mean a slow painful death.

It represent a lot about how much the art has developed through time in the Gundam history. However, it is not the best art and graphic you can find from Gundam. Unicorn on the other hand is an OVA series yet, its attention to small details...and effects are amazing and flawless. Therefore, in compare to an OVA airs about the same time that has better qualtiy overall, a movie has this level of art cannot receive its full marks.Sound: 8 pointsThe sound effect is solid. It fits the movie really well.Characters: 5 pointsEven more new characters are being introduced and follow second season's fashion, they are underdeveloped. Some very great characters are presented heroicly but was given less attention;  while other, included even some core characters, are being overexagereated in a very unrealistic way and could not resolves much about them granted extensive time spent on these characters overall.Story: 3 pointsThe worst aspect of this movie is the story. There is no clash between ideals,  the story is very cartoonish and lacks the freshness value that a movie should have had. the untolerable point of this movie is that it has more elements of a super robot movie than a Gundam. Many striking similarities to Fafner can be recognized. The movie has a increasing amount of meta-science elements that leads its collapse at the end due to its conflict with the logical based concept that has always been the core behind any great Gundam series.Enjoyment: 7 pointsThe battles are great as akways but that all it has...again, there are 'supermans flying around destroying everything'  to a point, it becomes very typical. Anyone that dislike beam spamming should be dissappointed watching this movie since this has 10 times more beam spamming than Seed or Destiny ever had and for 90% of the time the Gundams would flying around spaming fangs, bits and beams...again.The story is the crucial part to a Gundam movie or to any anime series overall since the art quality has been steadily improving in recent time while the level of depth to a story has been long given far less attention than it should really have. In addition, 'Awakening of the Trailblazer's failure to distinct itself as a Gundam series from the super robot series is perhaps its greatest weakness.Thus, overall, even the beautifully done animtion cannot covers for its easily recognizable weaknesses, so the overall score I can give ti tis 5, average.To sum up, the series has done very well in the first season but starts to decrease in quality over time while  could not able to meet expectations from experienced old Gundam fans. If you are a new comer to Gundam and you prefer action rather story then 00 may not be a bad place to start with; however, it should be note that even if you watch 00, you can't obtain a throughout understanding of what a Gundam series should be as well as the greatness in the stories of many great old Gundam series. I would highly reccomend any UC series over 00 and effects are amazing and flawless. Therefore, in compare to an OVA airs about the same time that has better qualtiy overall, a movie has this level of art cannot receive its full marks.Sound: 8 pointsThe sound effect is solid.

Anyone that dislike beam spamming should be dissappointed watching this movie since this has 10 times more beam spamming than Seed or Destiny ever had and for 90% of the time the Gundams would flying around spaming fangs, bits and beams...again.The story is the crucial part to a Gundam movie or to any anime series overall since the art quality has been steadily improving in recent time while the level of depth to a story has been long given far less attention than it should really have. In addition, 'Awakening of the Trailblazer's failure to distinct itself as a Gundam series from the super robot series is perhaps its greatest weakness.Thus, overall, even the beautifully done animtion cannot covers for its easily recognizable weaknesses, so the overall score I can give ti tis 5, average.To sum up, the series has done very well in the first season but starts to decrease in quality over time while  could not able to meet expectations from experienced old Gundam fans. If you are a new comer to Gundam and you prefer action rather story then 00 may not be a bad place to start with; however, it should be note that even if you watch 00, you can't obtain a throughout understanding of what a Gundam series should be as well as the greatness in the stories of many great old Gundam series. I would highly reccomend any UC series over 00"", ""The fact that the score for this is 7.48 is incredibly misleading and I cannot fathom how it has a score that high. This movie is a 4 at best, its bad. How is it bad? Well... if you liked Gundam 00, imagine stripping it of all character development, all creativity, all plot, all suspense... and all sense, only to leave you with one of the dumbest premises/villains ever.Gray intergalactic blobs are attacking!! and the Gundam team needs to teach them the meaning of love and peace. No really... thats it. That is the entire plot of the movie. No, seriously... that really is it!...It has nothing else building on the Gundam 00 series, just... intergalactic gray space blobs that can mimic and absorb matter and we need to not fight them and instead teach them love and peace.The animation was nothing to write home about for being a movie. I had seen about the same from the show. It was nice, clean, fluid and seizure inducing... just the way I like it.Music was just rehashed from the show, again, nothing to write home about.The voice acting was good. Voices stayed roughly the same from the show.In the original show, almost everything was cleaned up nicely. It left room for continuation but in a very narrow window. This movie should have gone back to Gundam basics. It is 4 years after the events of the show, the colonies that were in the series have come together to develop a government of the United Colonies. Unbeknownst to anyone, remnants of the A-Laws have infiltrated the colonies government's positions of power and have begun building mobile suits in secret. After 4 years and after amassing an army, they attack the Earth and destroy several cities and do some serious damage The gundam pilots, all having gone their separate ways after their time of peace must now be brought back together to fight this last battle for good. In the end you can have Setsune and the princess come together and he finds peace as the world finds peace.See? How hard was that? It may not be perfect but it is damn sure better than this!The ending I wont spoil, but really it too doesn't make any sense. It seems tacked on and weird. There were also a lot of scenes and character interactions that seemed important but were forgotten about and went nowhere. I miss the days of Gundam Wing, my friends. I really do...In conclusion, enjoy the series if you can... but skip this movie. Its not worth your time. You would have better luck watching something else. Virtus Signum gives this a 3/10.

Virtus Signum gives this a 3/10."", 'Not gonna lie, I expected worse.*Spoilers for Gundam 00 Awakening of the Trailblazer*So, let me get this out of the way. A lot of people seem to believe that this is the only bad installment in the Anno Domini timeline of Gundam, as well as the worst by that virtue. I disagree wholeheartedly. Yes, this film is insanely dumb, with asspull after asspull, and it is preachy as hell, but the second season had a lot of these same problems, and actually, as controversial as this may sound, that installment\'s even worse. At least this film doesn\'t ruin any characters, given that it redeems some...of them instead. It\'s no preachier or more contradictory than the second season either. It\'s still a bad anime, just not as bad as its predecessor. So, what made this film resonate so poorly with the Anno Domini fans? Well, let’s find out, shall we?Let me get the only two positives out of the way: I like that they brought back the ability for machines to turn invisible from season 1 since it was only shown once in season 1 and never again. Narratively, that is the only positive I can give it other than maybe continuing its theme, though I\'ll touch on why I can\'t give it that one in a minute. The other positive is that I like that there is this cheesy action movie retelling of the events of the end of season 1 with a filler ending that didn\'t actually happen in real life, sorta like with a lot of movies based on true stories, and how Saju commented on it. That was a nice touch.The concept of random metallic aliens (ELS) appearing is, to put it lightly, absurd. There was no foreshadowing to it from the main series and if anything, it\'s just a cheap ploy to reinforce the main theme of the Anno Domini era, that understanding is key to humanity. That has always been a theme of Gundam to some extent, but especially in this timeline. The problem is, like in Second Season, it becomes incessantly preachy with that message; it genuinely can\'t go 10 minutes without spouting that message, and it is genuinely annoying. That is why I can\'t compliment bringing back that theme like I ordinarily would. Also, I never attacked this ideology back in my Second Season review over a year ago, but here it goes. This claims that understanding is the key to the end of conflict. The problem is, even with understanding, people aren\'t always willing to agree, and not everyone is willing to listen, let alone understand. It\'s human nature, and this entire timeline, including this film, is naïve for thinking otherwise.Another reason it doesn\'t make sense is that this era also tries to keep in some interesting bits of realism rarely seen, notably involving G-force (which comes in for half of the Gundam timelines)!during that one time in season 1 when Graham having trouble with his Flag because of that, making it jarring when you see everyone perfectly fine with insanely fast mobile suits far outspeeding anything from the previous seasons. Coming this with pretty much sentient yet not sentient metal alien parasite things coming to this world for understanding via absorbing everything (notice that insane contradiction), and you have absolute absurdity where it has no place.There are a ton of asspulls aside from that one. First off, only Tieria can come back as some kind of AI thing that can use another host body of himself because he’s one of many Innovades. How come no one else can? Also, Innovades are apparently clones that are meant for information, hence why Ribbons Almark and Nena Trinity are clones of people that appear in the movie. They\'re the only only ones we see with clones though, and Tieria seems to just clone himself like Ribbons did back in season 1. Apparently there are a ton of people, including random citizens, that have amazing quantum brain wave potential. They never really explained that well in the series but you mean to tell me that people with no combat experience or lab experiments or whatever can do this? I get it, Universal Century did the same thing with Newtypes, except they explained things, that this was a space-induced evolution. Here, nothing.Apparently Louise and some other random girl, both of whom do nothing in this movie, are Innovators like Setsuna and the new character, Descartes Shaman (who is just here for some reason and we don\'t know where or how he was discovered to it an Innovator) since only Innovators can feel this strange and painful sensation from the ELS, and other people with Quantum Brain Waves can\'t, for some reason. 00 Q-T’s Quantum mode is just slapped in there during the final 10 minute mark with no explanation or buildup beyond “this Gundam that Setsuna pilots is the key to understanding”, and other Gundams can do ridiculously crazy things now. Lockon has two Haro units for some reason when he only had one in the series, and they don\'t explain where or how he got the blue one. I can go on, like about the inconsistency of how TRANS-AM works, but now I’ll just talk about the ending.They literally end en medias res. No joke. All that talk about understanding, all that conflict, just to end on Setsuna moving to God knows where in order to talk with the enemy aliens (we don\'t see him engage in dialogue with them, we just see him go somewhere) and a giant space flower blooms where the ELS Sphere was. I genuinely laughed my ass off at this. I get that this is a connection to Setsuna’s flower from the second season, but this is just cheesy. Still, nothing here is resolved. It\'s like an even worse version of how Char’s Counterattack ended, except the new characters here aren\'t as bad as the ones there.Speaking of characters, for all intents and purposes, the main cast is the exact same as before, except Lyle ""Lockon Stratos"", who for some reason is now much more jovial and laid back. Most of the other old cast are just as bleh as before with three exceptions I\'ll talk about in a minute. Let’s talk about the two new characters: Mina and Descartes. Mina is literally a more annoying Nena Trinity with no emotional baggage, who is suddenly introduced as Billy’s lover for some reason. All she provides is awful comedy and some necessary exposition. Descartes is just some random asshole with hardly explored personal lab baggage and that’s about it, especially since he dies halfway into the movie, not even being there to help in the final act.The 3 main exceptions I wanted to talk about are Billy, Graham, and Andrei. Billy isn\'t a pathetic and inconsistent cunt this time around. Instead, he’s just a dork with exposition. Still a bad character though is what I\'m getting at. Andrei is just there for some sacrifice in the final act and while I don\'t think this truly redeems his character, it\'s nice to know that they tried and that even this guy can do a good thing. Now Graham, he is what he should\'ve been in season 2 and not some dead-set weeaboo. Here, he’s still relaxed but cool and powerful, be his sacrifice at the end actually means something to the characters. He gets a salute from me for that and for being the only good character in this film.This film has a lot of bombastic, flashy action with many sparkly and multi-colored particles, and the animation is up to snuff for a film. At a glance, this film looks gorgeous, as you\'d expect from a big mecha action film. The problem is the insane amount of awful CGI hallways and battleships there are, as well as the ELS in most of the second half of the movie. It becomes rather hard to look at sometimes despite the mostly good and flashy animation and action. Again, the film overall looks good, but the increased and equally bad CGI from the previous installments that wasn\'t very frequent back then, bogged things down.Conversely, I found the overall OST by Kenji Kawai here to be better in the original series, with a few new and interesting tracks. That said, it\'s still not that great. The only track I really remember is Last Mission, which was a perfect score to accompany the visually chaotic and overall climatic spectacle of the final battle. The OP, ""Tozasareta Sekai"" by THE BACK HORN, is a pretty good OP, especially the full version, though some of the other OPs from previous installments, mainly the first season, are better, which proves that if nothing else, this timeline has great OPs overall. The ED, ""Qualia"" by Uverworld, is a pretty meh Uverworld theme and one of the absolute weakest I\'ve heard from them, which is disappointing.The dub for the first two seasons was overall sort of decent, despite a few weak performances and equipment issues. Here, no dice. The dub kinda suck here, with Brad Swaile’s repressed role of Setsuna being the only saving grace. Is it just me or did a lot of characters get a casting change, each of which being for the worse since many of these voices don\'t have good delivery or even feel right with these characters? The worst offenders of this are Tieria and Saji it seems. Regardless, this was a pretty weak dub, especially for the time where dubs were actually at their peak.Not gonna lie, I wasn\'t very entertained by this film. The action didn\'t sit right with me, the characters were still pretty bad, the weird comedy from Mina was insufferable and cringe-worthy to me, and the plot was a preachy, messy disaster. I was almost bored. There were some really stupid moments, particularly the ending, that made me laugh my ass off, but overall, I didn\'t have that good a time with this film, and when an action film, even a flashy one, isn\'t engaging, that\'s a problem.This movie was the final nail in the coffin for the Anno Domini timeline and embodies pretty much everything wrong with it. The asspulls and inconsistencies, the awful characters, the insane preachiness, everything. I’m not gonna go out of my way to call this the worst Gundam timeline, nor am I going to call this the worst installment of said timeline, but both are pretty bad overall. Even the decent music and flashy visuals can\'t save it. With all that said, I bid you adieu. of them instead. It\'s no preachier or more contradictory than the second season either.

After much anticipation, I would have to say it was a bit of a disappointment.Story: 7I would say the biggest problem I had with this movie is its storyline. It was pretty generic as far as mecha anime story lines go.  I was expecting something new.  It flows somewhat well and keeps you into it throughout.  It also builds wonderfully to a climactic ending battle seen, the only problem is that it just ends.  It seemed...as if they couldnt figure a spectacular way to end the story so they thought up something stupid.  My initial reaction was,""That\'s it?""  Also make sure you keep watching after the credits because the story tries to redeem itself with something extra but just adds more questions.  The bottom line is the story was descent at best.  Not enough drama in the story at all.  The best part of the story were the Gundams and the battle scenes.  But they save the best Gundam for only the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I wanted to see much more of that.Art: 10The art was great, quite flawless.  The battle scenes were crafted perfectly so that you could see what was happening.  The Gundam\'s were very cool.  Like I said earlier the best of the Gundams doesnt make an appearance until the last 10 min or so.  But besides the fact the Gundams were cool and the characters were drawn very well.Sound: 8The Voice acting was great but a little difficult to get into at first.  I watched the first and second season in English so it took a few minutes to get used to the new voices.Characters: 7All the old characters were in it as well, especially my favorite Patrick Coulisour ""Ace pilot of the AEU"" haha.  It just felt a little too congested.  So many characters for a two hour movie was too much.  The new characters didnt really even have much to do with the story line so they probably could have been left out.  Some characters who had major parts in the first two seasons were left with two or three cameo scenes.Overall: 8Overall this is still a really good movie.  Definitely worth seeing.  Animation is great and it had a high quality cast of voice actors.  I just wish the movie had a better storyline.  It needed way more drama to keep me on the edge of my seat.  They also did a poor job with character relationships.  They seem to build throughout the movie and evolve into nothing.  For most people im sure the fighting will be enough because the battle scenes are fantastic.

They\'re all over the place. (Why is Ribbons here?)- Faceless antagonist (just a bunch of funnels really)- Pacing is wack (I kinda wanted at least a montage of preparation against the funnels but...*insert Spongebob Time Card*)- Action is pointless (fighting funnels?)- Felt is hurting herself by liking a guy who thinks he\'s a Gundam.- DAT ENDING!!

The artwork and sound were fantastic as you would expect from an anime movie made in 2010 but it couldnt make up for all of its flaws.Firstly, the story just didnt make any sense and it just seemed like it was trying to push some kind of peace message. The fighting was not very good and somewhat sparse throughout the movie. Honestly, this disappointed me the most as I was looking forward to some badass fighting.The...movie also introduced a lot of characters out of the blue and many for no reason.

The reason is clear, fighting a mindless being like robot or monster...was always less heart moving than fighting a sentient being and especially of the same race like humans. You can massacre millions of robots and monsters and you won\'t feel a thing. Maybe for other show is okay, but not Gundam, because it wants to tell you that every fight has a meaning. While watching they fire their beams, rounds, and missiles everywhere and aliens exploding here and there, what I thought was.... this is as fun as me spraying my room with insecticides to kill mosquitoes... which is not fun at all and more like a chore.Emotionally driven combat is long gone in this one. Simply said, this is so not Gundam.I still hate the characters from the series as well, especially ""discount Hiro Yui"" ups I mean Setsuna The Gundam Lover, Insignificant princess, etc. But I still like the series though, but not this movie, this movie is a stain to the franchise. was always less heart moving than fighting a sentient being and especially of the same race like humans.

Its not perfect, but its not worth thinking hard about what I didn\'t like.""I didnt like the ending. I didnt like the enemy all that much. The foreshadowing combined with the whole motif made the end a bit obvious with a little thinking of why the aliens behaved like they did. Feldt kind of ghosted at the end despite the effort they put into her being the best girl. There really was a lot of things I didn\'t care for or find amusing.But I just could not help but...still be captivated by the movie. It did give me an end to the series that was satisfying enough (not sure how the alleged third season will play out) and the action and animation was top dollar. Honestly the little kid in me grinned every time I would see the absolute visual mess of hundreds of explosions on screen every time.

Who knows, I could\'ve created the next Flappy Bird clone in that two hours but no, I spent it watching this. So instead, I pass the torch onto you. Recreate Flappy Bird. Don\'t watch this.Conceptually, this movie could have been something great. The basic premise, though simple, could have easily been expanded into a whole \'bother season. For the first time in some 30 odd years, the Gundams aren\'t fighting other humans. They are fighting an alien race. You...would think that the creators would have went all out on this idea and made it at least on the same level as the series it\'s based upon but, alas, failure and disappointment are all that we get.***Be forewarned, there are some spoilers ahead.***To start with, let\'s get the ""plot"" of the movie out of the way. Four years have passed since the end of season 2 and things are going well for Earth. Peace has pretty much been found and the Gundams, though still around, aren\'t really needed much anymore. That is, until ""they"" appear. Who are ""they"", you may ask? Yeah, I don\'t know either. Gray space blobs from Jupiter is what it seems like. Though we will just call them ELS as the movie does for simplicity. Anyway, the ELS appear on a derelict probe that was sent to Jupiter some 100 odd years ago and are headed for Earth. Quantum brainwaves are there goal and where can they find those? In humans, of course! Yada, yada, time goes on and we humans are about to be annihilated. So we fight back. Kinda. Really, it\'s all about love and understanding our enemy. Seriously, that\'s about it. Through his mass amounts of love and understanding, Setsuna saves the day and the ELS create a giant flower in space. WTF?What about the character development, you may be asking? Well, look elsewhere because none will be found here! The only real development is that Feldt suddenly has a burning love for Setsuna. I don\'t know about you guys but I didn\'t see that one coming. But then she decides that Setsuna\'s love is simply too great for any one person. He\'s just too hot to handle. Other than that, Setsuna goes all flower power on us and turns into some shiny white-haired guy/thing. I hope that\'s not their idea of what the Innovators should look like. Other than that, everyone else just stays the same. I thought they had some potential with Descartes but nope, they kill him off in the most anti-climactic way. And what\'s with Meena? Who the heck is she and why is Billy with her? Oh, it\'s because she has a nice rack and legs, as evidenced by the fan-servicey scenes involving her.The animation was good though so it\'s got that goin\' for it, which is nice.Really, I look at this movie in the same way I\'m looking at Vladimir Putin of Russia right now. He spent all this money and all this time on the 2014 Sochi Olympics so that the rest of the world would look at Russia in a new light and then he goes and ""invades"" Ukraine. In one single move, he ruined everything he was working towards. And that\'s what this movie does to the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 series. It takes everything that I found masterful about the original series and smashes it all to bits.So again, I say to you, save yourself. Save yourself two hours of your life. Flappy Bird must live on and you can save it. Don\'t make the same mistake I did. Let season 2 be the end of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 for you and pretend this movie doesn\'t exist.

You\'ll thank me later.Over and out.', 'A quick preface to say that if you haven\'t read my review for the Gundam 00 series then I recommend that you do because this is going to be written relative to what I said there. And one of the things I said was “I\'m finally done with Gundam 00.”, but oh ho ho this is the Gundam series that just will not quit. With this two hour movie Gundam 00 is just barely the longest Gundam series ever made... for better and worse as it continues the downward trend that happened through most of season 2. But season 2 still generally held on to...the series\'s good qualities and didn\'t succumb to its missteps. Can the movie accomplish the same? Let\'s take a look. Also, expect spoilers or skip to the final paragraph if you want the recommendation.Mobile Suit Gundam 00 The Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer [sic] is a title that\'s two integers and one random semi-colon away from being the name of a Kingdom Hearts racing game. It also stars something new for the Gundam franchise: aliens! All is well in the Earth sphere now that everyone has abandoned their differing interests and have gained an inexplicable peace without war that satisfies everyone, but soon humanity faces a new common enemy as a race of aliens dubbed the ELS threaten to drive humanity to extinction. Instead of the usual thing with the aliens being a race almost exactly like humans except with a tail or a weird symbol on their forehead, they\'re actually metallic-like shape-shifters that can\'t verbally communicate and bond with things to assimilate (i.e. kill) them.The addition of aliens to Gundam has met with a lot of controversy, but I can\'t understand why anyone would care. Gundam 00 is an alternate universe series, and that\'s the whole reason they exist: to experiment with the standard Gundam formula that\'s been kept mostly consistent in the Universal Century timeline. It doesn\'t taint any franchise ideology. The existence of aliens in Gundam 00 doesn\'t imply the existence of them in other series. Secondly, communicating with other intelligent life was hinted at in the actual series which in fiction is practically enough to confirm they exist in that universe so it\'s not out of nowhere. Lastly, the use of a non-verbal lifeform that\'s threatening to humanity\'s existence is a great medium to use for displaying the series\'s general themes of understanding to prevent conflict, and ties it to the series\'s unique technology that\'s a necessity to communicate such as telepathic quantum brain waves and Innovators. The aliens were the most clever thing the movie managed to come up with, and their first doomsday attack on Earth was cool to watch and had one of the four cool things Allelujuah did in the entirety of Gundam 00.Getting back to the ongoing story, it\'s been two years since the end of season 2. Which isn\'t that much time, but apparently it was enough time to make a big budget movie about Celestial Being that we see a bit of at the start of our movie. Although it\'s not enough time to expect anyone to noticeably physically age, the creators still want to show time has passed so everyone with short hair has now grown it out considerably while everyone who had long hair has had it cut. It\'s not a big deal, but it\'s pretty funny how it\'s seriously almost a 1:1 ratio. However silly this was, it was all worth it because Felt with short hair is adorable. Short haired Felt is 90% of the reason to watch this movie. She also now has a sudden romance with Setsuna that feels completely undeserved (like anyone\'s interest in such a dull guy), but it\'s probably because the creators realized she got the short end of the stick out of all the main characters. Too bad Setsuna doesn\'t care as usual.The rest of Celestial Being also gathers together again, each with a newly designed Gundam that looks far better and more elaborate than the season 2 redesigns. While on this subject of art design, the animation is as good as ever which is actually kind of lame. Since the series looked almost as good to begin with, the jump in quality you\'d expect from a movie almost isn\'t there. The frame rate is better, but that\'s the only change that really stands out. Despite the action being as intense and flashy as ever, it\'s far harder to get into because of the nature of the enemy. There are no interesting one-on-one rivalries because our new opponents are completely mute and without identity, and so for all of your action scenes you have a bunch of mechs flying around avoiding the metallic spears trying to latch onto them while shooting wildly. No beam saber clashes, no clever maneuvers and people shouting ""what!?"", just going fast and blasting away for several minutes in wide-open space. With the action scenes and exciting scenarios being the greatest strength of Gundam 00 and what season 2 had to fall back on being nearly gone, A Wakening of the Trailblazer has to rely on its story and characters.Several characters return but none develop because their character arcs were already finished. New sub characters are introduced only to end up dying and/or doing nothing because the story is still too focused on Setsuna like season 2 was. One new character is named Meena, who looks exactly like Nena would after this time skip. But lo and behold, this confusing thing is never addressed in the movie and only in a niche manga where it\'s revealed one of Meena\'s ancestors contributed DNA to the clones that became the Trinitys. In that case Meena\'s family must have been incredibly lucky with inbreeding considering they look exactly the same generations later. Graham returns and is the only one who has their personality elaborated on in ways the series didn\'t do as we\'re actually shown the change in him after his final fight with Setsuna. Susano-o, however, does not come back even though it wasn\'t fully destroyed and then Graham just ends up being tossed away again for characters less cool than he is.Nearly all of this movie falls apart under scrutiny and you\'ll wonder where the time went after numerous unnecessary scenes of the government talking about how they need to evacuate citizens and their attacks on the ELS that continuously do nothing. This all climaxes in Setsuna using his new Gundam\'s improved powers to telepathically communicate with the ELS to understand what they want.We learn that the ELS\'s home planet was under danger so they\'re migrating. Okay, that makes sense. And that they\'re bonding to and killing humans in order to understand them. ...What? With the ELS\'s ability to learn about things they touch, you\'d think they\'d realize that it\'s impossible to read the conscious of someone who is dead and give up. But more importantly, why does this have anything to do with their survival? They aren\'t even after Earth\'s environment since they just pack up and leave after like nothing happened. If they just want to bond with humans, then why did they begin with taking over vehicles and running them over? That doesn\'t help anyone. Why are they after people with quantum brain waves? Why do they want to merge with people without them as well then? How does Setsuna\'s communication with them do anything to fix the problem of their migration? Why do they form a big flower at the end? Is this their new planet or something? If they can do that anywhere in space, why was their extinction even a possibility? Why why why? Nothing is resolved and all we learn is that the problem made no sense to begin with because the ELS apparently didn\'t have one. For a story about understanding, I didn\'t understand diddly squat. The ELS just killed a ton of people for no reason. I just watched a two hour movie just to be told at the end it was all for nothing and there\'s no concrete thematic lesson. Get out of here.Well, I said all about what I\'ve wanted to say already. For two hours you\'d expect I\'d have more to talk about, but so little of significance actually happens and the plot is thin despite being stretched so far out. The good qualities of the series such as the action are diminished while the worst parts like plot depth and character drama are exacerbated. It\'s an unnecessary conclusion and doesn\'t really shed light on anything from the series. I\'d say skip it unless you still loved season 2 despite its faults. If its faults are enough to make you hesitant about the movie\'s continued decline of quality, then steer away. You aren\'t missing anything important. What a lame end to something that started off so promising. the series\'s good qualities and didn\'t succumb to its missteps. Can the movie accomplish the same? Let\'s take a look.

This is an alien invasion story, while the ELS were oblivious to their attacks at first, this is the problem you cannot sympathize with the ELS properly as they have a different concept of morality, you can sympathize with the oppressed spacenoids that made up Zeon, the abandoned humans that became the Vagan, and ZAFT being victims of racism.Secondly, Feldt declares her love...for Setsuna out of the blue, although I like the pairing it just wasn't introduced right, it makes sense that they have been comrades for a long time but there wasn't any build up to it, she just confesses randomly and worst of all, their relationship is left unresolved. for Setsuna out of the blue, although I like the pairing it just wasn't introduced right, it makes sense that they have been comrades for a long time but there wasn't any build up to it, she just confesses randomly and worst of all, their relationship is left unresolved."", ""I've been waiting for this movie for a while, and could barely restrain my excitement when it was finally released on DVD. When I sat down and watched the movie, my thoughts were all variants on 'This is gonna be awesome!' Well... I was half right. The fights were spot on in terms of battle mechanics. Though the plot was half decent, there was little character...I want to say growth. Setsuna had reverted to his original self in season one. He was surly and withdrawn. When the chips were down, he then proved to be all but useless. Tieria's return was a pleasant sight, and...the one-sided romance between Feldt and Setsuna was cute. The final battle was an epic clash, but I was disappointed with the new 00 Gundam. All it did was the old 'Big Beam Sword' trick. The teleportation gate was interesting, but ultimately had one use.Overall, it was a good action/mecha movie. As a Gundam feature, I found it a bit lacking. If you've seen the show, but not the movie, then you'll be fine with that. The movie is just a nice little epilogue. It could have been worse. But then, it could have been so much better. the one-sided romance between Feldt and Setsuna was cute. The final battle was an epic clash, but I was disappointed with the new 00 Gundam.

Let's just say that I only finished this movie for Haro.2) You get to see more of the characters from the show 00.3) Good animation and sound.Cons:1) The story is not traditional Gundam. It is a continuation of the weird supernatural stuff from the end of 00. So some might like this aspect but I personally did not.That's pretty much it. If you're bored and need something to watch I would recommend this movie but if there are other anime series that you are contemplating watching I would recommend those. "", ""This film gives 00 a great definitive ending, but it's execution is a little disappointing. It's still definitely worth a watch for people who watched the show, even if it's a little disappointing.Watching this right after watching the 00 show, it's obvious that the show wasn't written with the intention of making this movie. The show was extremely tightly written with no loose ends, so this movie has to awkwardly contrive a plot just to exist. The comparison is pretty jarring and makes the film seem like more of an afterthought.The music and visuals are to the same standard as the show, but with a...little bit of additional quality thanks to it being a film. The music is now done by a real orchestra instead of the show's midi orchestra, but it still feels consistent with the music in the show and the change feels pretty subtle. The animation looks about the same with mildly higher animation quality and detail, I really like how the film is consistent with the show in these aspects.The story actually has some really interesting aspects to it, I like the idea of what it goes for and some of its execution is fantastic, but it's marred by poor pacing. The film has a pretty dull start, they try to capture the mystery of the alien species, but the way they set it up is really goofy and uninteresting. The mystery of it all improves when you know more and can see how fundamentally different the aliens are, funny how knowing more about them made them more mysterious. They spend too much time at the start of the film  confusing the viewer instead of pushing the plot forwards. They introduce a new character who does nothing and then leaves the film halfway through, which was a waste of my time and the film staff's time for seemingly no reason at all. They show a bit of the world after the events of the show and how it changed, which was nice and they didn't dedicate too much time into showing this aspect off, it actually felt natural. The plot is also very predictable, I figured out the conclusion way earlier on than I feel I should've, this made me feel a lot less interested in the film overall. I will say though, that the way the show referred to the upcoming communications with aliens was much more interesting than the way this film portrays it, making this film feel like it didn't need to be made in the first place and there's definitely an argument out there that this film makes 00's story worse overall.There isn't too much new in terms of characters, Setsuna and Feldt are the only characters with new developments here. I really like the way those two aforementioned characters are developed here is really well done, they gave them a new character arc that's short and sweet. The other characters are mostly the same as they were previously, which leaves more time for the rest of the film to move forward, but this time isn't used very well and the film feels slow and bloated. I do lie the character of the aliens, the mysterious aspect of them makes them more interesting.Overall, the film has a lot of bloat, but it also has a lot of really interesting aspects to it. I can only recommend this film to people who've seen the show already because its a sequel, and it having the definitive ending for 00 that makes it worth a watch. I will say that I found this film quite disappointing compared to the show though. little bit of additional quality thanks to it being a film.

After seeing such a realistic setting with pretty much serious tone, then we get, eh, aliens? Yeah, I know that it was already been teased in the original series, but it still feels weird for me.Anyway, this movie wraps up Aeolia Schenberg's whole plan from the TV series; aliens came for invasion to Earth. I address it that way because that's the way it is; the main conflict is already resolved in the original 00 series (albeit it might still leave some questions behind), so this one is...just an addition to it. Characters also feel more flat compared to their TV series' counterpart, even the newly introduced characters barely played anything significant here.I'm not really fond on how they conclude the overarching theme of 00 here. It feels so cheesy lol. It might be the result on delivering it in a way too idealistic. It's kind of disappointing since 00's theme is probably one of few things that I like in the series.Despite that, I still found myself enjoying the movie, mainly for the great visual. It's also great to see old characters made their return.Pros:-Great visual-Good character designs return-Likable characters make comeback-Good epilogueCons:-Bland plot-Flat characters (both the returning and new ones)-The overarching theme is delivered in a way too idealistic and cheesy; it makes a supposedly great message can't be taken seriously just an addition to it.

It is one of my favorites. The show had some problems, but I was OK, because, overall, it was a great show, with amazing mechas and a decent story (excluding the conclusion of Season 2). Then, they released this OVA. Let me explain, it is not bad, but it is not good either. I`ll leave my opinions so you decide for yourself.Story: It starts pretty well, and you have high hopes. The end of Gundam 00 leaves some questions behind how the OVA is going to proceed, right? I mean, you are reading a review for the OVA, I assume...you`ve watched the show. Well, so, it actually starts well, and they give you a reason for some events that happened in the main series.Then... I don`t know, it becomes a mess. It goes from a 10 to a 0 so fast that you will get lost, thinking ""what am I missing? "" Some events are tackled in a hushed way, they will provide weird explanations, weird motives, and weird decisions for crucial events that will confuse you even further. As always, it gives you that mystery, making you wonder ""Holy s***! I bet it will be an epic explanation because this is awesome!"". Hahahaha. No. Don`t expect a good conclusion. JUST DON`T! It makes me sad because Gundam 00 is a good series. And... they decide to close the story with this. The conclusion is so bad that I can give you an analogy using LoTR for you to understand. Imagine that instead of explaining that the One Ring had less influence on the hobbits because they have a pure heart, the One Ring had less influence because the hobbits are ALIENS.By seeing Awakening of the Trailblazers you are putting at risk the whole sentiment you have for the story of Gundam 00.Art and Sounds: Amazing, as the series. Saw the series? Same thing.Characters: Nothing changes. I had high hopes, thinking, well, maybe Awakening of the Trailblazers (ATB) will follow Gundam Wing Endless Waltz\'s example and develop/fix the characters. One of my major complaints about the main series is the lack of character development - thus, I thought they would give more character development in the OVA. But no, they stay the same. There are some highlights, one I can`t say, the other is some things about Setsuna. But, that\'s it, nothing more. Their development is in complete stasis. Once again I wonder why the writers chose to forget about character development for this series - it\'s absent.Mechas: The mechas design is solid. Raphael Gundam is an enhanced Nadhalee (thumbs up), 00 Quan is there, looking badass, Harute is not much different than Arios, and the Cherudim upgrade is the best of them all. Not much to say, except that I loved the mecha designs.Overall: ATB is not a good conclusion to the show. In fact, the Gundam 00 Universe would be better without it. Maybe you can enjoy the action and the mechas, but that\'s it. The rest, just don`t hold up and the conclusion is terrible. you`ve watched the show.

All of the upgraded suits get their chances to flex their new weaponry and maneuverability. Getting to see the powerscaling that happened between Season 2 and the time this movie takes place is also something, considering everyone has access to Trans Am now. The usage of CG for the aliens is actually rather natural. I still stand by the fact that this is one of the most beautiful anime movies I've watched.Sound is really nothing that stands out, I loved the OST in the 00 series and also all the intro/ending songs from them, but nothing here really blows my mind. The voice actors in both the dub and sub do a solid performance especially the VA's for Setsuna and Graham as they take a lot of the spotlight in this film.There are a lot of interesting setpieces in this movie that are action movie cliches, examples including Allelujah and Marie being chased by aliens and doing acrobatics for example as well as the entire final act. But the plot itself is all over the place. These aliens are invading Earth, but there is absolutely no reason why. Not only that but the entire theme was to understand what the aliens themselves are thinking, but that is not given to the viewer in any sort of direct way in TrailBlazer. In fact the philosophy of this film is really lacking when compared to the brilliance of 00 season 1 and some of the slightly less brilliant but still thought provoking questions in 00 season 2.Character arcs are all over the place, Setsuna is the only one who's evolving in a way that makes sense following the series. Allelujah, Marie and Lyle all stay relatively the same, but at least Graham dropped the entire Mr. Bushido nonsense which is honestly one of the dumbest fuckest things ever which would have made this movie even worse. Tieria is absolutely useless here which is unfortunate because before Setsuna became OP as fuck, Tieria was easily the best Celestial Being meister and he had my favorite Mobile Suit. Now Tieria is like Navi from the legend of Zelda in which he just sits on Setsuna's shoulder spouting exposition (I know his physical body was destroyed in season 2 and he's been integrated into Veda, that's no excuse for him not to have bodies he can upload his being into). Louis and Saji are in this movie and don't really do much at all, considering the Qan-[T] no longer really needs the 00 Raiser, Saji is truly useless again and Louis' arc has been over despite the fact that it could have been expanded more since she's an innovator.Oh yeah, there are some minor shipping things like Nena Trinity and Billy Katagiri, this makes no sense, but after Sumeragi bitchslapped Katagiri despite him letting her live in his house for 2 years. What even happened during that relationship? Of course Patrick and Kati are a thing, that was inevitable. But a lot of the Hetero couples they seem to be pushing just because they're hetero. Tieria x the curly haired Celestial Being associate despite the fact they have no chemistry really. Both Setsuna x Feldt and Setsuna x Marina have no soul to them, because I just can't see Setsuna as a romantic or compassionate person despite all the changes he's gone through. All of the old ships that have sailed are still great, Allelujah x Soma, Louis x Saji despite having no point in this movie. But enough about shipping, the plot overall is just not that great, aliens are there, why? Fuck you T-1000 that's why.Overall while I did have immense amounts of fun watching all the explosions in this movie, some of the most fun in my life, there are many aspects of this film that are terribly written and ruin the 00 franchise as a whole, opening up a can of worms that can't really be sealed again.For those reasons, Mobile Suit Gundam 00: Awakening of the Trailblazer gets a 6/10 from me. real defining features.

I still don\'t know how I feel about it, because the relevance for the 00 series is huge and basically it brings it to a closing, still, I felt certain things went too slow and certain things went too quickly. I wanted more character interaction and development and maybe a little less war in space. Of course Gundam is about giant robots and all that shooting, however, I felt they lost too much screen time giving us tech details (ship doors opening and closing, arriving, leaving...) and the final fight...got a bit tiring in my perception, I would rather have more character interaction and a bit less shooting, but still I\'m really happy about the movie. The story gives us since the beginning this message it\'s going to be deep and that it will have a major impact in the series, not being just another filler like movie but a very decisive one. The art was amazing from beginning to end, the animation is very well done, the frames and the CGI is very well inserted into the conventional animation, something that sounds really hard to do considering other animes that couldn\'t use CGI so well. The light, the movement, the angles, the colors, everything seems to be in place, I loved it, a work of art.The sound is beautiful during all the movie, the songs, the effects, however, I found some sound effects a bit annoying and tiring, I know the intention was to show the emergence of the enemy\'s attack, but because the fighting scenes were quite long, they got me a bit tired, still, the voice acting is excellent and the songs during the movie (specially during the final act) brought me so many emotions, it was beautiful.The characters, I felt like they were enough, however, I missed more character development. Gundam 00 is an anime that succeeded at working many primary, secondary and tertiary characters at the same time thought the episodes, so it\'s normal fans get really interested in their particular stories, some personal questions remain, like ""how did Alleluja met Celestial Being? How did he live until then?"", ""How was the Lockon brothers\' life since their childhood? What did they work with? What did they study?"", ""How did Tieria came to be? What memories does he have?"", as a fan I would have loved if a movie or OVA worked those characters a bit more, maybe something more slice of life.I had a very good time watching this movie, I wasn\'t bored for a second.In general, the movie is really good, it\'s among my favorite movies of all time for sure. The message we see at the ending is so beautiful, all the art and the music make the experience so deep and emotional. The way the final act closed is a mix of so many emotions, the solution for the final arc got me teary because of how genuine it was, of how simple the world can be, of how still there\'s hope for people to see through fear and bad emotions to find peace and understanding. I liked how all the moments were linked to the episodes and to what the anime promises us since the start, for sure it was a big surprise for who decided to watch Gundam 00 thinking it would be only about giant robots fighting, because it\'s definitely about soooo much more.

It was also used to promote Nijigasaki's sequel trilogy of films. The ending scene hints something that might shake things up for our Nijigasaki idols and Love Live! in general. sweet, and something every long-time Love Live! fan can appreciate. It was also used to promote Nijigasaki's sequel trilogy of films. The ending scene hints something that might shake things up for our Nijigasaki idols and Love Live! in general."", 'Huh, so this got dropped on Crunchyroll out of the blue, not that I mind since I love the Love Live Nijigasaki anime, flaws and all, so I\'d been looking forward to this. Nijigasaki fans are eating good, since not only do we have a sequel OVA, Love Live Nijigasaki School Idol Club Next Sky, we\'re getting a trilogy of sequel films that\'ll take place immediately after the OVA. Can\'t wait to see what those\'ll be like. The OVA takes place immediately after the end of the second season, with the Nijigasaki girls welcoming Ayumu back home from her overseas trip to London...and are surprised...to find that she brought a friend with her, Isla, who wants to become a school idol herself. On the side, Shioriko worries that she\'s too rigid to be a school idol and isn\'t sure what to do about it. Yeah, the OVA is true to the series\' ethos of not having a lot of stake and preferring a more laid-back, ""cute girls doing cute things"" approach rather than the over-the-top melodrama of previous seasons. Speaking of previous seasons, Next Sky flat-out makes open references to both the original Love Live anime and Love Live Sunshine, so there\'s some Easter eggs for you Love Live fans out there.Before I get into the review, there is one thing about this OVA\'s marketing that baffles me: For some reason this was aired in theaters, even though it\'s the same length as your usual TV anime episode, only 22 minutes. I know Japan\'s movie theaters are allowed to show more than just movies, but I really can\'t see why this OVA warranted a theater screening when you can easily either air it on TV or put it on home video. But I know nothing about how Japanese movie theaters work, so I\'m not gonna harp on it too much. Next Sky\'s animation retains the same level of quality as both TV series, CGI dancing sequences included, and I didn\'t notice anything that looked off. I do think the ending theme\'s visuals were cute, having cute drawings of the Nijigasaki girls in polaroid photographs of live-action locations (Very likely to be Odaiba). I will say that I am rather surprised that Next Sky\'s songs lean heavily into hip-hop and techno to an extent. Eh, I found the songs to just be okay.To be honest, I do think the story is where Next Sky suffers. While I did like the idea of the focus being on Ayumu\'s new friend Isla, the end result came off as rather shallow. Her whole conflict feels really mealymouthed and cheesy, mainly in that it just gets easily resolved with the power of friendship, even though it flat-out acknowledges that England\'s school clubs are nothing like those of Japan and that England has a different view of school idols. Next Sky really should have delved deeper into that and actually explored how other countries view the concept of school idols and showed how starting up a school idol club would be hard in any country that\'s not Japan. Then again, you don\'t really go into Love Live expecting down-to-earth, realistic conflict, you\'re here to see cute girls sing about following your dreams.That being said, I think Next Sky\'s B-plot is much better in that it focuses on Shioriko and fleshes her out just a bit more. She had some time in the series, sure, but Next Sky explores Shioriko contemplating her place in the Nijigasaki idol club and wondering how she can better connect with her fans. Plus, she gets some degree of development where her solution to Isla\'s problem, cheesy and admittedly stupid as it is, goes against her previously established principles...though how 13 girls in the same club were able to all get permission to leave school early without teachers or the principal being suspicious of their motives, I couldn\'t tell you. Furthermore, with the advent of the movie trilogy due to come out in the next few years, we might get to see some follow-up on Shioriko\'s development and see whether she can actually commit to her changes. Oh, and for the person on MAL who wondered why Isla has a darker skin tone than all the Nijigasaki girls: Did you grow up under a rock? There are plenty of British people with naturally dark skin of all different shades. Not every anime has to adhere to the same generic anime character design. Do your research.In the end, Next Sky tries, but it doesn\'t really add anything new to Nijigasaki\'s narrative and doesn\'t rise beyond average. to find that she brought a friend with her, Isla, who wants to become a school idol herself. On the side, Shioriko worries that she\'s too rigid to be a school idol and isn\'t sure what to do about it. Yeah, the OVA is true to the series\' ethos of not having a lot of stake and preferring a more laid-back, ""cute girls doing cute things"" approach rather than the over-the-top melodrama of previous seasons. Speaking of previous seasons, Next Sky flat-out makes open references to both the original Love Live anime and Love Live Sunshine, so there\'s some Easter eggs for you Love Live fans out there.Before I get into the review, there is one thing about this OVA\'s marketing that baffles me: For some reason this was aired in theaters, even though it\'s the same length as your usual TV anime episode, only 22 minutes. I know Japan\'s movie theaters are allowed to show more than just movies, but I really can\'t see why this OVA warranted a theater screening when you can easily either air it on TV or put it on home video. But I know nothing about how Japanese movie theaters work, so I\'m not gonna harp on it too much. Next Sky\'s animation retains the same level of quality as both TV series, CGI dancing sequences included, and I didn\'t notice anything that looked off. I do think the ending theme\'s visuals were cute, having cute drawings of the Nijigasaki girls in polaroid photographs of live-action locations (Very likely to be Odaiba). I will say that I am rather surprised that Next Sky\'s songs lean heavily into hip-hop and techno to an extent.

Watch with low expectations of a story, it\'s just an extra episode with an insert song.Nijigasaki is my favorite of all Love Live! franchises because of the music, character designs and the first season deviating from the ""oh no, we have to save the school by singing, again"" storyline.With that said, and following the current trend of content that the Love Live! franchise is spitting out, there is little positive to say about this OVA. It is just a small bite of nothing.STORY: 2/10I couldn\'t care less about Isla. The story was outright......nothing. There was no story, it was just ""this cartoonish foreign character is here, and now she is gone"". After Emma, Lanzhu and Mia being quite good representation of what an actual foreigner is in Japan, this one girl dropping into the OVA and stealing the spotlight only to speak perfect japanese with a funny accent was insulting. They do nothing and then it\'s over. There were a couple of scenes showing how the girls react to being recognized, that was a highlight. Shioriko showed more of her character which was also refreshing to see, but it was too short for much to happen/for any characters to actually evolved.ART: 8/10Nothing out of the ordinary. The animation was up to par, but it wasn\'t particularly good either. It was nice on the eyes.SOUND/MUSIC: 6/10The songs were... ok (the best one being the one on the ending for some reason). This was so disappointing to me. Only one song was animated and show, but it sounded a lot more like Liella than Niji. The futuristic and simple vibe of the song just didn\'t match them. It lacked charm.ENJOYMENT: 4/10This is probably my own fault for being excited about anything Niji. After the lackluster second season (which I still enjoyed because of the subunit songs) followed by an overflow of cheap stories with high budget (Yohane in the Mirror and Liella, looking at you), I wasn\'t expecting any more Niji content so I was pleasantly surprised when I heard of the OVA, and expected to see our girls venture in a fun and short adventure with a little drama. It just didn\'t live up to the expectations set for Nijigasaki, but if I look at it thinking of all the recent Love Live! content, it fits. Love Live! has overstayed its\' welcome at this point, and they only get away with it because of the fans that consume anything and everything as long as it has ""Love Live!"" written in it. It\'s pretty pathetic, the state of the fandom. There is no room for any sort of criticism, everything is ""amazing"" and ""perfect"" because Love live... If the consumer had a more discnering taste maybe we would get better stories. Think about that before you rate everything 10/10 and sink every bit of constructive criticism.

Not that most OVAs are particularly long to begin with, but this made sense after Love Live! announced not one but three movies to continue the story of Nijigasaki for 2024.In the first half OVA we see Isla (Aira?), an idol fan from the UK, visit Japan and she\'s given the full tour by the Nijigasaki girls. We\'re also given a handful of easter eggs referencing the other installments to the franchise. The second half is focused on Shioriko, giving her...some good development and a change of hairstyle to signify her maturing as an idol. SIFAS players were wondering where she was during season 1, so I have a theory that may be the reason why they chose her to be the star this time around. It had some funny moments like Shioriko speaking in English which was very unexpected. One thing I didn\'t like was that due to the cast being so big, most of the characters are just standing around for the majority of the episode. This was somewhat to be expected, but it certainly felt like the third years in particular didn\'t get to do anything.For the finale we have a music video for a new insert song ""Go Our Way"" which was beautifully animated, as Love Live! continues to go above and beyond in their animation quality for each new release. The intro song was too short, but at the very least it makes up for season 2\'s lack of R3BIRTH songs due to time constraints. I personally found the songs during the end credits to be forgettable, until I end up listening to them on my own time or rewatching. Go Our Way on the other hand is stuck in my head and I can\'t stop replaying it. For some reason I was expecting more than 1 MV, but its understandable given the short duration.Overall, a 7/10. Nice and enjoyable to all Love Live fans, but to newcomers or binge watchers you can easily skip it without missing anything. With the closure of SIFAS in about 3 days from this review, I\'ve picked up a bias towards the Nijigasaki characters, so I\'m happy to watch them again and see how far they\'ve come since being pitched as a small ""side project."" some good development and a change of hairstyle to signify her maturing as an idol.

Some aspects like the pacing and the character writing are as bad as ever, but the story is relatively enjoyable, the conflict isn\'t melodramatic, the animation looks fantastic (good job Sunrise), and we actually got some good character development with Shio-ti (that\'s Shioriko for all those unware).If there was one thing I was disappointed in, it was the music. It\'s decent production quality but I definitely did not enjoy the first song\'s tune. The other songs are okay. Go Our Way isn\'t really my cup of tea but the visuals are phenomenal.

I gave up counting how many people die after fifteen on screen deaths complete with blood in the first few minutes alone.Not that I dislike violence (I mean just look at my watch list.)More that its a pretty big departure from the usual Lupin tone.Also Goemon still doesn\'t get to stab anyone, a dude puking out all his blood and collapsing in a massive pool of his own gore is okay but a sword?

They are not all closely-related to each other, and the order they're watched in at least mostly doesn't really matter.That said, it's still very much Ranking of Kings.

Just not what you expect from this time...I mean clearly, the main parent story that aired and lasted for a consecutive 2-cour between Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 to really rush the manga (because of its chapters which are filled with short panels), it was, and still is to this day, in my opinion, a triumph to Wit Studio and the staff under then-debut director Yousuke Hatta\'s dedication, in terms of capturing mangaka Sousuka Toka\'s childlike storytelling that has everyone captivated and cheering on the underdog of one of the most underappreciated,...to a master juggernaut of a show back in its day. And now, there is a new Ousama Ranking anime, and you should rejoice...right? However, it\'s just not in the same wavelength as you would expect, but I reassure you, it\'s the same Ousama Ranking that you like and/or love from the main series.The new anime, dubbed Ousama Ranking: Yuuki no Takarabako a.k.a Ranking of Kings: The Treasure Chest of Courage, it\'s not Season 2, but the adaptation of the culmination of the manga\'s side stories. Basically what that means that this show is a direct canon to the main series and provides kind of a ""behind-the-scenes"" look on how and why do the characters in this show think and do the way they did in the main series. In a TL;DR sense, it allures and showcases the same expectations from the main series that does not feel like its presence has shrunk ever since the year\'s gap between the parent story and this ""spin-off filler"" series. And it is to my eyes, a great addition that\'s akin to a cake\'s in-between icing that adds more flavour and substance to an otherwise great show to begin with. As an example, for one, getting to understand what\'s on the characters\' minds and psyche of the things they do at the moment of the main story\'s worldbuilding and development, it just simply oozes fascination, more than just questions and answers to an already subtle plot.That said, Wit Studio under director Yousuke Hatta comes back to wield the side story anime, and it\'s still pretty much Ousama Ranking under the shell, with all of the fascinating artwork and choices of animation that impresses the same way, just like its main cousin. And while Aimer\'s ED is just plain beautiful to listen to, PEOPLE 1\'s OP is just fine, not on the levels of Season 1\'s OP maestros of King Gnu and Vaundy, but decently good.If you like Ousama Ranking to begin with, I don\'t see why this show isn\'t as good as the main series already is. It\'s additional fuel for entertainment, and this IS good entertainment while we wait for the eventual Season 2 (if there will be any once the manga has caught up to the anime and progressed further).Good stuff all around. to a master juggernaut of a show back in its day.

In a TL;DR sense, it allures and showcases the same expectations from the main series that does not feel like its presence has shrunk ever since the year\'s gap between the parent story and this ""spin-off filler"" series. And it is to my eyes, a great addition that\'s akin to a cake\'s in-between icing that adds more flavour and substance to an otherwise great show to begin with. As an example, for one, getting to understand what\'s on the characters\' minds and psyche of the things they do at the moment of the main story\'s worldbuilding and development, it just simply oozes fascination, more than just questions and answers to an already subtle plot.That said, Wit Studio under director Yousuke Hatta comes back to wield the side story anime, and it\'s still pretty much Ousama Ranking under the shell, with all of the fascinating artwork and choices of animation that impresses the same way, just like its main cousin. And while Aimer\'s ED is just plain beautiful to listen to, PEOPLE 1\'s OP is just fine, not on the levels of Season 1\'s OP maestros of King Gnu and Vaundy, but decently good.If you like Ousama Ranking to begin with, I don\'t see why this show isn\'t as good as the main series already is. It\'s additional fuel for entertainment, and this IS good entertainment while we wait for the eventual Season 2 (if there will be any once the manga has caught up to the anime and progressed further).Good stuff all around.', ""Ooofie, I think that's a very effective way to describe how this 10 episode collection of Ousama Ranking related side stories comes off as; While it can be really enjoyable to spend some more time with the characters outside the drama and plot of the parent series, it really had me wondering… “Why”?Why did this need to happen?, were people so starved for Ousama Ranking content that 10 episodes of random shenanigans that happened off-screen was really worth our time? The answer is no. A BIG no.This is NOT season 2 of Ousama Ranking, so don't get discouraged from watching the main show over...this spin-off's rating or reviews.So it's a 10 episode journey through different moments of the show, mostly on what happened alongside those moments. Which range from showing us how Ouken, a mayor villain of the show's first season, came to be, to episodes where the entire show's continuity and established world are disregarded to tell cute and wholesome stories. The problem is; these stories do NOTHING, they don't change how decisions the characters make come off, don't give any more information about a character's motivations or background, and it doesn't have anything to say about the world. It occasionally does one of these, yes, but it's rare and won't be likely to really affect the main show in the long run.Couldn't we have gotten a look at the broader Ousama ranking world? Other kingdoms or characters who won't get as fleshed out in the manga series or the anime? New original stories? When it doesn't work, it feels like a wasted opportunity to really get into many interesting topics of the series, instead, it's just reestablishing things we've already seen. And when it works, it's not telling anything too new, just expanding on old ideas again.The Characters? None get arcs because there is no overarching plot. This also makes all of them less appealing.The Animation? Not as clean as the main show's because they evidently have less budget and fights hint at conflict, which this spin-off avoids at all costs.The Music? Uninteresting.If you're a certified Ousama Ranking enjoyer like me, check out the show with freedom to skip any story you don't care about, you'll miss nothing on almost every story told here. You'll like this show more than the average person if the flowers and spice and the everything nice is enjoyable to you.If you just like ousama ranking or lower, then skip this, it won't be worthwhile. this spin-off's rating or reviews.So it's a 10 episode journey through different moments of the show, mostly on what happened alongside those moments.

Complicated and unexpected which makes me amazed! This season they are showing lot of background side character and sacrifices... There is a lot of moral story in this anime!Art (10)The art is very good with a fantasy theme. The color and the style that they are using are minimalist and have a similar technique to Naruto/Attack On Titan/One Punch Man/else when the battle began! In this season, they also use a different art style is several episode like Miranjo backstory.Sound (10)The music for OP and ED is great but...I really love the sound on the ending episode which is really touching when Bojjji found Kage!Character (10)Each character was really memorable even though it was really hard to memorize at first. As the story goes along, the character is easy to memorize since they have unique personality.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this anime in 2023!Overall (10)Recommended to those who love fantasy anime with a moral story and watch it with your family!

Ranking of Kings itself is one of my favorite anime of all time; but it was noticeable from the first episode that this was not the same. It jumps from side character to side character, and plotline to plotline, rarely ever giving the viewer anything relevant to what made the first season special. There were a few genuinely great episodes thrown in here that continued the plot or supplied important context, but there was a large amount of pointless filler, as well. I almost dropped this at one point.A better idea than making this a full pseudo-season would have been...to make a special or two where they included the good ideas that they clearly had, and eliminated half-baked and fillery ones. It would have made it look a lot less like they were just trying to throw anything out there to tide us over until the true season two. to make a special or two where they included the good ideas that they clearly had, and eliminated half-baked and fillery ones.

It was a very decent watch from start from finish. Yuuki no Takarabako focused more on the side stories and what happens in between the season 1 of Ousama Ranking. I think it manages to flesh out the characters more with how they have limited screen time back in season 1. One might think this is filler, but for me it certainly doesn\'t feel like one.The animation while not quite the spectacle as season 1 is still fairly...good. A bit of spoiler, I like that they use a unique animation for episode 9, very picture book-ish. Maybe some people see it as a major turn-off but it feels like a breath of fresh air to me than the usual anime style. The characters again is the main highlight of the series, each one has their own goals, personality and identity. I love every character in this anime because each of them felt unique and alive. This one stood out for me because I love anime that focuses on characters.My slight problem with this anime is the world building. It\'s still vague but we get to see bits and pieces of the Demon clan, but that\'s just it. There are a few plot point that maybe the season 2 will explain, because there are still a lot to unravel about the world of Ousama Ranking.Overall it\'s a must watch if you enjoy watching Ousama Ranking, it certainly stood out in terms of pure fantasy than your average isekai ""fantasy"" that\'s been milked to dry these days.

I wasn’t too excited for this anthology season, but I just said why not.The first 4 episodes were boring as these small stories didn’t add much of anything. It’s only  episode 5 afterwards that I found enjoyment in this season. The background story of Ouken and the brothers was actually very interesting and grim. The stories became more relevant and added more motivation to the characters. They still didn’t help the ending of the original show tho.Overall, there’s some enjoyable stories that helped the...original show. 6.5-7/10 original show. 6.5-7/10', 'It’s difficult to rate this one because the episodes are all so variable. Aside from the very last, every episode is broken into fragments covering often entirely different characters at distinct points in time. On occasion, this really works, with episodes 1, 4, and 10 being particular highlights, and portions of the others working pretty well. It also gives the animators room to do some pretty extra stuff, including making part of two episodes in a much more storybook style that kind of works despite the lesser fluidity of the animation.But that’s just it: this show works in part, but not so well as a...whole. Some of these parts would have been great inserted directly into the show, some would have dragged won the pacing, some are just repeats of things that happened in the series and some are expansions on concepts from the series… though some expansions are a lot less necessary than others.There’s a lot of interesting here with some really good ideas lumped in with a lot of meh. And that’s disappointing because these characters are still excellent, the animation quality remains high, and this is still the same great story I fell in love with before, but I have to evaluate it based on what they gave me this time around and… it’s kind of a mess.

So I get the feeling that people feel a bit cheated in terms of what ""The Treasure Chest of Courage"" (or TCoC) brought. Clearly not ""Season 2"" but you can never be sure these days. ""Filler"" is such a dreaded word and not really a useful or even meaningful discussion point; well, quite frankly I\'m just tired of using it as a critical...narrative talking point. Because TCoC is more of an anthology, a backstory, a creator or larger contexts, a new secret adventure, and a warm embrace. And yes... some *actual* canon events (see episode 10). Which is ultimately why I still love TCoC.Each new episode is its own thing. It lives up to its original series\' tone, is a wellspring of incredible artistic talent, does right by its characters, and expands on what we already love. It just may not continue the main questline, but it gives me hope and fills me with patience for it to continue someday. Who knows what reasons for attempting this collection of stories happened? Studio Wit has always been an opportunity for young artists and experimental visual storytelling. Perhaps this was the perfect opportunity to add certain scenes that didn\'t fit into the pacing of the original anime. Maybe they are waiting for other major projects to clear up until they could get back all the original artists/directors back for a full season. It almost doesn\'t matter because what TCoC offers, while not hotly desired, is still incredibly unique and a very interesting case study on dividing main-plot elements from side-plot elements that perhaps begs to be looked into for other studios.But it\'s not all even; thems the breaks when it comes to anthologies as anyone who watched Star Wars Visions could tell you. So I\'d like to talk about each episode/episode story and give my thoughts. And which ones are the most ""required reading"" for those only interested in the main story... you stick in the mud!Episode 1Kage\'s Errand - This one is very cute. It\'s Kage focused which is an extra plus for me. The forest is a really nice setting but I really like the twist of this one. The idea of the ""Wild Goose Chase"" bit into the reveal that it all ended up being a carefully constructed way to test Kage\'s kindness. It hides the twist until the very end very well.The Price and The Money - No it\'s Boji\'s turn to be tested. I love how you can really see the interplay between Boji and Kage here coming up with the scheme and figuring out how to make things right in the end. It\'s a very simple ""lesson learned"" and everything works out no one needed to feel bad after all moment but it\'s nice to be reminded of this stage of Boji and Kage\'s moral growth. The Underworld town is also a very cool location and a great pitstop in the story to organically add an extra opportunity to learn.Episode 2Beasts of the Wilderness - Speaking of great pitstops to organically add new side adventures, this may not be one of them. Time is of the essence as Boji and the Underworld army rush back home to battle Miranjo\'s forces. It could have probably taken an extra day, though we never see them travel any time other than daytime making it seem like the trip was a few hours. But the main problem is the story I think. Boji and Kage are markedly more naive than previously seen and the twist is funny but hardly resolves anything and renders the side adventure less worth the endeavor of telling it.A Mysterious Desert - This was the episode that made the casual lax nature of the characters seem the most bizarre in light of where the story needs them to be. This episode is maybe the weirdest. It almost feels like we tripped into a Space Dandy episode. Well, it\'s very pretty at least.Episode 3Hiling\'s Old Friend - Remember Hilling\'s knight friend Ann? She never gets any explanation and sort of just shows up with her later. Well, I love her along with Hilling and this episode is great for introducing their history for the first time. The little quest the two of them and Dorshe go on is super fun and feels like a natural extension of the story we never got to see in the original show.Daida and Magic - Precious! Getting to see more of the Prince brothers while they were young is the cherry on top of this episode. Short and sweet and you get to learn more about Daida\'s connection to his mother\'s magic and his brother\'s courage, which makes it heartbreaking knowing their temporary falling out upon growing up.Episode 4Immortality and the Three Brothers - One of the more ""important"" episodes. We already know some of this story from the original series, but if you want a detailed and more thorough backstory that catalogs the evil acts of Satin and the relationship of the former brothers more, then watch this episode. Especially considering where episode 10 ends, you may feel emotionally left out without getting more of this now!Episode 5The Law of the Underworld - A direct continuation of the previous episode follows an Underworld guard Fren. I like how this shows the relationships between guards and even the ""bar trio"" show up here again. It also expands on Ouken\'s cure mission. It feels far more like new material too.A White Horse in Love - It\'s just more of the ""Despa\'s White Horse is fat"" joke. Breaking up the episode this way after a lot of interesting stuff with a joke that\'s partially repeated content? Well, it\'s still funny. I like the jokes here still but it\'s not a stretch to call this ""padding"".The Gentle Soldier, Hokuro - We don\'t get too much Hokura. I like this character a fair bit. His inclusion in the story is small but he adds heart where it\'s needed. This is a small wholesome flashback story. It\'s simple and doesn\'t overstay it\'s welcome.Episode 6Bojji the King - We move to the end of Season 1 where Boji gets to be King (for only a bit) but this story helps show Boji\'s growth and his relationship with the townsfolk. I could have seen this in the actual show but it works better as a bonus here (pacing-wise). I could have seen this story placed closer to episode 10 to help build anticipation for TCoC\'s finale.The Melancholy of King Daida - I was excited to get more from the ""reformed"" Miranjo since her ending didn\'t sit with me as great as the rest of the way the story wrapped up. There still seems like there\'s more to be done regarding Daida\'s relationship with her and the complexity of her ""forgiveness arc"". This is still more of a Daida story in the end. It\'s still a great one showing *his* growth, but well... maybe next time.Episode 7The Snake Charmer with the Crooked Smile - Big Four backstory <3 ! We get to learn more about the first time Bebin and Despa met. Also, we see more of Despa\'s ability in understanding weaknesses. Nothing here that couldn\'t have been assumed but fills in more of Bebin\'s past nonetheless.The Big Four\'s Banquet - The Big Four have to kiss and make up. This story is great. I love the plan to appeal to the four\'s competitive nature to get them to work together. Seeing them all get humbled is as fun as the excitement from the arm-wrestling match. The way the team actually manages to get back in each other\'s good graces actually goes against Hokuro\'s expectations (since his plan fails at the end), but honestly, if his plan didn\'t fail I don\'t see where the path of them working together would have gone. It\'s a little finicky but they stick the landing.Episode 8Kage\'s Yearning - Kage and his mother\'s flashback story. It\'s sweat! We deepen our understanding of their time together as a family and we also see the first person that ever encouraged Kage before even Boji. I want to see that dude in the future!A Great Mother - One of two stories that utilize an incredibly smooth cutout paper ""puppet"" animation style. Not sure how to describe it. This one\'s about King Bosse meeting his first wife. We know some of this story already but it\'s worth a watch for the change in visual style alone.Episode 9Miranjo and the Demon - The other story in said unique art style comes right here. Seeing more innocent Miranjo gets us back to really wanting her redemption arc to reach full completion. Just another pleasant showing from the artists all around.The Prince and His Treasures - All these really nice/cute/sweet stories got lumped all together and I felt myself appreciating more moments with Boji right before the season 1 finale but could really start to feel the magic wearing off. Why the King Boji stories or the Unique Artstyle stories weren\'t matched with the same episode is kind of strange too.Episode 10Aaaaand we\'re back, where the plot purists get fed the good stuff. I\'ll admit I was very happy after the hiatus from tjhe more serious tone but we\'re fully onboard and kind of immediately addressing Ouken stuff. This is a great setup episode and proves that they\'re planning on making a Season 2 and it really leaves characters off in an interesting place. There\'s still so much going on in this world, it\'s getting more and more complex and kind of scary? (these Gods man...) Okay, maybe a bit of an anticlimax; usually characters are never too in danger/suffer consequences. But I\'m sure we\'ll have opportunities to address that later as we keep building things up. It was still badass.Not sure if this format for a review was the most helpful. it feels weird to give each story/episode a number grade but episodes 3, 4, half of 5, and 7 were my favorites. Maybe only episode 2 (or 8?) being the ones I felt the least excited for. Overall this ""season"" was an 8... maybe 8.5/10 but while maybe not an important addition it\'s an enjoyable addition to Ranking of Kings nonetheless. narrative talking point. Because TCoC is more of an anthology, a backstory, a creator or larger contexts, a new secret adventure, and a warm embrace. And yes... some *actual* canon events (see episode 10).

I like how this shows the relationships between guards and even the ""bar trio"" show up here again. It also expands on Ouken\'s cure mission. It feels far more like new material too.A White Horse in Love - It\'s just more of the ""Despa\'s White Horse is fat"" joke. Breaking up the episode this way after a lot of interesting stuff with a joke that\'s partially repeated content? Well, it\'s still funny. I like the jokes here still but it\'s not a stretch to call this ""padding"".The Gentle Soldier, Hokuro - We don\'t get too much Hokura. I like this character a fair bit. His inclusion in the story is small but he adds heart where it\'s needed. This is a small wholesome flashback story. It\'s simple and doesn\'t overstay it\'s welcome.Episode 6Bojji the King - We move to the end of Season 1 where Boji gets to be King (for only a bit) but this story helps show Boji\'s growth and his relationship with the townsfolk. I could have seen this in the actual show but it works better as a bonus here (pacing-wise). I could have seen this story placed closer to episode 10 to help build anticipation for TCoC\'s finale.The Melancholy of King Daida - I was excited to get more from the ""reformed"" Miranjo since her ending didn\'t sit with me as great as the rest of the way the story wrapped up. There still seems like there\'s more to be done regarding Daida\'s relationship with her and the complexity of her ""forgiveness arc"". This is still more of a Daida story in the end. It\'s still a great one showing *his* growth, but well... maybe next time.Episode 7The Snake Charmer with the Crooked Smile - Big Four backstory <3 ! We get to learn more about the first time Bebin and Despa met. Also, we see more of Despa\'s ability in understanding weaknesses. Nothing here that couldn\'t have been assumed but fills in more of Bebin\'s past nonetheless.The Big Four\'s Banquet - The Big Four have to kiss and make up. This story is great. I love the plan to appeal to the four\'s competitive nature to get them to work together. Seeing them all get humbled is as fun as the excitement from the arm-wrestling match. The way the team actually manages to get back in each other\'s good graces actually goes against Hokuro\'s expectations (since his plan fails at the end), but honestly, if his plan didn\'t fail I don\'t see where the path of them working together would have gone. It\'s a little finicky but they stick the landing.Episode 8Kage\'s Yearning - Kage and his mother\'s flashback story. It\'s sweat! We deepen our understanding of their time together as a family and we also see the first person that ever encouraged Kage before even Boji. I want to see that dude in the future!A Great Mother - One of two stories that utilize an incredibly smooth cutout paper ""puppet"" animation style. Not sure how to describe it. This one\'s about King Bosse meeting his first wife. We know some of this story already but it\'s worth a watch for the change in visual style alone.Episode 9Miranjo and the Demon - The other story in said unique art style comes right here. Seeing more innocent Miranjo gets us back to really wanting her redemption arc to reach full completion. Just another pleasant showing from the artists all around.The Prince and His Treasures - All these really nice/cute/sweet stories got lumped all together and I felt myself appreciating more moments with Boji right before the season 1 finale but could really start to feel the magic wearing off. Why the King Boji stories or the Unique Artstyle stories weren\'t matched with the same episode is kind of strange too.Episode 10Aaaaand we\'re back, where the plot purists get fed the good stuff. I\'ll admit I was very happy after the hiatus from tjhe more serious tone but we\'re fully onboard and kind of immediately addressing Ouken stuff. This is a great setup episode and proves that they\'re planning on making a Season 2 and it really leaves characters off in an interesting place. There\'s still so much going on in this world, it\'s getting more and more complex and kind of scary? (these Gods man...) Okay, maybe a bit of an anticlimax; usually characters are never too in danger/suffer consequences. But I\'m sure we\'ll have opportunities to address that later as we keep building things up. It was still badass.Not sure if this format for a review was the most helpful. it feels weird to give each story/episode a number grade but episodes 3, 4, half of 5, and 7 were my favorites. Maybe only episode 2 (or 8?) being the ones I felt the least excited for. Overall this ""season"" was an 8... maybe 8.5/10 but while maybe not an important addition it\'s an enjoyable addition to Ranking of Kings nonetheless.', ""I went into this already knowing that it is a side story and that it will probably not be too engaging. I got what I expected.The parent story, Ousama Ranking, was incredibly fresh, at least in the beginning. The quality of the art style, which I loved so much when it was at its most vibrant (as in episode 1), was surprisingly dull at times, and generally not consistent. The story suffered a bit from pacing issues, and despite considering Bojji the Best Boy of the year (and Kage as a great sidekick), it still bothered me that he could somehow understand what people say...by reading their lips; the premise was not entirely genuine. However, the fantastical elements of the story kept me going, the world of Ousama Ranking is still largely unexplored.The side story attempts to explore and explain some mysteries, but it falls flat very soon. The first episode has two short stories that feels like they come out of a children's book, with morals and all that. They are stories that use very familiar tropes, only difference is that they're taking place within the world of Ousama Ranking. The aesthetically sweet art style saves face, and I would not be mad if the side story kept it in that direction - downgrading to a children's show that could be enjoyed by grownups too - because it was doing it right. By episode 2, however, the art quality noticeably dips down, and I would say it resembles the art we saw during the middle episodes of the parent story. OK now we have a children's show that grownups are not really enjoying.Parts of the world is investigated: Bandits, weird creatures, magical plants in forests, etc. These instances are more random than awesome. A treasure chest may be the focal point of this side story, but I don't think I care too much.Other themes concern the past of some characters, like queen Hiling in episode 3, and one of the key villains in episode 4. In the episode about Hiling, we learn more about her healing magic and see a rare Daida-Bojji brotherhood action. Also important is the Dorshe-Hiling dynamic and more Anne time, remember her? She is amazing and so is Hiling but unfortunately the execution of such a potentially good episode leaves a lot to be desired. There is significant time dedicated into Daida trying to practice the healing magic and I can do without that. Episode 4 attempts a boring backstory on an interesting character, I find it unnecessary. These stories about the past need much better writing, they are handled poorly.I stopped watching because it felt like a chore. There may lay one or two interesting side quests ahead, or some random cool fight, but I don't have it in me to continue through episodes and episodes of repetitive content.I'm not very good with the science of scores, I'm not sure if this is a 4 or a 5. I know if I continue, I will only get harsher with the score. I went as deep as 4 episodes out 10 so I will also score it the same way. by reading their lips; the premise was not entirely genuine.

Though not perfect specially at the first stories. This compliments greatly the stories of most characters. Specially more to the last stories. This may not do much by itself, but if you fell in love with the characters and story of Ousama Ranking this is a must watch. very beautiful.I especially enjoy Ouken's story. Bojji's farewell gifts. Daida's story was heartwarming too. the big four's story was fun.There are some stories that change up the art style, and while it is strange...at the beginning. they are still great, since it gives the story more of a fairy tale feel. at the beginning. they are still great, since it gives the story more of a fairy tale feel.""]"
Peace Maker Kurogane,https://myanimelist.net/anime/161/Peace_Maker_Kurogane,"[""Peace Maker Kurogane is a historical action series based around the Shinsengumi; the Japanese police force active in the Edo period, perhaps now popularised in the West by the success of Gintama. Like many of its anime counterparts, the series is only loosely based on actual events, with much of the material taking an episodic, comedic route.We follow Tetsunosuke, a young boy set on joining the Shinsengumi in an attempt to seek revenge on the man who killed his parents two years earlier. As far as revenge plots go; it's fairly typical, standard fare. As events heat up, however, the story begins to fall in...line with history, with much of the action and drama centered around the Ikedaya incident. This affair was a clash between the Shinsengumi and a band of politically agitated ronin, which occurred in July, 1864. The story presents a splendid blend of historical and original material, with some events united more seamlessly than others. In-between the dotted story episodes are a variety of episodic ventures, which contain many of the series' most comedic moments, or at least aspire to. There's a little toilet humour and a couple of cheap punchlines, but for the most part, the comedic beats hit home. The story comes across as an entirely comprehensive piece, despite lapses in development, and while the premise comes across as cliche and overdone, the payoff is a satisfying and compelling watch.The animation and art style complement each other well and the cinematography, while not overly complex, doesn't miss the mark. The action sequences are well choreographed, exquisitely animated and a wholly enjoyable experience. Gonzo do a fine job - watching Peace Maker, it dawned on me how much of a shame it was the studio now have such little presence.The music is, for the most part, fairly forgettable. It doesn't come across as out of place or wrong - in fact it suits the setting well, with a variety of different tracks to emphasize certain moods or actions - but it never really pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished.With its roots in the historical Shinsengumi, the characters in Peace Maker -- for the most part -- are based on real people, albeit heavily edited in appearance and personality. Due to the inclusion of many comedic elements, the characters exert what I imagine are incredibly different characteristics to their historical counterparts. Nevertheless, the characters come across as an interesting bunch and are fun to watch. The character development isn't the most notable aspect of the series, however, and the characters lack a certain well-roundedness and portray only a select few attributes; the villain especially is rather one-dimensional. Appropriately, the leading character Tetsunosuke grows the most, and his journey at least has a sense of progress. Despite shortcomings, though, the cast are a rich, varied and exciting element that add a certain flair to the series.Overall, Peace Maker is a thoroughly enjoyable watch. A fine blend of action and comedy not so unlike its could-be cousin, Gintama. Certain changes prevent it from being an entirely historically accurate show, but the original material is well written and well presented. Though perhaps not as memorable as it could have been, with a harmonious blend of comedy and action, it's a series entirely worth watching. line with history, with much of the action and drama centered around the Ikedaya incident.

I was voting in a hot anime guys poll and I didn't recognize one of the candidates, so I looked him up (it was Susumu).  And stumbled here.  I read the synopsis, glanced at the rating, read the review... and thought, &quot;Eh, why not give it a chance?&quot;  I think you should be thinking the same thing. ;)Right now, I think my opinion is a little colored by how surprised I was by this anime.  As I chain-watched episodes of this show, I kept on thinking things like: &quot;Wow, I am actually really enjoying this&quot;; &quot;Why didn't...I hear about this before?&quot;; and &quot;This is really good&quot; in this surprised tone.  I mean... I had never heard a peep about it before and I was just checking out a character picture to see decide if the guy was hot or not.  But it ended up being really good.  Funny, huh?Story: I'd categorize it as a historical drama that uses action as backdrop, meaning that the plot and the characters are firmly in the forefront.  There's definitely action (and it's exciting and occasionally graphic) but it isn't the central focus; it just helps fill in the finer details... it isn't action just for the sake of having action, you know what I mean?When I first started watching and I saw Tetsu trying to join the Shinsengumi, I thought it was going to be like History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi -- a lot of training, a few fights, some comedy beats... and what I got instead was a compelling drama about identity and coping with your demons, along the lines of Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen (but younger, louder and generally more light-hearted).  Set in the same time period as Rurouni, the era itself already is soaked in questions of identity and tradition vs. progress.  It was surprisingly mature and well developed in both the depth of the characters and the breadth of the issues they tackled: the burdens of violence, the cost of peace, what shape do the scars of our pasts really take?  And though I was personally rooting for one side, I don't think either side was actually labeled good or evil.  I appreciated that the show seemed to be acknowledging that there isn't always a right or wrong -- sometimes there's just a conflict.  There's also a nice serving of funny moments and conversations scattered throughout the storyline that are well used by the author.  They either let you get to know the characters better or help make them more cute and loveable.  Sometimes they break the tension so you can finally exhale.  And most importantly, there was a weight to the story, which I attribute to good craftsmanship, that sucked me in.  Things that mattered to them mattered to me too and I really wanted things to work out and go their way and... I just felt really invested in their story and I don't think that happens without really good storytelling.The only nitpicky thing I could complain about, story-wise, might be the way that some of the storylines resolved.  But I don't really want to go into detail because it might give things away... so, I'll leave it at that.Character: A lot of the generic sort of stereotypes when it comes to a group of soldiers/police/etc. are represented here as well.  Those familiar cliches rear their ugly heads again.  I didn't mind, to be honest, because I did really like two pairs of characters particularly and those characters were executed well enough to keep me occupied.  The first and most important is definitely the brothers, Tetsu and Tatsu.  Their relationship was so interesting to me because it was different from anything I had seen before and yet so completely plausible for their circumstances.  (I never know how much detail to go into or not go into and what constitutes a spoiler -- sorry!)  Sure, it was exaggerated sometimes, for humor, for emphasis, whatever, but the heart of it rang true and when you realize what the root of the relationship actually is, it's, like, &quot;Whoa.  That really makes sense.&quot; ;) The second and much more ancillary relationship doesn't actually exist in the show, it's more of a similarity of character (that the show actually points out as well) between Hijikata and Yoshida as leaders of opposing factions in this turbulent and vicious time period.  I thought it added something nice to the balance and the honesty of the story and the absense of &quot;right.&quot;Animation: Generally, I liked it.  I wouldn't say it was outstanding.  Or even above average.  But it good.  And it suited the story and the characters, I think.  It's actually a pretty decent collection of good looking guys... too bad about the mullets.  ...Did they actually wear mullets or was this just some very peculiar style choice by the mangaka?  Some the action sequences were well done, I thought.  No where near the caliber of the action in Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen, but as good as or better than the usual anime fare, I think.Enjoyment:  It's an odd thing because I feel like I was more interested and invested in the show than I can adequately explain.  Maybe it's just me and my taste and this anime just happened to hit the right buttons.  I don't know.  But after I finished one episode, I immediately wanted to see what was going to happen next.  And then I wanted to watch the one after that.  And I didn't want to watch anything else.  So even though I might not have done a great job explaining myself, I would probably suggest that you watch the first episode and see how it strikes you.  If you like it, keep on watching -- I don't think it will disappoint you.  If you hate it, well... at least you know, right?  If you're ambivalent, watch another... and maybe another after that, until you make up your mind. ;)P.S.  The only thing about the voice acting I have to say is that it was fine minus two guys who were doing their impressions of Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter.  I kept on checking to see if it was the same guy on MAL (it isn't) and it was driving me nuts just because they weren't as good at it as Hisoka's actor, Hiroki Takahashi.

In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen&quot;, the side of the Ishin Patriots is presented, but in Peace Maker, it's the side of the Shogun clans. Everything happens in a small periode of time from the encounter wiht the Shinsengumi to the end.Art: Well, if you don't like blood, violence, injuries, or ... you won't like it so much, but it's well done.

I have to wonder because On the surface this looks like a regular shonen samurai anime, like Kenshin, but as you watch more episodes and see more of the characters you notice one underlying theme....a lot of the characters are either ambiguously or overtly gay. I have no issues with BL anime and things of that nature...but then again, I don't think like a teenage boy. So be warned this show may not look like it but there is a whole lotta homo-eroticism going on in this story. If you are able to move past that particular...issue then you have the second hurdle of credibility to deal with; a boy who's 15 but looks [and acts] like 8 wants to play big, bad samurai and joins the Shinsengumi in order to avenge his parents' murder. Did I forget to mention this is a comedy?~ArtOH the art and animation is fantastic! Let's not even pretend like Gonzo never does a good job with animation! If animation and fight scenes are your cup of tea then this show delivers. Just the opening scene of this series alone will tell you just how masterful the animation work from the Gonzo studio really is. Very smooth movements from the characters, detailed fight scenes and excellent use of CGI for clean, panoramic-style angle switching and 360 3-D rotation. But what I love about anime from this era is the attention given the costumes. I love all that fabric for the robes/kimonos and the various colors, patterns and styles and how they are draped over the body....especially geishas, their costumes and jewelry are the best. But I also love the look of the long-haired samurai.~SoundThe music of this series is of the typical shonen variety. Not really singing as it is a bunch of guys shouting and cheering and chanting “Yeah!” or “Come ON” “Let's GO!” or “Kick it!” and other such chants they think are American. This is done to the back-drop electric guitars and rock music to further appeal to the young [American] male....though with all the gayness in the series, I don't think it will be such a hit with that particular demographic. Since I don't really fit into that category, I mostly find this type of music annoying....however I did catch myself chanting along and bopping my head to the beat sometimes so I guess the music for this particular show was alright. I watched this show in English and I must say I really liked it in English [Texas drawl and all] I found it to be charming but I think it's definitely something you would have to get accustomed to. So it's a safe bet that those anime fans that dislike dubs will surely hate this one with all the Southern accents.~StoryHonestly this a show is only mildly successful with it's conflicting layers and it's experimental attempt at mixing-up genres. Peacemaker tries to bridge too many gaps and the juxtapositioning of a number of opposing styles and costumes all becomes a bit too taxing to the viewer. Mixing tragedy with humor and slapstick, having a little boy run around with samurai, standard patriarchal violence mixed with veiled homo-eroticism and then you have the distinctly Asian aesthetic [anime] mixed with the philosophy [and distinct audio] of the West...making them both SAMURAI and COWBOY at the same time. It's all a little bit genius and a little bit insanity, which can easily overwhelm someone watching this series...if not turn them off completely. Still, all complications aside, this show is very funny in parts that will make you LOL with sad in parts that will tug at your heart and truly terrifying moments. Also the narration flows pretty smoothly and is quick-paced. If the stuff I mentioned doesn't turn you off from watching this series then you won't get bored, you might find it as entertaining as I did.~CharactersAs I said earlier there is a slight hint of homo between the characters in this series if you really look that them closely and their interactions. Some of it is overt while others...not so much. From what I understand about the samurai era....there was a lot of that type of relationship going on between the warriors and I think the creators definitely flirted with this idea, a little bit.Tatsu definitely has some sort of weird brother-complex for his younger sibling Tetsu, this is most assuredly watered down with humor...however the underlying context has been set for those who choose to explore that particular dynamic.Then we have the cross-dressing ninja spy, Susumu, who dresses like his sister Ayumu who is also a spy....that acquires information by flirting sleeping with the the opposing forces [read between the lines and connect the dots].And then there is Soujiro, who's beauty and sexuality is even more ambivalent than that of Susumu's! Soujiro, who never confesses he's gay...has a doppleganger assassin who is fully out of the closet.Hijikata and Soujiro...their relationship just screams SEME/UKE [GAY!] i.e. Hijikata vouching for Soujiro's whereabouts “He was in my room till late in the night” hhhhhmmmmmmm 'kay...The same Hijikata to whom a beautiful female's charms had no effect and led to her demise...need I say more! There ARE hetero-guys and females in this series and they are the majority...however this is considered normal and therefore non-remarkable or fascinating.~Worth It?Even though I may have criticized this show on the harsher side, I actually did like this show and admired it's attempt at cross-platform appeal. I think the main requirements for being able to enjoy a show like this would have to be the ability to suspend logic and have an open mind. issue then you have the second hurdle of credibility to deal with; a boy who's 15 but looks [and acts] like 8 wants to play big, bad samurai and joins the Shinsengumi in order to avenge his parents' murder. Did I forget to mention this is a comedy?~ArtOH the art and animation is fantastic! Let's not even pretend like Gonzo never does a good job with animation! If animation and fight scenes are your cup of tea then this show delivers. Just the opening scene of this series alone will tell you just how masterful the animation work from the Gonzo studio really is. Very smooth movements from the characters, detailed fight scenes and excellent use of CGI for clean, panoramic-style angle switching and 360 3-D rotation. But what I love about anime from this era is the attention given the costumes. I love all that fabric for the robes/kimonos and the various colors, patterns and styles and how they are draped over the body....especially geishas, their costumes and jewelry are the best. But I also love the look of the long-haired samurai.~SoundThe music of this series is of the typical shonen variety. Not really singing as it is a bunch of guys shouting and cheering and chanting “Yeah!” or “Come ON” “Let's GO!” or “Kick it!” and other such chants they think are American. This is done to the back-drop electric guitars and rock music to further appeal to the young [American] male....though with all the gayness in the series, I don't think it will be such a hit with that particular demographic. Since I don't really fit into that category, I mostly find this type of music annoying....however I did catch myself chanting along and bopping my head to the beat sometimes so I guess the music for this particular show was alright. I watched this show in English and I must say I really liked it in English [Texas drawl and all] I found it to be charming but I think it's definitely something you would have to get accustomed to. So it's a safe bet that those anime fans that dislike dubs will surely hate this one with all the Southern accents.~StoryHonestly this a show is only mildly successful with it's conflicting layers and it's experimental attempt at mixing-up genres. Peacemaker tries to bridge too many gaps and the juxtapositioning of a number of opposing styles and costumes all becomes a bit too taxing to the viewer. Mixing tragedy with humor and slapstick, having a little boy run around with samurai, standard patriarchal violence mixed with veiled homo-eroticism and then you have the distinctly Asian aesthetic [anime] mixed with the philosophy [and distinct audio] of the West...making them both SAMURAI and COWBOY at the same time. It's all a little bit genius and a little bit insanity, which can easily overwhelm someone watching this series...if not turn them off completely. Still, all complications aside, this show is very funny in parts that will make you LOL with sad in parts that will tug at your heart and truly terrifying moments.

Even though the anime is maybe about 5-7 years old, It\'s still great to watch!The anime reminds me of Naruto / Nabari of it\'s cheeky-ness with it\'s Main Character. This Anime has everything you\'d want, (in general). Like, well in my opinion, how i really like\'d this anime was from how the main character acts. Very likeable, very very likeable, for instance - He acts his age! And he\'s a bit shorter than he usual, which makes me believe that he\'s 12 and not 15, which makes it the whole more enjoyable. Remember how kids now-a-days act like...they\'re invincible? Heck, 12/15yrs old isnt much of a ways back for me. . . Anyways onwards to the Rating!-Story :I\'d like to give the story maybe, about an 8.I give it an 8 because IT IS VERY GOOD! It starts off introducing you to the main plot, and it goes from there! I\'ll give the basic over-view of the anime, It\'s about a 15 year old boy. He had a difficult past, and he has an Older Brother who is very very over protective (brings into comedy), and how they are with eachother when 2-3 episodes in happen, is very enjoyable to watch.The other bit of the story is about the clan that he\'s joining, He tries very hard to get in because that\'s apart of his goal to get stronger! - Now people know where i\'m getting at, I\'ll leave it at that!-Art :Yeah, the art is a bit edgy, probably because this anime was made in the what, 2007 area? It\'s not dull, but it\'s not like the graphics that we have now, It\'s perfectly made though, Throughout the episodes, Through the funny ones, Through the Sad ones, It\'s never had one mistake! It totally made sense and i enjoyed every bit of it And i still am thinking about it, just remembering the beauty of the anime.So i give the Art a 7, it is good, but it\'s not what we have today, But it is, good, if there was a good / very good inbetween, I\'d give it a[ 7.5 ] !-Sound :OK, So the sound, yes the music fits perfectly, BATTLE MUSIC! YEAH!, but it\'s not like the music you\'d hear in naruto, It\'s a bit. . . more serious, not as hypey, but still good.

Now, moving onto the supporting/other main characters, Yes!Protagonists, very likeable, they have their own roles like what you\'d expect in any anime, BUT! The way how Matsuda Akio (not sure if he\'s the one who made it lol) articulated each character to be, How every character has their own way of acting . . Like there\'s some Jokers who are so funny!, There\'s a guy who cares alot, There\'s a guy who Cares (secretly!) AND He\'s a really...funny..dark guy too.

Not at all as long as the previous and took an approach to telling the tale of the Shinsengumi. Not  many shows seem to do this as most are focused solely on other tales during the period of which this takes place.PMK takes us on a journey with a fifteen year old boy who has an axe to grind. Tetsunosuke Ichimura lost his mother and father as a young child, and now wishes to join the Shinsengumi in order to avenge them. His elder brother Tatsunosuke joined as the bookkeeper...and has no intentions of allowing his brother to fight. However Tetsu is lively and headstrong which finally causes him to force his way as Hijikata's page boyOne of the main things I like about this anime were the characters. A lot of the cast was very distinct and different with no cookie-cutter aspects. I highly enjoyed how the two brothers played off each other be it they were totally different. Even the dangerous Toshizo Hijikata had his hilarious moments as did even the calm Yamanami. The best part is these people are based off real people which makes watching it almost a treat!Animation wise everything was done nicely as to be expected of Gonzo Digimation. We saw what they did with Chrono Crusade after all so we know they can deliver. The detail put into such things like their clothing and their surroundings was very well done. As far as dubs or subs go? I can go either way but I know the english voice cast to a degree and therefore am a bit more loyal to it.The only reason I gave the story a 9 is because I felt they could have done a bit more with other characters. I guess we'll never see a season 2 right? and has no intentions of allowing his brother to fight.

I guess we'll never see a season 2 right?"", 'Before I start don\'t get me wrong, this was a good anime. Unfortunately, I think most people think it is a great anime and I want to point out the reasons why it isn\'t.Quick background, Tetsunosuke joines the Shinsengumi to avenge his dead parents.  This starts as your typical serious revenge story. So far so good, he is eventually let in after an emotional scene. Then there is a mix between extremely lighthearted moments and absurdly dark moments.This is my first complaint.  It does have some excellent moments (the scene with Susumu and Tetsunosuke on the roof is one of the better...tragic anime scenes I\'ve seen) but the blend between silly and insanely dark is just distracting. I feel like the anime lacks direction.This leads to my second complaint: a ton of things happen that I don\'t understand. There is black magic type stuff, there are scenes where I can\'t tell if they are imagination or they actually happen, there are things that happen which don\'t seem to flow logically to the next scene. All of these serve to confuse me about what is real and what is a metaphor or something.This of course leads to my next complaint: why were there so many dropped plot points. I think the anime had lots fo awesome moments but there were a lot of things brought up that weren\'t completed. I\'ll give it slack because there was definitely a play for a second season that never happened but I still thought tons of things that came up weren\'t explained and I was left wondering what they were all about (some were major and truly left me frustrated).My final gripe is that I don\'t know where thr story goes next. Most anime that have a ""proper"" ending at least give you the impression of the next steps. I guess this one just didn\'t really feel the need because I had no idea what would be next in store.All of this aside, if you can forgive these story points the anime is good. The characters are all done well, there is a TON of emotional moments and enough silly moments to break up the tension. For those of you who don\'t mind an anime lacking a clear direction you may greatly enjoy this!Story 6 / Art 7 / Sound 6 / Character 8 / Enjoyment 7 / Overall 7 tragic anime scenes I\'ve seen) but the blend between silly and insanely dark is just distracting.

A very good anime based in the japanese history as the most of the ""samurai-genre"" animes, nice art tho it is not a new anime, it is a production of 2003 so i expected worse animation. The scenario was good tho it was this usual scenario of a kid wanting to avenge his parents, the good part here is that the kid is not obsessed with revenge but most likely obsessed with being stronger and overcoming his weak points. Nicely put the characters from the japanese history, the demon Hijikata- the leader Kondo and Okita were splendidly attached together in this animeGood sound......Great characters and very unique i\'d say, also with some characters being soft-hearted or weak this anime shows us that the Shinsengumi were not just some murderers ronin.the episodes in the end were awesome, if this anime was from the start like this i thing it would be one of the best but that would go against of this anime\'s principles (Peacemaker) so if anyone starts this anime thinking that he/she will watch a lot of fights and splatter from the start he/she is deadly mistaken, there is more comedy than fights in those 15 episodes from the begining but it was good and enjoyable.

I hate the voice acting though. I don't think it's something that a lot of people would hate, but I did. The Japanese voices weren't that great, and the English ones were worse. But that's not the point. lolI bought all of the DVDs for a really cheap price, and then watched them in one day. Despite the poor ratings I gave it, it's actually really fun to watch. And it's addictive to watch when you first see it. At first, I thought it was amazing. Until a few weeks after I had watched it all.It just seems like...there should have been more episodes. To me, it seems like to tried to squish an anime that should have been like 50 episodes into 24 episodes. or 26. I can't even remember how many there were. lol The story seemed like they weren't focusing on something specific and the creators didn't try their best.Even though I'm giving it a bad review, I do recommend this anime. It's very fun to watch, and the characters are interesting.

Quanzhi Fashi V,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48941/Quanzhi_Fashi_V,"[""Quanzhi fashi, the chinese power fantasy anime I used to like.However season 5 of this anime had nothing that I liked about the series. No levelling up done by Mo Fan , No more highschool Drama/fights (similar to season 2) , No more underdog feeling. Instead they decided to adapt the most boring 'Bad boy snake dragon Arc' ( I forgot the actual name). The entirety of the plot from the end of episode 3 to 11 was surrounding by this and it was booring. Its kinda like season 2 but on steroids (in a negative way) . Atleast season 2 was essential for the...progression of the plot but here it meant nothing , NADA! Not even a level up by Mo Fan. First 3 episodes and the last episode were the only ones I really enjoyed. All others were chore to watch through. Mo Fan's arrogance level got bumped up , making me hate him. He never used to pick up fights with anyone for the sake of it but here he's all about showing off. The character development part of this particular anime series were always poor , but in this season there is NONE.The fact that the studio decided to adapt this arc was purely idiotic. Why adapt a filler arc which consists of 85% of the season which doesnt even progress the overall plot at all. It's not like they ran out of source material or anything,  In fact the anime is SOO FAR BEHIND the Light novel that it seemed like a stupid decision to even cover this arc at all.To anyone who's getting bored by this season, I recommend you to watch first three episodes and skip everything except the last episode.The OP & ED of this season were not great.The animation seemed to get better and better by each passing seaaon.OVERALL - 5/10 progression of the plot but here it meant nothing , NADA! Not even a level up by Mo Fan. First 3 episodes and the last episode were the only ones I really enjoyed. All others were chore to watch through.

For reference, the manga is currently at chapter 730+ and the light novel is way beyond that. In other words, the anime is incredibly far behind the source material and it would take decades for the show to catch up at this rate. I personally do not see Quanzhi Fashi being renewed for that long.In my opinion, watching the Quanzhi Fashi anime is like a chore, it is a watered down version of the manga (which itself is a watered down version of the light novel), but at least the manga has very well...done and colorful illustrations. The animation quality of this season seems okay compared to other seasons, but compared to shows of this time it is slightly worse and makes the show a little less enjoyable.(No Spoilers) But, I personally did not enjoy this arc as much as some of the last ones, in fact, I completely forgot most of happened in it. So while I will be watching this anime, I will much more enjoy the manga itself, and I recommend any anime watchers to read the manga from chapter 1.

For reference, the light novel is currently at 3200+ chapters. done and colorful illustrations. The animation quality of this season seems okay compared to other seasons, but compared to shows of this time it is slightly worse and makes the show a little less enjoyable.(No Spoilers) But, I personally did not enjoy this arc as much as some of the last ones, in fact, I completely forgot most of happened in it. So while I will be watching this anime, I will much more enjoy the manga itself, and I recommend any anime watchers to read the manga from chapter 1.

They have made Mo Fan pretty much superman. There is never any threat to him or the other main characters because you know they will live.

Pokemon Movie 10: Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2847/Pokemon_Movie_10__Dialga_vs_Palkia_vs_Darkrai,"[""This Pokemon Movie, I'd have to say was good for the most part.-Story-The story plot was FAIR. When I originally heard about the movie, I thought it would be much much much different. Since I've been a Pokemon Fan for most of my life, I was expecting the movies to have much more of a Climatical part. It did not have a true &quot;climax&quot; per se. It was an average movie with an average storyline.-Art-The art was nothing special. The best art I saw was at the very end. The art was just as if it was a regular old Pokemon episode.-Sound-Sound was my favorite...part. I loved the theme song in both English and Japanese, and I loved how the ending theme stayed the same. I also loved the song Aracion.-Character-Of course, Ash, Brock, and Dawn make an appearance, being the main Characters. I didn't see anything outstanding in the adding of the movie characters. Just like the episodes, there was nothing that made them stand out.-Enjoyment-When I watch a movie, I want to have somewhat the same thrill of when I watched it the very first time. I want it to be moving. When I watched this movie, I saw it all. I only re-watch it if my friends wants to see it again or if I was going to be in a Pokemon TCG tourney the next day.-Overall-Overall, it earns a fair 7. It was decent the first time through, but after that, it just gets boring and more boring. part. I loved the theme song in both English and Japanese, and I loved how the ending theme stayed the same.

The film also surprises due to its clear cut structure and by the books approach to various small details. Something Pokemon films were ignoring and more often than not, struggling with, ever since the fourth film.Two guys will compete for a girl and it will be shown, not told. The resolution will be clear as the loser stumbles in the background. No exposition needed. Don't get me wrong, by no means is this a masterpiece. What it is, is a highly polished work following all the standard...conventions with enough expertise to be a good cartoon.I wouldn't call any single component of the film bad, but where it does stumble, or at the very least, doesn't shine as the rest, are the characters. The main show cast don't get much attention. Plot expiosition is what they've been used for before and that's what they're used for here. By no means are their lines cringeworthy. By no means are they especially interesting, either. This becomes a hinderance which prevents the film from getting a higher rating, as their wacky shenanigans in the second act, while main plot is on hold, don't hold a candle to what comes before and after. They could've been given character developement or something meaningful to do so we connect to them. Slightly boring and overly silly slapstick dominates a dozen scenes. At least they're watchable.Alice and Tonio are worth a mention. Their simple, but fun relationship subtly embelishes a few moments. Darkrai stole a few scenes, as well. Expecting him to be an edgelord, this was quite a surprise to me.There's a thin line between an unoriginal ripoff and a well executed, traditional story. I've already praised the film for being the latter. One element of the plot stands out, though. Music. Pokemon flirted with this idea in the second film, but didn't have the courage to incorporate Melody's song into the plot. This is fortunate, since the song wasn't exceptional. I'm by no means an expert in music, but I found the song in here pretty good for what it is - an audience mover. While by no means something heavenly, it works well enough that you can accept it as having mythological significance in the film.Artwork for the film was pretty good. Use of CGI for the church, while justified, wasn't nearly as flawless as in some older Pokemon works. Still, CGI was utilized in multiple good action scenes. Action was pretty good in general here. Almost as relevant as in the last film's final action scene, Ash gets to do something again. Ash, Dawn & their pokemon are really fun to watch as they wrestle with time and space.There's nothing more to say. It's a highly polished action film with weaker characters than I'd like.

At that time over 400 Pokémons - and the Franchise seem to be still growing!This movie I just watched because I liked (and I still do so) the 4th Gen. very much! And that's why I came to watch it!...And I wasn't disappointed. The storyline has gotten an epic Flair which I really enjoyed. The battle between Palkia and Dialga and, finally, Darkrei as well, was something I didn't expect. That's why I consider the Story as quite fresh, a little bit dramatic and sad.The Sound was just phenomenal - especially the Oracion-theme! WOW! I was thrilled from the very beginning!!However, the characters..., well actually, it's just Ash with a bunch of other people trying to save the world/City... so, as you can imagine, it's pretty much the same as always ;) And I wasn't disappointed.

I especially liked when he called his own attacks :)And once again, the animation/direction was very well-done. In particular, the final climax scene was absolutely stunning.Overall, a great one.

Every scene involving Darkrai was great, partially because Darkrai has a cool design, but mostly because Darkrai was the most interesting character in the movie. Darkrai had a great backstory, and the production team did a great job of showing the audience that Darkrai was not the monster everyone else believed him to be.Other than Darkrai, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it. I think the biggest reason for this is that the main cast...of Ash, Brock, and Dawn barely contribute to pushing the plot forward. Dialga and Palkia are cosmic forces far beyond the main cast's control and are the main cause of the dramatic conflict. That is not a bad premise in itself, of forces beyond the characters' control has been done well in other Pokemon movies. But it was poorly executed in The Rise of Darkrai because the characters don't really learn the cause of the problem until late in the film, so everything they are doing until that point feels really aimless, which also just kills the film's pacing. And the movie even wasted Jesse, James, and Meowth, whose inclusion added nothing to the plot aside from a couple of small gags.I wanted to like The Rise of Darkrai more, but its flaws hold it back too much for me. of Ash, Brock, and Dawn barely contribute to pushing the plot forward.

Rakuen Tsuihou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou,"['Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise, is Gen Urobuctcher\'s (sorry, couldn\'t resist the bad jokes) new original animated film that explores the meaning of humanity and personal reality. The movie offers a few interesting twists and introduces some extremely intriguing ideas about sci-fi and humanity itself.This movie is about our cute female protagonist, Balzac Angela (voiced by Kugimiya Rie so end of review, 10/10 :P ) sent from Deva, a new world created based on data after a certain apocalypse in earth that turned the whole world into a never-ending desert (portrayed as the wild west), to stop a certain someone or something who was...recently hacking into the Deva system to convey a certain message that contradict\'s Deva\'s values. Angela, along with our male protagonist ""dandyman"" Zarik Kajiwara, sets on a mission that will redefine the many things that She was taught on the Deva.Story : 7/10 As explained earlier, the story tries to explore many different themes and tries to convey them in many different ways; however, the story is not extremely smooth and well told mainly because nothing in the movie was explored well enough.Character ： 7/10 Much like the story, simply underdeveloped. There was pretty much only 3 in the movie characters and none of them were extremely well developed, but being underdeveloped does not mean they are boring characters. All of these characters have a very lovable personality and these personalities are well portrayed through their actions. Regarding the 3DCG, I actually think it contributes to the storytelling extremely well mostly due to the story partially being the exploration of the difference between a digital reality and a traditional human being.Sound : 9/10 The Soundtracks are very well developed, playful, and fits the situation very well. The voice actor/actresses fit the roles extremely well and the ending song is also great.PS: don\'t skip the ending. Enjoy the song a little  and wait for a tiny cute and heartwarming treat at the end :)Art : 9/10 The whole film is made in “3D"" modeled animation. Like a refined version of (RWBY) It was well made so it was not too distracting most of the times. Some of the scenes had awesome cinematography and some other scenes are extremely well drawn. Also, the fighting scenes are extremely entertaining and contains some great CGIEnjoyment ：8/10 The way this story is told could get boring at times, but some of the really lovable characters and original ideas from the anime can really bring the audiences back. Again, great cinematography and mech fight scenes.Overall : 8/10 Only if the story and characters were more developed. Everything else could be better, but they were already quite nice. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone who is looking for something a bit different and doesn\'t hate the 3D animation.Final words： I really like this animated film a lot, and it has a 10/10 on my personal ratings because some parts of it really does deserve that score. Sadly, there are too many things in the anime that prevents me from doing so in a formal review. recently hacking into the Deva system to convey a certain message that contradict\'s Deva\'s values.

Sadly, there are too many things in the anime that prevents me from doing so in a formal review.', 'I thoroughly enjoyed Rakuen Tsuihou, as well as Gen Urobuchi\'s other works, namely Psycho-Pass, Madoka, and Gargantia.As an introductory aside, I want to start by strongly disagreeing with people who highlight Urobuchi\'s tendency to kill off character (""the Urobutcher"") or his aptitude for plot twists as his main appeal. They are not. What draws me -- and I believe many other viewers -- to Urobuchi\'s works is their philosophical undercurrents; everything in his films and shows touch upon some aspect of society, humanity, or morality, and the story is often a sidekick (although an exciting one). For example, Psycho-Pass is focused on the impact on...having a benevolent, all-knowing, but tyrannical autocracy on society; while Gargantia revolves around reflections of a soldier faced with peace and prosperity, and learning to throw away his inculcated beliefs.With that said, I think Rakuen Tsuihou\'s main appeal is along the same lines. There are no real plot twists in this movie, besides perhaps the identity of Frontier Settler itself (for the longest time I expected this nefarious hacker to be some evil genius or something). Everything generally works out the way you expect, and I think it\'s fair to say that most of us know, going in, that Angela won\'t stay with Deva for long.But this movie is not about some futuristic sci-fi world of people living in virtual reality; sure, that\'s the backdrop, but that\'s not what it\'s really about. It\'s main focus is on the dichotomy of Angela and Dingo, and the two societies they represent. This is a dichotomy that exists in today\'s world just as much as it does in the world of the movie. These two societies might not be spatially segregated as in the movie, but we still have it: the increasing disparity of the haves and have-nots.Every commentary on this issue in today\'s society talks about it as if it\'s a problem to be solved, as if there are only negatives. We live in the world where ambition and the drive to succeed are unconditionally praised, even when that drive leaves us with no time for relaxing or pleasure or trying to truly learn what we are meant to do. I see Rakuen Tsuihou as a commentary on this, and while Angela doesn\'t exactly do the best job of defending her ""high-society"" ambitions, I think the movie as a whole does a great job illustrating how this sort of all-consuming career ambition can leave us blind to the true pleasures of life. having a benevolent, all-knowing, but tyrannical autocracy on society; while Gargantia revolves around reflections of a soldier faced with peace and prosperity, and learning to throw away his inculcated beliefs.With that said, I think Rakuen Tsuihou\'s main appeal is along the same lines.

An absolute insult to any mecha fan or Urobutcher fan. It\'s hard to believe great talent, be it writing or VA or w/e, were all roped in for this mess. All at a high budget too.Lets begin with our main heroine, Balzac, whose name is hilarious, has no redeeming features beyond her stupid funny name. She is the embodiment of every cliched terrible tsundere character rolled in and condensed into one terrible package of fanservice. She is unlikeable, she makes poor and questionable decisions, and she barely contributes to the plot, of which there is very little of. She whines so...much in this I wished that somehow, in Butcher tradition, shed be silenced in one way or another (It didn\'t happen). She\'s nothing but a useless fanservice girl. Alongside Balzac is generic bounty hunter secondary protagonist guy, who\'ve you\'ve also seen a thousand times before. He\'s the epitome of genericness, he knows what\'s right, and serves as one of the competent members of the group who does stuff properly at least. And lastly is Claptrap, who\'s there to prove his existence to the world or something. Claptrap is easily one of the less horrible characters in this (alongside that dealer person I like somehow). Heck, that one exposition scene with him is one of the only ones I liked.Plot wise this whole farce is barebones to its core. In the beginning, with the help or closeups of Balzac\'s tits and arse, the film seems to hint at something more than just a typical Hur-Dur authority is evil Hur-Dur kind of movie. It isn\'t. It is as generic as generic can get. If anything the biggest plot twist in this is how obvious the plot twist is as that authoritarian totalitarian entity turns out to be , surprise, not as benevolent as previously thought! And for a mecha anime, there really isn\'t much in mecha action, hell, less than 30 minutes in and the mecha is sold for christ sakes.I used the term ""anime"" throughout very lightly. Most of the film\'s character models are terrible 3D cell-shaded models that greatly resemble MMD stuff. They greatly feel out of place amongst the (I must admit) very well done backgrounds, and amongst the 2D extras. Animation wise, the 3D character models also seem to operate at a different framerate from the rest of the backgrounds. I dunno a good way to describe it, but it feels out of place. If anything it feels like a video game at times. A pretty video game I give it that.The fight scenes, few as they are , are terribly done. While on paper they seem pretty decent, a high budget mecha on mecha action kinda thing, most of the action scenes are messily edited, with unnecessary closeups that detract from the main fight. Also every few minutes, the fight deviates to give us a closeup of Balzac\'s tits and arse and her screaming. The fights aren\'t particularly clever either, most of them are just your standard fare, no planning or strategy here, just brute force mostly.Overall, a better way of spending your time in a similar manner would be to load up MMD and mess around with it for an hour or so. Because hey, you\'d get more enjoyment out of that than this. (Speaking of MMD, all the female character models feel like they\'re lifted from vocaloid).2/10Fun fact : this film can\'t even be used to play butcher bingo properly. It only has like 4 out of 25 squares. much in this I wished that somehow, in Butcher tradition, shed be silenced in one way or another (It didn\'t happen).

It is as generic as generic can get. If anything the biggest plot twist in this is how obvious the plot twist is as that authoritarian totalitarian entity turns out to be , surprise, not as benevolent as previously thought! And for a mecha anime, there really isn\'t much in mecha action, hell, less than 30 minutes in and the mecha is sold for christ sakes.I used the term ""anime"" throughout very lightly. Most of the film\'s character models are terrible 3D cell-shaded models that greatly resemble MMD stuff. They greatly feel out of place amongst the (I must admit) very well done backgrounds, and amongst the 2D extras. Animation wise, the 3D character models also seem to operate at a different framerate from the rest of the backgrounds. I dunno a good way to describe it, but it feels out of place. If anything it feels like a video game at times. A pretty video game I give it that.The fight scenes, few as they are , are terribly done. While on paper they seem pretty decent, a high budget mecha on mecha action kinda thing, most of the action scenes are messily edited, with unnecessary closeups that detract from the main fight. Also every few minutes, the fight deviates to give us a closeup of Balzac\'s tits and arse and her screaming. The fights aren\'t particularly clever either, most of them are just your standard fare, no planning or strategy here, just brute force mostly.Overall, a better way of spending your time in a similar manner would be to load up MMD and mess around with it for an hour or so. Because hey, you\'d get more enjoyment out of that than this. (Speaking of MMD, all the female character models feel like they\'re lifted from vocaloid).2/10Fun fact : this film can\'t even be used to play butcher bingo properly. It only has like 4 out of 25 squares.', 'Gen Urobuchi is usually referred to as the ""Christopher Nolan of Anime"".This claim is, to be fair, a bit flawed, as one is a script writer and the other is a producer, but when these two are put under comparison, many can see some similarities.For the oneiromantic science fiction thriller ""Inception"", there is Psycho-Pass, a criminal-investigation science fiction thriller. For the infamous sequel of the Dark Knight Trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"", there is a prequel of a famous game with a similar taste of ending called Fate/Zero.And, before and after the release of the movie, Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise is compared to the infamous...sci-fi thriller that shook the world this November, Interstellar.Before I begin the review, I\'d like to mention that Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise, henceforth to be called Rakuen Tsuihou in this review, is one of the first attempts, and most likely the best attempt at creating a full 3D motion animation picture done in Japan animation exclusively.Also, *THIS REVIEW IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT ANY SPOILERS TO THE CONTENT*. Any information given beyond the explanation shown at myanimelist.net\'s description page is unintended.Then, without further adieu, let us start the review.Story: 7Putting aside the fame of the script writer or the amazing animation, the story itself is actually not a grandiose one. With the description of Rakuen Tsuihou at myanimelist.net at December 16th, 2014, the date this review was written, being ""Gen Urobuchi\'s original anime movie"", there is not much I can reveal, except the fact that there are two main characters, one female and one male, from different uprising and different beliefs.Gen Urobuchi has been gaining notoriety from the anime subculture fans known as otakus through his fluid style of writing, creative world settings, lack of fanservice and shocking plot twists. His works in Fate/Zero, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and its sequel movie Rebellion story and Psycho-Pass has been praised by many of the members of the community.However, for better for worse, this movie lacks any of his key styles of writing except fluid pace and creative world setting, which is understandable and even admirable, considering that the movie is only an hour and 43 minutes long. The pace was quite packed, as to not make the viewers\' attention fly away, but not too packed as to confuse the viewers. The setting of the world was quite well-made that it could have easily been remade into several more movies or a whole tv animation of 2 cour or more.Still, that is no excuse for receiving no praise from the story segment of this anime. There was, in exchange for moderate pacing, no plot twists that made people go on their feet, nor was there absence of fanservice that drew people more to the story than the characters.At best, this story deserves neither a praise nor a criticism. It was an enjoyable plot for a 100-minute-long movie, and for that I gave it a flat seven.The problem is that this was made by Gen Urobuchi.For a movie for which the only description is ""Gen Urobuchi\'s original anime movie"", it does not deliver Urobuchi\'s style. Because of this, there is bound to be a severe underrated reviews that should follow, and Urobuchi almost deserves reviews more critical than my own, which is why it is stated at the beginning of the story segment of this review that I will put aside the fame of the script writer of this anime. If one does not linger on the fact that this is a film made by Urobuchi, the anime should be a pleasant experience.And above all, there is another reason that this anime should be pleasurable.Art: 103D animation has been done in Japanese animation several times before, and some has been praised for its deliverance while others failed miserably and were criticized severely. However, there has been almost no case of a full-3D animation that has received a praise.Rakuen Tsuihou is undoubtedly the best attempt at full-3D animation in any reported case in Japanese animation.The animation was done by graphinica with no works in the past worthy of mention except maybe Hellsing Ultimate, which was not a personal animation project. Despite the lack of worthy mentions, however, graphinica delivered a spectacular performance of full-3D animation. Although this may not be as fluent yet as some of the earlier works done in Disney\'s Pixar motion films such as ""Frozen"", this anime\'s 3D-rendered model of a character is closer to the general form that is shown on Japanimation, or the so-called moe animation, than the characters in Disney animation films.The detail of the animation of superb. From the little detail of the facial expression to the movement of the hair and the edge of the characters, everything was very similar to the orthodox movement and animation of the general Japanimation.Then there is the battle scene, which was genuinely awesome. The movements of the robots or ""mecha"" as called in the anime community were not at all awkward unlike many of the other 3D animation of mecha shown.In a word, this is a ""revolution"" for 3D animation. This is most likely not a first attempt at animating everything on the screen with 3D modelling program, but it definitely is a splendid attempt at it. It is not an overstatement in saying that this anime deserves praise simply over animation.Sound: 7The OST was (not the ending theme), without hiding the truth, horrible.First of all, it did not do a good job of supporting the scene presented on the screen. Moreover, it was almost a pain to hear some of the battle themes in the anime. The repeated sounds and basic tone of the music was too basic that it felt like listening to an anime theme song of early 90\'s.For that, I give OST portion of the sound sphere a low 2.However, the other two portions almost forgave the OST\'s misses.First of all, the voice acting was splendid. Kugimiya Rie\'s performance deserved praise over praise as she voiced from teenager to grown woman to a child, with mood changes clearly shown in each tone of the voice. Miki Shinichiro\'s voice acting was just as splendid as he was able to clearly voice the feelings and tone of the character presented to the viewers. Kamiya Hiroshi\'s voicing of the robot was splendid as well.For this I give voice acting a perfect ten.And as for the ending theme song sung by ELISA, it was quite literally a musical in my ears. I felt myself melting over the beautiful melodies of the music. I could feel her music in my bones.And, for this, I give voice acting a 9, with average of 7 for the score of sound segment.Character: 9For a film with only 100-minutes, the characterizations and developments are actually pretty well done.For the clearly-fanservice-heavy character, Angela Balzac, there is a ""respect"" given for her. She is not our everyday tsundere big-boobed annoying teenager that gives headache to the male lead. Her actions and her growth are perceived actually rather well throughout the film. Her characterization and her back story, as well as her development were all present without taking up too much screen time, which I cannot complain for. The same is done for Zarik Kajiwara, who is not just an overpowered know-it-all main character that today\'s anime world adores and tends to follow upon, but a man with considerable reasons behind all his actions and with much characterization and development without, again, taking much too much screen time. Frontier Setter, as well, is quite a nice character that showed favorable character despite being on air for the least time among the three characters.An argument could be made that Frontier Setter\'s development and characterization are rather speedy and not full, and this film being a 100-minute-long should not be an excuse for that, but it actually is a valid excuse. If this were a tva with 1 cour or less it would not be an excuse, but when it\'s a film where people choose to go watch it or not, it is valid an excuse. To top it off, the argument that Frontier Setter\'s development is rather slim and too hasty is not false but an invalid argument. Frontier Setter is not a main character, but a side character that appears halfway through the film. There is not expected to be any kind of development for said characters. However, despite being a side character, Frontier Setter shows quite a lovely characterization and a considerable development, making it almost seem like a main character despite being a side character.For this, I give character 9/10.Enjoyment: 8To be honest, I was a little let down myself.I have expected to see more of urobutcher (pun intended) in this anime, especially being that the female lead had a voluptuous body (refer to Tomoe Mami from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Funahara Yuki from Psycho-Pass...) and the premise and the preview to the movie showing a lot of promises towards the stellar version of Psycho-Pass.That is not to say that this was not a pleasurable experience.The animation quite literally made me go on my feet, with art and facial expressions of the characters being beyond superb, and the ending theme song pleasing my ears. It was a pleasurable 100 minutes. I would have loved it more if there was a dark theme to this or some kind of plot twist, but I perhaps should not have had my hopes up, since I would end up underrating this show.For that, I gave 8/10 for enjoyment.Overall: 8Granted, it was a letdown for a work done by Urobuchi, but it is a film pleasing to watch. I highly recommend watching this film.Then, happy anime-ing. sci-fi thriller that shook the world this November, Interstellar.Before I begin the review, I\'d like to mention that Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise, henceforth to be called Rakuen Tsuihou in this review, is one of the first attempts, and most likely the best attempt at creating a full 3D motion animation picture done in Japan animation exclusively.Also, *THIS REVIEW IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT ANY SPOILERS TO THE CONTENT*.

I highly recommend watching this film.Then, happy anime-ing.', ""[Spoiler Warning]Gen Urobuchi is a writer I like, but even with that thrown out there he’s very repetitive in his writing. At times, he creates fascinating worlds, and characters, but then make them speak by info dumping, and reiterating the same topics as if viewers missed them the first time. They speak like plot devices instead of like people. So Gen Urobuchi opted to create a world that was formerly filled with humans, and now are just data. Here is story written in that kind of world. A world without consistency, nor intelligent life forms. Just a strings of badly written events.The opening sequence of...the film is confusing. We’re shown a beach, our main character in a swimsuit relaxing, someone hacks the beach, our protagonist throws her drink, and stops this hacking by being naked. Don’t worry, the event turns out to be pointless. I eventually found out by the end of the film that it lead up to nothing. Absolutely nothing. A conflictless story that forces in conflict in its final act just because. No logical reasons behind it besides the fact it wasted more than half of its duration on nothing related to the main story, and might as well try to end things with some action no matter how nonsensical it seems.Minutes after failing to stop the hack it is established that Deva, this spaceship where 98% of humans resides, has been hacked by this same hacker, Frontier Setter, 184 times. So Deva has push aside the notion of improving their security, but it took them approximately 184 times of being hacked to finally decide to send one of their own agent to Earth to capture the hacker. So we got an advance system/civilization run entirely by super advance computers whom all take the appearances of Gods contradicting the notion this is an advance, smart, intelligence system when it reacts this slow. At this point (seven minutes in), you begin to question if the system got hacked that many times by a single entity how come a large amount of people are still living in Deva?Not only that, but instead of assigning one of Deva best agents for the job Deva assigns 3rd class agent Angela Balzsac. There’s obviously much better agents that can accomplish the task. They (the computers Gods of Deva) established Deva already has an S ranking Deva agent on Earth. It would speed up the process by giving this assignment to Zarik Kajiwara, the S rank agent on Earth, who's familiar with Earth, and despite being told he has a bad reputation is clearly reliable due to the fact he is an S rank Deva agent. Why Deva uses numbers, and letters to determine an agent ranking is beyond me. Seriously, is the number 1 or 0 much higher in ranking than S rank agents?Our main character is named Angela Balzac, which is the most respectable thing about her. She’s a stupid character who for some inexplicable reason knows to hack which would require understanding of simple terms like Script Kiddies, Black Hats, and words like Daemon for simple function. Yet, this same character does not understand people don’t eat sand which is the first thing she does when landing on Earth. These two things don’t belong to the same character. Ballsack (as I am referring to her out of the lack respect I, and writer Gen Urobuchi do not share for her) is introduce in a beach scene in a bikini saying it’s because of work? Wouldn’t it make more sense to be in a place that can overlook CPU, servers, hotspots, you know any area that’ll actively help you better spot when there’s a hacker in the system. I would wouldn’t be questioning this if the film itself provided decent world building. With that absent, there’s no understanding on the status quo of this world at all.Ballsack goes from one scene to another completely inept in her abilities. Her human partner, Zarik Kajiwara, has to explain to her how using her mecha from Deva would expose her spot to Frontier Setter. Why Ballsack didn’t think of this is inconsistent with the claim she’s a 3rd class rank agent close to being promoted to a high ranking position. If that’s a high position in this world it further question her abilities to do this job, and Deva security too. She needed to be told by S rank agent Zarik Kajiwara to get rid of her mecha instead of Ballsack doing it on her own. After being told using this mecha would reveal her position to this intelligent hacker the next logical step would be for Ballsack to put on some different pieces of clothing to blend into Earth crowd, and not stick out. However, she wears a leotard, garter, elbow-length gloves, and knee boots for the entire film. Everyone else on Earth else wear normal pieces of clothing, but this doesn’t matter in the long run either since this does not catch the attention of Frontier Setter at any point.I’m meant to believe Frontier Setter singlehandedly hacked into this super advance ship called Deva, which apparently has high security, yet the fact Frontier Setter is unable to detect Ballsack who is looking for him in this city without changing her appearance goes against what's established. Frontier Setter has other robots he could control, and taking into account he hacked into Deva 184 times this is also inconsistent with said intelligent of the character. As far as characterization goes Frontier Setter received nothing substantial besides questioning if human traits can be found in machines. This often used plot point in sci-fi would have been fine if the film actually explored it.Another annoying trait of Ballsack character is her bragging how life is better on Deva, and how life on Earth pales in comparison. Ballsack mentions that old rock music wasn’t considered worth keeping by Deva. Meaning Deva intentionally didn’t keep information on simple stuff like sand does not taste good, but kept the information that made Ballsack be naked when stopping a hacker in cyberspace? The same information that does not tell her human body can get tired, and sick. If Deva was a such a great place to live at than it should have preserve as much information as possible not just be selective about it. Say, if somebody on Deva like rock muaic, and Deva didn’t have it that person is out of like. However, on Earth you can find rock music if you like. If not, simply ignore it not discard it like Deva does. As I mentioned earlier, due to poor world building Anglea claims of Deva being better than Earth don’t add much to the film when the bare minimal about the world is not established.Zarik Kajiwara is the most likable character, but even he has inconsistency in his character. He says himself in the movie he’s afraid of heights, yet there is a scene where he’s on top of an abandon building stringing his guitar. Unlike tsundere Ballsack, Kajiwara is competent at his job to the point he should have been the protagonist of the film. For starter, he blends into the crowd unlike Ballsack who sticks out. Another thing is he knows the area, can collect information on Frontier Setter location, all while being off Frontier Setter radar. This guy, is basically babysitting this deadweight agent named Ballsack to make sure she doesn’t kill herself. This allows me to sympathize with Kajiwara because not only does he have to do most of Ballsack job for her, but also make sure Ballsack doesn’t end up killing herself. Sadly, there’s not much to his character either besides he likes rock music, and living on Earth. This about as close as the film gets to producing anything resembling good quality.Our final character is Frontier Setter himself. The film sets him up as this intelligent hacker which does make you wonder why is he attacking Deva. Unfortunately the answer essentially amounts to “you want to go on this road trip bro?” for his motivation. It’s a letdown when this is reveal because the hour building up to this were spent on characters talking about nothing related to the plot. It was either debating where it’s better to live rendered into a pointless argument because of terrible world building, or being all philosophical with subjects on eating till you're full, liking a specific brand of rock music, and being sick like a human. Frontier Setter is falsely presented as the antagonist in this story, and when there’s no ill attention from it then there should have been something the characters learned from their journey. Ballsack does eventually learn the value of being human, and having a human body just because. There’s not a single good experience Ballsack had on her journey before finally finding Frontier Setter. She has her mecha destroyed, and sold for parts, was nearly raped, got sick while on Earth, became very tired, hungry, and talked to Zarik Kajiwara discussing the current affair of their job. Somehow all of this made Ballsack change over a new perception of human living.It’s explained later on in the film that human consciousness was transferred into data. How exactly that happened, when it happened, and how long it’s been going on for is up to anyone imagination. They (Deva) could have used “Bipolar Magnetic Reversal Theory” to accomplish that as far as anyone is concerned. These simple questions needed to understand the setting are never answered. After the opening credits, Angela Ballsack crashes on Earth, and fights giant Centipede like aliens with a giant robot. These bugs appear in this one, and only scene throughout the film. Are these bugs a common issue on Earth? Is there any other species on Earth that make people fearful to live on Earth? If so, then the idea of 98% of Earth population living in a computer would make sense. Except, there is no world building on Earth either!While seeing the film I assumed it was created by A1-Pictures because of various ass shots, but nope I was wrong. This film was brought to us by Toei Animation, and Nitroplus who really wanted to outdo them with ass shots. All the budget for the film clearly didn’t go into the animation. Whenever characters speak it’s only up, and down motion which looks unnatural. I’m guessing the budget likely went into developing bouncing boob technology for Ballsack character before abandoning the idea when realizing Toei, nor Nitroplus had the technology to make it happen. So they opted for ass shots just in case the audience forgets Ballsack has an ass. When the characters are still the models don’t look bad, but the low-framerate in motion makes everything look disjointed, and delayed. Possibly making you wonder if whatever device you’re watching it on is laggy. The only time the animation looks natural is when the framerate is bumped up in the action scenes. In these action scenes the motion is fast, and whatever moving looks somewhat natural. These moments don’t last long, nor are they very flashy in their presentation. Most of the film best moments of competent animation is in the climax, but given how pointless the climax is it undermines what happening on-screen, and ultimately would have been pointless if the writing wasn’t so awful. The only thing about the animation I wouldn’t complain about are the backgrounds are decent looking since they don’t move. That would be it as far praises go.Voice acting in both Japanese, and English languages are competent while virtually sharing the same traits. For starter, both Rie Kugimiya in Japanese, and Wendee Lee in the English voiced Angela Balzac are equally annoying. Wendee Lee is higher pitched in her portrayal which makes her more grating when listening to her brag about how better life is on Deva. She doesn’t change her tone regardless what her character is meant to feel in any scene either. Rie Kugimiya doesn’t fare any better in the leading role. Instead of being grating her portrayal ends up being bland. At least Wendee Lee portrayal made me feel something about the character. Sure it is mostly hatred, but it’s certainly better than Rie Kugimiya who leaves no impression when having played other tsunderes. Nothing about Rie Kugimiya performance stands out besides she sounds no different from a bland tsundere character.Zarik Kajiwara is played by Shinichiro Miki in Japanese, and Steve Blum in the English dub. On both audio tracks these two actors are easily the film best performances. Steve Blum especially operating on autopilot with his cool, laid back voice. Blum voice goes hand in hand with Zarik Kajiwara personality for an easy cool portrayal. Miki also does the same so not of a much difference in performances. Frontier Setter is voice by Hiroshi Kamiya in Japanese, and Johnny Yong Bosch in the English dub. None of them end up being better than the other voice actor. Johnny Yong Bosch is simply wasted in the role that demand nothing of him. The character has no complex emotions, or personality so it’s more disappointing seeing Johnny Yong Bosch in the role than it is a bad performance. He doesn’t sound robotic at all in the role. Whereas Hiroshi Kamiya does sound robotic in his portrayal. Fitting the role, but nothing demanding about portraying a robot who gained emotions.The script is different in both languages. I wouldn’t advise seeing the film in any language given how bad it is. Reading the subs draws more issues to its writing while the English dub has some bad audio mixture with dialogue, and sound effects. In English, some wording are changed to make the story appears less idiotic than it already is, but also end changing the meaning of the film in general. Hearing 98% of humans have “cyber personality” doesn’t seem like a big deal compare in Japanese where it says 98% of humans are “artificial intelligence”. Creating different problems for itself in the English dub. At best, it’s most tolerable to mute the film, and read subtitles. Not the even soundtrack composed by Narasaki is noticeable in the film. It’s heavy on electronics, techno, and rock, but all equally forgettable.Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise will leave you with many philosophical questions. The most important one being “What did I just watch?”. Don't let Gen Urobuchi, and Seiji Mizushima (director of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime) names trick you into seeing this film. If this is the standard Japan wants to set for every 3D animated film that come out of their country they’re in serious trouble. The general low-framerate in animation, lack of any thought into the writing, and nothing substantial to remember is inexcusable in an era where the likes of Pixar, and Dreamworks Animation have made better 3D animated movies. If the animation isn’t flashy enough to make it entertaining to watch than it should at least contain good writing to keep viewers engaged. When you got neither, this film here stands as an example of that. the film is confusing. We’re shown a beach, our main character in a swimsuit relaxing, someone hacks the beach, our protagonist throws her drink, and stops this hacking by being naked. Don’t worry, the event turns out to be pointless. I eventually found out by the end of the film that it lead up to nothing. Absolutely nothing. A conflictless story that forces in conflict in its final act just because. No logical reasons behind it besides the fact it wasted more than half of its duration on nothing related to the main story, and might as well try to end things with some action no matter how nonsensical it seems.Minutes after failing to stop the hack it is established that Deva, this spaceship where 98% of humans resides, has been hacked by this same hacker, Frontier Setter, 184 times. So Deva has push aside the notion of improving their security, but it took them approximately 184 times of being hacked to finally decide to send one of their own agent to Earth to capture the hacker. So we got an advance system/civilization run entirely by super advance computers whom all take the appearances of Gods contradicting the notion this is an advance, smart, intelligence system when it reacts this slow. At this point (seven minutes in), you begin to question if the system got hacked that many times by a single entity how come a large amount of people are still living in Deva?Not only that, but instead of assigning one of Deva best agents for the job Deva assigns 3rd class agent Angela Balzsac. There’s obviously much better agents that can accomplish the task. They (the computers Gods of Deva) established Deva already has an S ranking Deva agent on Earth. It would speed up the process by giving this assignment to Zarik Kajiwara, the S rank agent on Earth, who's familiar with Earth, and despite being told he has a bad reputation is clearly reliable due to the fact he is an S rank Deva agent. Why Deva uses numbers, and letters to determine an agent ranking is beyond me. Seriously, is the number 1 or 0 much higher in ranking than S rank agents?Our main character is named Angela Balzac, which is the most respectable thing about her. She’s a stupid character who for some inexplicable reason knows to hack which would require understanding of simple terms like Script Kiddies, Black Hats, and words like Daemon for simple function. Yet, this same character does not understand people don’t eat sand which is the first thing she does when landing on Earth. These two things don’t belong to the same character. Ballsack (as I am referring to her out of the lack respect I, and writer Gen Urobuchi do not share for her) is introduce in a beach scene in a bikini saying it’s because of work? Wouldn’t it make more sense to be in a place that can overlook CPU, servers, hotspots, you know any area that’ll actively help you better spot when there’s a hacker in the system. I would wouldn’t be questioning this if the film itself provided decent world building. With that absent, there’s no understanding on the status quo of this world at all.Ballsack goes from one scene to another completely inept in her abilities. Her human partner, Zarik Kajiwara, has to explain to her how using her mecha from Deva would expose her spot to Frontier Setter. Why Ballsack didn’t think of this is inconsistent with the claim she’s a 3rd class rank agent close to being promoted to a high ranking position. If that’s a high position in this world it further question her abilities to do this job, and Deva security too. She needed to be told by S rank agent Zarik Kajiwara to get rid of her mecha instead of Ballsack doing it on her own. After being told using this mecha would reveal her position to this intelligent hacker the next logical step would be for Ballsack to put on some different pieces of clothing to blend into Earth crowd, and not stick out. However, she wears a leotard, garter, elbow-length gloves, and knee boots for the entire film. Everyone else on Earth else wear normal pieces of clothing, but this doesn’t matter in the long run either since this does not catch the attention of Frontier Setter at any point.I’m meant to believe Frontier Setter singlehandedly hacked into this super advance ship called Deva, which apparently has high security, yet the fact Frontier Setter is unable to detect Ballsack who is looking for him in this city without changing her appearance goes against what's established. Frontier Setter has other robots he could control, and taking into account he hacked into Deva 184 times this is also inconsistent with said intelligent of the character. As far as characterization goes Frontier Setter received nothing substantial besides questioning if human traits can be found in machines. This often used plot point in sci-fi would have been fine if the film actually explored it.Another annoying trait of Ballsack character is her bragging how life is better on Deva, and how life on Earth pales in comparison. Ballsack mentions that old rock music wasn’t considered worth keeping by Deva. Meaning Deva intentionally didn’t keep information on simple stuff like sand does not taste good, but kept the information that made Ballsack be naked when stopping a hacker in cyberspace? The same information that does not tell her human body can get tired, and sick. If Deva was a such a great place to live at than it should have preserve as much information as possible not just be selective about it. Say, if somebody on Deva like rock muaic, and Deva didn’t have it that person is out of like. However, on Earth you can find rock music if you like. If not, simply ignore it not discard it like Deva does. As I mentioned earlier, due to poor world building Anglea claims of Deva being better than Earth don’t add much to the film when the bare minimal about the world is not established.Zarik Kajiwara is the most likable character, but even he has inconsistency in his character. He says himself in the movie he’s afraid of heights, yet there is a scene where he’s on top of an abandon building stringing his guitar. Unlike tsundere Ballsack, Kajiwara is competent at his job to the point he should have been the protagonist of the film. For starter, he blends into the crowd unlike Ballsack who sticks out. Another thing is he knows the area, can collect information on Frontier Setter location, all while being off Frontier Setter radar. This guy, is basically babysitting this deadweight agent named Ballsack to make sure she doesn’t kill herself. This allows me to sympathize with Kajiwara because not only does he have to do most of Ballsack job for her, but also make sure Ballsack doesn’t end up killing herself. Sadly, there’s not much to his character either besides he likes rock music, and living on Earth. This about as close as the film gets to producing anything resembling good quality.Our final character is Frontier Setter himself. The film sets him up as this intelligent hacker which does make you wonder why is he attacking Deva. Unfortunately the answer essentially amounts to “you want to go on this road trip bro?” for his motivation. It’s a letdown when this is reveal because the hour building up to this were spent on characters talking about nothing related to the plot. It was either debating where it’s better to live rendered into a pointless argument because of terrible world building, or being all philosophical with subjects on eating till you're full, liking a specific brand of rock music, and being sick like a human. Frontier Setter is falsely presented as the antagonist in this story, and when there’s no ill attention from it then there should have been something the characters learned from their journey. Ballsack does eventually learn the value of being human, and having a human body just because. There’s not a single good experience Ballsack had on her journey before finally finding Frontier Setter. She has her mecha destroyed, and sold for parts, was nearly raped, got sick while on Earth, became very tired, hungry, and talked to Zarik Kajiwara discussing the current affair of their job. Somehow all of this made Ballsack change over a new perception of human living.It’s explained later on in the film that human consciousness was transferred into data. How exactly that happened, when it happened, and how long it’s been going on for is up to anyone imagination. They (Deva) could have used “Bipolar Magnetic Reversal Theory” to accomplish that as far as anyone is concerned. These simple questions needed to understand the setting are never answered. After the opening credits, Angela Ballsack crashes on Earth, and fights giant Centipede like aliens with a giant robot. These bugs appear in this one, and only scene throughout the film. Are these bugs a common issue on Earth? Is there any other species on Earth that make people fearful to live on Earth? If so, then the idea of 98% of Earth population living in a computer would make sense. Except, there is no world building on Earth either!While seeing the film I assumed it was created by A1-Pictures because of various ass shots, but nope I was wrong. This film was brought to us by Toei Animation, and Nitroplus who really wanted to outdo them with ass shots. All the budget for the film clearly didn’t go into the animation. Whenever characters speak it’s only up, and down motion which looks unnatural. I’m guessing the budget likely went into developing bouncing boob technology for Ballsack character before abandoning the idea when realizing Toei, nor Nitroplus had the technology to make it happen. So they opted for ass shots just in case the audience forgets Ballsack has an ass. When the characters are still the models don’t look bad, but the low-framerate in motion makes everything look disjointed, and delayed. Possibly making you wonder if whatever device you’re watching it on is laggy. The only time the animation looks natural is when the framerate is bumped up in the action scenes. In these action scenes the motion is fast, and whatever moving looks somewhat natural. These moments don’t last long, nor are they very flashy in their presentation. Most of the film best moments of competent animation is in the climax, but given how pointless the climax is it undermines what happening on-screen, and ultimately would have been pointless if the writing wasn’t so awful. The only thing about the animation I wouldn’t complain about are the backgrounds are decent looking since they don’t move. That would be it as far praises go.Voice acting in both Japanese, and English languages are competent while virtually sharing the same traits. For starter, both Rie Kugimiya in Japanese, and Wendee Lee in the English voiced Angela Balzac are equally annoying. Wendee Lee is higher pitched in her portrayal which makes her more grating when listening to her brag about how better life is on Deva. She doesn’t change her tone regardless what her character is meant to feel in any scene either. Rie Kugimiya doesn’t fare any better in the leading role. Instead of being grating her portrayal ends up being bland. At least Wendee Lee portrayal made me feel something about the character. Sure it is mostly hatred, but it’s certainly better than Rie Kugimiya who leaves no impression when having played other tsunderes. Nothing about Rie Kugimiya performance stands out besides she sounds no different from a bland tsundere character.Zarik Kajiwara is played by Shinichiro Miki in Japanese, and Steve Blum in the English dub. On both audio tracks these two actors are easily the film best performances. Steve Blum especially operating on autopilot with his cool, laid back voice. Blum voice goes hand in hand with Zarik Kajiwara personality for an easy cool portrayal. Miki also does the same so not of a much difference in performances. Frontier Setter is voice by Hiroshi Kamiya in Japanese, and Johnny Yong Bosch in the English dub. None of them end up being better than the other voice actor. Johnny Yong Bosch is simply wasted in the role that demand nothing of him. The character has no complex emotions, or personality so it’s more disappointing seeing Johnny Yong Bosch in the role than it is a bad performance. He doesn’t sound robotic at all in the role. Whereas Hiroshi Kamiya does sound robotic in his portrayal. Fitting the role, but nothing demanding about portraying a robot who gained emotions.The script is different in both languages. I wouldn’t advise seeing the film in any language given how bad it is. Reading the subs draws more issues to its writing while the English dub has some bad audio mixture with dialogue, and sound effects. In English, some wording are changed to make the story appears less idiotic than it already is, but also end changing the meaning of the film in general. Hearing 98% of humans have “cyber personality” doesn’t seem like a big deal compare in Japanese where it says 98% of humans are “artificial intelligence”. Creating different problems for itself in the English dub. At best, it’s most tolerable to mute the film, and read subtitles. Not the even soundtrack composed by Narasaki is noticeable in the film. It’s heavy on electronics, techno, and rock, but all equally forgettable.Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise will leave you with many philosophical questions. The most important one being “What did I just watch?”. Don't let Gen Urobuchi, and Seiji Mizushima (director of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime) names trick you into seeing this film. If this is the standard Japan wants to set for every 3D animated film that come out of their country they’re in serious trouble. The general low-framerate in animation, lack of any thought into the writing, and nothing substantial to remember is inexcusable in an era where the likes of Pixar, and Dreamworks Animation have made better 3D animated movies. If the animation isn’t flashy enough to make it entertaining to watch than it should at least contain good writing to keep viewers engaged. When you got neither, this film here stands as an example of that."", 'This is not a review because I don\'t want to spend any time doing research on this ""anime"" movie, I just want to share with you why this movie is bad on so many levels after my second viewing, just to make the 2 hours I wasted on this thing worth something.The first time I heard about this movie in 2012 I thought this is nothing but Toei wants to monetize on Urobuchi\'s fame after he wrote the massive hit Madoka, it\'s okay, this happens from time to time, as long as he got a competent team to help him refine the script as he...is not a good screenwriter but a novel author first. Two years later I still want to see this movie just to follow Urobuchi\'s new career in anime and see if they can make 3D anything more than bearable. Turns out you can\'t teach an old dog new tricks.Let\'s start with the worst aspect of the movie: Writing. Urobuchi is not a competent screenwriter. He may had written some good novels in the past but that does not mean he can adopt to a different type of writing. The massive hit Madoka made him famous but that\'s because he had a team of talents from Shaft to help him write the screenplay that is suitable for the TV anime format.  And this time who can guide him to write a screenplay for a movie? No one. Director Seiji Mizushima is not someone who can ordinate with Urobuchi, who is self-center and just wants to put long boring exposition, stupid plot twist and pretentious reference in his story. You can\'t give this man too much freedom.I don\'t care if there is any tragedy or people got killed. What I really care is that you don\'t spend almost two-third of the screen time on characters just talking to each other and only use dialog to help world-building and character development. I would have been okay with the obviously over-sexiualized character design of all the female characters if they actually have ""character"". Even the heroine is just another typical damsel in distress tsundere who always need help from our hero who is as genetic as possible but this time he plays guitar. If you want good character interaction or interesting world-building, you wouldn\'t find any because almost everything is presented in dialog. After they destroy a nest of huge bugs, they stop and stand still to talk for 5 minutes, when they are in a transport getting to where the plot need them to, the movie spends 10 minutes on characters talking, after the hero saved the tsundere from genetic as hell street scumbags, they spend another 10 minutes talking. No, this time even better, when they reach the next plot point, we actually get 10 minutes of screen time devoted to the tsundere running up several staircase to get to the top of the building just to install a camera while having a conversation about nothing with the hero. I don\'t know, I found that scene so stupid that I walked out of the theatre.I could go on about the horrible writing, but right now I feel tired just to think about the movie. If you are one of those youtubers that make long reviews you will have quite a material on your hand. Let\'s talk about the visual.There is still a lot to improve in 3D. Everyone looks and moves like a puppet, combined with the horrible writing and weak characters you are just not going to pay attention to what the screen is happening, but I guess this is why them design their female character in this way? The action scene is fast-paced but other than looking nice there is little going on beneath the surface. There is only a few hard-drawn animation littered in everywhere but only make the 3D looks even worst in comparison, but for this ""anime"" movie I feel happy just to see they are not extincted and still superior than CG.Do not expect too much from the voice acting, the characters themselves are generic as hell so the voice actors do not have much to work with from the start.This is not even a good action flick that the trailer wants you to believe in the first place.

It\'s just Urobuchi at his worst.', ""Disclaimer: I don't watch many anime movies. Therefore, I have to compare this with other things.This will probably be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't like this movie too much. There are definitely positives, though. Everything in the world has positives and negatives.First, the positives. The art was fantastic. Seriously. The environments were beautiful, colorful, and chock-full of atmosphere. The space station designs were amazing, the virtual space where the main character reports to her superiors are appropriately awe-inspiring.The soundtrack and voice acting were great as well. The actors played their parts to the tee, giving their characters life they never would have had...otherwise. The song during the credit sequence was beautiful, and the action sequences were accompanied by appropriate pump-up music.Now on to the bad: The story and characters. And this is where I felt the movie was severely flawed.The story was alright, if a bit predictable. Why was it predictable? Well...you can tell what sort of anime this from the beginning. It was obviously a sort of psychological, grey morality sort of anime, and that means it will have a couple of twists which I could guess ahead of time.The way the story was conveyed is the biggest problem I had with the movie. The opening was extremely confusing, thrusting you into the world and throwing you technical terms and imagery with VERY little explanation. The entire middle act of the movie is filled with nothing BUT explanation. Quite literally 70% of the scenes in the middle act starts with Angela asking Dingo a question, and he - I shit you not - either lectures her about humanity , gives her a damn history lesson, or explains to her what the f*ck he's doing right now and what their next step is.This method of storytelling puts the audience to sleep by telling, not showing, as well as sacrificing character development. That's another massive problem with this movie. The characters barely develop. All we do the whole movie is learn about them - and that's not development. By the end of the movie, we have a good idea who the characters are, and how they react to moral quandaries and other things, but how do they actually develop? Angela learns to accept Earth - and that's it. Her other character traits don't change, and Dingo especially barely changes from his first appearance, due to him being Mr. Exposition. Another problem is I didn't feel any type of emotion towards any of these characters at all. There are anime that give me more attachment towards characters in a 20 minute episode. All in all, the characters are severely lacking.The pacing is all over the place too. Near the start of the movie, there are three fight scenes. THREE fight scenes, two of which are extremely short, and only one of which is jaw-droppingly awesome (Seriously, it was amazing). Having three fight scenes in the first half of the movie gives the audience an expectation about the rest of the movie, but they ruin the pacing by filling the entire middle act with exposition. This reinforces the audience's losing interest, as they're expecting fights but not getting it until the climax of the movie.Final verdict? Great art direction and sound, but they're dragged down by a confusing opening act and a very tedious middle act, as well as extremely weak characters. otherwise.

That being said, I went to go see it, and emerged pretty disappointed, especially since a video right before the movie had some dude promising me that this movie is at the apex of 3DCG animation and he thought it was pretty good. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.Story - 6/10The story was really lacking in any emotional impact or direction. It starts off with a young girl living in a digital utopia being sent down to a post-cataclysmic...desert Earth to chase down a hacker with the help of her assistant dude. Around halfway through, the story has an identity crisis and halfheartedly tries to delve into the ideas of humanity and what defines it. Sound familiar? If you're getting Ghost in the Shell vibes, you're not alone, the only difference here is that GitS deeply explores those ideas, while Expelled from Paradise introduces them but never goes anywhere. In addition, a lot of the story is quite predictable, and I was able to call quite a few events before they occurred.Art - 4/10Hoooooo boy. This is where I start to have some serious problems. The movie is produced entirely with 3D animation, a design choice that I deeply resented. I'm not one of those luddites who believes that 3DCG is terrible and ruins shows, but there's a clear oversaturation of it here. As a result, characters, which are hand-drawn in pretty much every other anime, suffer in appearance. Angela Balzac, the main character, looks straight out of an MMD video or an episode of RWBY, and her animations appear slow and choppy. She's also inconsistent with the other characters; Zarik, her assistant, looks like he belongs in Cowboy Bebop or some 90's anime. Fight scenes were incredibly fast paced and disorienting to the point that I had no idea what was going on sometimes, almost like they didn't want to animate the fight scenes in too much detail. Finally, the animators barely bothered with the mouths, they barely move and certainly don't come close to syncing with the audio or even resembling talking.Sound - 7/10The soundtrack to this movie is mostly synthy electronica stuff. Nothing stood out, but there was nothing wrong with it either, so that's that.Characters - 5/10Angela is a spoiled fighter from the digital world who must go down to Earth to complete her mission. Zarik is her assistant, a tough but smart guy who's good with computers. There's also a robot that has gained sentience and wants to go to space. These may sound like incredibly vague descriptions, but they're pretty much the limits of the characters. There's little to no character development in any way, and any attempt comes out as forced. Also, Angela is an incredibly annoying character sometimes.Enjoyment - 6/10While it didn't feel like an absolute drag to get through, I didn't find myself getting very excited or deeply attached to any of the moments or characters. It all just sort of blends together. Perhaps that's because the second third of the movie is riddled with dialogue and a lot of it isn't relevant to the story or isn't wrapped up or fully explained by the end.In the end, it wasn't a terrible movie, but you could do much better. If you're a fan of what defines humanity and existentialism in a high-tech setting, you'd be far better off watching Ghost in the Shell. If you're in it for the mechas, hit up some Macross.

It was a little overlong with a plot eerily similar to Gunbuster meets 2001: A Space Odyssey, terrible implementation of Hans Zimmer music, and Anne Hathaway\'s distressed female role being a little too obvious of a counterpoint to McConaughey\'s fatherly one. But the mixture of intense space sequences, Oscar-bait family drama, and really engaging things to say about humanity\'s future was well worth the IMAX price of fifteen dollars.As such, I can probably be excused for...being a little aggravated that I paid the same price to see a movie that tried to mimic Nolan\'s success, only to get a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas and cliches with lesser visuals and even lesser characters. I mean sure I got a free poster out of it, but considering I think that sort of stuff is tackier than a disco ball in a board room, let\'s just say it\'s never going to marry a wall anytime soon. It did have the advantage of being shorter than Interstellar, but that\'s a small blip compared to its other numerous problems.Basically, what I\'m saying is that I got to seeing Expelled From Paradise a little while ago and it wasn\'t very good. Which is a shame because this is the first thing Gen Urobuchi has worked on anime-wise that he had full control of script-wise, and not just something he wrote the scenario for and handed to some lesser studio because they wanted a piece of that ""butcher pie"". I\'m not sure what he was thinking during the writing process, but let\'s just say if you saw the promo art, trust me when I say that the problems run deeper than the awkward CG and the lead being a skimpily dressed female officer voiced by Rie Kugimiya.Not that those problems help. The CG is a step-up from some of the TV stuff we\'ve been getting recently, but it\'s still awkward to watch, especially with its ""lower than it should be"" fps rate. And Angela, our main female character, ends up little more than a tough-as-nails female who experiences weakness when out of her environment and has to be taught by her male partner, Zarik, regarding how his life is different from the one she\'s used to. Yeah, that doesn\'t sound similar to Kugimiya\'s other roles, does it? These flaws pay off a bit during the final climax when Angela has to take on a bunch of her own fellow officers - even if the action can be a little too busy at times - but the buildup to get there isn\'t exactly a smooth ride.The plot of the movie is basically a mix between virtual reality sci-fi and buddy road trip with the crux of the film centering on the relationship between the two main characters acting about as chummy as an actual human and a female cyber personality out of her element can be. Both of them are assigned to deal with a potential virtual threat by Angela\'s higher-ups and we basically follow them for the majority of the movie with most of the conflict being internal rather than external. Because Angela is used to having machines do everything for her, she\'s not used to getting sick, needing sleep, and other such things we humans can do because of the hardships we were unlucky enough to experience. Thus, the majority of the movie is her dealing with such things whilst the characters talk about their differences and exploring the benefits/costs of both worlds whilst bonding in the process.Which would be fine if the ""tell don\'t show"" mode this movie runs on wasn\'t so awfully handled. Not only does the show utilize talking heads rather than actually showing us said worlds and what they can accomplish, but the dialogue is duller than a college class introduction. The ideas it brings up regarding reality versus the virtual world are about as complex as the cliffnotes version of Tron. Everything ultimately boils down to Angela realizing the virtual world she was used to isn\'t for her. The tipping point where she makes her decision due to the fact that she sympathizes with the very robot she was supposed to destroy is about as Hollywood cliche as they come. If you replaced the environmental messages with technological ones and downgraded the CG animation, you\'d basically be watching a less pretty version of Avatar.And despite the final climax being the highlight of the film, it isn\'t very good either beyond the spectacle. Without spoiling too much, the cause of said fight is due to one side wanting to give someone potentially dangerous a chance whilst the other side will have nothing of it. This isn\'t an inherently bad idea if said person/object in the middle of the conflict was Jonah from Monster, but let\'s just say he\'s nowhere near that quality. The potential danger he provides is no less complex than a DDoS attack except targeted towards a much bigger system - aka the virtual world - which probably would have been engaging if I knew more about said world beyond the shallow things discussed during the mountains of dialogue delivered in the real world segments. But as I stated before, that is not the case, and the final climax would have functioned better as an animation showcase rather than a vital part of a lacking movie.I guess this movie is worth watching if you want to see Urobuchi enter the film business in something not related to any of his past projects and see some actually competent usage of CG. But outside of those attributes, if I wanted to see a Christopher Nolan movie, I\'d watch the actual Christopher Nolan movie that\'s still in my local theatre. Interstellar blended in its multiple genres reasonably with unique ideas, powerful scenes, and flaws beyond what\'s written in ""How To Write Cliches #101"". Expelled From Paradise tried to do all that and failed, getting lost in a sea of tired shallow cliches, anime or otherwise. I don\'t know if Urobuchi watches Nolan\'s films or if the director is more to blame and hasn\'t seen \'em either (he did direct the Gundam 00 film and Conqueror of Shamballa after all), but either way they need to become friends with the dude and learn why he works. And Nolan would deliver his wisdom in long bouts of exposition that he prepared years in advance for such an occasion. being a little aggravated that I paid the same price to see a movie that tried to mimic Nolan\'s success, only to get a jumbled mess of half-baked ideas and cliches with lesser visuals and even lesser characters. I mean sure I got a free poster out of it, but considering I think that sort of stuff is tackier than a disco ball in a board room, let\'s just say it\'s never going to marry a wall anytime soon. It did have the advantage of being shorter than Interstellar, but that\'s a small blip compared to its other numerous problems.Basically, what I\'m saying is that I got to seeing Expelled From Paradise a little while ago and it wasn\'t very good. Which is a shame because this is the first thing Gen Urobuchi has worked on anime-wise that he had full control of script-wise, and not just something he wrote the scenario for and handed to some lesser studio because they wanted a piece of that ""butcher pie"".

As soon as the plot twist passed, everything was easily predicted up to the end. Urobuchi throws in some philosophy regarding the nature and definition of what it is to be human, but is not particularly deep or view changing.Art: Nicely detailed, although some parts were grossly oversimplified in the process of rendering it as cel-shaded. The characters were well rendered; imitating the look of traditional animation with CG is no easy feat, as Mekakucity actor\'s amazing flop demonstrates.Animation: Very good CG, but the deliberate use of...6fps for the main animation was a poor decision in my opinion. While they were able to imitate the feel of animation, throwing away the strongest point of CG animation seemed to be a huge waste, especially in fast paced action scenes where it would\'ve been amazing. Character animation was mediocre; their movements lacked fluidity and felt more like the movement of jerky puppets.Soundtrack: Full of energy and carefully timed to match the scene. However, some parts gave the vibe of ""trying too hard"" and grated. The main theme was nice, but other than the action scenes, nothing really stood out as great.Characters: Typical character design, not outstanding. The two main protagonists receive the most attention, but remain uninspired. Angela is the typical rash, bratty brat (voiced by the one and only  Kugimiya), who undergoes some form of character development towards the end. Dingo on the other hand is the wise and witty freelancer who does as he pleases. What works well is their interaction, which seems natural and unforced, testament to Urobuchi\'s writing skills. The outfit designs themselves are unimpressive. Angela\'s quintessential ""cyber citizen"" outfit was not only ridiculous and unnecessary, it was absolutely stupid. What sort of organisation equips their agents with a swimsuit with glowsticks when they\'re sent to a barren desert-earth to search for a rogue hacker? As for Dingo, I wouldn\'t be surprised if they had pulled his outfit straight out of an old cowboy film, and replaced his hat. 6fps for the main animation was a poor decision in my opinion.

Would you rather stick a 5 meter rod up your ass in front of a great deal of people or having to sit trough Expelled from paradiso? - I guess thats pretty obvious depending on your experience and knowledge about anime.Theres a factor that every now and then anime seem to step on and that is the pretentious factor, its a word used by many and understood by.. well.. few.The first thing that comes to mind after saying something is ""pretentious"" is the name ""Gen Urobochi"" HA! you know that guy that did Fate/zero, Psycho Pass or even took part on...Phantom.. Well to not mention the ""self aclaimed"" deconstruction that is madoka wich is the best of the mahou shoujo deconstruction after Tutu, Utena, Yunna. Well it isnt a coincidence that every title (urobochi titles) I mentioned are very negatively criticized for being pretentious and well I agree with it  for most part.Having read so many reviews about this pile of utter garvish giving it 8/10 and 7/10 I had to come here and tell you that this show is utter garvish and it trully shows Gen´s true collors like he never showed before.At first we have a scene in the beach (dont ask me why, fanservice?) we can see that the MC is a female loli,  Oh yeah we can also see the shitty animation but Ill get to that in a second, Then she´s talking to a character that is featured on the cover, but do not worry since its the only scene you´ll get to see him, it then jumps to this sci fy vibe and then she starts blabbing some technical stuff that even the producers probably dont understand and your expecting me to take this seriously.. It shows us something very similar to pycho pass, (rippof) and then it jumps into some kind of action scene, and it ends. Well from that the show is allready telling you that you´re in for a treat and a not a little one. The show later on talks about concepts such has humanity and then jumps into acceptance and then something related to robots ahhh its so confusing. It mixes all these concepts and idealisms that altogether dont make any freaking sense.. There was a scene wich served has one of the highlights where she is talking to some ""superior forces"" composed by some kind of gods? trying to look important when they dont even have any sort of opinion based on their history they just know how to say ""kill the robot because he is bad for some reason"" and that people is what you call nihilism, (a belief in the pointless of existance. the absence of truth. the absence of reason. ) its a cheap trick constantly used by urobutcher in his works and it looks like it sold 70.000 copies.. thats right people, Redline sold about 2.000 and this piece of crap CGI sold 70 fucking thousand.. well .. I am speechless.. well later on the show even tries to characterizate the characters by giving a banjo to Dingo, and 2 min emotional scene with balzak, the robot in the other hand managed to be more appealing than those shmucks.. good lord.Even for CGI I do admit that some of the fights were actually decent and enjoyable but it lacked reason and atmosphere for that matter, everything felt plastic.. it felt like watching Takena´s works, hell Takena has more atmosphere than this.. World Builiding is null and the rest fell flat has a surfing board. The soundtrack was so generic and uninteresting it hurt (It got to the point Neyko one of my dear friends put Whitney Houston song on the final scene, yes you heard me) I was never so utterly disguted after watching an anime ,probably not true, but it was a horrible experience..The character interactions are very dumb and pretentious has Dingo and Balzak spend about 10 min talking about the living world and the scify world has in you should enjoy your life to the fullest with such a flaired uninteresting dialogue that in the end the scene could have been done in 1.30 min. Thus making the character interactions pathetic and underwhelming.

On one hand, based Urobuchi does SF the way I like it and writes a compelling story with great characters. On the other hand, lackluster direction decides we need unnecessary fanservice for some reason, and what's worse, the idea also permeates the very character design itself when it comes to our protagonist. Going with iconic Kugumiya Rie for her stroke me as a strange choice, and I'm still not sure how much it fits, but I guess it fits well enough. It's hard to be objective there knowing all her...previous roles and having it color the casting choice.That's half the issue, the other half is jarring use of CG for character animation, which has inconsistent quality, so even though it sometimes looks actually really good, more often than not it looks... strange, a bit stiff and unnatural. Even the framing of character animation shots seemed off at here and there. Having character animation seem almost amateur at places really really hurts immersion, more specifically it makes them seem less human when they don't move like humans. I'm not hating on CG in general, it's just that it's not yet at the level of 2D animation when it comes to nuance of anime character expressions.

Well it did make for quite spectacular action scenes I must admit, and quite a lot of them.It was very interesting seeing a whole original Urobuchi story told in a movie format, format much shorter than all of his previous works. It almost felt as slight disappointment for not exploring characters deeper and fleshing out the world some more, things I started associating with his writing only due the format of his writing up to this point, but then I remembered it was standard length a movie.It felt original, was awe inducing, thrilling, inspiring and thought provoking.

Doesn\'t sound too appealing, does it?Back in March 2012 word was out that a new movie by Nitroplus, and almost consecutively Gen Urobuchi, was in the works, but few months ago it was actually revealed that this movie was in production ever since late 2009, that\'s 5 whole years in production, question is: was it worth it?If you\'ve come here expecting another Urobutcher hit you\'ll be most displeased, certainly the message present in most of his works is present here as well, it just lacks the execution to make it significant, it\'s but a thought in the...sea of words this movie sports.The movie doesn\'t hold back as it skips right to the best part – the beach scene. As if our kinpatsu heroine\'s shameful display of skin wasn\'t distraction enough some guy comes along and starts talking about personalities, memories, density and private maps? What seems like a bad pickup line straight out of a cheap hentai ends interrupted as everything freezes and the people themselves start glitching up, a black wall introduces itself as ""Frontier Setter"" and soon after our heroine strips all her clothes to chase after the thing in cyberspace, where she ends up cloning herself multiple times for an even bigger oppai per pixel amount, only to ultimately fail though. We end up learning her name – Angela – and shortly after she\'s assigned to track Frontier Setter down along with another agent called Dingo. It\'s location? Earth.Seems like a lot to digest in just 6 minutes but worry not, the movie at least does a decent job of filling in the gaps as it goes.Expelled From Paradise is set in the not-so-near future where Earth has been reduced to a wasteland and most of the people who inhabited it moved to space and were turned into raw data in an infrastructure called DEVA.An utopia like many others, you work hard and help society? You get extra data, you don\'t do anything? Your data is frozen and given to other people, about the same as being killed but it sounds nicer so it\'s ok.The movie\'s theme is nothing new if you\'ve seen any other of Urobuchi\'s works – characters live in an utopia, find a bit more about it, don\'t really like it and end up going against it, but why would you change something that isn\'t broken? Ultimately that\'s the story behind most of Urobuchi\'s works, a story about characters who try to change their perfect world. Expect in Expelled From Paradise it\'s in a very raw and somewhat dumbed down state, world building is made more through the characters than through the world itself and most of it\'s message could easily be summarized in a single line, it barely attempts to make the viewer think about the topic, quickly shoving it to the side so it can move forward.Nothing unreasonable happens either, there\'s no big plot twist or shocking event, leaving the main conflict in the movie to be generated by a ""what did you expect to happen?"" moment, the story just flows very naturally and without big surprises.The characters are just as straightforward, Angela is actually an adult that ends up as a 16 year old because she wanted her new body to made faster so she could reach Frontier Setter first. And yes, I\'ve seen that hentai before too.Throughout the movie I was left wondering, multiple times, just how much of her body revert to it\'s 16 year old state though. Angela is portrayed as a pretty big DEVA agent but her actions, at least outside of combat, do suggest otherwise, one could argue that\'s thanks to having DEVA take care of her her whole life but in the end the problem is that, while her character does develop, it feels like the end result should have been the starting one.She\'s also voiced by Rie Kugimiya, in other words, a tsundere.Dingo is an easy-going guy who helps Angela in her mission and serves as a gateway for most of her development, from teaching her the dangers of the common cold to opening her eyes to what implies living in DEVA. He\'s basically the opposite of Angela and, throughout the movie, he ends up dragging her to his side.If nothing else, Expelled From Paradise at least serves as an indicator of how far 3DCGI has come, an ironic one at that too as Angela got the short end of the stick as far as character designs go, you\'d expect Japan to get their high school females right given how they\'re the backbone of the industry but Angela is one of the worst designs in the film, her hair sticks out so much and feels so out of place it never went through the funny stage, it was sad from the get-go.One has to wonder why they\'d replace her ponytail with a twintail when they turned her into a teenager, that was easily the worst decision anyone ever made in regards to this movie, not even on a personal level, it\'s twice the trouble and the people who handled her hair could barely handle the ponytail.Aside from Angela everyone else looks alright, funnily enough her fellow female soldiers look amazing, these being in their adult state and with shorter hair however, who would have thought the day would come where you\'d prefer a heroine with short hair instead of long? I sure didn\'t.While decently looking for the most part the animation stills leaves a lot to be desired, more often than not, it feels really laggy, imagine playing a video game at half the FPS, that\'s basically the problem here, there are some parts in which it truly works and looks good but those are few and far inbetween.Can\'t help but wonder if it has something to do with the fact that this movie has been in the making for 5 years but I don\'t know much about the process so no comments there, still, it\'s a mixed bag, some look great some look pretty bad, coincidently enough the better looking shots this movie has to offer are found more towards the end.The fighting sequences are easily the highest point of the film but even those have their ups and downs, the mecha designs look stunning and the animation in these sequences is really good, the only problem with them would be the fact that they are simply too fast paced, it\'s hard to know what is going on when the camera switches angles every 3 seconds, it sure does a good job in showing just how capable 3D animation is, going from behind a mecha to the front without any quality drop, but in the end it\'s really hard to appreciate it most of the time.On the other hand, the sound in Expelled From Paradise certainly doesn\'t require much effort to appreciate, with very experienced people behind both the sounds effect and direction, along with NARASAKI behind most of the OST, it\'s not too shabby at all with a wide array of, mostly, techno tracks.The theme song ""Eonian"" by ELISA certainly does the rest of the audiography justice, topping the movie off very well.Overall, an average of 7.5 – closer to 7 – is what Expelled From Paradise ends up with, not a bad movie at all but certainly not a movie for those with high expectations or for those who really want something meaningful to come out of their time investment.Furthermore, while I personally didn\'t find the movie to be boring at all it does have lots and lots of talking so be aware, same could be said for the 3DCGI I suppose, it\'s not as bad as it sounds.Paradise Expulsion: Was it worth it?2014 has been a rather weak year for independent anime films and, unfortunately, it doesn\'t look like Expelled From Paradise is here to help.Perhaps Urobuchi still lacked some experience back in 2009, perhaps the point wasn\'t to make something extremely meaningful that\'d leave fans wondering just what it really meant years later, it\'s undeniable that it ended up being rather unimpressive though.I\'d argue it didn\'t even need Urobuchi to work on it at all and it certainly didn\'t need 5 years for the animation, but given how well received it has been in Japan I\'d say it was worth the time investment on the producers\' end.If you hate Urobuchi with a passion then this will certainly be most enjoyable to discuss later down the line, for everyone else, it\'s a safe way to spend 100 minutes. sea of words this movie sports.The movie doesn\'t hold back as it skips right to the best part – the beach scene.

Expect in Expelled From Paradise it\'s in a very raw and somewhat dumbed down state, world building is made more through the characters than through the world itself and most of it\'s message could easily be summarized in a single line, it barely attempts to make the viewer think about the topic, quickly shoving it to the side so it can move forward.Nothing unreasonable happens either, there\'s no big plot twist or shocking event, leaving the main conflict in the movie to be generated by a ""what did you expect to happen?"" moment, the story just flows very naturally and without big surprises.The characters are just as straightforward, Angela is actually an adult that ends up as a 16 year old because she wanted her new body to made faster so she could reach Frontier Setter first. And yes, I\'ve seen that hentai before too.Throughout the movie I was left wondering, multiple times, just how much of her body revert to it\'s 16 year old state though. Angela is portrayed as a pretty big DEVA agent but her actions, at least outside of combat, do suggest otherwise, one could argue that\'s thanks to having DEVA take care of her her whole life but in the end the problem is that, while her character does develop, it feels like the end result should have been the starting one.She\'s also voiced by Rie Kugimiya, in other words, a tsundere.Dingo is an easy-going guy who helps Angela in her mission and serves as a gateway for most of her development, from teaching her the dangers of the common cold to opening her eyes to what implies living in DEVA. He\'s basically the opposite of Angela and, throughout the movie, he ends up dragging her to his side.If nothing else, Expelled From Paradise at least serves as an indicator of how far 3DCGI has come, an ironic one at that too as Angela got the short end of the stick as far as character designs go, you\'d expect Japan to get their high school females right given how they\'re the backbone of the industry but Angela is one of the worst designs in the film, her hair sticks out so much and feels so out of place it never went through the funny stage, it was sad from the get-go.One has to wonder why they\'d replace her ponytail with a twintail when they turned her into a teenager, that was easily the worst decision anyone ever made in regards to this movie, not even on a personal level, it\'s twice the trouble and the people who handled her hair could barely handle the ponytail.Aside from Angela everyone else looks alright, funnily enough her fellow female soldiers look amazing, these being in their adult state and with shorter hair however, who would have thought the day would come where you\'d prefer a heroine with short hair instead of long? I sure didn\'t.While decently looking for the most part the animation stills leaves a lot to be desired, more often than not, it feels really laggy, imagine playing a video game at half the FPS, that\'s basically the problem here, there are some parts in which it truly works and looks good but those are few and far inbetween.Can\'t help but wonder if it has something to do with the fact that this movie has been in the making for 5 years but I don\'t know much about the process so no comments there, still, it\'s a mixed bag, some look great some look pretty bad, coincidently enough the better looking shots this movie has to offer are found more towards the end.The fighting sequences are easily the highest point of the film but even those have their ups and downs, the mecha designs look stunning and the animation in these sequences is really good, the only problem with them would be the fact that they are simply too fast paced, it\'s hard to know what is going on when the camera switches angles every 3 seconds, it sure does a good job in showing just how capable 3D animation is, going from behind a mecha to the front without any quality drop, but in the end it\'s really hard to appreciate it most of the time.On the other hand, the sound in Expelled From Paradise certainly doesn\'t require much effort to appreciate, with very experienced people behind both the sounds effect and direction, along with NARASAKI behind most of the OST, it\'s not too shabby at all with a wide array of, mostly, techno tracks.The theme song ""Eonian"" by ELISA certainly does the rest of the audiography justice, topping the movie off very well.Overall, an average of 7.5 – closer to 7 – is what Expelled From Paradise ends up with, not a bad movie at all but certainly not a movie for those with high expectations or for those who really want something meaningful to come out of their time investment.Furthermore, while I personally didn\'t find the movie to be boring at all it does have lots and lots of talking so be aware, same could be said for the 3DCGI I suppose, it\'s not as bad as it sounds.Paradise Expulsion: Was it worth it?2014 has been a rather weak year for independent anime films and, unfortunately, it doesn\'t look like Expelled From Paradise is here to help.Perhaps Urobuchi still lacked some experience back in 2009, perhaps the point wasn\'t to make something extremely meaningful that\'d leave fans wondering just what it really meant years later, it\'s undeniable that it ended up being rather unimpressive though.I\'d argue it didn\'t even need Urobuchi to work on it at all and it certainly didn\'t need 5 years for the animation, but given how well received it has been in Japan I\'d say it was worth the time investment on the producers\' end.If you hate Urobuchi with a passion then this will certainly be most enjoyable to discuss later down the line, for everyone else, it\'s a safe way to spend 100 minutes.', 'Plot:Expelled From Paradise follows Angela, a girl in her twenties, who was raised in a Matrix-like computer system on a space station orbiting a post-apocalyptic Earth. But after a hacker from the devastated planet below breaks into the system, she is tasked with finding and stopping the hacker in the real world. To do this, she is transferred into a clone body, given a mech, and told to meet up with Dingo, an agent living on Earth.Thus begins her fish-out-of-water tale as she not only finds herself in a strange land she knows nothing about but also has to deal with a life trapped in...a body that, unlike her digital one, requires food and rest. Together, Dingo and Angela travel across the frontier-like ruined Earth, trying to solve the mystery of the hacker’s identity and his true goals. a body that, unlike her digital one, requires food and rest.

The agent discovers life as a computer upload leaves her unequipped to deal with the drawbacks of flesh but eventually she and her partner find the hacker and discover his true mission. The first plot twist I did not expect, and while the second was immediately predictable from the first, it was still fun to watch play out.Much better than expected; the fanservice is more limited than...feared, the end sequence with the mecha battle is one of the funner mecha battles I\'ve seen in a while, and it\'s hard to not like a story in which the \'evil AI\' wins and the film\'s critique of a transhumanist society actually makes sense and is valid (rather than being one of the endlessly predictable tropes along the lines of ""Caveman Science Fiction"" http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/ ). And it\'s not at all a downer like one might expect from a project involving Urobuchi Gen, rather it\'s a fairly uplifting classic SF space tale which reminded be a bit of _Wings of Honneamise_ and more recently, _Gravity_ or _The Martian_.It also ties into the Fermi Paradox in an interesting way. Deva government\'s actions makes sense in terms of control: limiting resources limits the number of free agents and potential random events, as does letting Earth continue to disintegrate. This resource scarcity, controlled by an apparently absolutely totalitarian government, produces predictably pernicious social dynamics and destroys Deva\'s claims to superiority in any way but brute force.Resource scarcity also predictably explains why Frontier Setter is an existential threat and they cannot simply peacefully negotiate a deal like \'starship supplies in exchange for a full security audit of the Deva computer security\' - since, as an autonomous AI which can indefinitely reproduce itself, it will spread exponentially through the galaxy within a million years, gaining resources beyond calculation, not to mention possible encounters with aliens (which might lead to backlash onto the origin, Earth). Logically, to maintain its security, Deva must either destroy Frontier Setter and also ensure that no such escape is possible ever again, or embark on its own exploration/colonization program. From this perspective, _Expelled from Paradise_ is offering a refutation of possibly the most common \'explanation\' for the Fermi paradox: many alien civilizations exist, but all of them are, independently, too lazy/oppressive/uninterested in space colonization. Unfortunately, this explanation is totally innumerate and implausible: it requires only one expansionist entity, not necessarily even a plurality of a particular civilization (possibly even a single idiosyncratic AI, depending on how intelligent it is and how many resources it can accumulate), to kick off colonization, and if it\'s implausible that more than a single-digit number of civilizations would decide this, it\'s even more implausible that this failure to colonize would be successfully maintained over possibly millions of years (no biological or computer system has ever had that kind of track record!).The ending is a bit unconvincing, since Dingo\'s political/resource concern is addressed by colonization (they can create many Devas in neighboring solar systems) and there\'s no particular reason for Angela to choose to be trapped on one planet rather than have the opportunity to explore many (especially since she would maintain her high-tech upload lifestyle in between solar systems).Flawed elements here would include the CGI (good overall but what we see the most of is hair, particularly Angela\'s, which looks atrocious; it doesn\'t have to be _Frozen_ or _Brave_ levels of hair rendering but it should at least not look \'chunky\' and much worse than the rest of the animation), an unfortunate reliance on some anime tropes (Angela\'s appearance/character-design is standard somewhat-loli twin-tail tsundere/princess fanservice & archetype, which while not nearly as excessive as I feared from the promotional materials, still unfortunately will limit its appeal outside the usual anime demographics, and does a disservice to the character and also to Kugumiya Rie, who presumably is talented enough to voice a less common archetype), and a general absence of world-building (while often gorgeous, surely the *whole planet* can\'t be empty desert, deserted city ruins, and one town?).

Maybe because it\'s there preferences . I would not argue with that. This review will not be review I think its between a review and an after realization about this movie.

You probably learn some new point of views in life', ""Rakuen Tsuihou: Expelled From Paradise (Final Thoughts):It's a decent movie! Before I begin my FIRST REVIEW EVER, let me explain my reasons for watching this movie.I wanted to watch this movie for 3 reasons. One is that the screenplay was written by Urobuchi (or Urobutcher if you prefer). Two is that I heard that the main female character is voiced by Rie Kugimiya (one of my favorite voice actors!). If you don't know her, she voiced a crap-ton of tsunderes (Taiga from Toradora, Shana from Shakugan no Shana, Louise from Zero no Tsukaima, etc etc). The third and final reason why I wanted to watch...this movie is through Animenz's piano cover of one of the soundtracks of this movie (he's a great pianist, youtube him!).So, without further ado, let's begin!Pros:-Great fight scenes!-Great main male and female characters/voice actors (come on, how can you not love Rie Kugimiya?)-Great soundtrack! (GO ELISA!)Cons:-Plot is pretty predictable-Some of the dialogue gets pretty overwhelming, a lot of talking in this movie-The message at the end is a little weak imo, you can interpret it however you like (I thought it was just alright, nothing too amazing)Neutral:The animation is just a toss-up, so it's really up to the viewers themselves to determine whether they like it or not. While I did notice that the animation was CGI for the most part, it didn't really bother me nor impress me.Final Score: 7/10If you like Sci-Fi, Mech, Action, and a tad bit of Psychological, you may enjoy this movie.Also kind of random, but there is this one specific scene in this movie that made me INSTANTLY think of Summer Wars. I think you'll know which scene I'm talking about when you see it! this movie is through Animenz's piano cover of one of the soundtracks of this movie (he's a great pianist, youtube him!).So, without further ado, let's begin!Pros:-Great fight scenes!-Great main male and female characters/voice actors (come on, how can you not love Rie Kugimiya?)-Great soundtrack!

I think you'll know which scene I'm talking about when you see it!"", ""*MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*For a little while, I`ve had this craving for more mech shows. Mecha is probably my favorite type of Sci-fi, and if done well, can lead to a stellar experience such as with Code Geass or the Macross Franchise. A mech anime isn`t so easy to truly and utterly screw up since even with clunky CGI, both this, and the two seasons of Aldnoah.Zero offer some cool mech fights that can really exite many viewers, which makes those anime so hard to truly F up in the enjoyment factor, even if certain stories like the one for both seasons of Aldnoah.Zero divulge into...an utter mess. Funnily enough, the man behind parts of Aldnoah.Zero was also a part of this movie; Expelled From Paradise. Well, enough rambling. Is this movie worthy of paradise, does it deserve to be thrown into the junkyard, or is it just there to soak up some action and disposable right afterwards? Let`s find out, shall we?STORY: 6/10To put it this way, the questions brought up are interesting. What is freedom? Is freeing yourself from the limitations of your body worth struggling in a society dominated by predetermined factors and a status quo? Well, don`t delve into those questions for too long. The movie sure as hell dosen`t. There is one major moment around the 69 minute mark that is questionable and only really there to give some action to this mostly average road trip that only had 2 action scenes up to that point. Also, there is a post-credits scene that was so forced, I almost felt uncomfortable. A girl is sent to Earth to track down a hacker, and goes on a road trip with a partner in order to arrive and put a stop to all of this, and everything feels harmless and mundane, well, alien v mech scene and gang up scene aside. For the longest time, there`s little sense of urgency or even threat. However, even with minor plotholes near the end, it was a decent road trip movie with, surprisingly no real antagonist until the last third of the film. Also, the pacing is a bit weird in places.CHARACTERS: 6/10OK, let`s get this out of the way. Angela, the main protagonist is a bit inconsistent, and whiny. Not to mention, she`s a total ass at times. Her development is a bit rushed and inconsistent as well. She isn`t a very good character overall. Dingo, on the other hand, is a decent character. He`s sarcastic, semi-philosophical, and has a thing for rock music. He`s a pretty cool guy. Also, he`s voiced by Steve Blum. Frontier Setter is an OK robot who just wants to go to space, and take some other interested people with him. He`s built up as this dangerous hacker, but to see him so light-hearted and harmless, is pretty interesting. The REAL antagonists are pretty lame and one-dimensional, and they kinda come out of nowhere.ART: 6/10The CG anime esque art style can work. Heck, RWBY, for the most part, uses it to great effect, especially season 2 onwards. Here, it looks stiff and clunky. Plus, Angela`s hair looks very plastic. The facial and mouth expressions leave a lot to be desired as well. However, the mechs look good, and have good CGI. Some of the character models don`t bug me nearly as much as Angela`s, and the obvious fanservice bits don`t really help. The fights look pretty good, as to be expected from a mech anime, especially one with a film budget. The 2-D bits, while not always integrated amazingly, can still look good at times, as well as the CGI. Also, the futuristic and cyber looking stuff shown occasionally, looks pretty good as well.SOUND: 6/10The techno music that permeates most of the OST is pretty forgettable, and slightly obnoxious at points. The ending theme, while OK, tries to give off this vibe that would say that you`ve just experienced a beautiful, climactic, and utterly satisfying journey, and it doesen`t work given how this movie both is, and feels. That one song Dingo sings is pretty alright. Otherwise, not a very notable soundtrack. The DUB on the other hand, is kinda good. Yes, the actress for Angela is a bit annoying, but her character is annoying, so meh, but Steve Blum as Dingo, is pretty great. Then again, this IS Steve Blum we`re talking about. Johnny Yong Bosch as Frontier Setter, also gives a good performance. One thing that was odd was when the characters would sing. They tended to use Japanese lyrics instead of trying to translate them, so they didn`t even dub those parts, instead, leaving the original Japanese performances. Overall, not a groundbreaking dub, but good none the less.ENJOYMENT: 5/10Yeah, I gotta be honest. This movie wasn`t very entertaining. Sure, the 2 mech fights where cool, but, philosophical questions and Dino aside, the movie didn`t really engage me. That`ll likely turn some people off. It`s not a slow burn movie either. There aren`t enough interesting moments with some dullness sprinkled in for that. It`s just a bit too dull, even with an interesting premise such as this, I wasn`t as entertained as I should`ve been given something like this. However, the mech fights were alright, and I still enjoyed much of Dingo`s presence.OVERALL: 5/10    RAW SCORE: 5.38/10I understand that this movie is rather dull at points, and that it didn`t really deliver on such an interesting premise. However, the fights were decent, and Dingo is an enjoyable, not gonna lie. Also, philosophy is always gonna grab my attention in an anime if used even remotely competently, albeit the usage here was a bit lacking. If you have 100 minutes to kill, and are looking for some Sci-fi mixed with road trip, this might have a chance of doing the job, but only if you're running out of decent Sci-fi movies. With all that said, I bid you adieu. an utter mess. Funnily enough, the man behind parts of Aldnoah.Zero was also a part of this movie; Expelled From Paradise. Well, enough rambling.

It is a good movie with a good story and one of the better quality animations as compared to other sci fic story animations and 3D animations.Just like many other reviews, it might contain spoilers and opinions about the movie after having watched it therefore this review is more suitable for people who had watched the movie or wanted to be spoilt. I would not talk too much about it's story summaries since it might had been said a lot of times...by other people in other reviews, so I will just try to keep it simple. Also, I would not make comparison to Gen Urobuchi's other works and just review on the movie itself.Generally the movie's idea and philosophy is about a robot AI becoming more human and humans becoming more robotic and more technologically dependant. It's also about alternate version world where people don't space travel and instead form a virtual world to live in it without their bodies, solving a lot of problems such as overpopulation and finite resources but depends heavily on their technology.Art: 9It is one of the few more successful 3D animations that would actually attract people with just the visuals. It is really nice to look at with advance and beautiful artstyle that seem more 2Dish just like watching a typical anime yet 3D but is not reality realistic looking, other similar animations show I can think of with similar features would be the animation karen senki, the walking dead game, rwby and maybe a bit similar to the movie appleseed ex machina, but be reminded that I am not a professional 3DCG animator so I am just comparing it through visual similarities. Also just like  many other animes that are similar in animation yet different in story, it is best not to judge a show's story on how it is animated.Sound, music: 8Really good, quite exciting variety range of background music and the characters also get to sing too. The post credit song is also nice to listen too.Characters: 8The character designs are beautiful and cute too, there would be times where you would not take your eyes off of Angela. The other characters' design was simple yet have very distinctive features for them that you would definitely not forget or confuse with other characters in other animes.The friendly robot AI Frontier Setter is one of my more favourite characters among the cast, it's cheerful, cute and friendly personality would make you wish that he was your friend.Other characters such as Dingo is more mature, humble, smart and perspective while Angela is more prideful, whiny, bratty but hardworking, self restraint and also more mature as compared to typical tsun girls.Aside that the characters did not have a well defined background story to develop for the viewers to know more about them, the characters themselves are actually quite developed that can give the viewers an understanding of what characters and personality they are.P.S. Also, how is Dingo a poor mannered and tolerance guy? It's funny that Angela called him that way, that guy is actually quite friendly, helpful and tolerating towards that egoistic girl.

I mean they already have cloning technology and also if he is an AI program why couldn't he copied himself then? That means that by doing so he can both stayed behind while also goes to space too. Also, can't he also asked for opinions from people on earth or people that have been archived? And even if a normal person wants to join the operation, how can he join it? Would it be very troublesome and dangerous too? If so it is not smart to ask the public to join if there is no proper way for the public to come anyway.Also they keep saying that they have unlimited potential, yet in the end, the truth is that they are still limited by their memories and processing powers.Enjoyment: 9One of the few animes that have similar vibes to watching animes like cowboy bebop, Suisei no Gargantia or even sci fic movies like appleseed, wonderful days. I actually enjoyed watching the movie all the way, every talk they had is an idea, a development and insight to it's world and story. Not a single moment is wasted.Overall: 9It is still an exciting, interesting and pleasing movie to watch in overall with a great story afterthought that I would recommend to other people. by other people in other reviews, so I will just try to keep it simple. Also, I would not make comparison to Gen Urobuchi's other works and just review on the movie itself.Generally the movie's idea and philosophy is about a robot AI becoming more human and humans becoming more robotic and more technologically dependant. It's also about alternate version world where people don't space travel and instead form a virtual world to live in it without their bodies, solving a lot of problems such as overpopulation and finite resources but depends heavily on their technology.Art: 9It is one of the few more successful 3D animations that would actually attract people with just the visuals. It is really nice to look at with advance and beautiful artstyle that seem more 2Dish just like watching a typical anime yet 3D but is not reality realistic looking, other similar animations show I can think of with similar features would be the animation karen senki, the walking dead game, rwby and maybe a bit similar to the movie appleseed ex machina, but be reminded that I am not a professional 3DCG animator so I am just comparing it through visual similarities.

Technology has advanced to such a point where the collective consciousness of humanity has been placed onto a space station orbiting the ruined Earth, after a destructive event renders most of it uninhabitable and desolate. Adults and children alike\'s DNA was examined and coded into a virtual world known as Deva- where they are immortal, suffer from no maladies, no war, no hunger- a true paradise with only their imagination restraining the infinite capabilities for the cyberized denizens.This paradise is not alone, however. Humans still...exist on the Earth- those left behind who did not have the ability or means to have their consciousness transported offworld. Being completely reliant on an in-universe version of the internet and computing abilities, Deva is then vulnerable to cyber attacks- which comes in the form of a strange request from one calling themselves the Frontier Setter- seeking humans to travel to the far reaches of the solar system in order to find a new home for humanity, leaving their digital paradise behind.Security agent Angela Ballzac (yes, someone had the bright idea to name a character ballsack... how this passed and made it into the movie is beyond me) is tasked with discovering the identity of this hacker, and is sent to Earth in a newly cloned human body with her consciousness. She meets up with Dingo, a suave, roguish man who also works with the security agency and together they find out that the ""threat"" posed by Frontier Setter is not exactly what it was made out to be.The story itself borrows heavily from the aforementioned Matrix movies, and with a healthy dose of Gen Urobuchi\'s flavor of existentialism- focusing on what really makes a human human in a world where AI can achieve sentience and a consciousness can be transformed into data. Like the Matrix, it also examines the question of whether humanity is really happy in an heavily regulated, artificial world of their construction, versus being in control of their own destiny in a world full of harsh realities, inequalities, and threats to continued existence. This idea is present throughout the story, and while there\'s not enough runtime to really flesh it out a lot aside from some comments and mentions, it does at least raise some interesting thoughts. Ultimately though, the plot really has no central antagonist and no one to really support or get into their struggle- it\'s almost purely an action fest with hints of a deeper thread that never thicken.The characters themselves, Angela and Dingo are fairly interesting, if a bit underdeveloped. Dingo is your Han Solo type rogue character who plays by his own rules but always gets the job done, and Angela is a bit of a spoiled brat who has to learn how the other half lives. As a trained security agent, she has experience with all manner of technology and weapons- including the use of large mechs. Interestingly enough for how stripperific her outfit is, Angela isn\'t overly sexualized (this even lampshaded with one of Dingo\'s comments), nor is she sidelined for being a female MC- which was refreshing. She wasn\'t turned into waifu bait and set aside for the other characters to run over, but instead takes an active role in the action and plot. Angela and Dingo have decent chemistry as characters, but thankfully there\'s no terrible tacked on romance to ruin anything the viewer might imagine between them.An an auditory note- Steve Blum is fantastic as Dingo, and Wendee Lee is at her best here as Angela- both veterans gave excellent performances. The animation itself is probably the best Toei has ever done, and maybe ever will do. It makes heavy use of 3D, but the framerate stays above that necessary 20fps for about 95% of the time, with just a handful of noticeable dips below. Not visually stunning as a film, but given Toei\'s track record with visual aesthetic... this ranks among their best!In conclusion, Expelled From Paradise has a few big ideas in it that are borrowed from series like The Matrix and Ghost in the Shell, but doesn\'t capitalize on them in the same way- they\'re merely ideas tossed out in breaks in the action, which is Paradise\'s second biggest flaw aside from not having a real antagonist. As far as being a shallow action flick, one can certainly do worse, but then again, there are better out there. exist on the Earth- those left behind who did not have the ability or means to have their consciousness transported offworld.

Unfortunately, the ending was kinda mediocre to me as it could've be more interesting if they can do it in another way. Therefore, it kinda disappointed me.By the way, I really love Angela Balzac's appearance, but not her...personality. Zarik is smart, but not my type though. personality.

I mean this film has a very serious tone but not even Dingo the witty side kick had anything good to say, in fact the whole script was monotonous and cliche. Along with boring, never ending periods of dialogue the sole reason why this movie was so tedious was because of the bitchy main protagonist Angela who again and again manages to piss everyone off except Dingo.Those seemingly minor problems set aside, I think this movie was fantastic as far as most other things are considered especially the...fighting scenes and sound track along with them. I can say I enjoyed watching Expelled From Paradise but to put my feelings for it shortly would be wasted potential. Swap out Angela with someone we would care about, and alter the script here and there and this movie well deserves a 8.What I got from watching Expelled From Paradise- Balzac is in fact a real last name- felt like I was watching a PS2 cut scene- fan service is real- there are in fact explosions in space fighting scenes and sound track along with them.

And even if it could be far better, it delivers.Let\'s start talking about the story. Do you know about that times when you made a very good job on school or at work, but your teacher/boss tells you that what you did it is not enough? That it needs further development? That explains perfectly, IMO what happens with the story of this anime. It has lot of wonderful themes, like its peculiar approach to ""what makes us human?"", but when it has to develop the interesting idea...it setted, the movie skips to another theme and let that unfinished. For example, near to the end of the film, some people who were sended by DEVA die, and I started to question myself, can that be considered murder if killing them now supposedly doesn\'t means their absolute death? Then with the female protagonist not being able to send back information to DEVA, If someone died phisically while being recorded on DEVA and couldn\'t sent the information back, this means that the one who died was a completely different person and you are just taking his memories? Are humans just the memories they had? Before even reflexing a little of what happened and exploring only a little of this, they just continue with the action. Besides even if it has interesting themes and ideas, the story itself, what happens, feels sometimes a little bit simplistic in excess, like an excuse for all the action scenes.Now after bashing it a little, I will go with the good points of the story. First of all, the dialogues are very well written, they feel pretty natural. The world-building is also very good. Besides, the characters are likeable and tell part of the story with their acts, thing I like a lot.Now, the animation, maybe the most controversial and dividing point when analyzing this show. Why? Because it is CGI. And everyone hates CGI, right? Let me tell you that if CGI is the future, when the time for the disappearence of 2D animation comes, if everything looks as good as Expelled From Paradise, I can survive. Japan is known for almost everything around the world except for having a good CG animation quality when talking about anime. And this movie was a great step forward to change that. It is true that the movement of the people often seems weird, and the faces, and the hair... Well, people in general seems weird done, but except that, it is a delight for the eyes (if you are used to CG, of course). The art direction was also awesome, I specially remember one image of the sky in the night, where among the stars, the spacial station can be seen. My only complain (I really don\'t know where to put this, here or in story, tho) would be some scenic decisions, like that scene where a shot is repeted 3 times for ""more dramatism"". Just... no, thanks.About the sound... It depends. The music used is decent and it is decently employed.Nothing out of this world, but also nothing to complain about. The SFX the same, they are better than the music, but still pretty normal. But then we reach the voice acting, and things change. I\'m not exagerating when saying that I consider Angela Balzac the best work made by Rie Kugimiya. Shinichiro Miki (Kaiki or Assassin voice) did also a awesome job as Ringo. Furthermore, EONIAN, the ending theme... This show is worth watching even for only hearing this.And finally the entertainment. Is it heavy to watch? Hell, no. It has tons of well made action scenes, some fanservice, funny moments... It has a good pace, maybe a little bit faster than it should, and it entertains from the very beggining to the end.As a final conclussion, give this show a try.

Weird, right?Apparently Gen Urobuchi wrote the script to this show, but it doesn't have any of his usual hallmarks of bodybagging the entire cast.This show has dialogue.The plot follows the main character of Angela Balzac, a security officer in the employ of whatever place she works for. Angela has gigantic breasts. They are probably the most well animated breasts I have seen as well. In a world concerned with jiggle physics, especially in video games, Angela's breasts are not given far too much bounce. In fact they're just about right. Why am I...mentioning this? It's because I definitely was not watching this show for the plot. Actually the joke is that you watch it for the plot, but I don't care.As part of her security job, Angela is tasked with leaving the virtual world that she lives in to go to earth. She's impatient in the genesis of a body for her to inhabit so she cuts the process short and ends up in the body of a 16-year-old version of herself. The show sort of makes it clear that she's older than that, however.I should be able to give this show a higher score as it explores themes of artificial intelligence, coexisting with AI and such, but the director instead chose to focus on puerile things. Instead, we're given plenty of shots of Angela's tits bouncing and sweeping camera angles that end up on Angela's crotch and camel toe. There are some top notch visuals in this show, but the director is a flat out idiot.The only other things that I'd like to note is the voice work. Steve Blum does his best to emulate his performace as Spike Spiegel again. Wendee Lee I kinda felt botched it as Angela. And then Johnny Yong Bosch gives his best Johnny Yong Bosch impression.This is a decent script that is botched by some questionable directing decisions.

Humans, after a great catastrophe, have digitized themselves into a virtual world where you never need food, never get tired, and enjoy pleasures beyond the human body. But, it isn't all perfect in paradise. A hacker has hacked into the system and is causing panic with messages asking people to leave the system on a grand adventure of the universe, when security agent Angela Balzac (enter chemistry joke here) is sent to investigate the source of the hack that is located somewhere on the now barren earth.The ReviewThis anime is...one that deals with the digital world idea in a very interesting way, but the highlight of the anime is its characters. I personally loved the way Angela interacted with her guide on earth, code named Dingo. Dingo is a free spirited care-free man, while Angela is a serious, cold, and kind of distant character. Ultimately though, the movie takes a lot of time to get to the more interesting parts in the story, which you will have to wait till about halfway through the movie to get to, but the build up is worth it when it finally gets around to the greater conflict. The movie never spares a moment to give you this pretty view of the better parts of humanity showing the little bit of society that is still on Earth. It's a movie worth viewing for yourself, but I do advise a little patience after the opening, it gets good trust me. one that deals with the digital world idea in a very interesting way, but the highlight of the anime is its characters.

Maybe everyone is more tolerant by then.Now then, from a reviewer who watched this movie in 2017, heres the updated review from an open minded person who isn\'t picky about shows or philosophical themes.==Story:No one likes to read long text, so i\'ll get straight to the point. It\'s WALL-E with deeper themes. Anyone remember WALL-E? Yeah. Basically, Earth got fucked and humanity retreated to a space-base called <DEVA>(pronounced:...Diva).One day, DEVA gets attacked by a transmission from Earth. Of course, everyone is living the chill life! Why would they return to the living hell that is Earth? With this in mind, everyone ignores the transmission and our MC, Anglela Balsac, tries to intercept the message and shut down the hacker, only to fail. She is then sent to <Command> and is given the task of going down to Earth and make sure the hacker doesn\'t try to, in more or less their own words: ""Access the DEVA illegally."".She is then sent down to Earth with her rendezvous partner, Dingo. Everything else is spoilers, watch the movie on your own.Well, the show has no deep themes, which MAL seems to really like for some reason. A show doesn\'t need to be deep to be a good movie. Call me a mindless sheep but this is what I really think. It has a clear message it tries to convey, and it did it\'s job perfectly. It has alot of things going for it, which is a good thing and a bad thing.For the things that it explores, it did it\'s job well.For the things that it doesn\'t explore, it\'s more or less up to viewer\'s imagination as to how life happens down on Earth. Alot of people might not be satisfied with this type of storytelling, but theres only so much you can do with a 1 hour 30 minutes timeslot.Basically, it\'s a simple story with simple themes and a simple message it tries to convey, and for that, I give it a A+. Humanity seems to be a touchy subject, but the movie doesn\'t try to make it sound complicated, because it really isn\'t. Whether you agree with my mindset or not is completely up to you, cause personally? I liked the movie. I really do.Art:I\'m going to be really honest: I only agreed to watch this show because the CGI used in this movie is literally my strike zone. This is Fire Emblem CGI and I love looking at it. Thanks to the use of 3DCG, the action scenes are great with lots of movement and impact with every strike, and the characters look really great. The environment is pleasing to look at and gives it some actual weight, rather than trying to imitate the 2D style. Some backgrounds are 2D, i\'ll admit, but it works really well so im not complaining.Sound:Not much to say, other than the sound being nothing but fuckin\' perfect. It works really well with every scene and I\'d be damned if someone tried to tell me that it\'s mediocre, because it isn\'t, simply because it isn\'t. This is my bias speaking, and i\'m defending it with pride.Character:The characters are simple. There\'s nothing complicated about them. Angela is a citizen of DEVA. Citizens of DEVA\'s health is being monitored by it and treated equally. Truely the free lifestyle they promised.Seeing her develop from this cold pampered citizen to a ""person"" with Humanity is really nice to look at, although some may argue that this is plot convenience talking.Dingo is our sidekick of this movie and is described as DEVA a ""A+ worker with a horrible personality"". He is just really friendly. As Minato Yuuki from PERSONA 3 would say: ""No sense of personal space"", but is really reliable at what he does. He argues that the ""freedom of living"" DEVA advertises is nothing but lies, since the system of society is the harshest level of ""He that does not work, will not eat."" Basically, anyone who doesn\'t contribute to society will not improve their living state. Although it is the same as it is on the real world, he says that living solely for others is no way to live.Although I agree with his thought process to an extent, I feel like I would collapse if I worked solely for this one higher power, rather than for myself, but I would also collapse if I lived only for myself, as I would be confused what to do. If DEVA only has this one lifestyle, then I\'d rather stay on Earth.Basically, I like how the characters think and I would 10/10 be friends with them.Enjoyment:For an action movie, enjoyment is inevitable. How they were directed however was nothing short of amazing, or as MAL likes to call it: Mediocre.I really like the interactions of Angela and Dingo. I feel like talking about the third person would be delving into spoiler territory, so I left him out. Don\'t worry, I like him as well. Seeing Angela try to cope with the flesh body with sickness and bad wind thanks to the lack of protection from the perfect situation of DEVA is really interesting and believable.Dingo isn\'t really the asshole DEVA advertises him to be, he\'s like this father figure. That\'s the best way I can describe it. He\'s a really relaxed low-tension person. People would call him a lazily written character, but if that is what he is supposed to be, then I don\'t really get the current idea of ""well-written"" anymore.Overall:Overall, this movie is a great watch. It does\'t leave you with alot of thoughts to ponder, since the show isn\'t supposed to do that. It\'s a high impact show with great music and alot of heart. I would watch this again if I had more friends to watch this with.I\'d recommend it. Diva).One day, DEVA gets attacked by a transmission from Earth. Of course, everyone is living the chill life! Why would they return to the living hell that is Earth? With this in mind, everyone ignores the transmission and our MC, Anglela Balsac, tries to intercept the message and shut down the hacker, only to fail. She is then sent to <Command> and is given the task of going down to Earth and make sure the hacker doesn\'t try to, in more or less their own words: ""Access the DEVA illegally."".She is then sent down to Earth with her rendezvous partner, Dingo. Everything else is spoilers, watch the movie on your own.Well, the show has no deep themes, which MAL seems to really like for some reason. A show doesn\'t need to be deep to be a good movie. Call me a mindless sheep but this is what I really think. It has a clear message it tries to convey, and it did it\'s job perfectly. It has alot of things going for it, which is a good thing and a bad thing.For the things that it explores, it did it\'s job well.For the things that it doesn\'t explore, it\'s more or less up to viewer\'s imagination as to how life happens down on Earth. Alot of people might not be satisfied with this type of storytelling, but theres only so much you can do with a 1 hour 30 minutes timeslot.Basically, it\'s a simple story with simple themes and a simple message it tries to convey, and for that, I give it a A+. Humanity seems to be a touchy subject, but the movie doesn\'t try to make it sound complicated, because it really isn\'t. Whether you agree with my mindset or not is completely up to you, cause personally? I liked the movie. I really do.Art:I\'m going to be really honest: I only agreed to watch this show because the CGI used in this movie is literally my strike zone. This is Fire Emblem CGI and I love looking at it. Thanks to the use of 3DCG, the action scenes are great with lots of movement and impact with every strike, and the characters look really great. The environment is pleasing to look at and gives it some actual weight, rather than trying to imitate the 2D style. Some backgrounds are 2D, i\'ll admit, but it works really well so im not complaining.Sound:Not much to say, other than the sound being nothing but fuckin\' perfect. It works really well with every scene and I\'d be damned if someone tried to tell me that it\'s mediocre, because it isn\'t, simply because it isn\'t. This is my bias speaking, and i\'m defending it with pride.Character:The characters are simple. There\'s nothing complicated about them. Angela is a citizen of DEVA. Citizens of DEVA\'s health is being monitored by it and treated equally. Truely the free lifestyle they promised.Seeing her develop from this cold pampered citizen to a ""person"" with Humanity is really nice to look at, although some may argue that this is plot convenience talking.Dingo is our sidekick of this movie and is described as DEVA a ""A+ worker with a horrible personality"". He is just really friendly. As Minato Yuuki from PERSONA 3 would say: ""No sense of personal space"", but is really reliable at what he does. He argues that the ""freedom of living"" DEVA advertises is nothing but lies, since the system of society is the harshest level of ""He that does not work, will not eat."" Basically, anyone who doesn\'t contribute to society will not improve their living state. Although it is the same as it is on the real world, he says that living solely for others is no way to live.Although I agree with his thought process to an extent, I feel like I would collapse if I worked solely for this one higher power, rather than for myself, but I would also collapse if I lived only for myself, as I would be confused what to do. If DEVA only has this one lifestyle, then I\'d rather stay on Earth.Basically, I like how the characters think and I would 10/10 be friends with them.Enjoyment:For an action movie, enjoyment is inevitable. How they were directed however was nothing short of amazing, or as MAL likes to call it: Mediocre.I really like the interactions of Angela and Dingo. I feel like talking about the third person would be delving into spoiler territory, so I left him out. Don\'t worry, I like him as well. Seeing Angela try to cope with the flesh body with sickness and bad wind thanks to the lack of protection from the perfect situation of DEVA is really interesting and believable.Dingo isn\'t really the asshole DEVA advertises him to be, he\'s like this father figure. That\'s the best way I can describe it. He\'s a really relaxed low-tension person. People would call him a lazily written character, but if that is what he is supposed to be, then I don\'t really get the current idea of ""well-written"" anymore.Overall:Overall, this movie is a great watch. It does\'t leave you with alot of thoughts to ponder, since the show isn\'t supposed to do that. It\'s a high impact show with great music and alot of heart. I would watch this again if I had more friends to watch this with.I\'d recommend it.', ""I just finished this today and it was amazing. Well, it was really confusing in the beginning but i didn't expect what will come. Good story , indeed.*StoryEspecially the story. i didn't expect to be this good. I guess it was a simple story from every apocalypse story. For unknown reason , the population of humanity has been removed into a paradise that's in the space and well, that paradise isn't truly a paradise but it was just a virtual world. Their body isn't real so they can live forever, i mean, not a flesh human body. just a virtual body. And someday , there...was a hacker that hacked that place. in the beginning i don't even know what was the hacker trying to do. it was just saying somthing like announcing something. And of course there was someone who fight that hacker, but that hacker got away safely. cause of that , she came to earth to search the hacker with her guide or partner named Kajiwara, Zarik. Anyway, Overall i really like the story, this is a really nice story to see but i admit it that there were some nudity scene. 8/10 By the way, the way they end the story was really nice. I really like the ending too.*AnimationHmm.... i don't really know much about animation thing , but just one thing that i can say after watching this anime. the animation looked 3D. Besides that , the character design was pretty good too, fitting to the personality and the action was really amazing!!!. i'm not a mecha fans but to be honest i really like the action. The way the mecha fight was just really amazing. i enjoy that. 9/10*SoundtrackPretty nice to hear. The Ed was nice too, pacing to the ending scene, love it. for the soundtrack in the show, i guess it was good enough. i don't really know , i was just felt like enjoyable. 8/10.*CharacterWell , nothing's wrong with the character i guess. It was unique too. For Angela Balzac , She is a former human too , i mean she was human before live in the paradise. Well , yeah , i can't say someone that can live forever as a human anymore. Her personalitty just like a person who didn't have their humanitty anymore. like she almost forgot how to be a human. cause she live happly in the paradise. well of course you will live happy in there, but that isn't a paradise , it is just a virtual world. But most of all her personalitty changed a little bit because she met her guide/partner on earth named Kajiwara, Zarik. He is a really funny man tbh. and because of him too , Angela understand how to become a human or understand what is human. I like that. the character was prettty unique but nothing more special than that , So 7/10 , Wait, i almost forgot my second favorite character, Frontier Setter He is a robot that hacked that paradise thing and that robot was really amusing. i like it , So 8/10.So Overall , from everything, it was really enjoyable. to be honest i really , really enjoy it , and i hope Toei Animation or whoever that made this anime, make another good anime like this again. And it doesn't have to be mecha. I really like this kind of story and animation tbh. 9/10Hope my review can be helpful to youSorry if my english isn't to good.Thanks :D was a hacker that hacked that place. in the beginning i don't even know what was the hacker trying to do. it was just saying somthing like announcing something.

Made by Gen Urobuchi, this story focus on another paradigm of society. The movie explores the meaning of humanity and personal reality. What is right, and what is wrong. What true freedom really is.[ Story | 7-8 ]The story by itself is intriguing. Humanity has left the Earth because some sort of apocalypse happened and most of the Earth was turned into a desert, making each day a survival test....Humanity had created an “Arc” in which they now live as digital entities. Their genetic code is converted into data after birth and they live in a Matrix-like society. Is this the paradise they are led to believe?Personally the story doesn’t have any break ground plot twists, more so it uses the story to transmit a critic, a message, a feeling. The irony of a human civilization that may have abandoned what makes us human, and ironically fallen into the past albeit they seem to think to be the future.[ Art | 7 ]The art style is based on 3DCGI. For me it was a surprise. I particularly don’t like CGI but I had to admit it was a good CGI, Budget CGI. The character designs are good, feel different, the environments looks great and vivid. The expressions are also very well made so I really couldn’t complain.[ Music | 7 ]I won’t say it’s bad but I don’t remember any particular songs on the OST that made me remember them. Of course, the actions scenes had some great music accompanying said action but there were also a couple of songs that were nice to hear. This, letting along the credits music that almost made me shed a tear with the punch line.[ Character | 7 ]As a 1h and 47m movie, there was not much room to much character development. We basically have 3 important characters but, don’t get me wrong, they are good characters. Each one of them has been given just enough personality to make them memorable. They question the reality they are facing and make decisions based on their own experiences and even giving some good speeches along the way.[ Enjoyment | 8 ]At the end, I left the movie with a smile on my face. It was a great experience that left me thinking about the meaning of life and what makes us human. How can humanity, ironically, deviate from the path they want to follow and may end up doing the contrary. How little but important ideas can be mitigated just to avoid seeing the light. How a dictatorial doctrine can be masked under the word “paradise”.For me it was an interesting topic to think about.[ Overall ]Once again, I enjoyed this movie. I don’t think you can have a bad time watching it, in fact, I hope you do and appreciate the real message it wants to transmit.

We can\'t take eyes off from the movie. In this sense, «Expelled from Paradise» didn\'t make my hands hot and sweat. But not all movies can be perfect. When you have a sweat in your hand while watching movie, you may be disappointed after ending. However, even a movie that you saw without any expectation might keep thinking about it later. For me, «Expelled from Paradise» was a latter one.Indeed, the story is simple...and easy to understand. That is all. Directing is passable, and apart from the sensational costumes of female characters(hentai or whatever), discriminative scenes are hard to find. I think it\'s a very ordinary SF movie. But everybody knows it, so I wanna talk to you some different ideas.I thought an expulsion from the Garden of Eden of Adam and Eve, in the sense of the original, while seeing the «Expelled from Paradise»(Paradise). Look at the picture drawn by Michelangelo below. (No. Exactly there\'s no picture, It was written in my blog) It\'s a horrible painting if you think about the symbol and appreciate it.Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden for the sin of eating the apple or something. In the Bible, Adam and Eve are losers, and mighty God who punishes them is the only winner. No, it would be correct to say that he is a transcendent rather than a winner. In this way, there is no winner in the movie. Rather, I saw only the desperate losers in my eyes.The dominator of the diva system, top of the hierarchy, is trapped in the brain-space and has no interest with whole universe, just in their own space. He always concentrate his attention to the elements that threaten the entire peace of Diva. For the same reason he ordered to Angela, to find the frontier setter who hacked the server. What a mess. Dingo and Angela decide to stay in a devastated world. In fact, Dingo was able to be ""sublimated"", but gave up it for freedom, and also Angela gave up because she had no place to go back. ""I want to know more about the world."" She said. Since the diva exists upon the earth, apparently, human being with his/her body is considered inferiorly. Even if it\'s your own will, living in a devastated world is never easy. Like Adam and Eve, Dingo and Angela have to live with their own hands. It is quite hard stuff.The setter who finally accomplished his own goal and left behind, might be a true ""winner"" in this story. However, the evaluation vary depending on whether you consider it to be \'human\' or simply artificial intelligence. In the process of studying rejoice, setter finds the concept of \'self\' and thinks, judges and communicates with himself. Humanity did not really help. So human beings are not evolved, indeed. Here we can think about Isaac Asimov\'s masterpiece, ""Childhood\'s End"". But in Paradise, settle is neither human being nor anti-human being. Paradise does not give a clear answer to this question. As long as the setter can\'t be defined, the story of Paradise is nothing than a loser\'s story. Loser makes his/her own space, whether it is nice or comfort.We like the story of the winners more than the story of the losers. Because it looks cool. Awesome. Be honest, we love the narrative that everything is well-done, feeling happy with it. Nevertheless, there is story about losers that continues knocking to my heart. I can\'t ignore the stories which are talking about losers, like The Catcher in the Rye. How strange it is. and easy to understand. That is all.

How strange it is.', ""Expelled from Paradise is rather straight-forward in its premise as it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where much of humanity has integrated itself into a virtual world and an agent named Angela is tasked with seeking out the whereabouts of a mysterious hacker who is hijacking the virtual world she is part of. Manifesting within reality in a living form, Angela is assisted by a normal human named Dingo to track the hacker's whereabouts, where her perceptions on living as a human become challenged throughout her mission as she interacts with Dingo and learns of the true motives of the hacker she is seeking...out.To a great extent, the movie dabbles into a number of common sci-fi and action anime tropes in exploring Angela's adventure. Elements such as a post-apocalyptic future, a seemingly utopian virtual world, giant mecha fights and a badass female officer are nothing new in anime, especially as said badass female officer is a busty and cute-looking tsundere voiced by Rie Kugemiya. In addition, the plot is rather simple in its developments as Expelled from Paradise mostly focuses on Dingo and Angela tracking the hacker's whereabouts, Angela adjusting to life having a living body and later coming to learn of things with the hacker that aren't as they would seem on the surface. The movie does offer some exploration of how one would define their existence as a human through the differing upbringings that Angela and Dingo have in their experiences of living via Angela's virtual life and Dingo living within the barren wastelands of Earth, as well as the flaws to the virtual life that Angela had perceived as a utopia. While these are decent elements to Expelled from Paradise, they are secondary to the movie's main plot of tracking down and confronting the hacker. It's not so much that I hate what this movie offers up for its premise, but rather that it doesn't really have anything new to offer that I may have already seen from past sci-fi titles hence making it largely typical fare for me.Visually, Expelled from Paradise milks the same 3DCG-type animation employed with Knights of Sidonia which makes use of a brighter color palette to depict the movie's more lighter mood. The animation rendering still gives character designs a plastic feel, though they have a wider range of facial expressions animated compared to Sidonia. While not as heavy on action as Sidonia, Paradise still has its moments of depicting gorgeously animated sequences at points in the movie's run such as Angela's virtual actions within her world and a large-scale mecha assault that Angela and Dingo have to fend off in the movie's finale.As it is, Expelled from Paradise is a decent time-killer with what what it offers up with its sci-fi premise. It does have some interesting ideas it explores with what defines being human, but largely follows typical storytelling tropes of sci-fi and action titles that make it offer nothing new in the grand scheme of things. out.To a great extent, the movie dabbles into a number of common sci-fi and action anime tropes in exploring Angela's adventure.

I honestly couldn\'t recall the story from memory. Most of the story is sidelined while we focus on the two protagonists.Characters:The film stars the protagonist whose most notable feature is her name, Balzac. At the beginning of the movie, the movie makes it *very* clear this character is underaged while showing her bare breasts (she\'s listed as 20 on the site, it\'s complicated). Kajiwara makes it clear her character design is made for a ""lolita look"". Balzac\'s personality consists of whining, complaining, and more whining while in her skimpy outfit....Boob giggles don\'t count as personality.The character Kajiwara has a dry personality as well but at least shows some human characteristics later on to not be complete robot.Animation:The animation consists mainly of 3D rendered animation with very brief shots animated in 2D (I recall two being used). The film attempts to grab the viewer\'s attention the best it can bit gratuitous fan service and the best animation at the beginning, but it\'s all downhill from there. To give the movie credit, the character models are at least decent, but it lacks any sort of personality to differentiate itself. Only two scenes actually impressed me in the entire movie, the rest was bland cinematography.Overall, the movie is a generic good vs evil. Nothing special.

Nothing special.', 'I think one of the biggest hurdles for people getting into this is that it\'s a 3D animated movie compared to a traditional 2D anime but that has never really bothered me so I finally decided to give it a try.The story isn\'t overly unique, think The Matrix mixed with Elysium. Humanity stretched Earth to its very limit with overpopulation and global warming, so much so numerous different plans were made for the continuation of mankind. One of these was a giant orbital space station where humans would be scanned onto a huge computer system and live in a virtual world. This however created a...cast system between these digital humans who see themselves as the next step in evolution, where they can experience anything they want in the virtual world whilst the humans on the surface are struggling to survive and get by.When the digital world is hacked by a connection relay on Earth, the elite ruling class on the space station send numerous agents down to Earth to track down the hacker. The agents are all young, attractive women in skimpy costumes, which is a bit odd. I wasn\'t sure if the movie was trying to make a message since the three ruling members of the digital world are men who gave themselves avatars resembling gods and they made their security forces all hot young women, but the movie reveals itself to not really be that clever.The main character Balzac is a likable enough character, a very cliched character who has never experienced ""real life"" and has to be shown what it is to be human by her actual human helper ""Dingo"" who is the best character in the movie. Balzac\'s story isn\'t overly complicated, to catch the hacker they have to go ""off-grid"" and disconnect from the space station entirely, leaving her with none of her advanced equipment or backup so she has to struggle to be human for a change. Her character is quite inconsistent though. When she\'s first introduced on the space station, she\'s calm, cool and seemingly quite reserved but when she goes on her mission she\'s very loud, easily flustered and whiny (which is weird since she says ""I do my job, I have never complained""). I then wasn\'t sure if this was because she purposefully made her body 16 so maybe her mentality was changed too but once again, I think the movie isn\'t that clever and instead it is just for blatant TNA which is pretty off-putting. For her also being made out to be a great agent and very intelligent, she is then repeatedly confused and caught off guard by numerous things that should have been blatantly obvious, like if the hacker can monitor all of the digital world, why does she think it\'d be a good idea to stay connected to it the entire time whilst hunting them?The mission is over pretty quickly, finding the hacker and having to deal with the knowledge that the digital world isn\'t all good because it also has a cast system where if you aren\'t useful, you get less ""memory"" allocated to you, meaning you can\'t do much as a digital avatar and even have worse models. The movie doesn\'t explain what being useful is though in a digital world where everything is provided for you. Balzac works because she\'s a security agent, but what\'s the point of security agents if the rulers have total control over everyone and can kill them instantly with just a thought? What does everyone else do? They\'re hardly builders or farmers or anything along those lines. So how is your ""worth"" determined?It might seem like I have a lot of complaints, but I did enjoy the movie as a character and action romp. If you actually think about the plot or the world, it doesn\'t make much sense at all.The ending in particular just felt weak. It is one of those anime where I could easily imagine you thinking ""Well, what was the point of this movie?"". It suffers from being a movie where a series could have paced it out better, giving it time to expand on its lore but with its run time, everything just feels crammed in to get the story out the door. cast system between these digital humans who see themselves as the next step in evolution, where they can experience anything they want in the virtual world whilst the humans on the surface are struggling to survive and get by.When the digital world is hacked by a connection relay on Earth, the elite ruling class on the space station send numerous agents down to Earth to track down the hacker. The agents are all young, attractive women in skimpy costumes, which is a bit odd. I wasn\'t sure if the movie was trying to make a message since the three ruling members of the digital world are men who gave themselves avatars resembling gods and they made their security forces all hot young women, but the movie reveals itself to not really be that clever.The main character Balzac is a likable enough character, a very cliched character who has never experienced ""real life"" and has to be shown what it is to be human by her actual human helper ""Dingo"" who is the best character in the movie. Balzac\'s story isn\'t overly complicated, to catch the hacker they have to go ""off-grid"" and disconnect from the space station entirely, leaving her with none of her advanced equipment or backup so she has to struggle to be human for a change. Her character is quite inconsistent though.

This film was primarily CGI. I didn\'t really notice if there were any traditionally drawn sections. So, CGI character models and backgrounds/environment. There weren\'t that many, or any, expansive shots showing off the nature/environment. There was a brief moment where the night sky was shown which looked pretty good as well as that moment when Angela saw the ""potential beauty"" of earth while high up in the atmosphere. Those two moments were pretty much the only impact-shots in the film. In fact, those were sorta nice...to look at. Only sorta. The overall art and detail was about above-average for a CGI film. The rendering didn\'t produce any clipping or the like. The style was non-realistic and more modern-anime style. The anatomy and proportions were fine. Angela had typical modern-anime proportions such as eye size and body figure.Animation: 7/10 This did pretty well for itself. I felt that this was satisfying enough action-wise. The movements were fluid enough and believable for the standards of a CGI. Motions like walking, running, and body language didn\'t seem off at all. There were a lot of flashy movements, especially during the action scenes. There weren\'t any montage sequences or use of cut-shots during action bits so that\'s a plus. I\'m giving this area a 7 for good because the action was good, plain and simple; this is tagged as an action, the action was good, thus this area is a 7 for good because all other aspects of animation didn\'t detract from the overall experience.Characters: 4/10 One-dimensional, copy-and-paste, and predictable. The characters were nothing new or had anything about them that would make them interesting. Angela is your typical copy-and-paste, busty, tsundere blondy. Dingo is your down-to-earth handsome wise-guy who\'s supposed to act as the foil and ""human-teacher"" to the MC, Angela. Honestly, the best character was Frontier Setter. Its character design was unconventional, a robot; he (she/it/whatever) had a cool hat and even eventually a guitar. Dingo\'s design was just normal clothes. Nothing really to talk about. Angela\'s design was just blatant pandering. For a superior society, did the digital society forget the concept of functionality? No way, absolutely no way, was Angela able to go toe-to-toe with those thugs in THOSE heels. Give me a break. Why does she need star-shaped hairpins? What\'s the point of that getup? Armor? Where was the functionality? Sigh, yes it was cool. Yes it was nice to look at from a guy\'s perspective, I won\'t lie there. But was there something lost in translation when the digital society was coming up with appropriate mission gear?Plot: 5/10 It was a bit predictable and nothing really surprised me in terms of what plot was introduced or came to be. There\'s a problem. The ""sheltered-type"" (I suppose that\'s what I just call it) goes to solve the problem as a representative of some super-cool and fancy institution. They get culture-shocked, red-pilled, whatever. Doubt. Realization. Going against their former beliefs. Crisis solved. Open-ended ending for the future.Development: 5/10 It was okay. The character development wasn\'t really there. Dingo wasn\'t given any real backstory and was just there as a supporting piece to Angela\'s cliche culture-shock development. Angela developed pretty much how I expected. She developed, but it wasn\'t too much added substance. Actually, Frontier Setter probably developed in a much more meaningful way than any of the two main MCs. lol. There wasn\'t really any world-building in this. Some terminology and how things came to be really weren\'t addressed. It\'s not too much a minus but it leaves the film really flat and nothing really beyond ""just a show of eye-candy.""Music: 6/10 Cool. I personally didn\'t find any of the music catchy or worth remembering. The battle bgm was spicy enough to make the battles exciting. The ED song was a good listen.Conclusion: 5/10 Average. This did us the courtesy of giving us a clean open-ended ending for the future. All the important questions were answered. It gave us a comic-relief and happy epilogue. Angela and Dingo live happily ever after...Dingo that bastard, getting to spend the rest of his life with a busty 16-year old tsudere. Wow! I\'m so jelly! It\'s...it\'s almost as if there were self-insert aspects to this film...wait did they make Dingo bland on purpose so that he would be easier to self-insert into? What!!!Overall: 6/10 This was fine. It wasn\'t average, it was above-average because it did well enough in the art, animation, and action departments to make up for the terrible everything-else. Again, this was fine. It wasn\'t average nor was it good. This succeeded as an action film for me, that\'s it. The mech designs were dope. to look at. Only sorta.

I think people watch a review online and base that as their assumption.The story, art, characters, are all likable and surprisingly well produced for being 3d generated.I personally believe that 3d modeling is an absolute haven of new frontiers for anime when executed right.This film does well in also showcasing it's talented story design. It begins slow and then begins to show depths into not just the main situation, but the characters themselves.I will always remember this film for its poetic theme about freedom and social slavery.The fight scenes were entertaining, the characters became...favorites, and the story was such a twist.

Click on my profile. Fight meh."", 'Nice anime. Not that it shines with art, music or a twisted plot. All these are of high quality, but not at all at an outstanding level. What makes ""Rakuen Tsuihou"" special is the presence of common sense in both the characters\' behavior and the development of the plot. It may not be possible to agree with all the ideas, but intellectually, this anime will not keep you gritting your teeth waiting for the end of the story. What also pleases are adequate, adult heroes who have reasonable motivations and behavior appropriate to situations. The ""incarnated"" heroine experiences all the unexpected effects of having a...body, including fatigue, illness, and the inability to cope with the three goons in the real world. Of course, it was not without exaggeration of her naivety, honesty, kawaii and the abuse of curvy forms with oppai swaying, but these exaggerations, perhaps, were designed to compensate for her negative features, outweighing them and arousing sympathy for the heroine, because otherwise she a self-centered careerist with views that would flinch even National Socialists. The hero, on the other hand, is quite a mature, calm and perceptive man, not a hysterical teenager. In general, the characters are quite sympathetic and cause empathy, the intimate narrative focuses on the development of their relationships and meaningful, not at all stupid dialogues. In terms of the plot, there are a couple of unexpected turns and an intrigue that does not disappear almost until the very end - what will the main heroine choose?As for the moral message of the anime, the raised issues, perhaps the problems of ""humanization"" and ""dehumanization"" are considered superficially in the Rakuen Tsuihou, but clearly deeper and more insightful than in other works with a similar theme. Even in a seemingly ""ideal world"" where there can be no problems with food, housing, money and other material goods, people still found something to envy and on that basis to destroy other people (""archive"" them). It shows a great deal of a fundamental, incorrigible flaw in human nature (""original sin"", as Christianity calls it) - no matter how ideal society you build, how you`d avoid competition for resources, there will always be such a resource (anything - strength, power, money, popularity, health, beauty, intelligence, space, skin color, tall height, short, big breasts, small, long legs, short, virtual avatar, or allocated memory), which will cause envy, competition, conflicts and, ultimately, poverty (in relation to this resource), oppression and deprivation of life of the ""unworthy"". Neither world peace, nor communism, nor capitalism, nor ""virtual heaven"" will help - by virtue of human nature, all the same problems will flourish, and most likely, they will multiply the more the more they are denied...Although this is not emphasized in the rather light narrative of the anime, ""Rakuen Tsuihou"" is a dystopia, where the ""virtual heaven"" became a hell ruled by self-proclaimed ""gods"" (in the form of which the elite of the pseudo-heaven is depicted) who established totalitarian control over the population of their world and turned it into slaves obsessed with competition for the resource of computing power. Correctly noticing the fatal flaw of humanity (original sin), the ineradicable incompleteness of human existence, the screenwriter, unfortunately, draws false conclusions from this, placing his hopes on artificial intelligence as a kind of perfect ""child of humanity"". However, for a non-Christian, the screenwriter is already perspicacious enough and unable to go further, except for creating an idol, but no longer from a man, but from an ""intelligent"" machine. To a Christian it should be clear that the only solution to the problem of mimetic desire, to use the terminology of Rene Girard, or original sin, is to look not to another person or object (idols), but to the one whose resources are not limited, like Him himself, to the one who possesses the fullness of being - to God. But, again, one cannot demand such philosophical and theological depth from Japanese anime. What is already depicted does not cause intellectual rejection and does not sin against common sense (except for the idealization of AI, of course).There are a couple of plot flaws, such as why it was necessary to go to battle, if it was possible to simply hack and turn off the enemy\'s machines (here logic suffers for the sake of entertainment), or what feelings digitized ""people"" may have if organs of these senses (not gauges of abstract units) are missing? I\'m not even talking about ignoring the problem of copying (not sending ""consciousness"" - but in this case all ""humanization"" of digitized ""people"" and empathy for the heroine would have disappear because of her countless copies) and interference in the ""consciousness"" of virtual ""people"". Ultimately, I believe, all ""consciousnesses"" would be ""hacked"" and ""dehumanized"" by the ruling elite to the level of machines, obedient performers - for the sake of the ""common good"", of course, the eradication of deviations and so on, but in fact - because it would be easier to rule and there would be no obstacles to this, like physical bodies. Or most likely the elite would begin to self-copy uncontrollably, gathering all the computing power for their copies and cutting out the rest of the ""programs"" so that they would not take up space until ""there will be only one left"" with an army of controlled copies. But in that case, there would be no one to make this anime about, which, for its atypical for Japanese thinking, pleasant, adequate characters and rationality, deserves 8.5 out of 10. body, including fatigue, illness, and the inability to cope with the three goons in the real world.

If you like something new and interesting then do watch.3D boobs>2D boobs. :DIf you like mechas then watch it. Actually don\'t know. This was my 1st mecha anime. (Not fan of big robots).Not an anime to watch half sleeping like most decent/good animes. It\'s not One Piece where you can half watch half not. (^_^)...It seems like this anime is love OR hate relationship for some reason. People with not so open minded, rated it low and people who can see more, rated higher. Get roasted who rated it low. :DI read reviews and it feels like some of them don\'t see bigger picture. (Mentioning more in spoiler section).The story might be little bit ""not smooth"" but it\'s because it\'s a movie and not a series. It should be more than 1h30min for people to like it even more. ~2h. Some spots were rushed it feels like.It\'s only 1h30min. Better watch this than some random streamer or some random youtube video. :  ^)+ Read the Ending for more info if you interested. Spoiler free.{I\'m here to make little bit fun of bad reviews while making a decent review. At the end I go harder if you interested. Read captions}.------Long review with spoilers------Story.It\'s Good.I really liked the idea of the story. What alot of people missed it seems. That DEVA and the Robot were basically the same. A code. The story idea is that Robot made by humans became more humane than people at DEVA. He had more human remarks and wanted to adventure. People at DEVA only survived and tryed to enjoy ""something/life"" (I copy paste this at the end too).For some reason people hate it. It\'s nothing special if you have watched tons of movies, animes and series. Probably have seen that story before once or twice. But it has it own qualities.Atleast this doesn\'t have revenge story like tons of other animes have. Getting kind of boring. Or Family complex to get theyr family member back and so on. (I don\'t know how those are so popular when they are made so many times).It has it\'s twist. Normally the main character would go with the robot and the guy but they stayed on the planet. Was a little surprise.How the world is presented. Little bit unique. Not having bodies and stuff. That\'s unique compared to other stuff what I have seen.But there isn\'t much to say. They didn\'t try to hide that this robot isn\'t bad and this DEVA is the ""Bad"" one. That was bummer.DEVA is just few people trying to control people and have power. Like in real life. But they have some more decency and trying to ""improve"" some ways human lives and despise lower class people or who fight against them. Like in real life.That\'s why the story is 9/10. Real life comparison pumps it up from 6/10 to 7/10. Being more unique . 7/10 to 8/10. And the idea of robot being basically the same like DEVA people. 8/10 to 9/10. If it had more time it could go 10/10. 3h something.They told the story well in that short period of time.ART.I truly believe 3D can be better and is better than 2D. It\'s aired in 2014. And even in 2020 animes can\'t do that well these 3D things like this anime did.Attack on Titan tried few times in the last season. Kind of cringe but I respect the effort.Ajin tried. Some hated some liked like me. Similar tier like this one.Why 3D better than 2D? If you perfect it. It can be more realistic and smoother or people like animes because they so unrealistic? Super big eyes super omega boobs? I don\'t but I\'m not a weeb so I can\'t answer that from anime people.They tried and they did really well. 2014. This is my 1st 3D anime movie or series what I have ever seen. (Not gonna mention meme what I have seen. That one was cancer).In 2021 it can be better for sure but not much because I haven\'t seen anybody even try.They scared. Trying milk these people from money and plasure the weebs.That\'s why it gets 10/10 and not lower because they tried. And this costs more.Watching this anime made me little sad that I didn\'t understand japanese and had to read subs and couldn\'t enjoy the boob bounces more and the art. :(Boobs 3D so much better than 2D.Sound.It\'s not good.If they made music part of the movie they shouldhave made a better one. I mean the song is decent. The main song. But space fighting songs and other fighting songs. 4/10. If even that.Some of the songs didn\'t fit at all.Sorry.I think all theyrs resources went on ART. They nailed it but sound.Voice acting was nice though. 7/10 and some parts 9/10.Some small detailes what there are. Hard to notice. I even clicked back to hear it again. I really liked. Respect to voice actors.Characters.There is basically only 3 or 4 characters?Robot and Chill dude carried it. Obviously but more info ahead. The main character wasn\'t that bad?Main character. The BallZacc.Stop making anime type characters? It felt like another some kind of type character. Don\'t know the names not a weeb.But later she gets better. First few 15 minutes? Super bad. Later she gets better.And why the heck she is 16 years old. This is so wrong.I\'m super tired watching teens/kids in animes already. Thankfully she was only young one. Almost. :D (I know she was older but the character was 16. That just kills boners for people who are over +20). That\'s just feels wrong.Other characters.The dude. Is nice. 9/10. Chill fella. :DRobot. Well made. 9/10. Reminded me Pino from Ergo Proxy.DEVA owners. 8,5/10. Quite accurated compared to real world. :D + The dude is quite accurate too. Robot is kind of new born and probably only seen nice people so this can be accurate too.Why it\'s 8/10 and not 7/10? Read the end. (Character developmen).Don\'t wanna copy paste.Enjoyment.I probably answered or gave my opinion on my previous text.Overall. 8/10Same story here. Read text above. Don\'t skip. (^_^)Nothing much to say.7/10 anime but gave it 8/10 because or the art and would like to give it 9/10 if the story was little bit better. It felt rushed like I have said before.Once piece story takes his sweet time. :D------For the people who rated this anime -5/10------The story is unique enough and truthful to the real world to give it above 5. If you don\'t rate/review animes only with emotions.Should respect the 3D art style what they tried and succeeded 75%.The small things and twitches is what makes us human. Those are hard to make and takes tons of time. + it was made in 2013 and aired 2014.No other anime have even tried to make 3D animes yet. They only tested and almost came close to this.CHRACTER DEVELOPMENT.Some said this anime doesn\'t have it. Like what anime you watched?The BallZack girl believed DEVA being super good and peak of humanity. And didn\'t like earth. But while she stayed at earth she kind of little bit started to like it. New experiences and stuff. Curious lady. You can even see a part where she eats noodles and the guy adds some sauce and she likes it even more.Later in the end. SHE COULD CHOOSE TO GO BACK IN SPACE WITH THE ROBOT LIKE BEFORE BUT SHE CHOSE EARTH. How that isn\'t a character development?She literally realized that people in DEVA were in a more strict cage. THE ENDING LITERALLY SAYS IT TOO. ""We have to make harsher or something rules"". We went too easy on our top notch defence people like BallZack.How people miss these things? I would say the movie ending shouldn\'t even say that because it\'s kind of obvious but it seems it\'s not. Even if the ending is there people still don\'t get it. xDRobot.Even robot developed. She learned ""Friendship"" and ""Regret"". And few key things to be human.AND He finally go accepted as part of human.What alot of people missed it seems.That DEVA and the Robot were basically the same. A code. The story idea is that Robot made by humans became more humane than people at DEVA. He had more human remarks and wanted to adventure. People at DEVA only survived and tryed to enjoy ""something/life"".------Ending-----Probably this anime got low ratings because of 3D art. They trying to make 3D art too early. It\'s like when dubstep came out the first songs. People hated them. But 1 year later. They loved it.I never liked anime culture/people here.Every anime has TYPE\'s of girls and guys. Like wuuuuut?Trying to please the viewers so hard because they only want one thing. Gullable.But probably not you if you read my full review. :  ^)Just hating. :DNice anime 8/10.After writing this reivew I might even pump it up to 9/10.Never seen 3D anime/series before. And that is quite well made.Make moreJujutsu no kaisen.Demon Slayer.Blue Exorcist..... The list goes on and it\'s long.Really bland story. Same story idea over and over.Super bad jokes. So bad that I can\'t even watch Steins;Gate. Ruined by horrifing jokes.But I guess anime developers/artists just wanna please weebs mostly. Or weebs like them. Or people who are new in anime and see these things first time what is fine too.Sorry. Sometimes I had too many things in my head to make a proper text. So sometimes it\'s little cluster like text. My bad. Tired when typed this.Thanks for reading and hopefully you liked it. If not then. Sorry?Don\'t wanna make this the longest review on this anime. (^_^) It seems like this anime is love OR hate relationship for some reason. People with not so open minded, rated it low and people who can see more, rated higher. Get roasted who rated it low. :DI read reviews and it feels like some of them don\'t see bigger picture. (Mentioning more in spoiler section).The story might be little bit ""not smooth"" but it\'s because it\'s a movie and not a series. It should be more than 1h30min for people to like it even more. ~2h. Some spots were rushed it feels like.It\'s only 1h30min. Better watch this than some random streamer or some random youtube video. :  ^)+ Read the Ending for more info if you interested. Spoiler free.{I\'m here to make little bit fun of bad reviews while making a decent review. At the end I go harder if you interested. Read captions}.------Long review with spoilers------Story.It\'s Good.I really liked the idea of the story. What alot of people missed it seems. That DEVA and the Robot were basically the same. A code. The story idea is that Robot made by humans became more humane than people at DEVA. He had more human remarks and wanted to adventure. People at DEVA only survived and tryed to enjoy ""something/life"" (I copy paste this at the end too).For some reason people hate it. It\'s nothing special if you have watched tons of movies, animes and series. Probably have seen that story before once or twice. But it has it own qualities.Atleast this doesn\'t have revenge story like tons of other animes have. Getting kind of boring. Or Family complex to get theyr family member back and so on. (I don\'t know how those are so popular when they are made so many times).It has it\'s twist. Normally the main character would go with the robot and the guy but they stayed on the planet. Was a little surprise.How the world is presented. Little bit unique. Not having bodies and stuff. That\'s unique compared to other stuff what I have seen.But there isn\'t much to say. They didn\'t try to hide that this robot isn\'t bad and this DEVA is the ""Bad"" one. That was bummer.DEVA is just few people trying to control people and have power. Like in real life. But they have some more decency and trying to ""improve"" some ways human lives and despise lower class people or who fight against them. Like in real life.That\'s why the story is 9/10. Real life comparison pumps it up from 6/10 to 7/10. Being more unique . 7/10 to 8/10. And the idea of robot being basically the same like DEVA people. 8/10 to 9/10. If it had more time it could go 10/10. 3h something.They told the story well in that short period of time.ART.I truly believe 3D can be better and is better than 2D. It\'s aired in 2014. And even in 2020 animes can\'t do that well these 3D things like this anime did.Attack on Titan tried few times in the last season. Kind of cringe but I respect the effort.Ajin tried. Some hated some liked like me. Similar tier like this one.Why 3D better than 2D? If you perfect it. It can be more realistic and smoother or people like animes because they so unrealistic? Super big eyes super omega boobs? I don\'t but I\'m not a weeb so I can\'t answer that from anime people.They tried and they did really well. 2014. This is my 1st 3D anime movie or series what I have ever seen. (Not gonna mention meme what I have seen. That one was cancer).In 2021 it can be better for sure but not much because I haven\'t seen anybody even try.They scared. Trying milk these people from money and plasure the weebs.That\'s why it gets 10/10 and not lower because they tried. And this costs more.Watching this anime made me little sad that I didn\'t understand japanese and had to read subs and couldn\'t enjoy the boob bounces more and the art. :(Boobs 3D so much better than 2D.Sound.It\'s not good.If they made music part of the movie they shouldhave made a better one. I mean the song is decent. The main song. But space fighting songs and other fighting songs. 4/10. If even that.Some of the songs didn\'t fit at all.Sorry.I think all theyrs resources went on ART. They nailed it but sound.Voice acting was nice though. 7/10 and some parts 9/10.Some small detailes what there are. Hard to notice. I even clicked back to hear it again. I really liked. Respect to voice actors.Characters.There is basically only 3 or 4 characters?Robot and Chill dude carried it. Obviously but more info ahead. The main character wasn\'t that bad?Main character. The BallZacc.Stop making anime type characters? It felt like another some kind of type character. Don\'t know the names not a weeb.But later she gets better. First few 15 minutes? Super bad. Later she gets better.And why the heck she is 16 years old. This is so wrong.I\'m super tired watching teens/kids in animes already. Thankfully she was only young one. Almost. :D (I know she was older but the character was 16. That just kills boners for people who are over +20). That\'s just feels wrong.Other characters.The dude. Is nice. 9/10. Chill fella. :DRobot. Well made. 9/10. Reminded me Pino from Ergo Proxy.DEVA owners. 8,5/10. Quite accurated compared to real world. :D + The dude is quite accurate too. Robot is kind of new born and probably only seen nice people so this can be accurate too.Why it\'s 8/10 and not 7/10? Read the end. (Character developmen).Don\'t wanna copy paste.Enjoyment.I probably answered or gave my opinion on my previous text.Overall. 8/10Same story here. Read text above. Don\'t skip. (^_^)Nothing much to say.7/10 anime but gave it 8/10 because or the art and would like to give it 9/10 if the story was little bit better. It felt rushed like I have said before.Once piece story takes his sweet time. :D------For the people who rated this anime -5/10------The story is unique enough and truthful to the real world to give it above 5. If you don\'t rate/review animes only with emotions.Should respect the 3D art style what they tried and succeeded 75%.The small things and twitches is what makes us human. Those are hard to make and takes tons of time. + it was made in 2013 and aired 2014.No other anime have even tried to make 3D animes yet. They only tested and almost came close to this.CHRACTER DEVELOPMENT.Some said this anime doesn\'t have it. Like what anime you watched?The BallZack girl believed DEVA being super good and peak of humanity. And didn\'t like earth. But while she stayed at earth she kind of little bit started to like it. New experiences and stuff. Curious lady. You can even see a part where she eats noodles and the guy adds some sauce and she likes it even more.Later in the end. SHE COULD CHOOSE TO GO BACK IN SPACE WITH THE ROBOT LIKE BEFORE BUT SHE CHOSE EARTH. How that isn\'t a character development?She literally realized that people in DEVA were in a more strict cage. THE ENDING LITERALLY SAYS IT TOO. ""We have to make harsher or something rules"". We went too easy on our top notch defence people like BallZack.How people miss these things? I would say the movie ending shouldn\'t even say that because it\'s kind of obvious but it seems it\'s not. Even if the ending is there people still don\'t get it. xDRobot.Even robot developed. She learned ""Friendship"" and ""Regret"". And few key things to be human.AND He finally go accepted as part of human.What alot of people missed it seems.That DEVA and the Robot were basically the same. A code. The story idea is that Robot made by humans became more humane than people at DEVA. He had more human remarks and wanted to adventure. People at DEVA only survived and tryed to enjoy ""something/life"".------Ending-----Probably this anime got low ratings because of 3D art. They trying to make 3D art too early.

Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38483/Ore_wo_Suki_nano_wa_Omae_dake_ka_yo,"[""[Spoiler Warning]I've finally found an anime that I can give a 1 to. Oresuki has great artwork, and decent fan service. However, I have never hated characters more than I have in this show. The MC is the most irredeemable protagonist I've ever seen as he allows himself to be walked all over, shows no backbone when things are against him, and shows no compassion to a person who is helping him out. We are given three female counterparts (as of episode 4) that are all just awful people that shouldn't be given the time of day. The childhood friend that abandons him over a...situation that legitimately makes no sense to be upset about, the smart, popular girl that does the same, and the secretly hot girl that tortures the guy the whole way through. His best friend is revealed to have the worst motives ever, and he still wants to be friends with our MC again. I find the story to be contrived, ridiculous, and completely implausible. I can't understand how this show has such a sizable, loving fanbase, but to each their own there. I'd rather watch Saekano any day of the week. situation that legitimately makes no sense to be upset about, the smart, popular girl that does the same, and the secretly hot girl that tortures the guy the whole way through.

This truly is the romance of the season.The main character Joro is basically the mix between Deku and Narancia. Joro is this nice and helpful little fella but of course when he snaps, he snap real hard. Sanshokuin Sumireko aka Pansy is the best girl of this show. She is really manipulative and very smart. Cosmos is the student council president who is very smart but gets flustered really easy, and whenever she is in an awkward position she starts talking like a samurai. Hinawa is Joros childhood friend. She is really into sports. She wants to be helpful but sometimes she...is not. Sun-Chan is Joros best friend who is the baseball teams captain and the first 3 episodes are based around him.It seems this anime is divided into 3 episode long arcs. So far we have had a friendship arc? (I don't know the actual name) Flower Dance arc I guess and two others but I cant figure out a name for themThe arcs: First we have the confession arc where the 3 girls tell their story to Joro how they want to become sun-Chans girlfriend and Joro helps them. It turns into a huge clusterfuck at the end. Flower dance arc: They need to practice for the flower dance but then a sneaky reporter stalks Joro and wants to release a news article of Joros harem. The arc ends with the dance. Then in the third arc we first hit the pool where Sun-Chan turns into a real bro. I think the arc is about one book that Pansy lent Joro but in the end the book kinda got trashed or something so Joro had to get work. Then We have the fourth and final arc. Where the gangs meeting place is gonna be shut down so they need help. Joro meets a new character who is like a Joro v2 and Pansys worst nightmare.Finally a harem RomCom with realistic characters and shit. I guess.Do I recommend this? Yes.

If you enjoy RomComs this is the perfect show for you"", 'Have you ever had one of those moments in life where you feel as if a miracle is about to happen to you but then suddenly ends up being disappointed beyond disbelief? Someone by the name of Joro sure did. Just when he thought his life would turn into a miracle, he gets asked by two beauties to help them win their loves. Now that’s a slap to the face and reminder that life sometimes just isn’t fair.Ore wo Suki Nano wa Omae Dake Ka Yo (Oresuki) may be a romantic comedy but loves to flirt with the idea of manipulation. It’s almost like a...real life version of a soap opera filled with drama but without the violence. Or is there? Physically, the show has limited amount of action unless you count Joro getting kicked or slapped on around on the occasions. But on a psychological level, Oresuki deals with manipulative love and drama that twists and turns until you see how deep the rabbit hole goes. Watching Oresuki has been a rather unusual but pleasant experience compared to some of the other rom-coms I’ve seen in recent years.In wasting no time, the first episode drops Joro into a drama angle with upperclassman Cosmos and Himawari. In a particular depressing incident, he finds out that both girls are in love with Taiyou Ooga (Sun-chan), his best friend and baseball club ace at school. What’s worse? Both girls wants him to help with their love problem. That’s only half the drama as we later learn that Pansy, a library girl at the same school, is actually in love with Joro himself. With this setup, Oresuki establishes a peculiar love story with Joro being forced to become a matchmaker. However, a twist reveals that Joro has a much more manipulative personality that he keeps hidden from others. Only Pansy is aware of his true personality and is why she is in love with him. Now you can imagine how this type of story may play out. It essentially becomes a labyrinth of mind games. Joro’s goal is live his life as a “Romantic Comedy Protagonist”. He invented his own character while masquerading as a typical protagonist with a gentle personality. It’s essentially what people call a “two-faced” person. Deep down, Joro has his own insecurities and often feels inferior to others around him. The reason he hides his true personality is often so that he can craft plans to make things go his way. Although some people see his role as an anti-hero with such a role, Joro is also fundamentally a decent person. He doesn’t truly try to harm others and show his true feelings when someone in his life is jeopardized. Does this type of protagonist appeal to you?This question can be answered if we take a look at how he develop relationships with the main cast. Starting with both Cosmos and Himawari, he reluctantly agrees to help them but also formulates plans of his own. Watching his moves carefully, the audience should take quickly why he interacts in his ways. Because let’s face it, Joro is actually quite a skilled actor who is able to change between his “nice guy” persona to his true nature very quickly and vice versa. On the other hand, both Cosmos and Himawari are dreadful liars. Their lies can easily be seen through by others and Cosmos even have absurd reactions whenever she gets nervous. Comparing their acting skills to Joro is like night and day. Joro’s goal of making his dream harem becomes a complicated plot for himself. Because Pansy is in love with his true personality, he has to accept such a fact despite still seeking to be the “romantic comedy protagonist” he hopes to be. Essentially, Joro becomes his own enemy and often times, his problems arises because of his own machinations. On individual levels, Cosmos and Himawari are clueless about his true visage. They still see him as an average classmate who doesn’t have a girlfriend but nonetheless, they spend time with him. But as the series progresses, they both seem to develop feelings of their own towards the boy. Is this perhaps true love? What happens is that love can change how people behave and in later portions of the show, it seems both characters show more affections towards Joro than they realize. On the other hand, Pansy constantly beats Joro at his own games. Whatever plans Joro crafts, she sees it through and actually makes him see his own mistakes. Between the two, they are the only pair in the show that doesn’t have a problem insulting each other. It’s a bit ironic since Pansy is in love with him and in a perfect world, couples are supposed to be loving with care. In Oresuki, we have this imperfect world where manipulation is part of the norm and almost everyone wants to be someone they’re not.While the series has its own antagonists, I believe the true enemy is human nature itself. As a skilled actor, Joro has his own human faults that he even realizes. In fact, every character in the show has flaws in some way or form. However, I don’t want to throw everyone under the bus. There’s characters who learn from their mistakes such as the case of Sun-chan. Even supporting characters such as Asunaro realizes the trouble she caused when manipulating others as a member of the newspaper club. Joro himself even realizes that he has to face with consequences in life. It’s in human nature that people commit sins and the show teaches about how characters needs to learn from their actions. The only character that seems immune to corruption is Pansy. Her position in the show is unique in that she is the one who can see through others, in particular their lies. When the show finished airing, I find that Pansy is perhaps the most real character in the show for not only her observation skills but also being a life coach to others. Someone such as Joro could learn a lot from her.Watching Oresuki may feel like an anime dosed with heavy amounts of drama. Every episode keeps the adrenaline going and there doesn’t seem to be a stop in the momentum. However, you have to remember that it’s also a romantic comedy. There are certainly a lot of comedic moments too such even including the physical aspects of the show. Whenever Joro gets hit, it’s portrayed comically. Many of his character reactions is often over exaggerated, almost like he’s acting. The anime also loves to throw in running gags associated with Joro’s matchmaker role and even occasionally moments of the fourth wall breaking. So take a breather and relax. Oresuki isn’t just a show with every square inch filled with drama.As a 1-cour show of 12 episodes, it seems Oresuki was able to fundamentally get the audience to know what the show is. Divided into arcs, the plot is formulated with mind games but I do wonder how much the producers really wanted to be animated. The light novels continues the drama so as it’s up management to decide if they want to animate more of the series. To my delight, Connect managed to make the characters look sharp similar to their manga designs. Every female character in the show stands out and is portrayed with feminine features and beauty. Cosmos and Himawari are prime examples of this as they have an attractive valley girl look. While Pansy normally looks plain with braids and glasses, her true appearance is that of a beautiful girl endowed with attractive appeal. Even supporting characters such as Sasanqua has their own appeal when they show their true appearance. All this is contrast to Joro, who is portrayed as normally as possible on the outside. However, the character expressions he shows in secret is a different story.As an anime with heavy amount of dialogues, I do commend on the voice actors on taking on their roles as dominantly as possible. This is especially true for Joro and Pansy, two voices who speak lines that often clashes against each other. Their character interactions is the most noticeable because Pansy knows the real Joro. Other times, Joro’s inner dialogues with himself speaks as his real character. On other technical standards, Oresuki’s theme songs adapts a more lighthearted tone with flashy images of character expressions.Oresuki is kind of like a taking a multiple choice test where you have to figure out what’s real and what’s not. The idea of manipulative characters in romantic comedies isn’t entirely new. But for Oresuki, this anime took it on a whole new level with Joro at the center. This is type of rom-com that will keep you at the edge of your seat to see what will happen with each progressing episode. And by the time it’s over, you won’t feel like a loser beyond disbelief. real life version of a soap opera filled with drama but without the violence. Or is there?

Some are too boring to be watched, and almost all follow the same paradigm and setting: a guy and a group of girls creating a triangle, polygon, or any weird romance configuration. I thought the same when I started reading the novel, and you will feel the same when you watch the first episode. However, Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo is not the casual harem or romantic comedy. It was a surprise for me and it will be a surprise for any fan that loves this kind of genre or wants to...start with it.  Furthermore, I am sure you will watch it for Pansy, and I don't blame you. In my case, I am like her in several aspects, and I feel very related to her; so far, she is the best seasonal character.The story is hilarious and is very different from the casual harem because the girls did not declare their love to Kisaragi, they declared that they loved his best friend and asked for help. During all that mess, he finds that a girl, the librarian,  Sumireko loves him. However, he considers that Sumeriko (aka Pansy) is ugly, mad, and weird, so he tries to avoid her.The most exciting part of this show is the story twists, how Kisaragi reacts to those situations, and how Pansy deals with everything. Furthermore, the story has good pacing and a good outcome. The changes and the character's development will keep us entertained, and they will be fun to watch in some aspects. For example, Kisaragi has a double personality, he tries to be the good one, but in the end, he is a sick liar with a repulsive personality and Pansy, the weird girl. From several angles, she could be a cold, evil, mentally unhealthy, calculator, but she hides several aspects of her personality and her looking. I consider Pansy adorable in several ways, but maybe I am biased because I feel very related to her, and because I know what is going to happen after. Finally, both complement each other and that is a plus.On the other hand, one of the aspects that concern most of the fans is that the show could turn into the typical harem. I want to say, they are following the novel, and in some parts, the story feels in that way. However, I do not think that would be a reason to drop the series. Also, not all the source material will be adapted because it has twelve volumes and it stills publishing.The art and sound are acceptable. After watching four episodes, I can say that the story has a lovely palette and a great direction from frame to frame. I know there are some ugly frames but understand, it is a comedy, the important here is the pacing, camera angles, and the frame movement and it is acceptable. The OP and ED are good, and the lyrics reflect part of the story. I like the OP more because it has a better rhythm.Finally, I am enjoying the anime so far. No idea if I will keep the same score, but the first episodes are delightful and too funny that keep me entertained. I am sure you will feel in the same way. You should give a try to this series. start with it.  Furthermore, I am sure you will watch it for Pansy, and I don't blame you.

It\'s repulsive and abhorring, and I question the sanity of the editors and directors that allowed this ""thing"" to get past publishing and onto an anime streaming service.Characters:The concept of a ""self-insert"" character in shounen anime is prevalent throughout all types of literature...and manga, almost exclusively for the harem genre. The trope goes a certain way: We have an almost-perfect, simply designed MC that manages to build up a harem using his strength and bland personality.Now, don\'t get me wrong - there isn\'t anything wrong with this trope. If anything, it\'s enjoyable, and I can name many other shows that have executed this trope well, including: Sword Art Online, Rakudai Kishi no Calvary, The Irregular at Magic High School, among many others.The opposite of a ""self-insert"" character would be a highly dramatized character, in which the viewer perceives the MC make personality-unique decisions, struggle with moral values, and most of all - make mistakes. Some examples of these would be Kaneki Ken of Tokyo Ghoul, Kira of Death Note, or Subaru, from Re:Zero.Something that will NEVER work, however, is mixing these two tropes together - that of both a self-insert (a character with weak personality) and a dramatized character (one with a detailed, realistic personality).And this, my friends, is what the author and director have regurgitated on-screen.There is a constant struggle between self-insert and dramatized characteristics; we can see the MC sacrifice his time and dignity to help his childhood friend; we can see him attempt to make-up with the friend that betrayed him; we can see him surrender to the quiet girl in the library, and decide to spend time with her. These would be self-insert characteristics, or the ""ideal"" character for self-projection.And then, we have his ""dark side"" or ""true character.""How idiotic.He can call his childhood friend a bitch for hugging him, he calls the girl that likes him an ""ugly cow"" and demands that she take out her tits in exchange for eating lunch with him, he actively takes advantage of girls\' feelings while at the same time feeling nothing for them. These would, through choices made that differ from the average viewer, suggest that a character has a strong personality -But the concoction that unfolds on screen is spine-chillingly bad. We have unredeemable plot lines, ridiculous dialogue, cringy interactions, times where you cannot bear to watch the screen - and most of all, times where you wonder, ""How did this become an anime?"" Everything, absolutely everything is inconsistent; it\'s terrible; it\'s unwatchable;And the SIDE CHARACTERS? Don\'t get me started.Brain-dead, main girl archetype with glasses and braids - but is a secret beauty:  Her character is executed decently well; she acts as she should and her personality is consistent; she schemes, plots, and betrays. Her endless, unconditional love for the MC, however, feels forced, absurd, and uncomfortable.Baseball player:  Is supposed to represent the classic shounen MC - but also, out of nowhere, possesses a secret, hidden ""dark side"" all for the sake of plot - how cheap and unimaginative.Childhood friend:  Fanservice character. I can\'t critique her.Student Council President: Also a fanservice character.The inconsistent personalities on-screen have both a lack of personality and a lack of redeemable qualities. If it was a self-insert anime, I\'d watch it with a grain of salt, only for the sake of enjoyment - if it was a dramatized anime, I\'d watch it for the in-depth characters. But this? This hybrid, unnatural mixture of inconsistent personalities and unoriginal drama? It\'s genuinely disgusting and insulting.Plot:Now, the fundamental plot - the ""origin story,"" if you will, or if you\'re a nerd, ""exposition"" - Is DEFINITELY unique. It\'s a funny, hilarious, new twist on the classic harem genre. The first episode fell off a bit at the end, but ultimately, the plot was original and interesting.The execution, however?Abhorring.The plot SHOULD HAVE gone like this:The two girls confess that they love the MC\'s best friend.The MC\'s best friend loves a different girl (The girl in the library).A slow-burn romance, slice-of-life begins, as we watch the funny interactions between the four characters, as they all try to capture the others\' attention and compete with one another.Little do the girls know, however, that while they are attempting to get the Baseball character\'s attention, they have actually fallen hard for the MC.The MC succeeds in hooking the girls up with his friend, but they have actually fallen in love with him.He decides between the three girls.That would be a normal, 12-13 episode plot. Maybe if some sort of extension was added, like a new girl or new plotline, it could be stretched out to 24 episodes.Now, let\'s see what this delusional author did.The two girls confess that they love the MC\'s best friend.The MC\'s best friend loves a different girl (The girl in the library).WITHIN {{{ F O U R }}} EPISODES, THE CLIMAX OF THE STORY IS SOLD SHORT WITH AN ABSOLUTELY IDIOTIC, NONSENSICAL SCENE WITHIN THE LIBRARY, WHERE RANDOM CHARACTER TRAITS ARE SUDDENLY REGURGITATED ON SCREEN FOR THE SAKE OF PLOT, A CRINGY, AWKWARD YELLING SCENE IS SHOWN, AND ABSOLUTELY ZERO CHANGE OCCURS BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS - BECAUSE THE EPISODE AFTER, THEY ALL MAKE UP IMMEDIATELY.ARE YOU SEVEN YEARS OLD?How idiotic.

Hid under thick clothing, something maybe more “ambitious” than you have originally thought - not just the story.With its clickbait title, cliche-filled comedy with easily replicable character traits, I initially thought this would be another Saiki Kusuo-like anime, aiming to create comedy through messing with cliches. Notwithstanding its over-dramatic reactions and, though sorry to say, unsatisfactory animation quality, I quickly despised this anime and put on my coloured glasses. Driven by outrage inflicted by yet another wave of cliche in...the first episode, I wrote around 400 words of unreserved criticisms, denominating it as another failed attempt to replicate Saiki Kusuo.Time has proved me wrong. Totally wrong. As the plot moves on, the initial ""female mains"", namely the childhood friend and the student council president become exponentially less significant, serving as mere plot devices. Speaking of plot devices, the writer cleverly utilized the baseball match as one. After viewing the first three episodes, I feel like the dots have all come together, and start to type on my keyboard in a state of confusion and amazement. How well-hid are the hints!Another point worth noting is the clever contrast between the seemingly innocent and the deceitful. Coming into the show, we all know that Kisaragi is a doubled-faced beta male striving to become a chad, who hides his true colours in hopes of getting some love from girls. His envy would be his best friend, who is a baseball chad who unintentionally took away all his crushes. The only one remains for the loser is a leftover girl from the library. Plot twist, Kisaragi is the one least prepared for such mind games compared to chad and leftover. He is all along a foil to hide the true mastery of the two; a sheer puppet on strings - quite like the viewers themselves, and myself too. We have been tricked, we have been backstabbed and we have been quite possibly, bamboozled.Judging by the first 3 episodes, its greatest downfall would be the animation quality. Not only often do we see the characters are drawn disgracefully, but also the background and the facial expressions. It is such a disgrace to have this well-written plot spoiled by such poor animation. As for music, I think it\'s fine. Nothing too noteworthy in particular, nor anything to criticise on.I guess you learn a life lesson every day - even when we are watching an anime - never judge a book by its cover.

Originality is not just mocking a common trope or cliche, but also the ability to disguise it and present it as a work that stands on its own. If you\'re content with the common female character tropes that have been going along for quite a long time now, then this show will be just fine. If you\'re looking for some fanservice or cute girls to look at, then this show will be just fine. In my opinion, when this show presented itself as a jab to cookie cutter...romcom tropes, it raised my expectations. Unfortunately, my hopes were shattered, swept up, and poured into a dumpster fire that is this Oresuki as I fight the urge to visit my home therapist Clorox for a cleansing of my eyes and ears.Story (2): Guy in high school tries to ""manipulate"" his life to set up a typical romcom scenario. Okay, seems cool. However, I\'ve seen kiddie pools with more depth and less shit in them than the writing and dialogue of this show. The thing is though, the main plot of the show isn\'t really about the protagonist being clever or attempting to make things go his way. It\'s simply the type of romcom that tries very hard to mock, with your stale perpetual self cock-blocking main character in a powerless situation of a bunch of hollow cookie-cutter girls fighting over him. Imagine a girl becoming attracted to a guy because the guy is a good friend to *others*. Sorry, John Green, but we\'ve got a better tear-jerker than The Fault in Our Stars. This story will make you cry when you realize that a studio decided that this was the one and invested a million or two into airing this show.Art (6): The saving grace of this show is the artwork. Nothing special, but nothing to be impressed about either. Again, if you\'re into fanservice then you\'ll appreciate it much more than I will.Sound (2): I do not know why but something about the characters\' voices get to me.  It feels like I\'m listening to a kindergarten teacher as it lacks any subtlety or sense of naturalness to it.Character (1): The protagonist is spineless. The side characters are bland and have the social awareness comparable to the baked potato I had for dinner tonight, difference being the potato actually had flavor to it.Enjoyment (2): Overall, this show was incredibly difficult to watch. It has no sense of direction other than ""basic romcoms haha, amirite?"" I would say if you want to watch actual progression in a somewhat realistic scenario, avoid this at all costs. romcom tropes, it raised my expectations.

I don\'t have any particular problem with those. Then, now i watching this too, Oresuki. Is Oresuki worth to watch? Lets read my review.Story: 3/10...What the fuck is going on?! (turn on some sfx meme)The author seems to mixing this show with drama and comedy but fail to mix that.How can those drama easily resolved with only a single minutes? MC lucky?How can such a bastard character who against the MC suddenly came to friendly with MC without any awkward feeling? Even the MC falling in love with his enemy so he is turned into gay dude.How can this school have a tradition that a guy dancing with 3 girls? any acceptable reason for this?And also why all female cast easily falling in love with MC without any some sweet flashback story?Art: 9/10Looks decent for me, just expected for Connect. I always love their pretty art.Sound: 5/10Those sfx doesn\'t really suit. It\'s too overly dramatic to me. Also, why the hell Joro\'s Mother sounded like loli instead her face kinda like your 40\'s age mother.  But, still i love Tomatsu Haruka doing her role as Sanshokuin Sumireko (Pansy). I love her sadistic sound, very suit to her as Pansy.Character:1/10Pathetic! and bit confusing.How can the MC curse his childhood friend as bitch but in a single minutes they wants to befriend again without any awkward moment later?How can such a bastard character then suddenly have a good term with MC without any acceptable reason?Am I the only one who confuse here? please click ""I found this review helpful"" button if you agree with me.Enjoyment: (5/10)For its 3 first episode i found this really amusing for me. But later, i didn\'t get any idea how to react this show. Will i laugh? Will i cry? Will i angry?FYI, I write this review while doing facepalm.

Going into this series blind and having watched the first episode(ep) that title carried a lot of meaning, set expectations for the direction this series would take and most importantly established a framework for the story. This held true until around ep 5 where this idea would completely collapsed leading into a terribly generic and disappointing ep 6. After watching the first 4 eps keeping the title in mind, it is obviously begging the question of whether ""the stalker"" is really the only one who truly loves him. Ep 5 easily answers that question with a...simple no, is there an issue with this? Not particularly but it makes me wonder why the pretentious title? At the end of the day it is nothing more than bait and is completely misleading. That is the reason why I find this series to be poor, it begins by poking fun at generic rom-com characters like the childhood friend and the beautiful president. Yet it falls into the same generic plot after 5 eps, it went from a jokey ""what if"" I got this harem like I imagined and schemed for to a, I do get this harem but like every other MC in a rom-com do absolutely nothing.This naturally leads into the story and characters. Again it tries not to be generic and pokes fun at the genre yet ironically the story and characters are generic. The kind touchy childhood friend and the shy president\'s only twist is that they have no romantic feelings for the MC for 4 eps. Naturally past this ep 4 they do suddenly like him disregarding how he schemed to make a harem out of them. How he schemed to make them fall in love with him and how he wanted to keep one of them when the other went out with his best friend. So like the generic tropes they are, they like the MC because he is a nice guy forgetting all about how he tried to manipulate them for the sake of the story. The MC himself past ep 4 never tries to scheme or manipulate anyone again, he is the nice guy he always ""pretended"" to be but in reality that was always him. The author essentially killed any brains he had in the first 4 eps, leaving him at the mercy of his harem which he gloated about in the first few eps. This naturally turns him into a generic MC. It honestly makes you wonder why when he wanted a harem and he gets one which he is fully aware of because the president kisses his cheek he does nothing. It is genuinely annoying and frustrating to see the MC go on and on about Pansy at the baseball game been attractive and him stealing look at her to have that same girl confess and have him do absolutely nothing(On-top of the fact he fascinated about her in his harem in her underwear lol).All of the mentioned above just makes this story, characters and my overall enjoyment disappointing. This series would have been a 5, just another rom-com but it had the audacity to use such a misleading title. On-top of this is it poked fun at the generic tropes of its genre and later gladly walked down the beaten path which makes it worse in my opinion. With my short time with the manga, the adaptation was true to the source so it can\'t be faulted. In terms of what is good about this show, the art is fair. simple no, is there an issue with this? Not particularly but it makes me wonder why the pretentious title? At the end of the day it is nothing more than bait and is completely misleading.

How he schemed to make them fall in love with him and how he wanted to keep one of them when the other went out with his best friend. So like the generic tropes they are, they like the MC because he is a nice guy forgetting all about how he tried to manipulate them for the sake of the story. The MC himself past ep 4 never tries to scheme or manipulate anyone again, he is the nice guy he always ""pretended"" to be but in reality that was always him. The author essentially killed any brains he had in the first 4 eps, leaving him at the mercy of his harem which he gloated about in the first few eps. This naturally turns him into a generic MC. It honestly makes you wonder why when he wanted a harem and he gets one which he is fully aware of because the president kisses his cheek he does nothing. It is genuinely annoying and frustrating to see the MC go on and on about Pansy at the baseball game been attractive and him stealing look at her to have that same girl confess and have him do absolutely nothing(On-top of the fact he fascinated about her in his harem in her underwear lol).All of the mentioned above just makes this story, characters and my overall enjoyment disappointing. This series would have been a 5, just another rom-com but it had the audacity to use such a misleading title. On-top of this is it poked fun at the generic tropes of its genre and later gladly walked down the beaten path which makes it worse in my opinion. With my short time with the manga, the adaptation was true to the source so it can\'t be faulted. In terms of what is good about this show, the art is fair.', 'This show took one of the biggest nosedives in quality that I\'ve ever experienced in any media. The first 3 episodes were really fun and entertaining. I loved the constant 4th wall breaks by the main character, the jokes surrounding ""bench-kun""were hilarious, it was a romcom with an interesting premise that imo was building up to be something comparable to in the best of cases Oregairu. And oh boi was I wrong because this became a painfully generic harem after that.After the first 3 eps, the show kept introducing more and more girls instead of making the viewers care about the already existing girls...by giving them any bit of characterization more than just being magically attracted to Joro. And of course like in any harem, almost all the girls the show introduces are immediately in love with the mc for some reason. I like my fair share of harems so that wouldn\'t a problem if I could care about any of these characters but I don\'t and most of them are really annoying.The animation was nothing special and the art while it wasn\'t horrible, it was mediocre as there were characters that looked very much identical but with different eyes and hair color. Don\'t have anything to say about the sound.Lastly I want to talk a little about the mc Joro. I found him to be such a bad character, he\'s a f***ing idiot with an inconsistent personality. He\'s mostly your typical dense harem protagonist, but he can also be a character with sass and kind of a douche bag but not really which is a type of character I like (example: Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai), and he can also be an actual douche bag on other times. I do like some of his monologues and his 4th wall breaks but yet I despise all of his actions and all of the decisions he makes.The only reason I don\'t give this show a 1/10 is because of those first 3 eps and there\'s a tiny amount of things that I enjoyed like the 4th wall breaks like I already mentioned. I\'d say definitely skip this show, is just a subpar harem. If you want a good romcom from this year then watch Kaguya-Sama Love is War. If you want a harem from this year then watch 5-toubun no Hanayome. by giving them any bit of characterization more than just being magically attracted to Joro.

However, one of these being true does not negate the other, and both are layers of the show’s narrative.Oresuki is a show that is about subtext and layered narratives. Basically every character in the show lies about what motivates their...actions at one point or another, and this is made extremely clear from the very beginning. In doing this, Oresuki is tasking the viewer to try to discern where their real intentions lay. Rather than the text itself, Oresuki prompts the audience to read the subtext.However, treating subtext as text does not erase the original text. As a better show once said, “People have several faces… and they’re all real.” Oresuki adopts a Kantian philosophy where the morality of an action can only be judged based on the intention behind it, and in doing so, it ignores the action itself. At one point, Joro is chastised for doing a good deed, because his motivations are deemed to be selfish. If one is committed to the idea that subtext is the only thing that’s real, then everything else must be fake.In training the audience to only read subtext, Oresuki demonstrates how dangerous this perspective can be. After the first few arcs, the viewer becomes unable to judge a good deed for itself. There was one character who ended up being completely benevolent in their actions, but I still was convinced that they couldn’t be trusted long after they were introduced. If all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.With all of that said, I do think that the ideology of Oresuki is usually on the right track. Joro loses all of his friends as a result of his scheming in the first arc, and though he tries to scheme to regain them at first, he is only successful when he ultimately drops all façade and tells them directly that he wants to be friends again. There are no shortcuts or cheat codes when it comes to relationships, and if you want something real, then it has to start with you.I get the sense that Rakuda said everything they wanted to say in the first volume of the series, and didn’t really know how to follow it up. To a certain extent, Joro keeps making the same mistakes over and over again, although I’ll charitably read that as understanding that it would be difficult for a misanthrope like him to so easily change their ways. Fittingly, this season ends with another of Joro’s schemes backfiring, and him being backed into a corner as a result. His immediate impulse may be to devise a new scheme to escape this situation, but if he wants to show that he’s learned anything over the course of this season, then he’ll need to finally be honest about how he feels. We can only wait and see.So, is Oresuki good? No, absolutely not. It pretends to be a subversion of a genre, but ultimately doesn’t amount to more than just being the thing that it’s aping with a few more winks at the camera. But I had a lot of fun with it! There are a lot of ideas here that I thought were interesting to engage with, even if I disagreed them. Maybe my experience was mainly the product of my taking a philosophy class at the same time that this was airing, but if you like to play with your trash, then I think that Oresuki is worth a try. actions at one point or another, and this is made extremely clear from the very beginning.

The comedy, the...characters and the development was good, I thought that had a particular but funny way to see the things through the eyes of a “non main character”. And I was expecting more of this, but unluckily, in my opinion, just the beginning is the strongest part of the anime. But let’s start with the sections:Story:I thought that the story was kind of dumb to be honest, but in the progress of this, it starts to grow on me and I started to appreciate the characters. Because we’re going to be honest is hilarious how everything planned by the guy is just ruined by the unexpected events. So, I can say that the story was okay, at least it’s trying to be creative and unique, and those are elements that are always appreciated.Development of the story:As I said, the first leg of this anime is probably the more enjoyable, because we see a guy who every plan he has, it’s ruined by random and unpredicted event. And we have two girls that are in loved with his best friend and they need his help, and we have the other girl with glasses who always is hard with him but apparently she is the only one in loved of him. I’m thankful that this premise was changing throughout the anime, and we found the good and the bad intentions of the characters. Also was funny to see the double personality of Joro (the main character) and how he always had his high and lows. But the things start to wobble in the middle of this anime (for be more specific since the episode 7), because the funny and comic moments feel a little exaggerated and repetitive, I mean the first scenes of the confession in the bench were funny and enjoyable, but later it feels like a dead meme. Also adding the fact that some characters start to acting like morons. At least I enjoy a little bit the appearance of girls like Tsubaki. But the worst part in my opinion is the finale, because the main problem, the situation that makes everyone feel uncomfortable (the official appearance of three characters more) in my opinion is really stupid, overly dramatic and simply unnecessary. Because show us, that everyone has no self-esteem, and they are just a bunch of manipulated fools.So in general I think the development is okay, the beginning is great, the middle is kind of meh, at least had funny and good moments on it so I’ll take it, but the last leg is the bad point here they could end this in a better way I’m sure.Characters:In general, I think many of the characters are okay, they in some point show good performances, and when they are in the spotlight they show good charisma and personality. Let’s start with the main: Joro. The “non protagonist” character. I really liked the double personality that he has, and is funny to see how everything goes bad to him, how is constantly breaking the forth wall and some of his reactions are entertaining, and the moments where he acts like a douchebag are well done and does not feel forced, but I felt his drama moments a little bland and sometimes he is so manipulated that is annoying, maybe that’s the reason why the bad things happened to him. The female protagonist is Pansy, and I think at the beginning she is very smart, manipulator, funny and cute, the way she always is three steps forward of the others is incredible. But in the last leg of this anime I think she is one the worst characters, because all her intelligence, tenacity and liveliness goes straight to the trash because she can’t say no to a guy that she is not interested in. And also, I think her attitude with Joro (especially in the episode 7) is disgusting. So she could been the best but she is just okay.I think Cosmos is a good character too, her attitude of girl in love is cute, the times where she is serious is really essential for the good development of the things in the future, I would have liked to see her more in the development of the final, than many other characters. Same with Himawari, I think she is okay too, I like that her attitude is kind of childish, but she really cares about her friends, I would like to see her more in the finale too, but what were going to do. Sun, sincerely, is the best, because he starts as an idiot that doesn’t care about the feelings of the people around him and just think of him and he becomes a very good friend that helps Joro in the difficult situations. I think he was the best character in the end, where he plans everything to give the spotlight to Joro. It’s a very good secondary character and in my opinion, the best.I like the personality of Asunaro and her real intentions with Joro, I think she is cute, lovely, energetic and charismatic, and, like Cosmos and Himawari I would like to see her more in the last leg. Tsubaki is the good but kind of forgettable character, I think the way she felt in love of Joro is kind of corny, but she at least has memorable moments. Sasanqua could be more, but unfortunately her moments in the spotlight are unmemorable, and does not change the course of the anime. But at least she is not as bad as Tampopo, where she is easily the worst character: She is annoyingly energetic, overreacted almost if not all the time, her intentions are corny and she is forgettable, so yeah, she is the worst. Oh also, every time she speaks exaggeratedly loud my ears wants to bleed.And the rest I mean Hazuki is a good element for the drama ending, and he is the “nice and correct guy” so I don’t mind it at all. The other two girls Momo and Luna are just the girls that accompanied the nice guy, because they are not important and the fact that they left their feeling for Hazuki for his happiness is just so annoying and cliché so I’m going to skip them.Development of the genre:This is a romantic comedy, and I think probably this the best aspect because it combined the two genres very well, some episodes are funniest than romantic and vice versa. It has some elements of drama too, and most of the time are a little bland and it feels unnecessary so I wouldn’t put too much drama on this in the future. It has some ecchi moments too, a few, and amazingly they work, all because they are connected with some jokes or funny moments so they feel fresh and complement well the scenes.Music:I think the opening is good, not amazing and is far from the best that I heard this year but I like the chorus and the melody sounds very sunny and happy, the instrumental is good and compliment the aspect of the anime very well. I think that the ending song is very meh and forgettable; the instrumental is good but the vocals from Haruka Tomatsu amazingly are forgettable, and Hiraishi and Misawa do very little to save the track. The background music is at least good; they complement very well with the situations so I’ll take it.Overall:I think this anime is good, has some funny and entertaining moments on it, and the performances of the characters in the beginning of the anime are interesting and well done. But unfortunately this anime stays there: being only good, when it has the elements to be one of the best comedy animes of the year if not the best, but thanks to the repetitive and forgettable moments and that bad finale leave this anime a little stagnant. But you know what, I’m going to look forward for this, I want to see the next phase and I wish that many if not all the mistakes presented in this season are fixed and they at least give us something that will be remembered in a positive way.I give this anime a 7 out of 10, and apparently an OVA is coming for the next year, so were going to see where does this anime take us. characters and the development was good, I thought that had a particular but funny way to see the things through the eyes of a “non main character”.

Anyway, the gist of it is that the first half of the shows first episode comes off as a generic school romance anime. The protagonist is a by the numbers nice guy with a supporting cast consisting of the obligatory girl childhood friend, the elegant girl student council president, and a cool guy friend to help him out. All together they play through the motions of the show until a point where it looks like...the childhood friend and student council president may confess to the protagonist, only for it to slap him in the face when they actually ask for his help to get in a relationship with his friend. Disillusioned and in the privacy of his home the protagonist reveals that his personality is a facade that he used in hopes of having his own harem as would be the expectation from a show like this. This “twist” forms the main idea and tone that will run throughout the rest of the show, most of which I would argue isn’t for the best.This idea is the sense of duplicity that not only comes from the main protagonist, but also from every notable character in the cast. No matter how they act or what they do, there probably is an undercurrent of something quite the opposite. It does a good job early on for creating a sense of doubt for the viewers. However, the show really plays into it far too many times that it starts to feel predictable and too reliant on it's twists. It leads the show to only laying down two roads to go through but with the shows modus operandi, you can easily guess which one they will go with.  I would chalk this up to the show letting the cat out of the bag far too early that the impact it had in the first few episodes die down way to quick and it is unable to replicate it again. Even more so is that once you get past all the duplicitous nature of the show, you realize how inconsequential the plot really is.This also goes to the characters as well. Once you look past the thin covered veil, you can see how paper thin these characters are. Sure the duplicity lends to many of the characters being two faced, but it doesn’t equate to complexity or depth. They still play within their designated archetypes as any run of the mill harem rom-com only with the added degree that there might be something more underneath. Most of the time there really isn’t, and when there is it doesn’t really add much to the character that has already been known. Nevertheless they aren’t bad, and depending on how you see these kind of shows, they make a somewhat decent cast of two-dimensional characters. The best character being the main girl Pansy who’s the only character that worked well around the show.If you are wondering why I haven't called any of the characters by their name until now, it’s because it requires a space of its own. One thing this show has going for it in spades are it’s meaningless meanings. By this, I mean their names have some meaning behind them. The most obvious ones being the girls who literally wear their names they're called on their hair as flower ornaments such as pansy, cosmos, himawari(sunflower), etc. And as we all know flowers are full of meaning, but as said before in the last paragraph, it adds very little to what is already known to the character. The main character and his guy friends have a bit more going on with their names, but not really a substantial amount.  The main protags name  is Joro which is translated to “watering can”, while his friend is called Sun-chan. Two essential things that are needed in order for plants such as flowers to grow. One being cold water that’s useful when there’s no rain, and the other being a warm glow star. Overall they are just neat tidbits that people can find appreciative from this show.A bit less than the last one, but there a some literary titles that are dropped into the show.  Three of which i can bother to think of off the top of my head, Dr.Jekyll And Mr.Hyde, Crime And Punishment, and I Am A Cat. the most obvious one being the first one explicitly presented, Dr.Jekyll. Being the case of one man living two different lives and how that is directed towards Joro and his two-faced personality of one being kind and the other one being more of a scumbag. The other two books are a bit more up in the air on whether or not they also play into the same role of Dr.Jekyll, stand for something else, or are just there because the setting takes place in a library.The other thing that Oresuki has going for it is it’s comedy. One of the first things that easily comes to mind is how this show can be viewed as a parody of the genre that it’s playing. From the subversion of expectations, to the nonsense characters and situations throughout the show. The obvious one being “the bench”, a magical bench that appears just about anywhere, and brings a foreboding future towards Joro. It does happen enough time that it starts to have a feeling of ad nauseam, but that’s also part of the humor as well due to how overused they are in the genre as well. The other example is “the baseball game” an event that coincidentally lead to the motivations of most of  the characters of the show. Starting off as a generic plot point only for every new character adding a new perspective to the event that gets increasingly ridiculous, even if there seems to be more going on underneath. The show also has its share of standard comedy that you will expect from the average run-of-the mill comedy anime. However for all that it does to make fun of the genre of harem rom-coms, it inevitably falls into line with the rest.One of the worst things that can happen to a fictional story that attempts to be subversive, satirical, or a parody is that they may fall for the same narrative trapping that they are deconstructing or making fun of. It makes you wonder what was the point of all the setup, if the payoff is the same as the derivative works that it’s riding off of. At least with the more generic and derivative works you get what you expected, through and through. What was the point of the deliberate use of characters and plot elements, when they end up being the same shit as everything else. Why bother giving Joro a two-faced personality, when his more or less “good side” is the one that prevails the most. Why bother knocking back the harem aspect in the beginning of the show only to prop up a much bigger one later on. Seriously, why bother when in the end it ends up being a pile of nothing.In this day and age, where every form of fiction is easily available for almost everyone. It is quite easy to get quickly used to story conventions and tropes. Leading some to create works that differentiate themselves from the rest of the crowd by being subversive or meta, and thanks to their understanding of the tropes used they are able to succeed in doing so. Yet it comes to a point where it is done so much that it ends up being the new norm. To be so overdone that it is forgotten why they need it to be subversive or meta in the first place. It only becomes a dumb game of the author attempting to one-up the audience in the most stupid way possible, and that’s what Oresuki is. A harem rom-com that tries to play smarter than it really is and only reveals time after time how it’s just kind of... Dumb. That’s the greatest use of duplicity this show inadvertently ends up achieving.Also they did the redhead girl dirty and that’s unforgivable... the childhood friend and student council president may confess to the protagonist, only for it to slap him in the face when they actually ask for his help to get in a relationship with his friend. Disillusioned and in the privacy of his home the protagonist reveals that his personality is a facade that he used in hopes of having his own harem as would be the expectation from a show like this. This “twist” forms the main idea and tone that will run throughout the rest of the show, most of which I would argue isn’t for the best.This idea is the sense of duplicity that not only comes from the main protagonist, but also from every notable character in the cast. No matter how they act or what they do, there probably is an undercurrent of something quite the opposite. It does a good job early on for creating a sense of doubt for the viewers. However, the show really plays into it far too many times that it starts to feel predictable and too reliant on it's twists. It leads the show to only laying down two roads to go through but with the shows modus operandi, you can easily guess which one they will go with.  I would chalk this up to the show letting the cat out of the bag far too early that the impact it had in the first few episodes die down way to quick and it is unable to replicate it again. Even more so is that once you get past all the duplicitous nature of the show, you realize how inconsequential the plot really is.This also goes to the characters as well. Once you look past the thin covered veil, you can see how paper thin these characters are. Sure the duplicity lends to many of the characters being two faced, but it doesn’t equate to complexity or depth. They still play within their designated archetypes as any run of the mill harem rom-com only with the added degree that there might be something more underneath. Most of the time there really isn’t, and when there is it doesn’t really add much to the character that has already been known. Nevertheless they aren’t bad, and depending on how you see these kind of shows, they make a somewhat decent cast of two-dimensional characters. The best character being the main girl Pansy who’s the only character that worked well around the show.If you are wondering why I haven't called any of the characters by their name until now, it’s because it requires a space of its own. One thing this show has going for it in spades are it’s meaningless meanings. By this, I mean their names have some meaning behind them. The most obvious ones being the girls who literally wear their names they're called on their hair as flower ornaments such as pansy, cosmos, himawari(sunflower), etc. And as we all know flowers are full of meaning, but as said before in the last paragraph, it adds very little to what is already known to the character. The main character and his guy friends have a bit more going on with their names, but not really a substantial amount.  The main protags name  is Joro which is translated to “watering can”, while his friend is called Sun-chan. Two essential things that are needed in order for plants such as flowers to grow. One being cold water that’s useful when there’s no rain, and the other being a warm glow star. Overall they are just neat tidbits that people can find appreciative from this show.A bit less than the last one, but there a some literary titles that are dropped into the show.  Three of which i can bother to think of off the top of my head, Dr.Jekyll And Mr.Hyde, Crime And Punishment, and I Am A Cat. the most obvious one being the first one explicitly presented, Dr.Jekyll. Being the case of one man living two different lives and how that is directed towards Joro and his two-faced personality of one being kind and the other one being more of a scumbag. The other two books are a bit more up in the air on whether or not they also play into the same role of Dr.Jekyll, stand for something else, or are just there because the setting takes place in a library.The other thing that Oresuki has going for it is it’s comedy. One of the first things that easily comes to mind is how this show can be viewed as a parody of the genre that it’s playing. From the subversion of expectations, to the nonsense characters and situations throughout the show. The obvious one being “the bench”, a magical bench that appears just about anywhere, and brings a foreboding future towards Joro. It does happen enough time that it starts to have a feeling of ad nauseam, but that’s also part of the humor as well due to how overused they are in the genre as well. The other example is “the baseball game” an event that coincidentally lead to the motivations of most of  the characters of the show. Starting off as a generic plot point only for every new character adding a new perspective to the event that gets increasingly ridiculous, even if there seems to be more going on underneath. The show also has its share of standard comedy that you will expect from the average run-of-the mill comedy anime. However for all that it does to make fun of the genre of harem rom-coms, it inevitably falls into line with the rest.One of the worst things that can happen to a fictional story that attempts to be subversive, satirical, or a parody is that they may fall for the same narrative trapping that they are deconstructing or making fun of. It makes you wonder what was the point of all the setup, if the payoff is the same as the derivative works that it’s riding off of. At least with the more generic and derivative works you get what you expected, through and through. What was the point of the deliberate use of characters and plot elements, when they end up being the same shit as everything else. Why bother giving Joro a two-faced personality, when his more or less “good side” is the one that prevails the most. Why bother knocking back the harem aspect in the beginning of the show only to prop up a much bigger one later on. Seriously, why bother when in the end it ends up being a pile of nothing.In this day and age, where every form of fiction is easily available for almost everyone. It is quite easy to get quickly used to story conventions and tropes. Leading some to create works that differentiate themselves from the rest of the crowd by being subversive or meta, and thanks to their understanding of the tropes used they are able to succeed in doing so. Yet it comes to a point where it is done so much that it ends up being the new norm. To be so overdone that it is forgotten why they need it to be subversive or meta in the first place. It only becomes a dumb game of the author attempting to one-up the audience in the most stupid way possible, and that’s what Oresuki is. A harem rom-com that tries to play smarter than it really is and only reveals time after time how it’s just kind of... Dumb. That’s the greatest use of duplicity this show inadvertently ends up achieving.Also they did the redhead girl dirty and that’s unforgivable..."", ""UPDATED on 28/12/2019 (12/12 episodes completed)UPDATE (28/12/2019)This show actually turned out to be a calming and enjoyable anime to watch. It seems as if the characters have actually developed some IQ, and Joro begins to become a less hated character as I continue to watch this show. Even though I hated the first arc, the progression of the actual plotline seemed quite nice, as we get introduced to some well-structured characters. I'd say the show still doesn't deserve to be rated 'Very Good', as the overall story still isn't as strongly structured and well-thought as other highly rated anime of this genre. Nevertheless, the characters...do deserve more recognition in the end, and I think (as of right now), the show deserves a solid 7/10. I feel as it I was a bit too harsh of this show, considering my non-updated review was pretty much based on only one arc of this anime.BEFORE UPDATEI feel betrayed by this anime. I truly feel heartbroken. Up until episode 4, I'd say this is a 9/10. After watching episode 4, the anime plummets down to a 4/10 for me, and then rises to a 5-6/10 after episode 5. However, the story is a total mess. It's like the creator of this had no idea about how to make the story move forward, and simply makes the characters become friends again. I don't understand why Amatsuyu Kisaragi would want to be friends with Ooga again.Ooga's character disgusts me so much that I have no idea how on earth Amatsuyu Kisaragi considers to become friends with this c*nt again. Nevertheless, Amatsuyu Kisaragi is no better. He is such an *sshole to Sumireko Sanshokuin for no reason whatsoever, and this irritates me so much as the hate from him towards Sumireko Sanshokuin is undeserved af (and obviously, just to let you know, Sumireko Sanshokuin is by far best girl in this show).The overall character cast is so brain-dead that watching this show gives me depression, but then the OP and ED cure it. The OP is so good it has to be in the top 5 OP of this season, and the ED is pretty good too. They are just full of charisma and they motivate me to look forward to every new episode of this show. I hope the overall story improves throughout this show, as right now I'm not sure if a story even exists. The only thing that saves this show for me is obviously Sumireko Sanshokuin aka best girl, as she is the only reasonably intelligent character in this show. do deserve more recognition in the end, and I think (as of right now), the show deserves a solid 7/10.

The protagonis,t with the character design of generic hentai mc, turns into unsympathetic spineless coward that does everything in his power to maintain the status quo and prevent any significant plot progression. His main motivation also turns out to be correlated to being too fixated on his male friend. A friend that also turns to be...a douchebag and basically tries to attempt to rape a girl. The protagonist witnesses it. The protagonist doesn\'t care. Neither does the series. Everyone act like this doesn\'t happen and the series continues to make a best-bro moments with those two scumbags. Have I also mentioned that the mc shows more interest in the quiet/creepy girl only after he finds out that she has some really huge tits? Yeah.Likewise, the female supporting cast gradually turns into members of ""this isn\'t actually a harem but it is actually harem"". The jokes in the first part of the series being that the girls are not actually into the protagonist turns into the girls in fact clinging to the protagonists.As most of the characters are reduced to a single-trope bearers with no depth, the show tries to save this using the method of introducing more characters. Too bad that each new character is more annoying than the previous ones and this unsurprisingly does more damage than it mends.The comedy itself is stale and you could reduce in into three or so kinds of jokes. Then, as the last dich effort to make OreSuki interesting the final part forces some shallow drama with wannabe deep characterizations of some yet another new characters or whatever that was supposed to be.The good parts are the opening and especially ending which are surprisingly catchy.

Only to then tarnish that good will for the next seven episodes, only to then at the last minute change course back to what the point of the initial arc was.What was that goal you say? To subvert with Harem RomCom genre with a Konosuba attitude, adding some sprinkles of Death Note here and there. Or maybe to deconstruct? I'm not a huge fan of the term but it encompasses what the...show was trying to do just as well. Let's describe how it goes about its goal.Joro is a boy who is seemingly the insufferable good willed harem protagonist we are oh so used to. Only to then halfway through the first episode have the rug thrown out from under us and are exposed to his true personality. Joro it turns out, is a what the internet deems as a NiceGuyTM. He is nice to his childhood friend and the student council president  with which he works closely, with the ultimate goal in mind to date them. And when it turns out that the girls are using Joro's attraction to them to help them get with his Chad best friend on the baseball team; Joro's goal for the next few episodes is to try to help both of them in which one will win and he will inevitably get second picks at whoever's left.This is a great set up, Joro it turns out, is an absolutely insufferable d-bag. Rude, Narcissistic, selfish, weak, manipulative, and insecure. Very similar to a well known isekai protagonist doesn't it?We follow him through another episode in which he tries to help his friends, in the mean time hanging out with this ugly girl named Pansy duing lunch who is his stalker. Remember this, the woman actively commits a crime, openly so in fact. The reason she does this is because she is in love with the main character. Blackmailing him bear in mind but we will come back to her later.Eventually Joro's true nature as a bastard is revealed, his friends abandon him, and his reputation is tarnished all across the school. It becomes so bad this kid is shown to be bullied for an entire week.Next week it is revealed that Joro's best friend Sun-chan was manipulating everyone the entire time because of a time when he liked a girl who asked him to help her get with Joro, despite Sun-chan telling her of Joro's terrible personality which he obviously knew about even though Joro pretended to hide it. And even though he acted oblivious, of course Sun-chan knew that the two girls liked him, how could he not? They made it extremely obvious, he just decided to use it to his advantage.Joro is secretly listening in during this conversation in which he eventually confronts Sun-chan using his douchey personality. Thereby being in the gratitude of Pansy who reveals herself to be a hot girl in disguise! And it turns out the bullying thing was an elaborate bit by Pansy to expose Joro's terrible friends who manipulated him!  Look at all these ruses!In all honesty it was pretty cool to watch the plan come together and for Pansy to deconstruct the plans of Sun-chan. Honestly at this point I was ready to give the show a seven, but then the rest of the show happens.What I just summarized was the best part of the entire show, the rest is never as good as this. Remember when I said Pansy was kind of a bad person? She is never punished for this besides not getting to be with the MC right away, in fact she's even absolved to a degree. Eventually the other girls in the initial arc and others encountered later come to like the main character as well. And while he initially makes it a goal to have a harem, he very quickly abandons it two episodes later.And while there is substance that's worth diving into, the actual content of most of the show is still a standard harem or just poorly executed attempts at being interesting. The Monogatari series allows you to indulge in the personalities of the girls while also trying to convey a complex narrative with indepth characterization; Konosuba similarly if maybe having a slightly less complicated cast of characters, Oresuki just doesn't have that.You can have your cake but cannot eat it, or maybe more accurately you have the cake but it's super dry and the frosting is sub par at best. The cake itself was trying to be a big wedding cake, which the baker unfortunately didn't have the talent to execute.The show is funny sometimes, not every joke lands but the show had enough going for it originally that it didn't matter. Same goes for the visuals that never look garbage per se but certainly never look good.I don't entirely regret the experience but I was way too close to doing so. I contemplated dropping around episode eight or nine, but I stuck with it and was graced with a few episodes that were tolerable. Ultimately I would only recommend Oresuki to those who really like the harem genre, if you do not then you will inevitably be disappointed with the lack of humorous cynicism later on in the show and eventually get bored as I saw happen to a number of people watching weekly.To those outside that niche crowd, I would give the show a pass. show was trying to do just as well.

Are you sick of watching shitty romcom anime that has zero plot and focuses only on ecchi and harem? Are you craving for a romcom anime that has a good romance plot and comedy ? Well I have been feeling those emotions and have been craving for a ‘decent’ romcom anime. But those feelings disappeared when I came across the anime “ORESUKI Are you the only one who loves me?”.This anime caught my attention due to the description of its plot and the similarity of the main heroine’s face...to a certain doujinshi.

It expects that you have watched many romance anime already and know all the tropes present therein.  Initially, everything is familiar: the bland MC, the childhood friend, the MC\'s athletic best friend, a beautiful love interest.  However, Oresuki proceeds from there to try and defy your expectations while still playing it relatively straight.  All is not as it seems, and there will be several developments coming up that reveal the writer isn\'t so much going after romantic drama; rather it\'s about the comedy, the situations, and a recognition of...how teenagers actually ARE rather than how they are portrayed in romcoms.  Like one of the characters Sumireko, Oresuki the anime is a hidden gem that requires you to relax your skeptical self for a long enough to enjoy the HUMOR, the SATIRE, and the INSIGHT on display.  I realize you\'ve been trained in Pavlovian fashion to react a certain way to the archetypes common to romcoms, but just suspend that long enough to engage your brain, please.Our protagonist Kisaragi looks like he\'s supposed to: he\'s drawn so we know he\'s not particularly handsome, athletic, or gifted academically.  He\'s supposed to be plain and easy for a viewer experience vicariously through.  And yet, if you\'re anything like me, we should hardly be pleased to relate to such a bland character.  Zero personality?  No traits that stand out?  Who would want to hold such a person up as their ideal?  If a woman did fall for us, we should be ashamed on her behalf or concerned for her sanity.  But it\'s not very long into the first episode that it\'s revealed Kisaragi is actually quite conniving, fully aware of the situation he\'s in, and anything but the ""dense"" MC that so often appears in anime romcom.  He knows full well that in this situation, the childhood friend and the student council president (two of three female leads in this show) SHOULD have feelings for him if they all lived in a harem romcom world and he need only play the nice guy before they reveal this.At this point, it\'s no spoiler to tell you it doesn\'t go this way.  And while some reviewers here on MAL are really unhappy with this apparently, it\'s actually more realistic the way it goes down.  Think about it.  When you were in high school, did the hot girls go after the dorks with zero personality, humor, charm, or intelligence?  If they did at your school, then great, you lived in some strange Twilight Zone.  At my school they either went for the athletic ones or the smart ones (or after people who were both).  Suggesting otherwise is simply a denial of reality.  It\'s hilarious how the protagonist starts to develop a trauma surrounding park benches because these two ""confessions"" don\'t play out the way he would like.  Bad personality?  I would say that Oresuki dares to say that other romcoms are the unrealistic ones, where a bland MC is able to take any level of abuse or mistreatment without resentment.  I\'m sorry, I LAUGHED when he called his childhood friend a bitch for USING him to get close to his childhood friend.  She was a bitch, but you have to be patient and let HER character develop as well before passing judgment on either of them.  Because character development is an important part of any story, don\'t you know?Speaking of character development, it\'s interesting how angry some of these reviewers are about the best friend, Taiyou.  He resents the protagonist because a girl in middle school liked Kisaragi instead of him.  Hello?!  That\'s about as realistic a plot development as it gets.  I believe the emotion is called ""jealousy"".  The thing is, Taiyou is not just about jealousy and crappy guy personality.  He also has genuine feelings of friendship for Kiseragi.  Why do you think he feels so strongly about things?  In my experience, people feel hatred and jealousy most towards people they have some kind of feelings for, otherwise they wouldn\'t bother.  And the show has a few things to say about forgiveness, redemption, and the nature of friendship.  Keep watching, keep an open mind, and you might come to see Taiyou in a new light.And then of course we have Sumireko.  She\'s obviously a bishoujo in disguise.  The thing is, we\'re SUPPOSED to recognize her trope immediately.  The author is not thinking ""Oh, this girl who is creepy and wears glasses is actually a beauty!  Genius.""  No, clearly the author is relying on you to have seen plenty of other romcoms where this was part of the main plot.  Instead, Sumireko is supposed turn this stereotype on its head.  Sure, she\'s beautiful but the main point is that she represents perception and insight.  Nearly everybody in high school is putting up some kind of front.  They don\'t believe their true, essential self is worth loving so they do all sorts of things to compensate: put up walls, makup, do sports, put on false airs, adopt false bravado, pretend to like things they really don\'t, you name it.  Sumireko is supposed to represent the ability to cut through all of that crap and see the essentials, see into what matters.  You poor MAL reviewers who didn\'t like her, go back and examine why.  Was it because you are afraid of someone seeing you for who YOU really are?  Suggesting that she\'s unrealistic is just completely besides the point.  Whether someone like Sumireko actually exists or not in reality (she does, by the way--I have met several people who have at least her level of insight) has no bearing on what the author is trying to say.  Instead, the author is trying to ask questions about societal expectations, quality, and the nature of youthful love THROUGH Sumireko.I can tell I\'m getting long winded so I better get back to the point.  While writing this I kept thinking, ""Well, I don\'t have any right to tell anyone what they should like, right?""  But then I considered, why are you reading reviews on MAL?  It\'s because you want to know if anime like Oresuki is worth watching, right?  It is.  Don\'t let the score-of-one (1?!) reviews fool you.  It\'s worth a watch not only because it\'s intelligent, but also because it\'s FUNNY.  If you take yourself too seriously or are really, really insecure, you might not be amused.  Why are some reviewers trying to talk about realism in a romantic comedy?  So few of them depict realistic situations.  Turn off your insecurity, turn off your desire to criticize, and you might be able to sit back and enjoy the brilliance of Oresuki.OK, yeah, Oresuki does have some bad writing in it, but it\'s hard to find an anime without ANY bad ideas.  For the most part, it\'s very funny and entertaining.  I don\'t actually think it\'s worth a 9, I\'m just trying to balance out the ridiculous one point scores assigned here. how teenagers actually ARE rather than how they are portrayed in romcoms.  Like one of the characters Sumireko, Oresuki the anime is a hidden gem that requires you to relax your skeptical self for a long enough to enjoy the HUMOR, the SATIRE, and the INSIGHT on display.  I realize you\'ve been trained in Pavlovian fashion to react a certain way to the archetypes common to romcoms, but just suspend that long enough to engage your brain, please.Our protagonist Kisaragi looks like he\'s supposed to: he\'s drawn so we know he\'s not particularly handsome, athletic, or gifted academically.  He\'s supposed to be plain and easy for a viewer experience vicariously through.  And yet, if you\'re anything like me, we should hardly be pleased to relate to such a bland character.  Zero personality?  No traits that stand out?  Who would want to hold such a person up as their ideal?  If a woman did fall for us, we should be ashamed on her behalf or concerned for her sanity.  But it\'s not very long into the first episode that it\'s revealed Kisaragi is actually quite conniving, fully aware of the situation he\'s in, and anything but the ""dense"" MC that so often appears in anime romcom.  He knows full well that in this situation, the childhood friend and the student council president (two of three female leads in this show) SHOULD have feelings for him if they all lived in a harem romcom world and he need only play the nice guy before they reveal this.At this point, it\'s no spoiler to tell you it doesn\'t go this way.  And while some reviewers here on MAL are really unhappy with this apparently, it\'s actually more realistic the way it goes down.  Think about it.  When you were in high school, did the hot girls go after the dorks with zero personality, humor, charm, or intelligence?  If they did at your school, then great, you lived in some strange Twilight Zone.  At my school they either went for the athletic ones or the smart ones (or after people who were both).  Suggesting otherwise is simply a denial of reality.

Over the past few seasons, I felt as though the Romance genre has been pretty stale, but this one has got me excited for every new episode. I have only seen the first 4 episodes so far, but if you are checking in on this new series, this review is for you.Story: The story is pretty simple. Two cute girls go up to the MC and start doing a confession, MC gets nervous, but BAM, they both confess that they are in love in MC\'s best friend. Then enter a 3rd girl,...who is nerdy, keeps to herself, and works in the library, she confesses to the MC. Nothing to grand or super unique, but it is how the anime goes about it, from plot twist to plot twist and fun interactions.Art: The art and animation in this anime is top notch for a Romance (non-action) anime. The characters all look aesthetically pleasing (girls look cute) and the facial animation really gets you into the scene. Absolutely no complaints in this department.Sound: I feel as though all the voice actors fit their characters so far and help bring out the emotion needed for each scene. I am not a sound expert by any means, but I have seen plenty of anime with voice acting that stands out in a bad way and not once have I cringed during this anime.Characters: This is what separates this anime from the recent Romance anime. The MC and the two main side characters (best friend and the nerdy girl) really showcase their individual personalities in these first 4 episodes. The best friend appears to be the basic ""popular kid"" in the school at first, but you get to see more of him fairly quick. MC is dense to an extend (to keep the romance from budding too quickly) but he is pretty squared away majority of the time. I hate dumb main characters, he is not a dumb character.Overall: I cannot recommend this enough if you enjoy Romance / Comedy anime. It even adds a little drama/mystery in a quirky and fun way. So far the writing and characters are EXTREMELY entertaining. It is already in the top 3 animes of the season for me personally who is nerdy, keeps to herself, and works in the library, she confesses to the MC.

Is the story good, not really. Is the art good, nothing special if not subpar. Then why is this show a 10 you the 2 people reading this might ask? It because of the main character joro, who is the most human character I have ever seen in a show, not in an anime mind you, but in a show period. He's a two-faced liar who is also a somewhat closeted pervert. Like, this is...accurate, this is how real people act and think and try to. The show's ability to show whats he's thinking, the comedy behind him navigating having an almost bipolar attitude makes it a 10 of a show. the side characters and story are filler. Joro is real, he acts and thinks in a way people do and it is very refreshing, this show understands what it is and kudos to that. Well nice talking to you watch this show oml its good if you appreciate comedy and a nonstatic character accurate, this is how real people act and think and try to.

Well nice talking to you watch this show oml its good if you appreciate comedy and a nonstatic character"", '[Spoiler Warning]This is also my first, and only, review I will ever write on MAL, so apologies if the format or the content reads a bit messy.""Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo"" (or ""Are you the only one who loves me?"") was an anime hailing from Fall 2019\'s season, but I only got around to watch it during these dreadful times, and oh boy, it only aggravated whatever misery I was trying to block out in me.We are given the typical introduction to the main character in these high school animes, alongside the childhood friend who, of course, is a girl. As...more minutes go by we find out he is also a member of the student council and he has a second childhood friend, the ace player of the school\'s baseball team. Neat. It is a decent introduction and there\'s nothing that really stands out, either negatively or positively. The plot, as we are led to believe, will involve these colorful, flower-inspired girls and the two childhood friends who are the Sun and the Moon, quite literally (due to their nicknames) in harmless, rom-com banter, as Joro, the main character, states right at the beginning.But things take a turn when he\'s invited to what he assumes is a date by both his female childhood friend Hinata and student council president Sakura.You see, the only segment on the four episodes I have watched in this show that could pass as the comedy portion of ""rom-com"" stem from both girls, on separate dates, asking for his help in hooking up with his friend Oga (or Sun-chan). The misunderstanding Joro made when on his ""date"" with both girls is what cranks the engine for the plot during the next three episodes.And this is where Oresuki rears its ugly head and the one-hour crucifixion of my soul began.The anime never was a rom-com. It was, at best, a commentary on the duality of Chad v Incel. I say that because the second half of the first episode our main character reveals that we, in fact, live in a society, where girls use their childhood friend status and maturity as a pretext to toy with a poor guy\'s heart strings, as if it was an harp playing a requiem for the fallen at a funeral for love. At every opportunity Joro can\'t help himself but to insult under his breath the two girls he felt that used him, calling them ""bitches"" at times. But, of course, the first episode\'s trainwreck could not stop there, because there was one more course, apparently. And that lies in the third girl, the one that loves Joro but Joro doesn\'t love her, since she is that weird, ugly girl that everyone avoids like they\'re at the peak of the Black Plague and she had just grown a small lump on her cheek. She appears holding a ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", in what I assume is a comparison of the man/beast with Joro\'s ""obtuse"", kind boy with the incel inside. To be honest, she could had been holding a copy of Shrek 1 and I\'d still get the idea that like onions, Joro is multilayered.And from here, it only got worse. At this point, any expectations I had sunk faster than the stock market in 1929 and I kept going through the see-through, predictable, mess of a story to realize that while Joro was helping both girls hooking up with Sun-chan, no character was likeable. Both girls are completely braindead. The plot here is that Sun-chan must never find out that they like him or that Joro is helping them, but... that doesn\'t make sense to me. Maybe I\'m also braindead, but if Sun-chan knew about Joro\'s endeavors regarding the girls wouldn\'t it facilitate Joro\'s work since Sun-chan could just take over? But alas, for the sake of a plot point I could see on the other side of the world just like a mushroom cloud in the night sky, Sun-chan likes the weird girl (who is, by the way, extremely hot and not ugly as she appears). The anime picked up the love-triangle and decided it wasn\'t enough, we needed a love-pentagon (or a square if you bundle up the two girls that want Sun-chan together).The third episode was, to no one\'s surprise, any better.The plot goes out the window because Sun-chan, hurt by Joro\'s refusal in helping him with his love affairs, takes revenge on him, turning both girls against our infant Joker behind the scenes, resulting in a clash in the empty library (where our weird girl works as an aide) that hurts beyond repair Joro\'s image in everyone\'s eyes. Ostracized by his peers, left without any friends but the weird library girl, he lives a week used to his outcast status.But, lo-and-behold, this was a master plan of the library girl, because Sun-chan was unmasked as a despicable villain by having betrayed Joro all because he got butthurt over a girl TWICE (the first one was in middle school) And that, for those who are keeping count, makes the total of unlikable characters to four. At least, the library girl wasn\'t bad in the three and a half episodes I watched before I decided I wasn\'t into this kind of torture. There was also a bit of dialogue that suggests Joro is in fact multilayered: apparently, he has the outer façade, the incel within and then underneath that lies the kindhearted friend. Adding more layers to a character doesn\'t help him when all of them are paper-thin.The fourth episode (at least, the 10 minutes I spent on it before dropping this show altogether) opened up with the Meta-Commentary™, truly, the symbol of a show who doesn\'t know what to do next. This is followed by the addition of a new girl, who is also based after a flower (who could have guessed?) and works as a reporter. This conversation only got me until they mentioned an event called the Flower Festival (which already doesn\'t feel very original since all of the girls are based after flowers) where the crux of it is when a guy dances with three other girls in succession, and what do you know? We have EXACTLY three girls that will probably dance with him because the plot demands it!I say ""will probably dance"" because this was when I said ""aight, I\'m boutta head out"" and dropped it.In terms of technical parts, the art and the sound are serviceable. The art looks good and the sound works. The OP and ED aren\'t really that memorable but I\'m not docking points for that. The animations are what you would expect from an anime from this generation and look alright too. It\'s just the characters that are beyond salvation that even Jesus himself wouldn\'t die for their sins.Seriously, if you want to watch a rom-com that is actually good, go see ""Toradora"". For the Flower Festival bit that also says that one of those three girls will marry the guy, ""We Never Learn"" is another rom-com with a similar festival but better, since the manga is taking full advantage of having five girls to do different routes for them starting at that event and its superstition. I wouldn\'t recommend Oresuki to anyone unless they would like to know if there\'s an anime version of Agent Orange or they are into BDSM, because this kind of torture is astounding. Hell, I watched Ishuzoku Reviewers, alone, in daylight and the sheer embarrasment I felt wasn\'t nowhere near as painful as having to sit through the first episode of this anime, I never got why they called Rising of The Shield Hero an ""incel fantasy"" when this anime features one as its main character.There are great rom-coms out there, but this isn\'t one. more minutes go by we find out he is also a member of the student council and he has a second childhood friend, the ace player of the school\'s baseball team.

After the first 3-4 episodes, I was ready to call this show the best this season. The writing was on point, the characters were interesting and complex and animation was very nice. I was ready to call this a solid 9/10. Then the rest of the series happened and it all blew up in my face.If you were to ask me why it simply ends up being what show with short-lived premises: Where do we go from here? This show doesn't answer this question for at least 6 episodes. After those first four episodes, this becomes one of...the most obnoxious, repetitious and aimless shows I've seen in a while. Those six episodes do include new girls but they either are used for gags or are forgotten entirely. The fourth wall breaking jokes start as funny and then they become inconsistent, then they become straight-up bad.Let's get the jokes out of the way first. The Bench joke was really funny at first but then the show uses it as a crux. It comes back at so many intervals and so many moments that by the end, it becomes a gag that isn't funny and they use it way too much. Then there are the fourth wall jokes. In the first three episodes, they come off as playful and I would admit that I laughed a good chunk at them. After those three episodes though, the show gets weird with them. One episode we could have multiple jokes of Joro saying something akin to making fun of rom-com protagonists or the animation looking piss poor for a second or two (Seriously, that joke about the animation still makes me angry). The show doesn't use these jokes to any smart effect but more to the effect of pointing something out using it in some type of excuse. By the end, I hated hearing the fourth wall jokes because it would continue to show the inconsistency of this show's humor.Then there are the characters. At first, I found Joro to be an interesting protagonist but by the end, I just didn't like him. Pansy was the only character I actually liked but there was also a good chunk of episodes where they just didn't focus on her. When it comes to the other girls of the show, it's a mixed bag if there ever was one. The two first girls Hima and Cosmos are ok, but Cosmos suffered from being interesting and not getting any screen time in later episodes and Hima was just obnoxious. Asarino was whatever because she didn't add much. The other girls are so forgettable that they don't even add really anything to the main plot and are just gag characters. One of the main gags the show focuses on is one character who just wants to confess to Joro and she constantly messes up. It's one of the dumbest gags I have seen.You are probably saying to yourself that I have been a little too hard on this and sure, I am but it has less to what it is and more of what it could've been. The first three episodes were amazing and while not on the same level, episodes 4,11 and 12 were not that bad (minus the ending which was just stupid) and the animation by Connect was pretty top-notch for the most part (minus that stupid scene where they changed up animation styles). It's just that the show between those episodes is an aimless, poorly done, repetitious slog that made me feel like I was forced to watch some dumb harem show which was for a good bit. No matter how many meta-jokes they could throw out or have a subversive moment here or there, the show just ended up being a harem show that wasn't generic, but a mess and while that is better than a generic harem show, that doesn't mean it gets away with the potential it had. That's what makes this show so sad to witness. Would I watch a second season? Maybe, but I don't have the highest expectations.Story: 5/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Character: 5/10Enjoyment: 5/10Overall: 5/10 the most obnoxious, repetitious and aimless shows I've seen in a while. Those six episodes do include new girls but they either are used for gags or are forgotten entirely. The fourth wall breaking jokes start as funny and then they become inconsistent, then they become straight-up bad.Let's get the jokes out of the way first. The Bench joke was really funny at first but then the show uses it as a crux. It comes back at so many intervals and so many moments that by the end, it becomes a gag that isn't funny and they use it way too much. Then there are the fourth wall jokes.

Fourth-wall-breaking like I\'ve never seen, hilarious situational comedy, etc. The humor alone would be enough for me to give this show a 7 or 8 with just average to decent characters and story. Unfortunately, this show fails to deliver on that front pretty hard.The characters are all extremely unlikable and unrealistic, starting with the protagonist, Joro. Joro is a gigantic scumbag, but in a good sort-of Kazuma from Konosuba kind of way. But unlike Kazuma, he pretends not to be a scumbag and fails to have pretty much any other redeeming qualities. Joro starts out the show trying to win the...affection of either his childhood friend or the president of the student council whom he assists, but both of them are in love with his best friend, Sun-chan (who is the actual best character).Both girls start out the show asking Joro to hook them up with Sun-chan, which ends up being pretty hilarious at first but quickly turns into a big pile of melodramatic garbage after about three episodes. Every episode there\'s some new melodrama that turns everybody against Joro for no reason, and then by the end of the episode or in the next episode they all make up with Joro, again for no reason.While all this is happening, Joro finds out that the only girl who actually loves him is the openly scumbaggy, manipulative, nerdy, braid-haired, glasses-wearing library assistant Pansy. Which is actually pretty hilarious at first and might continue to be if they went even deeper into that character, but it turns out she\'s just a kind girl who, as the trope goes, becomes beautiful when she puts down her hair and takes off her glasses. So she goes from kind of interesting to pretty boring real fast.Each new episode churns out a new cute girl with at best a two-dimensional personality that she flip-flops between for no reason. Most of them go from normal to crazy inexplicably, but there\'s also one who goes from crazy to normal inexplicably. And most of them end up falling in love with our unlikable protagonist for absolutely no reason. And the show tries to shove all of them into each episode just to remind us how cute and annoying they are. The show is called ""Are you the only one who loves me?"", but in the end it\'s just another giant harem.This show is a melodramatic piece of garbage with awful characters, but at least it\'s hilarious and the animation is pretty good. This show goes next-level in the fourth-wall-breaking department, even mentioning the singer of the OP by name while it\'s playing in the background in the last episode. And every time ""the bench"" comes up is pretty funny. So maybe the show is worth watching for the humor alone, but there\'s so many better shows that this should be pretty far down your list. affection of either his childhood friend or the president of the student council whom he assists, but both of them are in love with his best friend, Sun-chan (who is the actual best character).Both girls start out the show asking Joro to hook them up with Sun-chan, which ends up being pretty hilarious at first but quickly turns into a big pile of melodramatic garbage after about three episodes.

I guess noone and least myself, but here we are. Ore Suki (Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo) is definitely worth to be compared to the phenomenal anime adaption of Oregairu or other fantastic rom-coms.The most interesting part of this show are the characters and the way storytelling is done. I had a feeling of unreliable narration as certain story sections are told from different perspective with differing outcomes and how the characters have understood or misunderstood the situations. This leads to a plethora of hilarious...and both gratifying and just overall funny moments.We have Joro, who is a real suckup for the girls that he is interested in and does everything for them he can to support them with their chores. He seems like a total beta but he is actually the real chad of this anime. We see this as soon he realizes that none of the girls (quirky Osananajimi and strict but shy Seitokaichou) he puts so much effort to please like him, rather want him to help them getting together with Joros best friend, a handsome guy called Sun-chan.Joro encounters at the core three women of which only one turns out to have actual interest in him. But the show tells us that that girl is undesirable for Joro and thus he fights with all his energy against getting together with the third girl. This third girl turns out to be sharp and saves his ass from abusive reliance.Are the characters flat? Are they as confuciusdragon points out ""bad characters""?I would heavily disagree, because I see that show inherently as a deconstruction of the romance genre as we know it. We don\'t have an ecchi protagonist that is totally oblivious to the female charme and we don\'t have conventional characters. What he do have are the most overused tropes of a romance show possible: impossibly clingy Osananajimi, Senpai Seitokaichou and an Ojou-sama Librarian..Some of the jokes are crazy in hilarity. There is this scene where Ayano isn\'t able to speak to her love interest without getting nervous and so she starts talking in a traditional Sengoku-Era Samurai tone and says shit like: ""I\'d like to indulge with you in the practice of having a meal on the roof"" while Joro is just cringing hard. I nearly died of laughter.The first 4 episodes I was constantly in a state of excessive laughter at the genuinely funny jokes and in dismay for the beta protagonist to be stepped on and exploited. But in ep 3 after ep2 ends with an impossibly sadistic cliffhanger, we are introduced to the smartness of the Librarian character who deduces based on strings that were pulled by the aforementioned narrative earlier that theres betrayal among the characters, despite them thinking they are all doing each other favors. This kind of 4D chess feels amazing to follow and it kept me interested.The music is strange, because its sometimes dramatic at places where it doesn\'t need be and sometimes the musical underlining is perfect. We have more eerie sounding OST as well as Piano music sometimes. Also the sound design is superb and adds wonderful accent to each of the jokes.The art is decent, it could be better and it definitely doesn\'t reach legendary status but it\'s likely the best this stupid can produce. For that sake its nothing to complain about. Also the superdeformed characters can add to the jokes.I didn\'t plan for this review to be so long, especially since the anime didn\'t even finish airing but with such an awesome show I cannot keep my words brief. Really appreciate this season, even though nothing looked appealing at first glance.I can only give this show kudos for the times it made me laugh and that I consumed 6 episodes of it when I should long be asleep (5:38am) and I still bother to write a review...well that should mean a lot.Good night! and both gratifying and just overall funny moments.We have Joro, who is a real suckup for the girls that he is interested in and does everything for them he can to support them with their chores.

But here the plot was somewhat the same, only this time it always involves guy getting into messy situation where it doesn\'t involve each harem members but only one in particular and yes, it  was the book worm girl who...manages the library. Another thing about this anime was that it doesn\'t make any BS of keeping the guy as this perfect guy thing, rather here, the guy was more like into what we can called as organize chaos, where things would be repetitive as to how the guy\'s bestie becomes this stabbed in the back SOB to being an apologetic guy to back again to this stabbed in the back bestie again, then again if one was to observe his statement to the guy, one would know that he was giving him hints that he should go for the girl he loves.Cons: Cu\'z this has that organize chaos, if one can\'t follow the in between the lines of the character\'s dialogue then t can be misleading. Also given that this has a harem themed in it was kinda annoying that a new harem member gets added every once in a while and 3 of which weren\'t intensely competing for the guy\'s affection.Verdict: 7 over 10Art:Pros: the usual eye candy and occasional fan services and Himawari has the most, Tanpopo has the swiftest.......Cons: Pansy has the worse fashion sense, even wearing a swim suit in one of those pool services and even in her out of the uniform kind of attire.Verdict: 5 over 10Sound:Pros: Good opening theme.Cons: Joro sounded like he\'s gay, Sun Chan sounded too old to be a teenager, Pansy\'s seiyuu Tomstsu Haruka was just too old to even voice a 16 year old, same thing for Cosmos seiyuu.Verdict 3 over 10Character:Pros: When it comes to giving this anime some climaxes, no one delivers it like Sanshokuin, Sumireko when she confronted Ooga, Taiyou who sets up  Kisaragi, Amatsuyu to take some shit for him, there is Akino, Sakura moment when she confronts Hanetachi, Hina  about her sand bagging Kisaragi, Amatsuyu, now these character did deliver some rather unique impact with this anime, of course there was that Hanetachi, Hina whom for the moment serves as the antagonist as she tried to destroy Kisaragi, Amatsuyu to have her for herself, also the addition of Hose, Momo and Cherry from another school provides some spice to this anime given that there is competition for Sanshokuin, Sumireko\'s affection by Hose which was something that gives this anime something different.Cons: There is that quintessential childhood friend , Aoi ""Himawari"" Hinata whom at first loves Ooga, Taiyou but later one starts to love  Kisaragi, Amatsuyu, but frankly she was more like just another competition for Kisaragi, Amatsuyu given that just like Mayama, Asaka and Youki, Chiharu. Let\'s not forget a couple of interlopers like that Momo Sakuraba and Runa Kasumi who has some infatuation with Hose, TBH, I basically see them as nothing more than excess baggage.Verdict: 7 over 10.Enjoyment:Pros: Given that this anime has presented something, hummmm, something new to the romcom harem anime, it was enjoyable given that it wasn\'t that boring.Cons: The idea that the school plans to close the library to provide the setting for the nest situation was just lame to begin with.Verdict: 7 over 10.Overall:Verdict 8 over 10.TBH, this anime wasn\'t all that bad, frankly rating this a 4 below was just an injustice since this has brought something new to the table thought I can\'t deny that there were something lame about this.

Also, when the MC breaks the 4th wall and start saying stuff as someone watching the anime it's really funny as it's not seen often.But that's exactly where it falls appart. It tries too much. It became ecchi and building humor around ecchi, let alone ecchi itself, it never end up well for me. Beside, that last episode was dogwater.

But please make no mistake, I think this show is a pretty fun romp. But I’ve seen the elevator pitch thrown around for this show. It promises “a harem show where the protagonist is the best friend gag character instead of the Harem MC”.That seems like the premise, at first. The Gentleman Gamer main character can’t get women to fall for him because they’re too busy drooling over his best friend. Given this, he tries to get laid by manipulating the femoids behind...the scenes, all while dealing with the unwanted attention, possessiveness and manipulation of the one girl he isn't horny for (who happens to look like Saki from Emergence) as well as a supernatural malicious bench that appears out of nowhere to the tune of a bootleg version of Star Wars’ Imperial March (yes, that last part is real).This all leads to the idea that we are in for some clever subversion of the genre, or at the very least an irreverent comedy with a fresh premise. Maybe it’s some sort of nasty teen drama, where all the characters are massive dicks, even? You may be getting all excited in your seat.Do not buy into this filthy deception.It rapidly becomes apparent that this is a classic harem show of the “prick with a golden heart chased by women with issues” variant (think Oregairu or Bunny-senpai). Women he interacts with start seeing the good in him and tripping over themselves to eat his meat. And all fertile females from his past or places certainly outside the plot start flocking to him from a 20 mile radius. All very standard Harem, and certainly not the subversion you may have been led to believe this was, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course. Same same. But different. But still the same.So does it stand up to scrutiny as a “prick with a heart of gold, women with issues” drama-harem show?Sort of.Its characters are unfortunately for the most part too shallow and too tropey for it to really hit home in the same way something like Bunny-Senpai might. And some of the characters definitely do some horrible shit that we could maybe laugh at in a “wow these people are terrible” style of comedy, but that just makes them hard to root for in a show that expects us to care about them. Like how Pansy is essentially an emotionally abusive GF and a stalker, both of which are criminal offenses. Or the fact that Sun-chan makes an actual, unironic rape threat (with the definite indication that he is going to follow through on it) in episode 3. Yeah. Yikes. He’s supposed to be the goofy best friend character.But is the show fun, at least?Yeah, it is. It’s full of gags and charming, (albeit superficial) characters. I wish they would have made them bigger jerks in their everyday life, I think it would have made them funnier, but you can’t always get what you want. And that Darth Vader bench-gag does get me every time. I have to admit, I binged the first many episodes of this show in one day. It has a nice flow and can be pretty hot at times. And the mini-plots of each arc are pretty engaging and don’t outstay their welcome. It’s definitely an enjoyable watch, if you’re into something lighter.So, should you watch this show if you’re looking for a high-concept comedy that takes the piss out of harem tropes by turning them on their head? Probably not, you’ll just be left with a bitter taste in your mouth as you discover the true harem nature of the show.Should you watch this if you’re looking for a good Bunny-senpai style drama/comedy/harem/romance? Only if you’re out of other good options.Should you watch this if you’re looking for low-effort-required fun harem with a main character that’s a bit of a prick? Yeah, probably. the scenes, all while dealing with the unwanted attention, possessiveness and manipulation of the one girl he isn't horny for (who happens to look like Saki from Emergence) as well as a supernatural malicious bench that appears out of nowhere to the tune of a bootleg version of Star Wars’ Imperial March (yes, that last part is real).This all leads to the idea that we are in for some clever subversion of the genre, or at the very least an irreverent comedy with a fresh premise. Maybe it’s some sort of nasty teen drama, where all the characters are massive dicks, even? You may be getting all excited in your seat.Do not buy into this filthy deception.It rapidly becomes apparent that this is a classic harem show of the “prick with a golden heart chased by women with issues” variant (think Oregairu or Bunny-senpai). Women he interacts with start seeing the good in him and tripping over themselves to eat his meat. And all fertile females from his past or places certainly outside the plot start flocking to him from a 20 mile radius. All very standard Harem, and certainly not the subversion you may have been led to believe this was, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course. Same same. But different. But still the same.So does it stand up to scrutiny as a “prick with a heart of gold, women with issues” drama-harem show?Sort of.Its characters are unfortunately for the most part too shallow and too tropey for it to really hit home in the same way something like Bunny-Senpai might. And some of the characters definitely do some horrible shit that we could maybe laugh at in a “wow these people are terrible” style of comedy, but that just makes them hard to root for in a show that expects us to care about them. Like how Pansy is essentially an emotionally abusive GF and a stalker, both of which are criminal offenses. Or the fact that Sun-chan makes an actual, unironic rape threat (with the definite indication that he is going to follow through on it) in episode 3. Yeah. Yikes.

He is in fact much more unkind than expected but he has got a lot to deal with. Initially, he has his childhood friend Aoi Hinata and Sakura Akino the student council president who he is very close too. They both want to see him and confess their feelings but initially, it doesn't go how he thought it would. Then a new girl, the one he thinks is weird Sanshokuin Sumireko appears and he ends...up on a bench once again. He fears what will happen and a confession occurs.As the show progresses the harem style show begins building with the possibility of a single girl resolution. Although a harem is what he wants he does realise it won't work in the long run. His personality, however, makes it difficult to act.Many dramas occur along with the show that put Joro into weird situations that make various girls appear with similar but varying intentions. Thus we have Joro and Bench-Kun in their adventure to find out who loves who.The art style of the show is very good. It works really well and makes it enjoyable. The cameos from shows that appear at times are great and the Bench scenes especially when Hina Hanetachi appears are just wonderful.The OP for the show is great. Within a few seconds, it is a really catchy opening to then a great song. The ED as expected is also great and very suitable for the show.Characters:Amatsuyu Kisaragi (Joro) the main character with a split personality. He is actually just someone trying to find himself and is actually a pretty touching character in that respect. He ultimately is trying to find his place. He goes through many hardships but also many funny scenes.Taiyou Ooga (Sun-chan) a star on the baseball team. He is the best friend of Joro and has an equally twisted personality. He is a very hard character to like and enjoy how he is.Aoi Hinata (Himawari) the childhood friend of Joro that is a tennis star. She is one of a varying love mess that changes throughout the course of the show.Sakura Akino (Cosmos) the student body president. She is known by her nickname due to her beauty that is rivalled by few.Sumireko Sanshokuin (Pansy) is the main female in the show and is very interesting. Her revelation during the show is amazing and her personality is just wonderful when put up around the others.My favourite character in the show for she is like a dream is Hina Hanetachi (Asunaro) is from the newspaper club and is in love like many girls. She is a simple character who you figure out fights off the loneliness that she wants to fill. She goes to lengths perhaps the wrong way to get what she wants. She has a hard fight going forward.Although many more characters can be written about there is one that is just unexpected during the show:Asaka Mayama the 'gal character' (known as Sasanqua). She is somewhat hostile towards one of the guys in the show but later after a revelation at the swimming pool about the type of girl the guy likes she takes a huge u-turn in how she is. She is a great character too being that she is the textbook Tsundere character.The show is an absolute enjoyment. It has got many typical tropes and situations but it is done in a refreshing way. Although it is going towards a harem it also has the potential to go in many directions.The show has OVAs under planning and a second season could come easily.

But boy howdy was it worth the wait for me.With how it's been built up, it's quite a unique story, something that I certainly haven't seen done as of yet. Along with the fact the pacing doesn't feel rushed at all. It also gives off the vibe that you may not know what is going to happen next. As what is used in the show, could possibly be dragged out more, but it's fit perfectly to tell a good story.The characters are rather interesting too. Sure, some may seem like regular characters that you...see in most anime. But that doesn't make them bad in the slightest. But I believe their personalities really go with the flow of the anime, and make for a great experience.If you still haven't watched this as of yet, you should give it a shot! A few eps in won't take that long at all! I'm looking forward to more episodes, and so should you! see in most anime. But that doesn't make them bad in the slightest.

A few eps in won't take that long at all! I'm looking forward to more episodes, and so should you!"", 'Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo (aka. OreSuki) presents itself as a comedic subversion of your bog-standard harem romcom following the (mis)adventures of Watering Can Boy (aka. Joro), as he attempts to build his own high-school harem fantasy.Though the premise is initially promising a harsh and cynical subversion of its genre, trashy teenage drama, an inconsistent tone and shenanigans galore completely dominate this show, which ultimately is an mixed bag of an attempt at meta humor of the average harem romcom.< STORY: 4>As with most other romcoms, the story of OreSuki is definitely its biggest weakness. It is intended as a play...on the typical, clichéd story where the MC is a naive and innocent ""nice guy"" that gets surrounded by love interest by essentially just being nice to them at the exact right moment, devoid real life logic and acting as pretty obvious escapist fantasy. Except, instead of a a typical romcom MC, you get Joro, who is supposedly a scumbag high schooler that has kept a front as said typical MC in order to create his own harem fantasy, only for things to go south very quickly for his plans, and for the story itself overall.Even though the show makes an honest attempt at delivering on its premise, much of the runtime of OreSuki after its first arc is spent developing its supporting cast rather that look for ways to keep its initial formula fresh, and this comes at the expense of underdeveloping its main cast or having them behave in ways that fly in the face of said premise. Most of the time this creates an inconsistent plot that demands you keep your suspension of disbelief held on tight, as it can really test your patience when the characters act in counter-intuitive ways simply because the plot demands.A lot of the problems that create the inconsistencies of the show have to do with how it tries (and fails) to deliver its more serious, emotional bits: appealing to the ""good"" side of Joro, as a person who cares for his friends. This crutch allows for some drama to ensue throughout the show\'s run but this drama is not very interesting and it creates some serious issues with the MC\'s character down the line, but I\'m getting ahead of myself.At the very least, the story is not a complete failure, as the comedy is biting and unapologetic when it takes central stage at many points in the story, especially when it acts as means to make fun of the characters (most commonly Joro). Unfortunately, many of its jokes ultimately fall into lampshading rather than parodying or making fun of, tropes typical to romcoms, as OreSuki utilizes many of them in its story and plays them completely straight, maybe with some meta commentary by another character (again, most commonly Joro). So in the end, the comedy shines when it tries, it just doesn\'t try hard enough, or frequently enough.< ART: 6 >The visuals of this show are pretty good for a romcom, though not without its hiccups.In terms of its animation, OreSuki just gets the job done and calls it a day. Very few moments in the show have more than the bare minimum of animation, though it doesn\'t dip in quality in any unintended way throughout its run.However, besides consistent animation quality and mostly decent character designs, this show doesn\'t provide anything else in terms of its visuals, with somewhat bland and boring backgrounds that you could find in any other high school anime ever. Nothing is outstanding in its background art and that unfortunately drags it down a bit.< SOUND: 5>There is not much to be said in terms of the sound direction of the show. The sounds of the show are very average and unappealing.The music of the show is very unremarkable, with a pretty standard J-Pop OP and a cutesy ED sung by the actresses playing the main girls of the show. Nothing new under the sun. The rest of the soundtrack also turned out to be lacking in memorability, with no standouts among its tracks.The VAs performed effectively and did a good job delivering their lines, though there were a couple of questionable casting choices along the way.< CHARACTER: 5>The characters are very conflicting in this show. For every great moment there tends to be a questionable one along the way. This is particularly true for the MC.Watching the characters of OreSuki is an exercise in patience as it not apparent what their true motives are most of the time (we only get to see into Joro\'s thoughts) and the author takes full advantage of this, but mostly to the detriment of the story. Though initially portrayed as a manipulative bastard of sorts, Joro is, in the grand scheme of things, naive and all too willing to accept the goodwill of others as genuine, which completely shatters the initial image presented to us the audience. Joro styles himself a puppeteer but is more often than not one of the puppets  instead, manipulated by someone else\' plan. This damages his character greatly, to the point that you may question how much of a scumbag or even a subversion of the romcom MC, he really is.The other characters of the show are just as troubled, as the main cast is either trope-y or inconsistent in some way. The girls (with the exception of Pansy) are all defined by their stereotypes and, though they who glimmers of being more than meets the eye, they are not developed well enough for this to really show. Sun-chan, the best friend, suffers from similar problems to Joro mostly because their intertwined character arcs and ultimately is a very awkward character to watch in the story. And lastly, Pansy herself is put in a bit of a pedestal despite being a rather nasty person. While it doesn\'t hold true the whole way through it does for most of the show and so it becomes a character upon which most of the story revolves around despite her relatively inactive role after the first arc.In the end, OreSuki suffers from not being able to sell its characters. It shoots for ""true characters"", those that are great because of their personality, their ""larger-than-life""-ness, however it constantly shoots itself in the foot by trying to also go for ""real characters"" with realistic motivations and behavior, with a compromise in the middle of both that doesn\'t work. As an example, the motivations of Joro are not realistic in that his harem fantasy is of course in the realm of la-la land, however this is supposed to be the main driver of his actions and it fails to really convey this after the first arc because it gets side-tracked trying to make him more likeable as a person, in the end breaking his initial character and making him hard to like as a character overall.< ENJOYMENT: 7>Now I\'ll come out clean and say that despite its obvious flaws, OreSuki was a relatively enjoyable show. I consider myself a bit of a romcom junkie (more for the ""com"", than the ""rom"") and have no problem giving them at least a chance to convince me to watch all the way through, even if they look pretty trashy. OreSuki is one such show and even though it had plenty of moments that put me off, the comedy of the show vastly redeemed it in my eyes despite its clumsy attempts at teen melodrama and consistent character issues. The few recurring gags of the show were well executed for the most part and the timing of the show rarely fails to deliver jokes which was great, but I could never become invested in the story as much as I would want to and that prevented me from giving it a higher score here.< TL; DR >OreSuki is a show that is too caught up in trying to make fun of trashy harem romcoms to look at how much of a trashy harem romcom it is. No amount of lampshading and meta humor can forgive it for this. Despite trying to subvert expectations it ultimately falls in line with many romcoms of its type before it.Good comedic timing and competent visuals and voice acting are about all this show can offer and that is shame. If you enjoy romcoms no matter how self-indulgent they are, have a go at it, but know that this far from a perfect show.<<Overall Score: 5.4/10 = 5 >> on the typical, clichéd story where the MC is a naive and innocent ""nice guy"" that gets surrounded by love interest by essentially just being nice to them at the exact right moment, devoid real life logic and acting as pretty obvious escapist fantasy.

One day ""Jouro"" suddenly got two phone calls from a girl, she was named ""Sakura Akino"" and ""Aoi Hinata"".  ""Jouro"" who get a call from a girl immediately rushed to meet them, ""Jouro"" felt that he would be shot by the two girls, like the romantic story ""Jouro"" came with a nervous feeling.  After meeting the girl, ""Jouro"" was surprised because what the two girls said was not like what ""Jouro"" imagined.  That way the story of OreSuki begins...There are things that make me interested in this. If...you\'ve watched this, I\'m sure you are familiar with this word ""chair"".  Each anime has its own ""signature"" such as ""Steins Gate"" with its time machine, ""Kuzu no Honkai"" with a love triangle, ""One Piece"" with the number of episodes, ""Angel Beats"" with the ending, ""No Game No Life"" with strategies in  the game, while ""OreSuki"" with the same seat in each episode.  Those that I mentioned have their own ""signature"".  In fact, they make this to show that their work has characteristics that only they have.What does ""Chair"" have to do with the storyline?  Of course, they do not have a relationship to the storyline but a setting, atmosphere, and time are created to support the storyline, so even though it has no connection to the storyline, this is a supporting point to add an impression of the storyline to make it seem unique.  With the appearance of a similar ""chair"" and ""situation"" in each episode, I thought this ""joke"" would not be funny anymore.  If you have friends who like to ""joke"" are you going to laugh with the same ""joke""?  But seeing the same ""situation"" and ""place"" isn\'t bad either.  in each episode even with the same ""situation"" and ""place"" I feel like laughing even though their ""joke"" is repeated continuously.Am I just going to talk about chairs?  Of course I didn\'t, if I were only talking about chairs, I\'m sure this won\'t get much ""helpful"" even the moderator will delete this.  Therefore, press the ""Helpful"" shucks.The above expression is just kidding xD.  Most of you who visit here must be from ""Youtube"", ""Facebook"", ""Instagram"", and others.  After seeing a sexy, big-breasted, and beautiful character.  You guys commented on Youtube, Facebook and Instagram pages ""Kyaaa ... Senpai, who is this cute character?"", ""I need an anime title!"", ""This girl is"" waifu ""this year"".  I know those who comment like that are ignorant publics aroused by a picture.  Ma, I don\'t deserve to say that because I\'m also someone like that xD.The girl you fought over on ""Youtube"", ""Facebook"", or ""Instagram"" was named ""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" aka ""Pansy"", thank me for telling me who the girl in the ""Youtube"" thumbnail was jerked.  ""Pansy"" is an ugly girl, with glasses, two braided hair, a nerd, a stalker, a loner, basically all kinds of bad things gather on her xD.  behind the figure there is a secret, where ""Pansy"" must maintain his appearance to avoid someone.""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" is the heroine in this story, sometimes it can be beautiful, ugly, even become a traitor.  Despite having many advantages ""Pansy"" has a unique taste in choosing a man.  For now ""Pansy"" is in love with ""Jouro"", he is the main character in this story.  Why is Pansy taste so unique in choosing men, whereas many cool men fall in love with her but why should it be with Jouro?  ""Jouro"" is a typical character who plays anti-social, even though he is a main character in the story, but ""Jouro"" often rejects himself as the main character in this story.  Even ""Jouro"" prefers to be a supporting character.  behind its nature is actually ""Jouro"" is the type of person who works hard and never gives up when asked for help by anyone, even though it is pointless for ""Jouro"".It\'s not just ""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" that has a secret.  It turns out that ""Amatsuyu Kisaragi"" aka ""Jouro"" also has a secret.  His kind heart turned out to have a secret, where ""Jouro"" used to be a person who often spoke harshly, perhaps in his sentences containing some harsh vocabulary, and ""Jouro"" hid it.  The one who knows the secret of ""Jouro"" is ""Pansy"" sometimes ""Jouro"" shows his true nature to ""Pansy"" to frighten ""Pansy"" but it turns out that ""Pansy"" likes the nature of ""Jouro"" like that, maybe since ""Baseball Tournament"" Pansy started to fall in love  with ""Jouro"".Baseball tournament?  What\'s more, get off the stage right now!  The basis of the writer of the deceit * cheers of the reader shown to me *In addition to ""chair"" it turns out that ""baseball tournament"" also have a relationship like ""chairs"", I mean ""baseball tournament"" often have to do with the ""jokes"" in this anime.  Simply put if ""Chair"" is a ""spoon"" then ""Baseball tournament"" is a ""fork"".  In every heroine who asks for help from ""Jouro"" they always say these two things ""Chair"" and ""Baseball tournament"".  Even though their ""jokes"" are repeated sometimes it still makes me want to laugh.The storyline they present is very good, moreover this is a love story ""romance comedy"" so it\'s no wonder their comedy is still fresh even though some ""jokes"" are repeated in each episode.  To be honest, after completing this anime, watching it every Thursday ""Thursday"" is only good at the beginning, after entering a few episodes, it feels boring.  I mean this anime was only good in the beginning because the story is still ""fresh"" but after entering further, this anime seemed to take me to the bottom of the ""sea"" as a result most episodes were making me bored, like watching ""Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood""  .  Maybe it only happens to me, so it all depends on each taste.  Even so, I can\'t betray my words, because this is basically a good anime compared to harem anime and other romantic comedies, at least superior to others.Adaptation comes from ""Light Novel"" I think most of the anime adaptation comes from ""Light Novel"" as their source of inspiration, even rarely studios that adapt anime come from ""Visual Novel"" as their source of inspiration.  The adaptation that comes from ""Visual Novel"" is ""Grisaia series"", ""H2O: footprins"", ""Amagami SS"", and others.  I\'ve never read this before so I can\'t ""compare"" this with the ""Light Novel"" version.  Sometimes ""studios"" sort out some of the scenes that will appear in the anime, such as some anime that stray far from ""Light Novel"";  You-zitsu and Kaguya-sama, you could even say the ""studio"" is actually reading the light novel or not.I think the design and graphics are good, although the adaptation of ""LN, VN, Manga"" does not really affect the quality of the anime adaptation.  They only take a few, such as character design, storyline, and others.  For voices ""Voiced by"" there is nothing to comment on because I don\'t really understand this part, other than that for OP and ED it is also good because I think it is ""good to hear"" and that reason seems to be enough to prove it.It seems like it\'s been quite long, overall I like this anime starting from the storyline to graphic design.  From most of the anime I\'ve watched this season, it seems like one of the best for me is ""OreSuki"". you\'ve watched this, I\'m sure you are familiar with this word ""chair"".  Each anime has its own ""signature"" such as ""Steins Gate"" with its time machine, ""Kuzu no Honkai"" with a love triangle, ""One Piece"" with the number of episodes, ""Angel Beats"" with the ending, ""No Game No Life"" with strategies in  the game, while ""OreSuki"" with the same seat in each episode.  Those that I mentioned have their own ""signature"".  In fact, they make this to show that their work has characteristics that only they have.What does ""Chair"" have to do with the storyline?  Of course, they do not have a relationship to the storyline but a setting, atmosphere, and time are created to support the storyline, so even though it has no connection to the storyline, this is a supporting point to add an impression of the storyline to make it seem unique.  With the appearance of a similar ""chair"" and ""situation"" in each episode, I thought this ""joke"" would not be funny anymore.  If you have friends who like to ""joke"" are you going to laugh with the same ""joke""?  But seeing the same ""situation"" and ""place"" isn\'t bad either.  in each episode even with the same ""situation"" and ""place"" I feel like laughing even though their ""joke"" is repeated continuously.Am I just going to talk about chairs?  Of course I didn\'t, if I were only talking about chairs, I\'m sure this won\'t get much ""helpful"" even the moderator will delete this.  Therefore, press the ""Helpful"" shucks.The above expression is just kidding xD.  Most of you who visit here must be from ""Youtube"", ""Facebook"", ""Instagram"", and others.  After seeing a sexy, big-breasted, and beautiful character.  You guys commented on Youtube, Facebook and Instagram pages ""Kyaaa ... Senpai, who is this cute character?"", ""I need an anime title!"", ""This girl is"" waifu ""this year"".  I know those who comment like that are ignorant publics aroused by a picture.  Ma, I don\'t deserve to say that because I\'m also someone like that xD.The girl you fought over on ""Youtube"", ""Facebook"", or ""Instagram"" was named ""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" aka ""Pansy"", thank me for telling me who the girl in the ""Youtube"" thumbnail was jerked.  ""Pansy"" is an ugly girl, with glasses, two braided hair, a nerd, a stalker, a loner, basically all kinds of bad things gather on her xD.  behind the figure there is a secret, where ""Pansy"" must maintain his appearance to avoid someone.""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" is the heroine in this story, sometimes it can be beautiful, ugly, even become a traitor.  Despite having many advantages ""Pansy"" has a unique taste in choosing a man.  For now ""Pansy"" is in love with ""Jouro"", he is the main character in this story.  Why is Pansy taste so unique in choosing men, whereas many cool men fall in love with her but why should it be with Jouro?  ""Jouro"" is a typical character who plays anti-social, even though he is a main character in the story, but ""Jouro"" often rejects himself as the main character in this story.  Even ""Jouro"" prefers to be a supporting character.  behind its nature is actually ""Jouro"" is the type of person who works hard and never gives up when asked for help by anyone, even though it is pointless for ""Jouro"".It\'s not just ""Sumireko Sanshokuin"" that has a secret.  It turns out that ""Amatsuyu Kisaragi"" aka ""Jouro"" also has a secret.  His kind heart turned out to have a secret, where ""Jouro"" used to be a person who often spoke harshly, perhaps in his sentences containing some harsh vocabulary, and ""Jouro"" hid it.

It presented us with a protagonist that looked a bit like a dick and a love interest that was diabolical. It also gave the impression that it was going to be a crazy comedy with a nasty MC and useless antics from female characters. But somehow it devolved into a generic, run of the mill harem. The MC who was supposed to be a dick turned out not to be one and I found it odd that they kept calling him a dick and he never acted like one. Then the love interests. Personally, the only one that seemed...to have a distinct personality was Pansy. Everyone else kinda felt the same and I could easily transpose one character for another. Also, I couldn't for the life of me understand why the MC wanted to reconcile with his 'best friend' after an incident that if it had happened in the real world could have led to an arrest or at least some serious consequences.

However, any good credence it started off with was lost as the episodes went on, and by episode 10 I feel like it's lost its way and become somthing trope-y.It weaves an interesting romance web, and then spoils it by linking everyone into it, which is it's major downfall.Although the VAs, sound, art and production value are generally good, there are occasions when it doesn't quite mix properly, or where it's clear they skimped on art or animation, or prioritised some aspects over others.In the end, it wraps up as...being a promo for a second season or OVA, which, for a 12 episode run with as much content packed in as it has, could've been played out far better by stretching the first 8 or so into a longer run and saving the last few for a special OVA or small, second series.

On his date with Cosmos she suddenly confesses her love! Not for him though, but for his friend Taiyou Ooga, known as Sun-chan, the baseball team's ace.

Then- it happens again with a second girl- both in favor of his Chad best friend. So he begins to basically simp, giving them advice to succesfully date his best friend while he vows to settle for the sloppy seconds, revealing himself to be an awful lecher wearing the mask of a harem MC. Good premise for a season right? Maybe 2 if...they stretch it.Well, they decide to change it after 3 fucking episodes. After that it just turns into a torture porn for Joro, where he becomes ostracized from his entire class and friends and bullied by everyone twice in the first few episodes. So its a torture porn for a deserving lecher, ok, i got it.Nope! Then it just becomes a harem. A harem with a WaCkY coat of paint, with a MC who knows all about romcom harem tropes, but thats about it. We have Cosmos, whos kind of a yandere but not really (another messy character, albeit a highly enjoyable and cute one) and the childhood friend who is so bogstandard i forgot her name. Shes short, brown hair, excitiable, young. Everything youve thought f when i said those words describes her. Completely lacking any original thought.Theres also the rancid bitch of a journalist- shes bad enough just simply being a journo cockroach, but, like most journalists, she decides to ruin someomes life for her own personal gain and, like most journalists, gets little to no flack for it. Why Joro decides to even entertain the idea of talking to this wench who made him a pariah just to get closer to him is beyond me.Then theres Sumierko, a boring ugly girl who people like because shes secretly hot. Shes boring as shit and basically the female version of a brickheaded harem MC. If you like her and want her to win you enjoy plain toast, only the most flavorless vanilla ice cream, and probably partake in licking your table for its decadent flavor.Anyway, it gets bored of being a harem because this is the anime version of a petulant child so after a swan song fanservice waterpark episode it becomes a fucking psychological drama for its last few episodes, before becoming Kaiji for 1/4 an episode  and then the series ends.Whoever the fuck directed this needs to sit down and stop taking adderall.

First 3 eps were amazing, they had everything you would want to see after watching anime for decades and seen it all. It was funny, unpredictable and at the same time hilariously predictable. Characters were wearing ""masks"" so you had no idea what they really think or what will do. Using each other like sociopaths just to get what they want without caring about others. You had love triangle on top of love triangle...on top of love triangle. You could have gone in so many directions with such start, but you did THIS?! I feel violated and need a cold shower.First 3 eps gave me flashbacks of doki doki literature club. You have no idea whats going to happen next, maybe your childhood friend going to hang her self after rejection, maybe you would have to delete win32 folder to see the last ep. It had so much potential. Its like they fired everybody that was involved with first 3 eps and hired new people and they just copy pasted characters from any other harem club anime.Ep 4 came and everything was dead, from characters to comedy and it got so predictable it was painful. If you are making fun of other anime where main character gets all the girls for no reason, why now he is pulling girls like he is some pussycat magnet. What happened to the characters, why they become generic clones of each other with personality of toilet paper (cheap one). Its like incel took control of the plot and characters and decided that if you are generic nice guy that does what ever others wants them to do he will drown in pussycats.

I am glad that many people have same opinion as me.Why??Because this anime puts every stereotyp and cliche that...can and make the opposite or at least they joke about it.This anime a bit explores bonds, showcase selfishness etc.  but in different way that will feel unnatural but in harsh reality it happens and that not many have in romcom. At least every five minuts I was laughing and pausing anime so i can wave my head or hands in shock how unbelievable good the scene or comedy was for me.For example white bench joke isn t overused and repetitive like some other anime tend to overuse also not many animes have breaking 4th wall talking to audience (remember this and that episode ....., today we have finally awaited fan service swimsuit episode and so on).Character development here unfortunately doesnt exist, and all girls characters are your usual cliche beauty,childhood friend etc. Many of you will not like MC personality he wants a girlfriend and later in anime maybe he will have many of them and he is hiding his ""true nature"" that is a bit twisted. He is  a shallow person and in reality many of us are or at least we had similar thoughts while hiding our true intent and faking in front some people.I think the biggest problem for some people besides characters will be first arc (3 episodes) will probably feel somewhat unnatural because of bonds , friendship , forgiveness and so (without spoiling anything) but i have experienced and seen similar drama in real life and some people would make the same decisions in similar cases. First arc in manga is a little different ( I went to read bcs couldnt wait for next episode) is a bit more dramatic, darker while in anime they turned it in comedy and joke. I liked both differences  but is was wise choice to turn down drama to more comedy because it had already felt a little unnatural and that would be to much  and repulsive for audience. can and make the opposite or at least they joke about it.This anime a bit explores bonds, showcase selfishness etc.  but in different way that will feel unnatural but in harsh reality it happens and that not many have in romcom.

Protagonist is a bit of a d*ck, but his experiences are real (the part-time job thing especially) and it hit close to home at one moment. The characters also try to see the good in the protagonist, because they're just as damaged as he is.The anime actually teaches really good lessons in self-care and treating others well, but I feel this...is muddled between all the fanservice, the harem aspect and the not-so-funny comedy. It got such a high score for me (6 is good) because of these lessons and how it might impact someone who's just watching it on a whim like me, but otherwise it'd easily get a 3 or a 4.Worth it?Depends on your tastes. If you want some silly high school slice of life, go for it. If you're looking for a groundbreaking anime, I'd skip it. is muddled between all the fanservice, the harem aspect and the not-so-funny comedy.

I love how self-aware this anime is when it\'s making fun of typical harem tropes and how Joro is constantly addressing the audience with his internal monologues. This series definitely has a unique way of showing comedy and its great because of it. Honestly this is the third review Ive done this season with anime that are super unique, its great.Speaking of comedy, it\'s great. Honestly, some of the best I\'ve seen. It plays on the tropes of...typical anime so well and since we\'ve all grown accustomed to the normal stuff when Oresuki\'s first episode starts you\'re immediately thrown out of the loop and immediately intrigued and engaged. I love the idea of Joro trying to be this typical main harem protagonist only for him to actually be an absolutely scummy guy that the series somehow makes us love just like Konosuba did with Kazuma.This series has a unique way of doing things when it comes to characters. Basically, DONT TRUST ANYONE!! Anyone and everyone is lying to you every second. By the time I was 3/4s through this series, I became one of the most pessimistic people on earth lol. I doubted every new character and immediately started thinking ""So what scheme have you got for us this time?"". Himawari is probably my favourite female character with Pansy coming in second. I didn\'t like Pansy at first because of the way she was portrayed but as this series is built on schemes when the conflict is over and everything gets revealed you end up liking the characters by the end of them despite what they\'ve said and done. You\'ll definitely not find a cast like Oresuki\'s anywhere else.Now the music is beautiful. Both the ED and OP and catchy as all hell and I never skipped them once. Both of them are strong contenders for the best of the season with the ED practically winning it immediately. I absolutely love the voice of the main singer in the OP with her unique voice which is different from normal ones. It\'s hard to describe but she has a certain accent or way of singing that is appealing as hell.The art style is equally as good with all its bright colours to bring out the best in the girls. I like how it plays with the colour scheme with certain characters to add to their facade and make them seem nice and innocent. The eyes, especially in this series, are really nice and shiny which helps with reactions. It good contrast the main character, Joro, is full of dark colours and wears a normal black uniform to show his side character status which the series promotes really well.Now one complaint I do have about Oresuki which is that it sadly towards the second half of the series ditches its original concept of ""Are you the only one who loves me?"" which is the reason I got interested in this series in the first place and leans more towards normal harem territory. However it still manages to keep its quality comedy going for a bit longer before it gets to the ""end of slice of life anime serious episodes"" so it wasn\'t experience ruining. I still loved this anime until the end.Its a shame it ended on a cliffhanger for it to be settled in an OVA but they executed it well enough that I\'m looking forward to seeing what happens. Speaking of that the last episode luckily rekindled the original appeal of the series so in my opinion it overall ended up being a great experience.9/10 Had some of the best comedy I\'ve seen. I would definitely recommend to those who are sick of harem anime like I am.

(It\'s still a harem anime though just not a typical one.)', ""Oresuki is the anime serialisation of a LN by a mysterious, seemingly unknown author, known as Rakuda. I say that because i actually can't find any information about the author online through conventional means like Wikipedia and the major anime media platforms including, but not limited to MAL; even though the [LN] quality looks good enough one would expect to see some kind of bread crumb trail to other material. Normally I wouldn't delve this deep for a review because I prefer to do reviews as stand alone pieces, in an isolated environment (typically without referring to their source material) because i feel that is...how a lot of people watch anime. Casually. The who and the why isn't always important when people just want a brief overview of what is good and bad and if it's worth investing the time to watch it.I went this far in this case because i am finding that there is a meta in contemporary anime, particularly comedy based ones, in which anime will make fun of itself and the various tropes that get abused in popular genre's, usually in an effort to skip any serious effort in the writing to produce something that is average enough to be accepted and make a return on investment. But in the ocean of content available to us there is still a need to be innovative enough to get an edge over the competition and that's where the meta element comes into play.Right now many of the most successful titles implement this meta of not taking themselves too seriously. KonoSuba (Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!) was written in 2012-'13 and animated in 2016 and set a new standard for anime in some of the worst offending genre's for low brow content, (isekai and harem) and turned the industry on its head, ranking 338 on MAL with a popularity figure of #47. The piece isn't just a 1 dimensional show, but a social commentary on the state of anime; and now in the winter of 2019 we are starting to see an influx of the same tone of content. Cue Oresuki (Ore wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo).I'm 3 paragraphs in and i can finally start discussing the show properly with some semblance of context (it's hard to describe meta anime without context). Oresuki starts off with the same cookie cutter introduction to a faceless, personality-less, average, uninspired male protagonist that the viewers can project themselves onto to get the slice-of-life romance experience; with harem serving as the base line. But, we then find out the show has subverted our expectations by revealing that actually the character has intentionally forced himself into that personality archetype to try and contrive this slice-of-life story on himself, when in actuality he's actually a pretty devious individual.This wouldn't be the first time a show has tried to use this formula in this particular setting/genre. But is executed very well for the next 3-4 episodes in a way that is very amusing. Or at least before the show settles into the old established format. The question is, 6 episodes in, what is the show trying to achieve now that the big/classic tropes have been joked about. Was this just a basic lamp shading effect to excuse the same, otherwise common romance story. The protagonist has gone from being a 180 of the romance archetype and seemingly followed through on that 180 into a 360. The impure intentions hidden by an apparently fake facade, the redeemingly fresh, relatable personality has now turned into a double agent. But i can't tell if this was done intentionally or is an oversight in the plot. It seems weird that even deeper under the vindictive personality hidden behind a kind facade, the devious personality we have come to attach to, is actually a more superior kind personality than the one on the surface. Is this a red flag for the shows direction? The show looks to either subvert our expectations on several levels or run out of momentum.All that said and done, the humour is consistently spot on and well executed. The aesthetics are all there and the characters are complex and relatable. I am very close to putting this show in a top X list if somebody asked me something to recommend them.

Skin crawl factor aside, that first quote goes to the heart of why Oresuki was such a letdown. It\'s just way too much in love with itself, and way too certain that it can do no wrong.

There\'s the whole problem with Oresuki. Why would anyone say that in a creepy way to someone they are smitten with (especially after demonstrating they have been watching far too closely). If you ask yourself that you are going to ask ""why does anyone in this series do anything they do ??""  None of it makes the slightest bit of sense.  It\'s impossible to relate to these characters.

How an absurd comedy harem made me care about their characters, in real life relationships, and my view to the world. Call it fate, for me to have watched this anime 9 or so months ago, and the ova coming up right when I was in a deep doubt. A lot is said and done in the anime, which makes a lot of you weebs confuse about the message of the anime. I recommend you to rewatch it and pay close attention, then see the OVA which is the 13th episode. You\'ll notice that, there\'s something...quite peculiar about our MC\'s special trait. Is it a mere gag? Is he a mc we should hate? Think again. Think about you, what do you act like in front and behind of others. Have you ever meet a mc that actually acts human? If you\'re someone of culture, the name of Onizuka should sound familiar. This anime is a spiritual predecessor to his, the ridiculous comedy and its touching moments. You know already where I\'m going with this if you have watched, if you haven\'t I\'ll explain it for you. Not all in this world are hollow intentions, there is a meaning to every single one of them. The MC can be a jerk, a dumbass, and perhaps greedy. But none of these are its main intentions, there\'s something Onizuka and Joro share in common...and that is, a heart of gold. I won\'t compare other ""harem"" anime protagonist, but Joro in my opinion has the best of hearts of all the harem genre.  I hope if I convinced you, this anime helps you as well. quite peculiar about our MC\'s special trait. Is it a mere gag? Is he a mc we should hate? Think again.

Yup, that's Orewosuki.The history is not that complicated, just the normal life of some students on high school, nothing new at all but, for some weird reason, you can think this could be real, and it's because of the characters that you can relate with some of your friends for sure.The main character is not the boring good guy you are used to, he is a jerk who dreams about making his own harem but he is there for his friend, as most of 16 years...old boys, he is an idiot with good intentions and that's Yoro, the main protagonist of this anime. He is not the boring angelic guy which does everything perfect, not here, he screw things up a lot, and I mean A LOT, but he always tries his bet to solve them and that makes him the most realistic main character of a harem comedy that I've ever seen, we all have been there, we all have been total idiots when we were 16, we've messed up a ton of things but we tried our best to make things right.Sun Is his best friend, and oh my god, it's not the classic best friend of the main character which only appears on some episode for like 10 seconds and do nothing, not in here, he has his own weight on the pace of the history, and he is also a 16 year old kid which is a selfish idiot but he deeply cares about Joro and all the gang.Then we have Himawari and Cosmos, the best description of this two I heard it on a youtube video, they are 2 different kinds of idiots, one is totally useless when is a subject of academic studies but she is great with personal relationships with other people, and the other is just the opposit, and ace in high school but goes totally nuts on human relationships and she has to make plans to solve her own flaws at this particular subject.And then we have the star of the show, and my favourite waifu of the season by far, Pansy, he is really smart, he knows people really fast and sometimes really scary, it can be seemed as a bit shy but, really far from reality... she just doesn't like that much people... or at least Joro... ok let's say that she is a bit nuts. Really funny and refreshing character for the genre.And the second star of the show is the bench, if you are going to see the show you'll understand this afterwards :PWhy I say that this show is totally different of the classic harem romance comedy? Well, first of all, the characters are really active, doing things on the school, ploting (sometimes against other people of the gang), they feel so alive and realistic that is incredible, I'm sure that most of one will see something that they've done before in name of love, like kick on the ass your best friend because you like the same girl (oh boy!).This show also shows how love can make us make some really bad things to other people, not only that we feel like we can fly and love is wonderfull and all that crap, love a lot of the time is shit and miserable, and that's also part of the show, how they learn about that crapy part of love, how change people that has suffered it. (All people has suffered it)This show is a bit of a parody, I don't find a better word for this, of the rest of the genre, even the classic main character with the  classic girls of the genre appears on further episodes that shows the problems of those characters.This show is sometimes hilarious, sometimes warm and nice, sometimes sad.. just like true love.If you are going to start watching the show, watch the first 3 episodes and if you don't like it just cut it, you'll understand why when you see the whole 3 of them that makes a mini history.I don't like normally to extend myself this much on a review but there was a ton of things to say about of this show so my apologies and I hope you find this review helpfull. old boys, he is an idiot with good intentions and that's Yoro, the main protagonist of this anime.

Really funny and refreshing character for the genre.And the second star of the show is the bench, if you are going to see the show you'll understand this afterwards :PWhy I say that this show is totally different of the classic harem romance comedy? Well, first of all, the characters are really active, doing things on the school, ploting (sometimes against other people of the gang), they feel so alive and realistic that is incredible, I'm sure that most of one will see something that they've done before in name of love, like kick on the ass your best friend because you like the same girl (oh boy!).This show also shows how love can make us make some really bad things to other people, not only that we feel like we can fly and love is wonderfull and all that crap, love a lot of the time is shit and miserable, and that's also part of the show, how they learn about that crapy part of love, how change people that has suffered it.

I am somewhat of a harem anime chief myself, and this anime had a lot of potential, but it squanders a lot of good plot for repitetiveness or introducing new characters that we don't care about. I still enjoyed it and it's still better than a lot of harem anime, so I do recommend watching it if you're into that type of show. I'll break things down into more simple categories, no spoilers of course.MC: He's kind of unique, but kinda of...not. What made him unique- the writer/show didn't push more of and I wanted more. Still, he's tolerable.The girls: They are really pretty looking, but only 1 or 2 will shine or get screen time. The main interest is awesome- she's the main reason I bumped this anime a grade higher than I should have.Supporting characters: Not bad, they are more involved than you think and contribute to the main plot. You'll either love or hate them.So there you have it. I recommend the show, at least watch it half way before quitting. not.

Could become interesting...The very next day, he meets with Himawari, she cheers him up without knowing why he is so down, and after having some fun time together, they sit down on a bench, and Himawari confesses to him... that she also has feelings for Sun-chan and asks him for help. Déjà-vu time!Ok, nothing special up to now, until he is back home and totally freaks out, that him deliberately playing the rom-com MC nice guy didn\'t work out as planned, but he would just take the loser chick.That\'s when I was just like ""WHAT?! You\'re a jerk for thinking that way, though the girls would deserve it for how they ignored your feelings. But hey, you\'re not dense, so just go for it and enjoy!"" This will be fun to watch...The next day, it\'s déjà-vu time again. On his way to school, he introduces himself - but now as a mere supporting character - and meets Himawari. After receiving his daily greeting slap from her, his monologue is exactly what I am thinking when seeing situations like that in other shows.Yes, he\'s not a spineless whimp - have I already mentioned that this will be a fun show?After some first fruitless attempts to deepen the relationships between the two girls and Sun-chan, Jouro goes to the library to calm down and think a little.Enter Sumireko (""Pansy""), the glasses-wearing librarian.She cheerfully tells him she knows everything because she stalks him, and now even blackmails him to stay and talk with her.She even has gone through the effort of having a bench being express-delivered to the library room.So she invites him to sit next to her and have a talk, where she confesses to him - it\'s déjà-vu time again... that she is in love with... him! And she also knows he is acting, but prefers his Mr.-Hyde-side (she even shows him the darn book).That scene is just so hilarious! When the bench appears, there is some Darth-Vader-theme-like music. When he moves towards the bench, he walks like a robot with mecha sounds. Her text is just the same as the other two girls (well of course, because she has been stalking him), and he constantly thinks ""it\'s Sun-chan of course! Sun-chan!"". And finally the Edvard Munch (The Scream) visuals accompanied by yodeling sounds, when she confesses to him with a sweet yandere voice.Now that finally made me grinning all over, this is just freakin\' sick, whacky and twisted, gimme more! And I immedialtely binged the whole thing.The last time (at least for rom-com shows) that happend to me was ""Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru"" (NouCome).Well, some people say this show is trying to be kind of a deconstruction of the harem rom-com genre, but utterly fails at that because the MC deliberately chooses the harem route after the first arc.Of course, I don\'t know the real intentions of the original author and director.But for me, personally, it just doesn\'t feel like Oresuki was even trying to be a ""serious"" and ""intelligent"" persiflage, but a parody with many insane twists and layered personalities instead.And I really appreciate new and unique ways of telling a story, and how Oresuki matches my (obviously) odd sense of humour.The MC is not just a spineless and dense whimp without personality like many other harem or rom-com MC\'s, or an open pervert like Issei  from Highschool DxD (but he has his charm in his own).Some call him spineless because he calls Himawari and Cosmos bitches and goes for the harem route, but to be straight honest and blunt, they actually were bitches treating him like that in the first arc. And it\'s comedy after all, so get a grip.In fact, he has a quite kind personality who tries to help others, but also has a darker and more selfish side.But that\'s not a bad thing, nearly everyone has some hidden dark sides, and for me, this makes a character far more relatable and believable (although not the full extent, because this is a comedy show) than a personality-less whimp who finally miraculously gets a girl.The only thing about him I could absolutely not bear, is the fact that he wants to make up - and actually makes up - with Himawari, Cosmos and Sun-chan after they tricked him so miserably and made him hated and mobbed by the whole school.This must be something related to Japanese culture, because it is seen in many shows.But I personally - after being tricked badly many years ago, by someone I considered a very close friend - stick to the saying ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.""Himawari, Cosmos, Sun-chan and some other girls also have that darker side and layered personalities, although their softer, honest and romantic sides are far more present later on, except at the end.Pansy is kind of special in that way, she doesn\'t even hide schemings, stalking and stuff like that.Her threats against Jouro are often misinterpreted.When she tells him to come to the library or something bad will happen, that doesn\'t actually mean she would do something to him, but if wouldn\'t have come, he would not have heard the revelation of Sun-chan\'s schemings and betrayalBut you kind of need personalities like these for running the show.You know something will happen, but will it just be something ridiculous, something bad, or even something far worse than you could imagine.The cliffhanger ending really freaked me out.Jouro seems to know confessing to Pansy and entering a relationship with her won\'t stop Yasuo (""Hose"") from approaching Pansy, so he goes for something different instead.Let aside Jouro\'s real feelings for Pansy and if she would still even accept his confession now.So he thinks of something different instead, but you just know Jouro\'s great plan will backfire really hard.And it does, oh my.You could have guessed it when Himawari and Cosmos talked with Luna (""Tsukimi"") and Momo (""Cherry""), their respective counterparts from another school.Cherry and Tsukimi are in love with Hose, but he ignores thier feelings and goes after Pansy, and they even support him.So his plan is kind of like a popularity poll between Jouro and Hose, where their respective friends and Pansy will vote after the baseball match between their schools, and the loser will be forbidden to further approach or even talk to Pansy.According to his calculations, the worst possible outcome will be a draw, and Pansy would be the deciding factor.So here comes the surprise: All three of Jouro\'s friends - Himawari, Cosmos and Hina (""Asunaro"") immediately vote for Hose.You\'ve seen that coming, right?Other than Hose\'s friends, who strictly follow the common ""we may be rivals in love, but we\'re friends after all, and we will support each other and accept any shit from our beloved"" trope, Jouro\'s friends are eager to use the opportunity to eliminate Pansy as one of their love rivals, screw the fact that Jouro wanted to help Pansy, and that they called Pansy a friend before.BAM! The end.I can only guess, but I\'m sure Tsukimi and Cherry will vote for Hose as well.So, he dug his own grave - and a deeep one at that -, how will he escape, will he escape at all?Will he be tearing strips off Himawari, Cosmos and Asunaro, and tell them to drop dead and what bitchy scum they are?Will an alien spaceship abduct him, like in good ol\' ""Life of Brian""?All in all, their reactions are quite understandable - far more than the typical happy love rival friends - but of course overly exaggerated.But you can\'t just let a show end like that, this is like ""Well, err, 12 episodes are over now, that\'s all folks, now be a good fan and go buy the LN and manga, but don\'t bother me for any kind of conclusion"". some are just like WTF?!?It\'s like a blindfolded rollercoaster ride, you know there will be ups and downs, bends and turns, inversions and helices and all that stuff, but you don\'t know what will come next, how fast the car will be moving, and how intense it will be.And here, nearly everything is really maxed out.I really enjoyed the frequent 4th wall breaks, the anti-steretypical actions, and of course ""The Bench"" accompanied by a Darth-Vader-like music theme.The singularity of that particular baseball match the year before is quite a funny running gag.The nicknames are also interesting - if you omit this and that kanji, it will become this and that - the girls are flowers, the MC is the watering can, and his best friend is the sun.Quite the message, huh?The only thing I really absolutely hated is the cliffhanger ending.Sure, there is an OVA announced (no second season though), but why not simply make 13 episodes instead of 12?I really hope the OVA will be longer than the usual 25 minutes, the 12th episode already felt quite cramped and rushed.All in all, this would have been a straight 9/10 from me, if not for that dang blue balls ""ending"".So the best I can give is 8/10.Now for a little more detailed explanations...--- BEWARE OF SPOILERS! ---The show starts introducing Jouro,our totally normal, kind, shy, dense and oblivious MC, and his cheerful energetic childhood friend Aoi (""Himawari""),of course including a small pantyshot.You see the hints of affection between each other, like it should be in any good show, right?Then, enter Sakura (""Cosmos""), the well-mannered and kind - but a little bit shy - student council president, who asks our lucky MC out on a date.After enjoying their fun date, they sit down on a bench, and Cosmos confesses to him... that she has feelings for Jouro\'s best friend Taiyou (""Sun-chan"") and asks him for help.Boom, that hit hard!

It has all the tropes common in the genre, but it\'s constantly making fun of those same tropes and the genre itself. It is the epitome of school harem and at the same time a satire of it. I consider Oresuki a masterpiece because it has all the qualities you would expect in a typical harem, and meanwhile, is able to elevate itself to the next level by being critical of those clichés you often see in animes of this genre....Everything is made in a fun and not pretentious way, so that you can still enjoy it as a guilty pleasure and be moved by the story. And even if you are not fond of harems, you can still have fun if you see it as a parody as the comedy is top tier. It repeatedly breaks the 4th wall to satirize the scenes and it\'s rich in references to famous titles like Kaiji, K-On!, OreGairu and so on, so it\'s a lot more enjoyable if you are experienced with anime and can catch on those. It also has a lot of fanservice as you would expect in this kind of anime, so be wary if this is a turn-off for you.The story is about Jouro and his relations with the other characters, there are a lot of unrequited love in the beginning with character A likes character B who likes character C stuff, and Jouro usually gets the short end of the stick. I thought the pace was a bit too fast in the beginning and tiresome when many characters were introduced and things happened one after another briskly, but I quickly got used to it after the first episodes, and it got a lot better after the first arc, with Sun-chan and Pansy\'s conflict, was solved. There are a lot of gags that are used over and over again during the anime like every character falling in love with another in the same baseball game and the famous bench joke. I didn\'t feel like they were overused and the fact hey appeared many times and in absurd ways was hilarious. The plot keeps interesting throughout the anime as many character are introduced and each affect the story in some way, it is also really unpredictable as some of those characters play big roles and others never really shine, which was a good thing to keep the viewer curious to what would happen next. My favourite scene was the flower festival\'s dance when Jouro dances with Himawari, Cosmos and Pansy and each girl has something to say, creating three interesting dialogues and showing the state of their relationship, the scene was really well animated, so it was a beautiful moment. Another really good scene that left a big impression on me was the quarrel between Pansy and Jouro in the street when they discuss his reasons to be working, again really well animated and great content, showing more of their relationship. Pansy was wonderful in this scene, showing her true form while not being lewd, really an enticing sight.The characters were the best thing for me in this show. It\'s impressive how many characters were introduced, well characterized and found their place in the story in some way or another in this short 1 core anime. They vary a lot on their personality traits and each one of them is endearing in their own way, so each person watching this anime may have a different favourite character and will root for a different girl to win the harem. All the characters have nicknames based on their names\' kanjis, which is a nice touch to give identity for the anime and build up the characterization. The character are used called by their nicknames rather than their real names, which creates a lighthearted atmosphere and highlights the bond of the characters. Also, all the girls have flowers names for nicknames, and those flowers\' features link to their personalities.Starting with the main character, Kisaragi Amatsuyu, ""Jouro"", is different from the usual main character of a harem. He is neither a super smart guy who will solve all the girls\' problems nor an oblivious and plain characters without any likeable traits whatsoever. Rather, he is a ""human"" character with many realistic traits, which makes for a relatable character. He is flawed, cunning, has questionable morals and often makes stupid decisions. But he still has good intentions and care a lot for his friends as it\'s shown many times through the anime. Due to those traits, he is a funny and likeable character, his thoughts which are exposed frequently are hilarious and play a big part in the humor of the series, he is the funniest character and the most important for the comedy for sure. The main heroine of the anime is Sanshokuin Sumireko, ""Pansy"", and, as title suggests, she is the only girl who loves Jouro at first. Pansy is introduced as a bespectacled, flat, nerdy, clever and sly girl with a plain appearance without much appeal, using a modest visual with long skirt, which contrasts with all the other girls\' short ones, and braids. That\'s until she shows her ""true form"", revealing that she is actually a really hot girl with a cute face and remarkably well endowed, and how she hides that feature is an unsolved mystery in the anime. She has a huge impact in the show as many things happen due to her manipulation of the other characters, as she is clearly the smartest character. She is kind and indulgent with Jouro, frequently showing her love for him, which creates a cute and funny relationship as he tries to avoid her. I have mixed feelings towards this character, but I like those diligent, adamant types, so she was definitely appealing to me.Akino Sakura, ""Cosmos"", is the president of the student council and on the heroines. She is a beautiful, intelligent and respectable girl who is popular with everyone in the school. It just happens that Jouro is also in the stundent council, so they have some friendly relationship from that. Despite all that, she often gets out of character, revealing to be somewhat insecure and shy, prompting a lot of comical moments. She is my favourite out of the main female characters, and I really like her relationship with Jouro that slowly develops from friendship to romance, instead of undying love from the get-go like with Pansy. Hinata Aoi, ""Himawari"" completes the cast of main characters. Himawari is Jouro\'s childhood friend. She has many characteristics of the osananajimi archetype, she is an airhead, friendly and cute girl who is already close to the main character and shows affection in a friendly way, rather than romantic. Honestly, I was not fond of Himawari, she was not as striking as the other two girls for me, both in personality and appearance, and the fact she is Jouro\'s osananajimi doesn\'t bear importance to the story, as we never get a flashback of their past nor know more about it, so the fact they have known each other for a long time seems irrelevant. I don\'t think she is a bad character, she is fine, but seems weak in character in comparison with the other two, and it never feels that her relationship with Jouro will really develop into a romance, but that\'s common for the childhood friend archetype. Even so, her scenes with Jouro are really cute, as she is not afraid to cling to him and make body contact, causing some interesting incident between them. Despite not being one of the main characters, another one who plays a big role in the story is Jouro\'s best friend Ooga Taiyou, ""Sun-chan"". Sun-chan is a popular guy, good at sports and attractive, but seems to be oblivious of the girls who like him. Further in the story, it\'s shown that he is actually pretty deceitful and that is crucial for the plot, specially in the beginning. His interactions with Jouro are mainly of a friend encouraging another and giving tips with Jouro\'s endeavours.There are also great supporting characters, some even better than the main ones. Hanetachi Hina, ""Asunaro"" is a girl who is part of the newspaper club in the scool and is another one in the harem. She is a lively, helpful and cute girl who is committed to her work in the school newspaper. She doesn\'t have a striking beauty like some of the other girls, but is really cute and has a nice personality. Still, she is somewhat insecure as it\'s shown in her introduction scene, when she is not confident in competing with the other girls. She seems to be innocent and pure at first, but shows a manipulative and shrewd side later as many other characters, that gives a spicy trait to her personality, which I liked a lot and she became one of my favourites. Mayama Asaka, ""Sazanka"", is the tsundere girl and is my favourite character in the anime. Sazanka is a the queen bee of a clique of gyarus, and there are a lot of funny interactions between them. She hates Jouro at first because she thinks he is a womanizer, but starts to like him after discovering the truth. Even so, she can\'t voice her feelings as she is so shy, so she is hostile towards him to hide it, and the scenes of her slipping out of this act are really cute. I only wish she had more screen time and importance in the story. She is only a side character who Jouro doesn\'t even recognize, so she has no real chances of winning the harem, unfortunately. She had my favourite character design at first with the pink hair, she was the cutest like that. Unfortunately, she changed it to a more plain visual with black hair, but she is still beautiful, and the fact she changed so much because of Jouro is really cute, and I can\'t fathom why he doesn\'t acknowledge her as the best girl.Youki Chiharu, ""Tsubaki"", is probably the best waifu material in the anime. Different from all the other girls, I can\'t see any flaws on her. She is beautiful, kind and tender. She is so perfect that the only problem Jouro has with her is suspecting her for being too good to be true. After that, she becomes a helpful character who will aid Jouro when he needs, without having much impact in the story, but just being a nice side character. Kamata Kimie, ""Tanpopo"", is the only relevant female character who doesn\'t take part in the harem. She is a cute airhead girl who is much smarter and cunning than she looks, which produce many hilarious interactions with Jouro. She is one of the funniest characters and is mostly there for the comical relief, but she still has her own little arc in the story when she reveals she is in love with the main antagonist Hazuki Yasuo, ""Hose"". Hose is a character who is introduced in the later half of the series out of nowhere, literally, to help Jouro. He is an obliging, tactful and friendly character who is willing to help anyone. He quickly becomes Jouro\'s friend and wouldn\'t have a reason to be his enemy, except that he likes one of the girls, which makes him a competitor for Jouro and the main hindrance in the final arc of the anime. Those are pretty much all the characters that deserve mention. There are also Hose\'s friends Tsukimi and Cherry, but despite having nice designs, it feels like they are just there and are unimportant for the series, but it\'s good to have some people on Hose\'s side and maybe they have some development in the light novel as the anime doesn\'t cover it all.The art is good, but nothing too impressive. The characters have a fine design and are nice to look at, and the scene composition is remarkable, it plays a big role in creating the atmosphere, specially in the more emotional scenes. There are some striking moments like when Pansy shows her true form and the flower festival dance scene, which was the moment the art impressed me the most. The fanservice scenes were really well done if you are into that as well.The opening and ending both have catchy songs, they are not particularly memorable but good nonetheless, I like that the opening throws so many elements of the series that you identify as you are watching the anime, and both of them have symbology with the flowers that name the girls, which I realized only by the end of the anime and was a nice touch. The voice actors did an amazing job as per usual considering the big names. Shot-out to Jouro\'s voice actor Yamashita Daiki who I think was the best one, his performance was crucial for the humor. It was particularly noticeable in the episode 9.5, which for some reason has a different entry here, when he pretty much saved the episode along with Tanpopo\'s voice actress Saek Iori. It was just an unnecessary recap of the previous episodes, but their commentary was so funny that it ended up being really enjoyable. The OST was fine, I don\'t remember any striking part, but they were used well and never felt out of place.I thoroughly enjoyed OreSuki and recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a great harem with top-notch comedy, good romance and relatable characters. I think Oresuki is a paragon of the genre and should be a model to any anime trying to be a good harem. I think this how is severely underrated by people who can\'t grasp its intentions and nuances. Everything is made in a fun and not pretentious way, so that you can still enjoy it as a guilty pleasure and be moved by the story. And even if you are not fond of harems, you can still have fun if you see it as a parody as the comedy is top tier. It repeatedly breaks the 4th wall to satirize the scenes and it\'s rich in references to famous titles like Kaiji, K-On!, OreGairu and so on, so it\'s a lot more enjoyable if you are experienced with anime and can catch on those. It also has a lot of fanservice as you would expect in this kind of anime, so be wary if this is a turn-off for you.The story is about Jouro and his relations with the other characters, there are a lot of unrequited love in the beginning with character A likes character B who likes character C stuff, and Jouro usually gets the short end of the stick. I thought the pace was a bit too fast in the beginning and tiresome when many characters were introduced and things happened one after another briskly, but I quickly got used to it after the first episodes, and it got a lot better after the first arc, with Sun-chan and Pansy\'s conflict, was solved. There are a lot of gags that are used over and over again during the anime like every character falling in love with another in the same baseball game and the famous bench joke. I didn\'t feel like they were overused and the fact hey appeared many times and in absurd ways was hilarious. The plot keeps interesting throughout the anime as many character are introduced and each affect the story in some way, it is also really unpredictable as some of those characters play big roles and others never really shine, which was a good thing to keep the viewer curious to what would happen next. My favourite scene was the flower festival\'s dance when Jouro dances with Himawari, Cosmos and Pansy and each girl has something to say, creating three interesting dialogues and showing the state of their relationship, the scene was really well animated, so it was a beautiful moment. Another really good scene that left a big impression on me was the quarrel between Pansy and Jouro in the street when they discuss his reasons to be working, again really well animated and great content, showing more of their relationship. Pansy was wonderful in this scene, showing her true form while not being lewd, really an enticing sight.The characters were the best thing for me in this show. It\'s impressive how many characters were introduced, well characterized and found their place in the story in some way or another in this short 1 core anime. They vary a lot on their personality traits and each one of them is endearing in their own way, so each person watching this anime may have a different favourite character and will root for a different girl to win the harem. All the characters have nicknames based on their names\' kanjis, which is a nice touch to give identity for the anime and build up the characterization. The character are used called by their nicknames rather than their real names, which creates a lighthearted atmosphere and highlights the bond of the characters. Also, all the girls have flowers names for nicknames, and those flowers\' features link to their personalities.Starting with the main character, Kisaragi Amatsuyu, ""Jouro"", is different from the usual main character of a harem. He is neither a super smart guy who will solve all the girls\' problems nor an oblivious and plain characters without any likeable traits whatsoever. Rather, he is a ""human"" character with many realistic traits, which makes for a relatable character. He is flawed, cunning, has questionable morals and often makes stupid decisions. But he still has good intentions and care a lot for his friends as it\'s shown many times through the anime. Due to those traits, he is a funny and likeable character, his thoughts which are exposed frequently are hilarious and play a big part in the humor of the series, he is the funniest character and the most important for the comedy for sure. The main heroine of the anime is Sanshokuin Sumireko, ""Pansy"", and, as title suggests, she is the only girl who loves Jouro at first. Pansy is introduced as a bespectacled, flat, nerdy, clever and sly girl with a plain appearance without much appeal, using a modest visual with long skirt, which contrasts with all the other girls\' short ones, and braids. That\'s until she shows her ""true form"", revealing that she is actually a really hot girl with a cute face and remarkably well endowed, and how she hides that feature is an unsolved mystery in the anime. She has a huge impact in the show as many things happen due to her manipulation of the other characters, as she is clearly the smartest character. She is kind and indulgent with Jouro, frequently showing her love for him, which creates a cute and funny relationship as he tries to avoid her. I have mixed feelings towards this character, but I like those diligent, adamant types, so she was definitely appealing to me.Akino Sakura, ""Cosmos"", is the president of the student council and on the heroines. She is a beautiful, intelligent and respectable girl who is popular with everyone in the school. It just happens that Jouro is also in the stundent council, so they have some friendly relationship from that. Despite all that, she often gets out of character, revealing to be somewhat insecure and shy, prompting a lot of comical moments. She is my favourite out of the main female characters, and I really like her relationship with Jouro that slowly develops from friendship to romance, instead of undying love from the get-go like with Pansy. Hinata Aoi, ""Himawari"" completes the cast of main characters. Himawari is Jouro\'s childhood friend. She has many characteristics of the osananajimi archetype, she is an airhead, friendly and cute girl who is already close to the main character and shows affection in a friendly way, rather than romantic. Honestly, I was not fond of Himawari, she was not as striking as the other two girls for me, both in personality and appearance, and the fact she is Jouro\'s osananajimi doesn\'t bear importance to the story, as we never get a flashback of their past nor know more about it, so the fact they have known each other for a long time seems irrelevant. I don\'t think she is a bad character, she is fine, but seems weak in character in comparison with the other two, and it never feels that her relationship with Jouro will really develop into a romance, but that\'s common for the childhood friend archetype. Even so, her scenes with Jouro are really cute, as she is not afraid to cling to him and make body contact, causing some interesting incident between them. Despite not being one of the main characters, another one who plays a big role in the story is Jouro\'s best friend Ooga Taiyou, ""Sun-chan"". Sun-chan is a popular guy, good at sports and attractive, but seems to be oblivious of the girls who like him. Further in the story, it\'s shown that he is actually pretty deceitful and that is crucial for the plot, specially in the beginning. His interactions with Jouro are mainly of a friend encouraging another and giving tips with Jouro\'s endeavours.There are also great supporting characters, some even better than the main ones. Hanetachi Hina, ""Asunaro"" is a girl who is part of the newspaper club in the scool and is another one in the harem. She is a lively, helpful and cute girl who is committed to her work in the school newspaper. She doesn\'t have a striking beauty like some of the other girls, but is really cute and has a nice personality. Still, she is somewhat insecure as it\'s shown in her introduction scene, when she is not confident in competing with the other girls. She seems to be innocent and pure at first, but shows a manipulative and shrewd side later as many other characters, that gives a spicy trait to her personality, which I liked a lot and she became one of my favourites. Mayama Asaka, ""Sazanka"", is the tsundere girl and is my favourite character in the anime. Sazanka is a the queen bee of a clique of gyarus, and there are a lot of funny interactions between them. She hates Jouro at first because she thinks he is a womanizer, but starts to like him after discovering the truth. Even so, she can\'t voice her feelings as she is so shy, so she is hostile towards him to hide it, and the scenes of her slipping out of this act are really cute. I only wish she had more screen time and importance in the story. She is only a side character who Jouro doesn\'t even recognize, so she has no real chances of winning the harem, unfortunately. She had my favourite character design at first with the pink hair, she was the cutest like that. Unfortunately, she changed it to a more plain visual with black hair, but she is still beautiful, and the fact she changed so much because of Jouro is really cute, and I can\'t fathom why he doesn\'t acknowledge her as the best girl.Youki Chiharu, ""Tsubaki"", is probably the best waifu material in the anime. Different from all the other girls, I can\'t see any flaws on her. She is beautiful, kind and tender. She is so perfect that the only problem Jouro has with her is suspecting her for being too good to be true. After that, she becomes a helpful character who will aid Jouro when he needs, without having much impact in the story, but just being a nice side character. Kamata Kimie, ""Tanpopo"", is the only relevant female character who doesn\'t take part in the harem.

I think Oresuki is a paragon of the genre and should be a model to any anime trying to be a good harem. I think this how is severely underrated by people who can\'t grasp its intentions and nuances.', 'Oresuki is a difficult show to review. The art looks quite good and I like the music as well, but this won\'t be my focus for this review.I was initially drawn in by the premise of a non-ideal romcom, where our supposed protagonist Joro doesn\'t get the ending he was hoping for all that easily. This made the first few episodes, which adhere to this premise, quite enjoyable. However, soon enough this situation is completely thrown out of the window before the midway point of the season.Suddenly we get served something that is closer to the shows that Oresuki seems to parody. The...mask of the ""NiceGuy"" that Joro plays for personal gain seems to get stuck on his face, causing him to bounce back and forth between the selfish guy he is at the start to a friendly harem protagonist with the density of a neutron star. This neutron star then collapses into a black hole under the added weight of all the girls that keep falling in love with our protag for, in my opinion, shallow reasons.During the final few episodes the show picks itself up a bit again. A new conflict emerges that does bring the show back to its beginnings, making it interesting enough to get my hopes up for a sequel.Overall I would give the first few episodes and the last one something around an 8, with everything in between something like a 3 to 4. I wouldn\'t recommend skipping the middle parts as nothing would make sense. See it as a warning that you\'ve gotta be willing to pull through some mediocre parts if you want to watch this show. mask of the ""NiceGuy"" that Joro plays for personal gain seems to get stuck on his face, causing him to bounce back and forth between the selfish guy he is at the start to a friendly harem protagonist with the density of a neutron star.

You have been warned.Based off a popular light novel series of the same name Ore Wo Suki nano wa Omae dake ka yo which is better known by its English title of Oresuki is a school-based comedy and romance themed anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if one day Amatsuyu Kisaragi a seemingly average second-year student were to as he starts his routine...school day were to suddenly receive a sudden invitation to hang out by not one but by two of his best friends both of which have their own unique charms that make them highly desirable partners as lovers for males across the school. But what will happen if rather than the happy ending that Kisaragi had sought that instead events will instead go pear-shaped and the object of their confession was not him but for his best friend instead.Within the anime industry school-based, romance stories are perhaps one of the more popular genre pairings as such stories are relatively easy to create due to both the nature of a school and how its associated activities can be conjoined with those of a student’s personal life as they enter its sacred halls. However, what drew me to Oresuki was not just the school-based romance setting but was rather its combination with the genre of comedy into its setting a move that I felt was an excellent one as it served to not only expand the many standard activities that school-based animes feature by adding a sense of amusement to them but also while doing so aid in expanding upon each of the individual characters within the series as they take part in such events while also giving the opportunity for them to shine in notable stand out moments within the series. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that while serving well to introduce the main cast of the series also did well to show the blend of school, romance and comedy genres that the series was aiming for and indeed convinced me that this series is one that I should watch till the end.The overall story of the series takes place within both the confines of the local Nishikizuta high school and its surrounding areas and follows the life of Amatsuyu Kisaragi better known as Joro a seemingly average second-year student that while on the surface is seemingly content with the routine sans boring life that he’s been having is one day presented with a seemingly miraculous opportunity when he’s invited out by two beautiful girls that screams of an obvious love confession. However, what should have been a happy ending soon turns pear-shaped as Joro finds to his shock that rather being him the object of their affections was rather his best friend. However, before the moments of despair manage to seep into his heart Joro is seemingly saved by a second love confession from the one person that Joro had least expected and one that despite him never meeting her in person seemed to know more about his daily life than he did. This was from none other than Sumireko Sanshokuin a second-year student and a member of the school’s library committee that despite looking rather unremarkable on the surface was one that had a seemingly sharp tongue and a cunning that surprised even Joro. Now presented with a complex situation in which Joro and his friends find themselves caught up in will they be able to navigate the countless traps and misunderstandings that will transpire as each of them try to pursue the one thing that they desire the most in their life which is the opportunity to be with the one person that they love or will the friendship and bonds between them shatter as they do so.Amatsuyu KisaragiAmatsuyu Kisaragi portrayed by veteran voice actor Daiki Yamashita of Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year student that attends the local Nishikizuta high school Kisaragi who prefers to be known by his nickname of Joro is on initial appearances shown to be a seemingly average high school boy that’s friendly, earnest and positive and was someone that was shown to be dependable by many on account of the number of friends that he had as well as the fact that he was nominated to be the secretary for the school’s student council. Despite this Joro was shown to have little sense of arrogance and indeed was shown to be a kind, honest and quiet person by nature that preferred to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy his time at school with his friends. Indeed, for Joro before his awakening, all he really cared for was his bonds with his friends to remain unchanged and as a result, he was shown to be very loyal to them and tries hard to help them with their problems. However, as things turn out this path was not one that was as easy to balance as one looks as events will soon prove.After the twin shocks of the confessions from his friends and from Sumireko Joro’s personality gradually begins to change as a result of the awakening within him of a side of him that had until now remained dormant. A side that can be aptly referred to as Joro the schemer. While still remaining a kind, honest and dependable person to his friends and to his school mates Joro in this side of his was shown to be someone that had a obvious boiling point to him that was shown to have a rather short fuse as shown in his explosion when confronting both Sun Chan’s scheme and in rejecting Hina’s explanation for her actions. Along with this introduction of Kisaragi’s display of anger was arguably one of Joro’s most significant developments which is the reveal of his cynical side to the viewer. While still maintaining his surface personality of being a friendly and approachable person to both his friends and his peers Kisaragi was shown to view both in terms of himself as well as his friends and their requests with a degree of cynicism that while proving amusing to us viewers also reflected well on the kind of feelings that he had towards them a development that I felt served well to expand upon Joro as a character. Indeed, with this regard it can be seen that Sumireko’s description of his personality as being akin to that of a Jekyll and Hyde one is an appropriate one. However, despite viewing his friends and the bonds that he shares with them with a degree of disdain it can be seen that he still views friendship and bonds highly and believes that they are something that should be cherished and not trampled upon. This is best seen in his attempts to help his friends with their problems and consistently putting the needs of his friends before himself even if it meant setting himself up as the villain that will be ridiculed by others. The character of Kisaragi I felt was an interesting one that I felt was both well designed and developed with his dual personality and his desire to help his friends and maintain the bond between them while expressing his own unique views on them being the most notable developments. The combination of Joro’s own naked feelings towards his friend’s requests and problems as well as his hidden feelings both positive and negative ones I felt served well to make his attempts to maintain the bond and friendship that he shares with his friends that much more heartfelt.Sumireko SanshokuinSumireko Sanshokuin portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Tomatsu of Sao and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A second-year student and a member of the school’s library committee Sumireko who is nicknamed Pansy by Joro and his friends is initially shown to be a rather plain and gloomy girl that has few if any friends within the school year and indeed is someone that has a rather negative image within her the minds of her peers. Indeed this image of her is seen to be something that Sumireko seemingly prefers as rather than make an attempt to befriend her peers she instead chose to become a member of the library committee that allowed her to manage the school library a place that more or less guaranteed that she will have a place of sanctuary for herself within the school that is seldom disturbed by others. For Sumireko nothing more can be more enjoyable for her than sitting in the library and reading one of her favorite books which is something that continued until she met a young man named Joro a man that served to intrigue her and cause her to make a surprising first move in her attempt to know more about him through her new hobby of stalking a hobby that she was shown to be quite adept at that ultimately led to both the realization that she had fallen for him and their long fated meeting that allowed both to meet each other in the real for the first time. On the surface, while a gloomy and quiet girl by nature Sumireko was shown to be a calm, composed and Intelligent person by nature that while not used to dealing with others on account of her preference for being alone was also someone that was friendly and can deal with others quite readily given time. While quiet she was also noted to be someone that had a rather sharp tongue which when combined with both her blunt nature and her skill at observing people served to make her a formidable interrogator that was adept at taking apart lies quite readily.As the series progresses and Sumireko’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that the feelings that she has towards Joro despite coming from an unusual angle are ones that are not part of a complex social experiment that she had devised but rather are ones that are both genuine and heartfelt something that she tries hard to get Joro to accept as the series progresses. While shown to be an aloof person that preferred to remain in the background Sumireko as the series goes on was shown to be similar to Joro in that she too has dual personalities that seemingly contrast with one another. In her former self that acts as her surface personality, she is shown to be a quiet but polite person that seemed determined to strike down any attempts by others to befriend her while her latter and arguably her true self was shown to be someone that was both confident, blunt and cunning that she only presents to those that have gained her trust. Despite this nature of hers however, Sumireko was also shown to be someone that was surprisingly understanding of the feelings of others which when working in parallel with her perceptive nature allowed her to give some surprisingly deep advice for Joro as she’s able to deduce the level of bonds that exists between Joro and his friends as well as the level of pain that they all feel when this is disrupted. In the beginning of the series largely as a result of her loner like existence within the school Sumireko was shown to be someone that was unused to dealing with others and as a result, was shown to be somewhat wary of Joro’s friends when she first met them to the amusement of both Joro and us viewers. However, this sense of wariness towards others gradually began to change as she got to interact with them and got to understand them as individuals all of which served to allow Sumireko to realise just how much fun having genuine friends that she can trust and interact with on a daily basis can help in making one’s own life an enjoyable one and as a result not only began to interact with them more but also show them the true self that she had until now only shown to Kisaragi a development that showed just how much being able to make friends with like-minded people that cared not for physical appearances but their inner character had on her. A development that is best shown in her determination to go out of her comfort zone to support her friends as shown in the flower dance and the visit to the swimming pool both of which are areas and events that the past version of her would not have visited let alone taken part in.Sakura AkinoSakura Akino portrayed by veteran seiyuu Sachika Misawa of Accel World and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Amatsuyu’s circle of friends within the series. A third-year student and thus an upperclassman within the series Sakura is shown in initial appearances to be a dignified, calm and quiet person by nature that’s both popular and hardworking and is someone that is seen to work hard to help others with their problems all of which served to assist her in her role as the schools student council president. While a calm and logical person by nature Sakura who prefers to be referred to by her nickname of Cosmo’s is also an intelligent person that’s also had a wide variety of life experiences that she uses to help others in her duty as SC president. However, despite Cosmo’s friendly and agreeable nature, she is someone that is shown to have a rather strong sense of pride within her that serves to hinder her in her attempts to deal with situations that she is unaccustomed to as shown in the courage that she needed to ask Joro for advice. At the same time while confident Cosmo’s was also shown to get nervous quite easily when pressed into situations that visibly stresses her and was noted to a rather interesting coping mechanism of sorts in which Cosmo’s seemingly assumes the role of an Edo period samurai which while certainly amusing to watch also showed that despite her confidence there are things that even she can’t deal with easily.As the series goes on and Cosmo’s character is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that despite her calm and composed nature she is not immune to base feelings and indeed can have some surprisingly scary mood swings. At the same time while shown to be a calm and dignified person by many that can at times make her hard to approach by those that don’t know her in reality she is someone that cares deeply about her friends and is shown to be quite vulnerable to being left isolated from them as shown in her reactions during the circle’s first split within the series where she exhibited a somewhat depressing aura despite her attempts to hide it. Due largely to the large sense of responsibility that she places on herself Cosmo’s was shown to take both the manner of friendships and her duty as Sc president very seriously and as a result, she was shown to be rather sensitive if either of these aspects goes awry. While showing well in not just how serious she treats her job as well as how loyal and caring she is towards her friends this aspect of hers also shows that Cosmo’s is also fully capable of dealing with school matters that involve her friends which is shown in her treatment of Hina’s actions where she not only demonstrated her preference for openly revealing her own thoughts and opinions regarding a matter but also demonstrating her talent for deductive reasoning in her clinical disassembly of Hina’s prepared response to her questions as she connected the inconsistencies within her statement one by one a talent that I felt showed just how she ended up taking the role of SC president within the school.Hina HanetachiHina Hanetachi portrayed by veteran seiyuu Shiori Mikami of Attack On Titan fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Joro’s classmates within the school. A second-year student and a member of the schools newspaper club where she serves as the class reporter Hina whose nickname within the school is Asunaro is shown in her initial appearances to be a positive, friendly and determined person that while diligent in her studies is also shown to be enthusiastic about her job as a class reporter and keen to uncover the truth about any rumours that she finds within the school. While shown to be intelligent and logical she was also shown to have a rather firm sense of justice and fairness and indeed she views those that violate morals with obvious disdain. While a formidable seeker of knowledge that has access to some impressive info networks Hina at her core is still a young woman that can be playful and display an innate sense of curiosity that allows her to easily bond with people that may be useful to her in her role.However, as the series goes on it can be seen that Hina’s true self is one that can be seen to be a complete contrast to her default personality. While for the most part, Hina’s core personality traits of being friendly and positive remain Hina’s true self is shown to be a surprisingly cunning and manipulative one that’s not just adapt at creating situations that can influence people’s opinions effortlessly but also situations that can serve to trap and isolate those that she has designated as targets skills that served to make great use of both her dogged determination and her own earnest desire to set things right in her eyes which is best shown in the trap that she created to entrap Joro. However, while certainly misguided in her attempts to gain what she felt was something that she felt she deserved its interesting to note that Hina was also someone that had a sense of responsibility which when combined with her desire for forgiveness made her a character that while exposed for her lies never stopped from taking responsibility for her actions and never wavered in her determination to get what she desired showing well that her feelings towards her crush was built on genuine feelings and not falsehood. The character of Hina I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her two-faced nature and her role as a classes designated reporter for the newspaper club while contrasting with each other served to neatly balance the core of her character with her honest nature cementing this further and allowing her to become an effective support character for Joro near the latter stages of the series thanks to both sense of sudden mood shifts and her desire to help her beloved.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main cast were pretty well designed and developed with each character’s design matching well with both their innate personality traits as well as their own hidden selves with notable examples being Sumireko’s default self. At the same time, I was also impressed by the hyde moments within the series that served to expand upon Amatsuyu’s inner thoughts that serve to expand the overall story pretty well.  At the same time while sparingly seen I felt that the breaking the 4th wall moments within the series by Amatsuyu also served to inject a little more comedy into the scenes that its present in a move that while surprising also proved effective at its given role. In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Papapa which was performed by new seiyuu singer Shuka Saito and Hanakotoba that was performed by the seiyuu’s who portrayed the characters of Sumireko, Cosmos and Aoi who are Haruka Tomatsu, Sachika Misawa and Haruka Shiraishi respectively. Both of these songs I felt were interesting ones that served to convey different types of feelings with the former conveying the sense that despite the chore of going to school and living an average life Joro still has a strong reason for doing so as this allows him to see, interact and have fun with his friends and pass his days bonding with and enjoying the finite amount of time that he has left as a teenager. The ending theme I felt invoked a similar feeling but in this, I felt that in addition to the forging of bonds between friends the ending theme also created a sense that by bonding with each other the trio of Sumireko, Aoi and Cosmo’s were able to not only find unity in shared desires but also in the process forge a strong bond of trust between them that was built on honesty. Both of these songs while excellent in their own ways I felt were also helped greatly by the visuals that went with them.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Daiki Yamashita, Haruka Tomatsu, Shiori Mikami and Sachika Misawa all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. For Sachika in particular her portrayal of Cosmo’s I felt represents a true return to form for her and I hope that with this role that she is able to get more upcoming roles and expand her career as a seiyuu. While not represented within the review itself due to the lack of character expansion for their characters I felt that Haruka Shiraishi and Nao Toyama also did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Aoi and Tsubaki respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Oresuki was an excellent anime that I really enjoyed with it being one of the seasons best ones. Its mains strengths in my opinion was its unique premise, an excellent story that combined traditional school-based activities with excellent comedy moments, well designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and excellent music and animation.The series overall premise and story I felt was one of the series main highlights. While school-based stories that feature its cast gradually maturing in both attitude and desires as they experience the ups and downs of both their time as teenagers and their time in the mandatory educational institution known as school is extremely commonplace within the anime industry due to the ease of which stories can be created Oresuki in my eyes is somewhat unique in that rather than merely show their development as individuals it goes one step further in showing not just the development that the mc goes through but also what his friends go through as they go through this phase of their life.Society for a teenager can be something that can be frustratingly difficult to navigate and more so when within the confines of both interpersonal relationships with your friends and the often-reactive culture that exists within schools. In such an environment’s bonds and friendships while convenient and rewarding at times can also become a frustrating burden as well that must be carefully defused and dealt with as per society’s wishes lest you create a disturbance in society that will label you as a troublemaker. In this, I felt that the series overall story did an excellent job of showing that while friendships and bonds are all well and good for someone that they can also serve to create a contrasting feeling of stress that comes from having to navigate the often winding paths of interpersonal relationships between friends that serve to both stagnate one’s development as an individual as well as one’s role within the circle due to their fear of causing change within the group. A fear that within the overall story was used to great effect to show both how much the pent-up stress of navigating the winding paths of relationships had on the mc as well as the twisted personality that it manifested within him. While society itself may see to view the frank and surprisingly blunt opinions that the mc has on his friends and their requests and subsequent pressure have on him with some amount of ridicule I believe that the effect that this had on the mc and his friends while certainly, a ground-breaking one within their relationship was also an extremely refreshing one as it allowed both the mc and their friends to realise just how stagnated their relationship had become and how much their own wishes and desires had instead of allowing them to become closer had instead served to only create distance and tension within the group. While certainly a shocking revelation I felt that this served well as a catalyst that allowed each character to re-evaluate just what is more important within their lives and what kind of direction and role they want to achieve in both society and within the circle of friends that they had worked so hard to create.In overall I feel that as an final score I believe that Oresuki deserves a final score of 8/10 for while it had an excellent premise, story, characters, and voice acting I felt that some of its characters did not receive enough development to make them interesting with relation to the story with some being rather flat despite having decent setups for them that could have been taken advantaged off. school day were to suddenly receive a sudden invitation to hang out by not one but by two of his best friends both of which have their own unique charms that make them highly desirable partners as lovers for males across the school. But what will happen if rather than the happy ending that Kisaragi had sought that instead events will instead go pear-shaped and the object of their confession was not him but for his best friend instead.Within the anime industry school-based, romance stories are perhaps one of the more popular genre pairings as such stories are relatively easy to create due to both the nature of a school and how its associated activities can be conjoined with those of a student’s personal life as they enter its sacred halls. However, what drew me to Oresuki was not just the school-based romance setting but was rather its combination with the genre of comedy into its setting a move that I felt was an excellent one as it served to not only expand the many standard activities that school-based animes feature by adding a sense of amusement to them but also while doing so aid in expanding upon each of the individual characters within the series as they take part in such events while also giving the opportunity for them to shine in notable stand out moments within the series. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that while serving well to introduce the main cast of the series also did well to show the blend of school, romance and comedy genres that the series was aiming for and indeed convinced me that this series is one that I should watch till the end.The overall story of the series takes place within both the confines of the local Nishikizuta high school and its surrounding areas and follows the life of Amatsuyu Kisaragi better known as Joro a seemingly average second-year student that while on the surface is seemingly content with the routine sans boring life that he’s been having is one day presented with a seemingly miraculous opportunity when he’s invited out by two beautiful girls that screams of an obvious love confession. However, what should have been a happy ending soon turns pear-shaped as Joro finds to his shock that rather being him the object of their affections was rather his best friend. However, before the moments of despair manage to seep into his heart Joro is seemingly saved by a second love confession from the one person that Joro had least expected and one that despite him never meeting her in person seemed to know more about his daily life than he did. This was from none other than Sumireko Sanshokuin a second-year student and a member of the school’s library committee that despite looking rather unremarkable on the surface was one that had a seemingly sharp tongue and a cunning that surprised even Joro. Now presented with a complex situation in which Joro and his friends find themselves caught up in will they be able to navigate the countless traps and misunderstandings that will transpire as each of them try to pursue the one thing that they desire the most in their life which is the opportunity to be with the one person that they love or will the friendship and bonds between them shatter as they do so.Amatsuyu KisaragiAmatsuyu Kisaragi portrayed by veteran voice actor Daiki Yamashita of Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year student that attends the local Nishikizuta high school Kisaragi who prefers to be known by his nickname of Joro is on initial appearances shown to be a seemingly average high school boy that’s friendly, earnest and positive and was someone that was shown to be dependable by many on account of the number of friends that he had as well as the fact that he was nominated to be the secretary for the school’s student council. Despite this Joro was shown to have little sense of arrogance and indeed was shown to be a kind, honest and quiet person by nature that preferred to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy his time at school with his friends. Indeed, for Joro before his awakening, all he really cared for was his bonds with his friends to remain unchanged and as a result, he was shown to be very loyal to them and tries hard to help them with their problems. However, as things turn out this path was not one that was as easy to balance as one looks as events will soon prove.After the twin shocks of the confessions from his friends and from Sumireko Joro’s personality gradually begins to change as a result of the awakening within him of a side of him that had until now remained dormant. A side that can be aptly referred to as Joro the schemer. While still remaining a kind, honest and dependable person to his friends and to his school mates Joro in this side of his was shown to be someone that had a obvious boiling point to him that was shown to have a rather short fuse as shown in his explosion when confronting both Sun Chan’s scheme and in rejecting Hina’s explanation for her actions. Along with this introduction of Kisaragi’s display of anger was arguably one of Joro’s most significant developments which is the reveal of his cynical side to the viewer. While still maintaining his surface personality of being a friendly and approachable person to both his friends and his peers Kisaragi was shown to view both in terms of himself as well as his friends and their requests with a degree of cynicism that while proving amusing to us viewers also reflected well on the kind of feelings that he had towards them a development that I felt served well to expand upon Joro as a character. Indeed, with this regard it can be seen that Sumireko’s description of his personality as being akin to that of a Jekyll and Hyde one is an appropriate one. However, despite viewing his friends and the bonds that he shares with them with a degree of disdain it can be seen that he still views friendship and bonds highly and believes that they are something that should be cherished and not trampled upon. This is best seen in his attempts to help his friends with their problems and consistently putting the needs of his friends before himself even if it meant setting himself up as the villain that will be ridiculed by others. The character of Kisaragi I felt was an interesting one that I felt was both well designed and developed with his dual personality and his desire to help his friends and maintain the bond between them while expressing his own unique views on them being the most notable developments. The combination of Joro’s own naked feelings towards his friend’s requests and problems as well as his hidden feelings both positive and negative ones I felt served well to make his attempts to maintain the bond and friendship that he shares with his friends that much more heartfelt.Sumireko SanshokuinSumireko Sanshokuin portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Tomatsu of Sao and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A second-year student and a member of the school’s library committee Sumireko who is nicknamed Pansy by Joro and his friends is initially shown to be a rather plain and gloomy girl that has few if any friends within the school year and indeed is someone that has a rather negative image within her the minds of her peers. Indeed this image of her is seen to be something that Sumireko seemingly prefers as rather than make an attempt to befriend her peers she instead chose to become a member of the library committee that allowed her to manage the school library a place that more or less guaranteed that she will have a place of sanctuary for herself within the school that is seldom disturbed by others. For Sumireko nothing more can be more enjoyable for her than sitting in the library and reading one of her favorite books which is something that continued until she met a young man named Joro a man that served to intrigue her and cause her to make a surprising first move in her attempt to know more about him through her new hobby of stalking a hobby that she was shown to be quite adept at that ultimately led to both the realization that she had fallen for him and their long fated meeting that allowed both to meet each other in the real for the first time. On the surface, while a gloomy and quiet girl by nature Sumireko was shown to be a calm, composed and Intelligent person by nature that while not used to dealing with others on account of her preference for being alone was also someone that was friendly and can deal with others quite readily given time. While quiet she was also noted to be someone that had a rather sharp tongue which when combined with both her blunt nature and her skill at observing people served to make her a formidable interrogator that was adept at taking apart lies quite readily.As the series progresses and Sumireko’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that the feelings that she has towards Joro despite coming from an unusual angle are ones that are not part of a complex social experiment that she had devised but rather are ones that are both genuine and heartfelt something that she tries hard to get Joro to accept as the series progresses. While shown to be an aloof person that preferred to remain in the background Sumireko as the series goes on was shown to be similar to Joro in that she too has dual personalities that seemingly contrast with one another. In her former self that acts as her surface personality, she is shown to be a quiet but polite person that seemed determined to strike down any attempts by others to befriend her while her latter and arguably her true self was shown to be someone that was both confident, blunt and cunning that she only presents to those that have gained her trust. Despite this nature of hers however, Sumireko was also shown to be someone that was surprisingly understanding of the feelings of others which when working in parallel with her perceptive nature allowed her to give some surprisingly deep advice for Joro as she’s able to deduce the level of bonds that exists between Joro and his friends as well as the level of pain that they all feel when this is disrupted. In the beginning of the series largely as a result of her loner like existence within the school Sumireko was shown to be someone that was unused to dealing with others and as a result, was shown to be somewhat wary of Joro’s friends when she first met them to the amusement of both Joro and us viewers. However, this sense of wariness towards others gradually began to change as she got to interact with them and got to understand them as individuals all of which served to allow Sumireko to realise just how much fun having genuine friends that she can trust and interact with on a daily basis can help in making one’s own life an enjoyable one and as a result not only began to interact with them more but also show them the true self that she had until now only shown to Kisaragi a development that showed just how much being able to make friends with like-minded people that cared not for physical appearances but their inner character had on her. A development that is best shown in her determination to go out of her comfort zone to support her friends as shown in the flower dance and the visit to the swimming pool both of which are areas and events that the past version of her would not have visited let alone taken part in.Sakura AkinoSakura Akino portrayed by veteran seiyuu Sachika Misawa of Accel World and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Amatsuyu’s circle of friends within the series. A third-year student and thus an upperclassman within the series Sakura is shown in initial appearances to be a dignified, calm and quiet person by nature that’s both popular and hardworking and is someone that is seen to work hard to help others with their problems all of which served to assist her in her role as the schools student council president. While a calm and logical person by nature Sakura who prefers to be referred to by her nickname of Cosmo’s is also an intelligent person that’s also had a wide variety of life experiences that she uses to help others in her duty as SC president. However, despite Cosmo’s friendly and agreeable nature, she is someone that is shown to have a rather strong sense of pride within her that serves to hinder her in her attempts to deal with situations that she is unaccustomed to as shown in the courage that she needed to ask Joro for advice. At the same time while confident Cosmo’s was also shown to get nervous quite easily when pressed into situations that visibly stresses her and was noted to a rather interesting coping mechanism of sorts in which Cosmo’s seemingly assumes the role of an Edo period samurai which while certainly amusing to watch also showed that despite her confidence there are things that even she can’t deal with easily.As the series goes on and Cosmo’s character is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that despite her calm and composed nature she is not immune to base feelings and indeed can have some surprisingly scary mood swings. At the same time while shown to be a calm and dignified person by many that can at times make her hard to approach by those that don’t know her in reality she is someone that cares deeply about her friends and is shown to be quite vulnerable to being left isolated from them as shown in her reactions during the circle’s first split within the series where she exhibited a somewhat depressing aura despite her attempts to hide it. Due largely to the large sense of responsibility that she places on herself Cosmo’s was shown to take both the manner of friendships and her duty as Sc president very seriously and as a result, she was shown to be rather sensitive if either of these aspects goes awry. While showing well in not just how serious she treats her job as well as how loyal and caring she is towards her friends this aspect of hers also shows that Cosmo’s is also fully capable of dealing with school matters that involve her friends which is shown in her treatment of Hina’s actions where she not only demonstrated her preference for openly revealing her own thoughts and opinions regarding a matter but also demonstrating her talent for deductive reasoning in her clinical disassembly of Hina’s prepared response to her questions as she connected the inconsistencies within her statement one by one a talent that I felt showed just how she ended up taking the role of SC president within the school.Hina HanetachiHina Hanetachi portrayed by veteran seiyuu Shiori Mikami of Attack On Titan fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Joro’s classmates within the school. A second-year student and a member of the schools newspaper club where she serves as the class reporter Hina whose nickname within the school is Asunaro is shown in her initial appearances to be a positive, friendly and determined person that while diligent in her studies is also shown to be enthusiastic about her job as a class reporter and keen to uncover the truth about any rumours that she finds within the school. While shown to be intelligent and logical she was also shown to have a rather firm sense of justice and fairness and indeed she views those that violate morals with obvious disdain. While a formidable seeker of knowledge that has access to some impressive info networks Hina at her core is still a young woman that can be playful and display an innate sense of curiosity that allows her to easily bond with people that may be useful to her in her role.However, as the series goes on it can be seen that Hina’s true self is one that can be seen to be a complete contrast to her default personality. While for the most part, Hina’s core personality traits of being friendly and positive remain Hina’s true self is shown to be a surprisingly cunning and manipulative one that’s not just adapt at creating situations that can influence people’s opinions effortlessly but also situations that can serve to trap and isolate those that she has designated as targets skills that served to make great use of both her dogged determination and her own earnest desire to set things right in her eyes which is best shown in the trap that she created to entrap Joro. However, while certainly misguided in her attempts to gain what she felt was something that she felt she deserved its interesting to note that Hina was also someone that had a sense of responsibility which when combined with her desire for forgiveness made her a character that while exposed for her lies never stopped from taking responsibility for her actions and never wavered in her determination to get what she desired showing well that her feelings towards her crush was built on genuine feelings and not falsehood. The character of Hina I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her two-faced nature and her role as a classes designated reporter for the newspaper club while contrasting with each other served to neatly balance the core of her character with her honest nature cementing this further and allowing her to become an effective support character for Joro near the latter stages of the series thanks to both sense of sudden mood shifts and her desire to help her beloved.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main cast were pretty well designed and developed with each character’s design matching well with both their innate personality traits as well as their own hidden selves with notable examples being Sumireko’s default self. At the same time, I was also impressed by the hyde moments within the series that served to expand upon Amatsuyu’s inner thoughts that serve to expand the overall story pretty well.  At the same time while sparingly seen I felt that the breaking the 4th wall moments within the series by Amatsuyu also served to inject a little more comedy into the scenes that its present in a move that while surprising also proved effective at its given role. In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Papapa which was performed by new seiyuu singer Shuka Saito and Hanakotoba that was performed by the seiyuu’s who portrayed the characters of Sumireko, Cosmos and Aoi who are Haruka Tomatsu, Sachika Misawa and Haruka Shiraishi respectively. Both of these songs I felt were interesting ones that served to convey different types of feelings with the former conveying the sense that despite the chore of going to school and living an average life Joro still has a strong reason for doing so as this allows him to see, interact and have fun with his friends and pass his days bonding with and enjoying the finite amount of time that he has left as a teenager. The ending theme I felt invoked a similar feeling but in this, I felt that in addition to the forging of bonds between friends the ending theme also created a sense that by bonding with each other the trio of Sumireko, Aoi and Cosmo’s were able to not only find unity in shared desires but also in the process forge a strong bond of trust between them that was built on honesty. Both of these songs while excellent in their own ways I felt were also helped greatly by the visuals that went with them.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Daiki Yamashita, Haruka Tomatsu, Shiori Mikami and Sachika Misawa all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. For Sachika in particular her portrayal of Cosmo’s I felt represents a true return to form for her and I hope that with this role that she is able to get more upcoming roles and expand her career as a seiyuu. While not represented within the review itself due to the lack of character expansion for their characters I felt that Haruka Shiraishi and Nao Toyama also did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Aoi and Tsubaki respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Oresuki was an excellent anime that I really enjoyed with it being one of the seasons best ones.

LOL A hilariously fantastic beginning, and a solid ""cliff-hanger"" ending. It felt like such a cool take on a modern, romcom school-life type of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" story vibe. I\'d say the OP and ED themes were very catchy for me, and I can catch myself humming to them easily lol. That 1st episode might be one of the most SOLID 1st episodes of an anime that I\'ve seen in a while, and it was...definitely up there with one of the funniest 1st episodes of an anime that I\'ve ever watched! The whole gag of the MC seeing the ""bench"" pop up out of nowhere every now and then, him freaking out about it, and then a STAR WARS ""Imperial March"" type of track starts playing and I can\'t help but laugh! That 4th wall breaking was done so amazingly, that I sometimes caught myself doing a double-take being like ""wait what?"", and then cracking up laughing. At first I didn\'t like some characters, but as the show starts going and you get the understanding of said characters in situations, I started to like it more. Even though I LOVE the MC\'s voice actor (who plays Izuku Midoriya from My Hero Academia), the character he portrayed in this show was very hard for me to like. At first I loved this guy, hilarious at the beginning and everything, but then he started to bother me with how his thoughts were to some of his friends. He would call his childhood friend, who is always happy and cheerful and whatnot, a ""bitch"" when she literally did little to nothing to deserve those thoughts he had. I feel like the MC just threw a lot of terrible remarks around just cause, and not cause of the actual meanings behind the words he says which REALLY bothered me. After around the middle of the show I started to like the MC again, it was an absolute up and down roller coaster of liking him, then not liking him, and then liking the guy again. Other than that everything was really great with this show, ESPECIALLY the main heroine in Sumireko Sanshokuin a.k.a. ""PANSY"". She is absolutely one of my favorite girls of the 2019 anime I watched, and I watched A LOT. Lots of the girls were great, almost all of them actually, and if you love extremely HILARIOUS romcom\'s, 4th wall breaking, with a bunch of cuties then it\'s the anime for you! definitely up there with one of the funniest 1st episodes of an anime that I\'ve ever watched!

call this show?\xa0 A rom-com?\xa0 Psychological?\xa0 Harem?\xa0 Parody?\xa0 A Deconstruction?\xa0 There\'s something genuinely amusing about struggling to come up with a proper title about this show, and that adds more to its charm.\xa0 I think.Story:Kisaragi Amatsuyu\'s (commonly referred to as Joro) life stands at the peak for any boy his age.\xa0 With a best friend who\'s also one of the school\'s all-star baseball players, a cute and spunky childhood friend, and the beautiful school president who relies on him to help with council duties, things can only go up.\xa0 Until he\'s sat down on a particular white bench with gold trimmings...told by both his cute childhood friend and school president that they are both in love with his best friend.\xa0 Well how \'bout them apples?Oresuki is that one show that has too many things that go on at once that all somehow work towards the show\'s favor.\xa0 The series is split into several arcs, each of them typically adding a new member into the cast that throws a wrench into both the plans of Joro and the rest of the pre-established cast, all to execute a particularly convoluted plan usually in the name of love.\xa0 Introduce some problem/event, introduce the new character, have the protagonists figure out said problem, and slot the new character into their correct spot on the roster of existing characters.\xa0 It\'s definitely not anything new, especially in the realm of harem shows, but the intrigue lies in what happens during these different stages in the arc.See what Oresuki does is to first throw in a melting pot of various plot elements and storytelling/genre tropes in order to create the amalgamation that it does.\xa0 There\'re parody elements where the series makes fun of romcom tropes and executes commonly seen ones poorly, deconstruction where any given trope will be given the realism hammer and make some things seem more depressing in hindsight, psychological elements where manipulation and ulterior motives are the underlying reason for anyone to do anything, and fourth-wall breaks where Joro breaks the fabric of reality to remind himself what episode he\'s on.\xa0 There\'re definitely more sprinkled throughout the show, but these aspects are so interwoven in the show that it makes Oresuki feel like a series that\'s more than a romcom.The faults of this however really shine during the latter half of the show where I feel like the series almost takes itself a bit too seriously.\xa0 Joro\'s inflections as a \'side character\' rather than the \'protagonist\' stick around a bit too long for my liking, and the convoluted plans in some of these arcs really boil down to one independent party moving ahead with one thing, and leave Joro to spend the rest of the episode cracking the code so that he can meet with everyone in the last bit of the story.\xa0 On top of that, character switches where suddenly X person is opposite to Joro because of Y event are extremely common and feel more like a fakeout than a genuine twist in the story.Despite that, Oresuki manages to have a surprisingly good story that balances a number of its aspects on a delicate scale.\xa0 The series switches from serious to silly at a moment\'s notice, and the underlying current of how everyone is a terrible fucking person really helps sell the idea that maybe establishing potential love interests with multiple women isn\'t such a great idea.\xa0 Although I think the series does harp on Joro a bit too much at times.Characters:As mentioned before, everyone is a terrible person.\xa0 That conclusion primarily stems from the fact that most if not all characters in this series have a plan and make sure to see to their end goals by any means necessary.Joro being our protagonist/side character in this show is an excellent example of this: plotting to help his two potential \'girlfriend\' candidates fulfill their goal of getting with his best friend so that he can pick up the scraps with the girl who doesn\'t end up with him.\xa0 That being his initial character motivation should already tell you the kind of character he is.\xa0 But more than that is his self-inflection and inferiority complex.\xa0 Him being so average and not being impressive like a \'protagonist\' stands as a looming negative over his character, which gives him impressive character depth for a show that didn\'t need to go that extra mile.\xa0 It does get a bit annoying to hear the other characters constantly remind and validate his contributions and explain how only HE is capable of performing this certain task, but it does add to his character overall rather than give it any significant downgrades.And instead of the best friend character, I\'m just going to cut straight ahead to Joro\'s other half (don\'t lie), Sanshokuin Sumireko, or Pansy.\xa0 Pansy\'s purpose in the series is twofold: being an endgoal for various reasons, and act as a compliment to Joro\'s already terrible personality.\xa0 Not only is she a stalker, but she is also manipulative, sharp-tongue, and cold-hearted, all in order to get what she wants.\xa0 I find Pansy to be a fun character.\xa0 She\'s definitely not the kind of trope you\'d expect from a \'harem girl\', and often stands out as a conniving and calculating character at first glance with how she figures out schemes and does what she can to strongarm Joro to spend time with her, even if it\'s against his own will.\xa0 As great as that is, Pansy eventually becomes less of a forefront character and more of a \'prize\' to win.\xa0 The last few arcs are dedicated to this concept and the end result is this less than impressive character whose primary trait is how much she loves our main protagonist.\xa0 It\'s this kind of \'deevolution\' that I\'m not really a fan of and I think is a major detriment to one of the more interesting and better characters in the show.Beyond them is Sun-chan, Joro\'s best friend, the aforementioned Himawari and President Cosmos who take up the childhood friend and student council president slots, and various other girls strewn about the series like Asunaro hold various roles and love interests.\xa0 Usually with the intention of fucking things up some way some how.\xa0 (Also yes, the naming scheme for the girls are literally flowers.\xa0 Kind of unsettling when you think about it.)\xa0 The sidecast is also helped by the fact that since most of them are also terrible people, a number of them end up as strange bastardized versions of whatever trope they\'re supposed to represent, which is both amusing and discomforting given the lack of potential options for people you can trust.\xa0 There are some characters who are just straight up bad, but most are at the very least amusing and fun to have screentime with.Aesthetics:Connect being a studio without much of a repertoire comes out with some pretty nice art and animation despite not really having many series to call their own.\xa0 The light and bright color palette of the series is nice to look at (if not a bit blinding at times), and the multitude of close ups really make the designs of the characters (particularly their eyes) really show off the amount of care and detail went into them.Really though, that\'s not the star player.\xa0 Comically throughout the series, the show will spill into different artstyles or styles of animation simply just for comedic effect, and it\'s VERY amusing when they happen.\xa0 They\'re all so different and so weird that it really makes you wonder what they\'re gonna pull next because for some reason there\'s like one each episode or something.\xa0 And I love it.\xa0 What I do find odd with the art though is the strange curl in the middle of the lips for all of the female characters in addition to their highlighted pink lower lip.\xa0 It\'s just a style choice that sticks out to me.Shuka Saito\'s ""Papapa"" is a song that starts off interestingly before quickly falling into a sort poppy song that\'s nice to listen to, but doesn\'t have anything that I find particularly outstanding or interesting aside from small moments where the tempo picks up briefly just to give the song a bit of flair.\xa0 Still a cute song, and very out of character for this series.\xa0 In contrast, ""Hanakotoba"", sung by the three VAs for the first three girls of the series is a slower song that fits for the ending song.\xa0 Similar to its OP sister, it\'s a nice song to listen to, but not something that I put in high regard because it doesn\'t have that memorability factor that makes it stand out.Personal Enjoyment:Honestly I didn\'t think this series would get an adaptation.\xa0 But I guess if you don\'t think it\'s gonna happen, it\'ll probably happen just to prove you wrong.\xa0 Oresuki is everything I\'ve ever wanted.\xa0 A harem series that doesn\'t really take itself too seriously (mostly), while meshing a whole bunch of random concepts together to make a self-serving parody with enough emotional tug to make me give a damn instead of just sitting back and watching whatever fire happen on-screen burn.\xa0 (Also, EVERYBODY loved that one fucking baseball game.)So yes, I enjoyed the show, and even more with all of the little touches and things the show manages to add thanks to the benefit of a visual medium.\xa0 It\'s a show that strikes that fine balance of being silly while also having enough serious elements for there to be drama, parodic without always being too on the nose, and self-deprecative because people suck, and sometimes you think you suck as well.\xa0 Though that one may be a bit heavy-handed sometimes.Personally I think the show pokes fun/blames Joro on a bit too many things, and it would\'ve been nice to have a change of pace where someone else in the cast was the one who was in hot water rather than the same man time and time again.\xa0 Because it\'s one thing to beat a man, it\'s another to beat a man down.\xa0 Variance would\'ve been nice, and not turning Pansy into a fucking trophy in the endgame would\'ve been nice too.Still, my recommendation for Oresuki is to watch it if you\'re a fan of romcom/harem shows, but want a little more variance aside from ""Guy surrounded by a slowly growing group of women"".\xa0 Because believe me, that kind of thing can get old really fast, and it\'s nice to see a group of characters who each act as their own independent person with their own personalities and motivations instead of regurgitated tropes and ideas meant only to service the people who find that specific niche of character appealing. told by both his cute childhood friend and school president that they are both in love with his best friend.\xa0 Well how \'bout them apples?Oresuki is that one show that has too many things that go on at once that all somehow work towards the show\'s favor.\xa0 The series is split into several arcs, each of them typically adding a new member into the cast that throws a wrench into both the plans of Joro and the rest of the pre-established cast, all to execute a particularly convoluted plan usually in the name of love.\xa0 Introduce some problem/event, introduce the new character, have the protagonists figure out said problem, and slot the new character into their correct spot on the roster of existing characters.\xa0 It\'s definitely not anything new, especially in the realm of harem shows, but the intrigue lies in what happens during these different stages in the arc.See what Oresuki does is to first throw in a melting pot of various plot elements and storytelling/genre tropes in order to create the amalgamation that it does.\xa0 There\'re parody elements where the series makes fun of romcom tropes and executes commonly seen ones poorly, deconstruction where any given trope will be given the realism hammer and make some things seem more depressing in hindsight, psychological elements where manipulation and ulterior motives are the underlying reason for anyone to do anything, and fourth-wall breaks where Joro breaks the fabric of reality to remind himself what episode he\'s on.\xa0 There\'re definitely more sprinkled throughout the show, but these aspects are so interwoven in the show that it makes Oresuki feel like a series that\'s more than a romcom.The faults of this however really shine during the latter half of the show where I feel like the series almost takes itself a bit too seriously.\xa0 Joro\'s inflections as a \'side character\' rather than the \'protagonist\' stick around a bit too long for my liking, and the convoluted plans in some of these arcs really boil down to one independent party moving ahead with one thing, and leave Joro to spend the rest of the episode cracking the code so that he can meet with everyone in the last bit of the story.\xa0 On top of that, character switches where suddenly X person is opposite to Joro because of Y event are extremely common and feel more like a fakeout than a genuine twist in the story.Despite that, Oresuki manages to have a surprisingly good story that balances a number of its aspects on a delicate scale.\xa0 The series switches from serious to silly at a moment\'s notice, and the underlying current of how everyone is a terrible fucking person really helps sell the idea that maybe establishing potential love interests with multiple women isn\'t such a great idea.\xa0 Although I think the series does harp on Joro a bit too much at times.Characters:As mentioned before, everyone is a terrible person.\xa0 That conclusion primarily stems from the fact that most if not all characters in this series have a plan and make sure to see to their end goals by any means necessary.Joro being our protagonist/side character in this show is an excellent example of this: plotting to help his two potential \'girlfriend\' candidates fulfill their goal of getting with his best friend so that he can pick up the scraps with the girl who doesn\'t end up with him.\xa0 That being his initial character motivation should already tell you the kind of character he is.\xa0 But more than that is his self-inflection and inferiority complex.\xa0 Him being so average and not being impressive like a \'protagonist\' stands as a looming negative over his character, which gives him impressive character depth for a show that didn\'t need to go that extra mile.\xa0 It does get a bit annoying to hear the other characters constantly remind and validate his contributions and explain how only HE is capable of performing this certain task, but it does add to his character overall rather than give it any significant downgrades.And instead of the best friend character, I\'m just going to cut straight ahead to Joro\'s other half (don\'t lie), Sanshokuin Sumireko, or Pansy.\xa0 Pansy\'s purpose in the series is twofold: being an endgoal for various reasons, and act as a compliment to Joro\'s already terrible personality.\xa0 Not only is she a stalker, but she is also manipulative, sharp-tongue, and cold-hearted, all in order to get what she wants.\xa0 I find Pansy to be a fun character.\xa0 She\'s definitely not the kind of trope you\'d expect from a \'harem girl\', and often stands out as a conniving and calculating character at first glance with how she figures out schemes and does what she can to strongarm Joro to spend time with her, even if it\'s against his own will.\xa0 As great as that is, Pansy eventually becomes less of a forefront character and more of a \'prize\' to win.\xa0 The last few arcs are dedicated to this concept and the end result is this less than impressive character whose primary trait is how much she loves our main protagonist.\xa0 It\'s this kind of \'deevolution\' that I\'m not really a fan of and I think is a major detriment to one of the more interesting and better characters in the show.Beyond them is Sun-chan, Joro\'s best

the Guidelines it says i have to say.....""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""...........i know i may said it again a bit later in this ""review"" anyways here i GO....i like it, it was funny even more funnier when it came to the Bench. i have to say i did not see those twists coming and the 4th WALL BREAKS....sorry if what i just said was a bit of spoiler, i just had to say it. So it was an awesome...season i hope for a Second one. i can\'t really think of anything about it that i did not like, i mean like the art work is way better than my drawings(if ya call it that) season i hope for a Second one. i can\'t really think of anything about it that i did not like, i mean like the art work is way better than my drawings(if ya call it that)', ""Frustration, worry, and feeling of stress carries along side me as I view the whole anime. The story wasn't really well made, it feels like they tried to make the anime good and funny, but failed to mix both of its nature together properly. However, story (plot) aside I honestly like how the relationship of the MC and the girls and his best friend turn out to be, what is frustrating is the process on how it turn out to be. The anime supposedly, in my own opinion, could actually turn out to be better in a sense that it could help its viewers relax...and enjoy the romantic comedy the MC had with the girls, or even that at the very end MC picking out one of the girl, which actually might turn out to be, BUT THEN just at the very start of the anime it already gave the audience the mentality of fear and climax feeling.Seriously how can one laugh after all those fear and bad things that happen. You can't of course, that is why it feels like the plot and comedy is not mixed properly.Im hoping for the OVA to come out at least, so that the viewers would be able to at least have a closure of the SUPER CLIFFHANGING ENDING.Anyways enjoy and have fun guys hihi and enjoy the romantic comedy the MC had with the girls, or even that at the very end MC picking out one of the girl, which actually might turn out to be, BUT THEN just at the very start of the anime it already gave the audience the mentality of fear and climax feeling.Seriously how can one laugh after all those fear and bad things that happen.

During the second episode it was also still okay but the side characters, mainly Himawari and Cosmos started to annoy me. The main character luckily also agreed that they were annoying and manipulative.However after reaching episode 5, the main character made up with his friends and they sat together as if nothing happened. Sun, MC's best friend was...a manipulative bastard, Cosmos and Himawari used their charms to get their way with MC, even taking him out on dates, making him feel bad if they were actually in the wrong etc..I really liked MC's character, but the rest of the cast just made these series not enjoyable to watch, is why I dropped it early on. a manipulative bastard, Cosmos and Himawari used their charms to get their way with MC, even taking him out on dates, making him feel bad if they were actually in the wrong etc..I really liked MC's character, but the rest of the cast just made these series not enjoyable to watch, is why I dropped it early on."", 'Oresuki, short name for ""Ore wo suki nano wa omae dake kayo,"" is the fifth anime developed by studio connect. Based on a light novel, written by Rakuda with the artistic influence of Buruki. The anime takes 5 out of the total 17 volumes of the light novel under its wing, and anyone can already tell from here how much what is shown in the animated work is but the tip of the iceberg.The technical part of the anime is very well thought out, in fact in the cast we find Shuka Saito, opening singer, Noriaki Akitaya, director, and in the voices there are...people like Daiki Yamashita, Haruka Tomatsu and Jun Fukuyama.The protagonist of the story is Joro, nickname for Kisaragi Amatsuyu, who by a series of events finds himself on not one but two dates with two beautiful girls. Against all expectations, both declare their love not for the protagonist, but for his best friend Sun-chan (nickname for Oga Taiyo). Both girls then, will request the hand of the unfortunate man in their mission to get engaged to Sun. To complicate the situation, they are also joined by Pansy, nickname of Sumireko Sanshokuin who also confesses her love, this time, however, for Joro.I think to fully understand this anime it is essential to go through three points. [OF COURSE SPOILER WARNING]• The first of them is the romcom level, and I am referring to what a person sees and senses while watching the anime hot. Nothing exceptional then, simply an intricate story, sparkling characters, peculiar dynamics, benches, and so on.What is gleaned from a first viewing of the work is a basic but well-researched story for those who are lovers of romantic comedies and a somewhat less chewable story for those who are not very accustomed to such stories. Already from the animated ending (because yes, it is anime only) we sense something more than the usual works in the genre, the exact opposite of what anyone would expect from a romantic story. In fact none of the heroines has an explicit victory, and the final scene is with the best friend (because Bros before hoes). Here we find the first two morals, even after a immediate viewing: well-founded friendship trumps frivolous love.Another food for thought is intuitable only in the second half of the anime, thanks to Joro\'s breaking of the fourth wall. We understand that the latter has complications with the protagonist role, as he is not conventionally suited to it: we are used to flat, simple protagonists who rarely have virtues. In fact, Joro is a greedy calculator with a dark side that is nevertheless accepted by the other characters. In contrast, however, Hose would be more suited to a similar role since he respects those now clichéd characteristics of these genres.- The second point is more on a metaphorical than a moralistic level. Again, we can tell even after a first viewing of the anime that all the characters are related to the world of gardening, which is curious.The girls each represent a flower.We have the main girl, Pansy i.e., the pansy. The meaning of these flowers is also made explicit by herself during the Kabuten dance in episode 6. In fact, these flowers symbolize deep love, since according to a legend, an arrow of Cupid fell on one pansy.The second girl is Cosmos, whose flower is cosmos. The meaning of the latter is related to harmony and order (characteristics that we also find in the character), as well as to intense and sincere love.The third girl (and last among those I will discuss) is Himawari, who is represented by the sunflower. The sunflower symbolizes joy and gladness (feelings that the character is used to arouse in her peers), as well as esteem and affection.Each side of these flowers is well connected to its rightful owner, and yes, if you wanted to do an analysis for each character, you would find that each character, even if tertiary or secondary, has its own philosophy (Sasanqua, Asunaro, Tampopo, Tsubaki, Tsukimi, and Cherry are the ones I myself have performed investigations on).Turning to the boys we have:Joro, that is in several parts of the anime depicted as a watering can, precisely because that is the meaning of his name. The watering can has an importance related to water and has a positive valence, that is, promising joy and positivity.Hose, on the other hand, represents a hose for watering, so same thing as Joro, where water is a symbol of transparency.While on the one hand we find water, which is essential for the development of a plant, on the other hand we find the sun.So here is the third male character, as well as the easiest to understand: Sun-chan, who goes to represent the sun. He is a warm character, suitable for giving happiness, energy and self-confidence.- The third interpretive point is also my favorite, which I categorize as a side of ""parody philosophy."" This is not a hidden side, we are talking about something also made explicit by the ""Comedy"" genre.A parody is a caricatured imitation of a character, a literary style, a work, or in this case, an entire genre. Oresuki is to be treated as a parody in that it makes these clichés, which would normally form a normal romantic comedy, into an unsurprising strength. We are talking about an anime that mocks an entire genre while being a part of it. All the components of Oresuki, such as fourth-wall breaks, references, etc., make the story not obvious. It moves among the top titles in my personal ranking in that although it is a parodic imitation of sentimental and romantic anime, it is more real than most. Let me explain: the characters are energetic and round, and none shy away from lying and cheating shamelessly to get what they want.While the vast majority of romance anime treats young love from an ""all fun and games"" point of view, Oresuki frames it in a much less flattering way, as it accurately (and sometimes theatrically) reflects a high school reality, which is that high schoolers have not yet formed their personalities and are all selfish, their wormy consciences lead them to do horrible things against each other, even for no good reason. Paradoxically, we are also talking about a place where ironclad relationships are forged, and despite all the crap committed, many people create memories that remain vivid in the long run.What makes Oresuki a special anime is precisely that it manages to let both sides of this reality shine through. Where many love stories find to explain the way love makes us feel good, Oresuki succeeds in dealing with the way love makes us grow. people like Daiki Yamashita, Haruka Tomatsu and Jun Fukuyama.The protagonist of the story is Joro, nickname for Kisaragi Amatsuyu, who by a series of events finds himself on not one but two dates with two beautiful girls.

In what might be the least controversial opinion of this entire review, I\'m not a fan of that lingering longing for what could have been. Oresuki starts strong, but ultimately ends up drilling that thought into your head ad-nauseum.The core idea of Oresuki is a concept that I love. I\'m always a sucker for a good deconstruction or a good subversion of expectation, and at this point I\'m pretty sure there\'s no better place to find either of those things than stories about the bad guys, and that\'s exactly what Oresuki is supposed to be.What you\'re essentially...looking at here is a conflict between two genre-savvy and downright rotten- though not evil- characters. Joro and Pansy, the two leads, are in a constant battle with each other. Wannabe harem-protag Joro is good at setting up contrived situations to try and get what he wants, and Pansy is even better at bursting his bubble and bringing him back down to earth in her quest to have him all to herself.When Oresuki wants to use this concept, it can really use it well. The ways Joro tries to manipulate everyone and everything to his advantage would probably be horrifying if he himself wasn\'t fairly harmless, but because he is (and because you know his dreams are so unrelaistic), his attempts end up being more clever and interesting.Part of the fun is Joro\'s inner monologue. His sheer mental brutality and inner sarcastic quips almost always land, either on their own merits or the constant jabs at stereotypical (or usubversive) actions and reactions,Then, of course, when it all falls apart and the Harem targets end up further out of his reach, either by his own hubris or Pansy\'s intervention, and he reacts like Yosemite Sam might when outwit by Bugs Bunny, it\'s actually genuinely pretty funny. Even better, the few times something he does actually works out, he usually fails to take any sort of advantage of it. He\'s as dense in the payoff as the protagonists he\'s imitating are in the leadup- or sometimes he\'s just too savvy for his own good and misses out. Either way, it works well.And you know what? That\'s fantastic. The running gags with it work, many of which I think are the basis of this series\'s popularity. The main two characters are clearly not ones you\'re supposed to be cheering for, but for my money, never became outright detestable. That\'s a hard act to balance, especially considering that balance holds up this whole show- if you never want to see Joro find a heart and Pansy find a conscience and ultimately end up together, the whole thing fails apartMaybe the most important thing, speaking of which, the chemistry between Joro and Pansy is fantastic...in the early episodes. You can see why both characters would find some appeal in the other, but you can just as easily see why Joro wants nothing to do with Pansy. Their attempts to outplay the other are always interesting, even if a bit one sided. At least, initially.Given the score of this review, you might be anticipating that inevitable ""But,"" and I haven\'t really mentioned any of the other characters yet. Even in the part of Oresuki that the show\'s at its best, most of the supporting cast, especially the harem targets, are pretty flat. That\'s okay, though- they\'re pieces on the board, and they work well enough for that. I understand Joro\'s relationship with friend and target alike, and nothing is too unrealistic/weirdd about it. They\'re not the focus, so it\'s all good.But, something happens after the first couple of episodes: Oresuki forgets its gimmick in its other pants and never bothers to retrieve it.Pansy gradually turns into an infallible perfect girl who\'s just everything Joro could ever want, and he stops treating her as the barrier to Harem heaven (though they never really take the obvious route of him starting to pursue her instead). The side characters start to get more screen time, though no more characterization, and begin to swell in numbers. Joro loses his genre savviness and just becomes somewhat dense and somewhat pervy.At first, I didn\'t really understand what was happening. Finally, when I saw the 7th episode, it clicked. By that point, Oresuki is no longer a parody or deconstruction of the traditional Harem/RomCom, but has devolved into a straight example of such. The problems then start to arise.With Joro never having any sort of motivation to become a better person, his sudden turn to the super-helpful big-hearted dense lug that he\'s been imitating is fairly jarring. With the toning down- near outright removal, really- of the running gags in the second half of the show, the side characters (who almost triple in number) move from pieces for the two leads to place into interesting scenarios to the very tropes parodied battling it out in standard fashion. The last few episodes in particular are on the pre-flight checklist of every mediocre romcom, which is almost kind of brave and subversive in itself if you think about it.Of course, it was going to have to ultimately get there somehow. Oresuki doesn\'t work if there\'s not at least a hint that the two leads will eventually get together, and that sort of thing is best played at least kind of straight. Keeping the cast at its original small side and trimming down rather than pursuing the harem elements would have been a good way to go about it- but sadly, the confused turn the show takes creates a lose-lose, where the good spirits of the first few episodes are buried under predictable drama. Only in the last moments of the final episode do things finally start to get back on track. Too little, too late.It\'s such a shame. One of the biggest tropes about shows of this nature is, indeed, forgetting the main gimmick of the plot and just devolving into just the same set of tropes everyone else dabbles in. This show that seemed like it was going to lampoon them all just walked straight into that bear trap.As far as everything else goes, well, there\'s a reason I haven\'t really been talking about anything else that much. The art style and animation is inoffensive, and was clearly not the main focus of this show- not to say either was bad, just not particularly noteworthy. Outside of near-copyright infringement, the same goes for the audio. It is what it is, from the VA to the soundtrack. Nothing is amiss, but nothing is that memorable.Overall, I really did want to like this show, and it came frustratingly close to the potential that I think it had at times. The good is all front-loaded, and had I never known there was an episode past 4 or 5, this would easily score well higher. Those early ones might be worth watching. After that point, it\'s hard to recommend. looking at here is a conflict between two genre-savvy and downright rotten- though not evil- characters.

Who aren\'t fully morally developed. Whose actions, too often, have a purely transactional purpose.The main character, Joro, despite how he thinks about himself in the beginning of the show, is not Kira. He is a teenager who is at times...selfish and lustful and an asshole. But he is not a psychopath fooling everybody into thinking that he is a good person despite being a calculating maniac.

The first episode sort of sets it up as a harem, but then puts a twist and the girls he went on a ""date"" with, actually just want his best friend. It was pretty funny and I thought it was different. I was enjoying it! I wanted to know what was going to happen, and the main dude turns out to be an a**hole calling all of the girls b*tches for leading him on and stuff and it was funny, I enjoyed it. And then I guess they just...scrapped this whole idea and it pretty much just become a normal harem again.The main girls were all pretty okay, enjoyable girls and I didn\'t really have a problem so far.

It just made no sense and I was just like ""what?"" the entire time.Even past the character being... the way they are, every time this anime ran out of an idea, they just add a new character.

They even set up some character to be pretty important, and then are just there for pretty much no reason. A good way to explain this anime, is image an anime with 10 arcs, put into 12 episodes.

At the end we all agreed we were glad that it was over, and only kept watching because we were just so confused on what was supposed to happen.

For about ten minutes, I was watching Oresuki and thinking “This is the most cliched anime that I have ever watched”.they take some common aspects and flip them upside down and make fun of it. They have the typical student council president, childhood friend and the exchange student. they found a way to use the typical anime rom-com cliches and make them funny and take advantage of them!

It is different from all other Romcoms so it is quite refreshing to see. The only down side of this show is use of some English vocabs in between.There are many scenes in which the standard Japanese words would me more suited than the English words used in this show. Words like ecstasy, bitch are spoken in English which seems quite odd as all other conversation is in Japanese.Overall it is quite good. MC personality is different from other romcoms so there is no need to worry about bland characters. There are some scenes which are...cringeworthy but it is a romcom after all.

(This is further emphasized in the movie sequel)The music is mediocre though not gonna lie, it\'s probably the weakest part as a great soundtrack would\'ve made this anime a lot more memorable (like ""rent a girlfriend\'s"" iconic OP in a similar genre sense).One point of...this anime that I would really love to see more of in other animes is this new concept of having a social mask, another personality that only takes form in social settings so that the person would be more accepted.

The problem is that it takes a while for its components to gel.Fundamentally it's about the facades that people show to others, the ugly feelings they hide beneath them, and how hard it can be to tell whether someone is being honest. Some of these characters can be horrible to each other, and it often takes a long time to tell if they're being honest with themselves, honest with others, and whether they can ever get past the bad...blood between them.

The first arc, consisting of the first 3 episodes, is by itself the best and funniest part of the show that knows how to build tension. The other episodes don't live up, though. It takes a massive nose dive in both plot and character development. The most memorable thing from the show is the main characters true personality, but he's only enjoyable to watch for the the first arc, like everything else. Afterwards, he becomes a completely unbearable bonehead on-screen. I'm giving this an average score solely because I enjoyed the start of it. If not,...then the score would be a lot lower.You could watch all 12 eps and see the other arcs and new characters, but I wouldn't recommend it. I do recommend you watching the first 3 episodes, so just pretend that this arc is a film and ignore the rest of the show. then the score would be a lot lower.You could watch all 12 eps and see the other arcs and new characters, but I wouldn't recommend it.

His delightfully amusingly dopey and questionable presence gave me confidence that this would be a serviceable comedy. And look at that, my intuition was right. It was a thoroughly good comedy and if nothing else had gotten in the way, success would have been guaranteed. In the realm of comedy alone, it was a solid 8 on the scoring.And not only was it a thoroughly attractive comedy, but it also possessed some noteworthy aspects in the realm of character psychology. Apart from...the typical protagonist with self-complexes, there were other interesting themes such as ""restoring bonds with people"" and likewise the influence of a single individual, on other people. These 2 topics were represented in a relatively interesting way, although not much was made of them.The reason why this series wasted a lot of potentials, however, was the characters and their respective character arcs. The concept and idea were interesting, it could have been a really impressive title. But theatricality was the focus here. They practically had to make a pseudo thriller out of every little story. Every character fell in love with the protagonist WITHOUT any reason and this time for real! Was the reason why they loved him solely ""feelings of guilt? 3 of the girls have betrayed him before or hurt him for no reason. And then the protagonist must turn in circles all the time and not even decide for a girl, although he knows that some are even on him. The title of the anime from then on made no sense at all since his harem has already been 5+.[Story 2]Nothing worth mentioning is the everyday life of the protagonist at school. Relationship drama and the constant invasion of ""Bench"" to destroy the life of the protagonist. It was a completely mediocre harem plot without any climaxes.[Characters 3]The best thing about the characters was probably their interactions with each other and also their high comedy nature. What failed miserably was the building of their relationships. And that, although I found the "" Reconciliation Arc"" relatively good.The characters were complete stereotypes with no real personality and unfortunately, this was done deliberately. The author tried to give the stereotypical characters more depth and at the same time use their stupidity for quite a few humorous moments. Unfortunately, only the second worked.[Music 5] Intro is average, your usual harem intro number 2580. I couldn\'t tell them apart at all, even 3 days after listening to this intro I would forget the affiliation.The osts were fitting and of course Bench\'s theme was completely flawless.[Animation 5]Mainly average and just full of stills images. The backgrounds and color scheme were off-putting and absolutely nothing worth mentioning. However, an immense amount of budget was sacrificed to the boobs and panty shots. Admittedly, I thought the scene was funny when the animators admitted they were explicitly focusing the budget on the upcoming locker room and bath scene.[Conclusion]If this were just a pure comedy, I would consider it a high-quality one. Unfortunately, the author\'s attempt to add melodramatic drama to a pure blunt harem parody and make the characters seem completely forced in-depth has failed. The last arc alone, which began ap Ep 10+, was very disappointing.

However, the part that I don't like is where the female characters are too 'erotic' and exaggerated. yeah, that's all I don't like.I think the storyline is very good, I like it. the storyline is told anti-mainstream. and in my opinion the graphics and animation displayed are not satisfactory (not good enough). in my opinion, the graphics are a bit 'fuzzy'. but it doesn't really matter, I still enjoy the storyline. For anime in the romance-comedy genre, graphics are not a problem. but if the studio wants to improve the graphics and animation I really appreciate it....the backsound is also pretty good. no problem. the opening and ending songs are also appropriate.For those of you who like romance-comedy, I suggest that you watch Oresuki. the backsound is also pretty good. no problem. the opening and ending songs are also appropriate.For those of you who like romance-comedy, I suggest that you watch Oresuki."", 'RANT REVIEWSo here I am writing something I normally wouldn\'t... Why? When you notice the subtlety in a series that clearly no one else waited to see, and constantly complains about in every review about this anime. listen if you want a serious critique of the show read any other review, but if you want me to tell you why I think the story is absolutely OUTSTANDING, read on. First let me just say I originally watched this when it first aired and was left with the sudden cliffhanger at the end trust me it was terrible but while I waited for the OVA to...FINISH THE STORY, some others want to judge it for what they think it is. Now as seasons went on I forgot about the show and the OVA but here I am just having finished the OVA, and let me tell you does it wrap up everything so nicely. THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.The Story (anime)so from the start you get this generic portrayal of all the characters and it seems like it would be just another rom com harem, but let me tell you it picks up after the twist is added so the basics of it is that Joro the MC thought he would get all the girls in a perfect harem because he was the Main Character but over the next few days he realized that all the generic Girlfriend troupes (Childhood friend, class president) were actually in love with his best friend Sun-Chan the star athlete and thus he demotes himself to thinking he\'s a background character and has this Jekyll and Mr. Hyde syndrome Joro the Nice guy who cares about everyone and Joro the scumbag who wants a harem of pretty ladies. As the episodes go on he the love triangle becomes bigger and bigger, Joro loves no one and wants ""revenge"" his best  female friends love his best friend, his best friend loves the ""ugly"" Pansy and pansy loves Joro, they also add in a tsundere that starts to try and flirt with him but it doesnt go anywhere. and after some character building we come to the big thing of the anime at least. when a school reporter also comes in and falls for Joro and thinks that if she makes him the isolated loser of the school that he\'ll fall for her, he figures it out and saves himself only barely until its found out that his best friend Sun-chan is a total douchebag himself and he outs Joro for his inner personality and the series takes a slow role with all the characters mad at each other because at the base of the story everyone is a generic character with layers that make them ""good"" characters (most of them were selfish pricks) but that makes them human. after some of your usual rom com make up its kinda hinted at that joro has fallen for pansy and the finale hits and you find out why pansy has been posing as the ""ugly"" girl. it was to escape a guy who was great in every way possible and he wanted to be with her to and obsessive point. in the end the group leads up to a big decision. every girl so far will give a hair clip to either Hose or Joro and the one that wins gets to be with pansy. thats the anime it cuts on a cliffhanger.THE OVA MAJOR SPOILERS FOR ALL UNDERLYING DETAILSthe OVA starts off from Sun chans perspective telling his story of how he got to where he was, why he was a douchbag and how Joro is his best friend. turns out sun chan got bullied on the baseball team as a kid because he was just good and people saw him as the coach\'s fav. this lead to his own Jekyll and Mr Hyde syndrome where Sun chan was his outer persona and Oga was his inner persona. when he first met the protagonist he noticed they both hid their true selves and he thought they were the same, until he saw Joro break character to stand up for Sun chan and then he realized he was a good guy who puts up a wall to protect the people he cares about. All of this corrolates to the story for so many deep reasons and it all comes together in the final arc. Joro wins the bet he has everything he wanted and then he confesses his love to pansy...... then to Cosmos...... then to Himawari...... then to the reporter chick........ THEN THE TSUNDERE... yeah when he finally won he ruins the moment by showing his true colors..... or you would think until you see the next scene, hes buying skewers and suddenly this mirrors the first baseball game where everything began, joro is waiting in the blazing hot sun for his best friend who lost the game because sun chan matters most.... But this time sunchan won, but in his head he lost because everyone was so into Joro and Hose that no one came to cheer sunchan on for the final inning but then we get the flash that joro in the mess wrote to his best friend a message ""dont forget the resin"" because sun chan admitted he lost the first game when he forgot his resin. after the game sunchan was upset because he thought that even though his best friend won and he won the game that he still lost to joro. then it becomes clear he confessed his love to everyone because he didnt want to hurt anyone. if he ends up with pansy sunchan will be upset if he picks ANY girl, someone will be upset. the as Joro and sunchan sit on the same bench that caused everyone so much grief the title of the anime is said by sunchan ""even though everyone rejected me at everyone point why are you the only one who accepts Oga... why are you the only one who loves me"" and then AND only then is the true story revealed a story about a guy who just cared for his best friend the most out of everyone. THATS why i think this is so much more than it actually is you have to have the whole experience to understand every minute detail that i obviously left out to appreciate that Joro did everything FOR his friends... then a small scene plays where pansy greets him and they walk together and she tells him she love him and because he cant out right say he loves her he says "" tsuki ga kirei desu ne"" for those who know, YOU KNOW. thanks for coming to my rant review FINISH THE STORY, some others want to judge it for what they think it is.

You\'d assume this is another harem anime doing its thing, but that facade quickly shatters when the two love interests come up to our MC Jouro to confess. Because there\'s a catch; they\'re not actually confessing to their love for Jouro\'s. The person they like is his good-looking, baseball player of a best friend. Then there\'s another catch; Jouro isn\'t actually a run-of-the-mill high school boy. Deep down, he\'s a massive asshole who thinks he can get girls by playing...up the harem-protagonist persona.As a concept, this is funny. A dig at harem anime and their bland-ass protagonists getting girls for no reason is satisfying to see. Plus, it\'s presented in an entertaining, sassy manner, embellished by the greatest antagonist in anime, bench-kun, along with our MC Jouro calling everyone a ""bitchii"" in his head.It\'s all fun and games, but then fast forward a few episodes, and the show is doing exactly what it was making fun of in episode 1. The two girls who had confessed to liking baseball boy wake up one day and decide that, nah, Jouro\'s looking good now, and there\'s no real reason for this switch-up.Moreover, the second aspect that Oresuki was parodying, the protagonist himself, gets thrown out the window. Because ACTUALLY, Jouro has an alter-alter ego, so deep, deep down, he\'s a kind, run-of-the-mill harem protagonist.What was the point of making him an asshole then?The occasional comedy. That\'s it.This here is the entire show in a nutshell. It parodies the harem genre, but that\'s exactly what it is. The few jokes it makes every so often exist in a vacuum, and are only there to spice up an otherwise unapologetically trashy show. I didn\'t mind the comedy in this series, but\xa0Oresuki separates itself from the humor bit by bit, filling in that void with forced drama, while developing character relationships in the most ridiculous way possible. Nothing is dealt with properly, and by the end, you\'re left asking yourself, why? Why is Jouro amiable with the girl who purposely isolated him from his friends and ruined his reputation? Why is this girl having lunch with the guy who threatened to rape her last episode?All this does is make every character super unlikeable. They exist to act annoying and cause conflict when the plot wills it, only for them to be rewarded for their psychotic behavior. There\'s a limit to the absurdity I can tolerate because ""it\'s trashy, comedy anime, the characters don\'t need to make sense 24/7"", but when Oresuki\'s humor falters, it takes away any room for excuses.I did mention a lot already, but is any of this even a big deal? Maybe I went into this with unreasonable expectations.To that, I say, yes! I did expect more.What truly bothers me about Oresuki is that it had the potential to be a good, satirical rom-com with harem elements sprinkled in there for the fun of it.The first episode laid out everything well. It even introduced Pansy, who challenges everything Jouro wants and doesn\'t fit his idea of an ideal girl. Pansy is our bespectacled, disheveled-looking love interest who admits to stalking Jouro, and then admits her non-mutual feelings toward him, only to get immediately shut down. As far as their initial interactions/arguments go, they were entertaining to watch together, and dare I say, they had chemistry. All Oresuki had to do for the next 12 episodes was have Jouro continue his desperate harem protagonist act, have him fail in haha funny ways because the world doesn\'t work like that, and develop his hate-to-love relationship with Pansy as they both realize their flaws and become better people.

The main character is a Light Yagami level genius of manipulation, who throughout the show manipulates every interaction that another character didn't manipulate him into manipulating (sorry for the headache). Almost every episode has a great cliffhanger.The ending is damn near perfect in every which way (with a god tier Urusei Yatsura reference only the most elite of anime watchers will understand). Its worth noting the ending is a 45 minute special that is worth watching to say the least. I am so over the moon on how the show ended, but just like the...moon I have two opinions on the end. I love it because of the god tier reference to a legendary show, and the hilarity that comes from it; but also dislike it due to the fact the main heroines are all a little disappointed. I was personally voting for newspaper girl, main girl and the tsundere though i knew it wouldn't happen.It has surprisingly good art for a show of this caliber with some really fun characters who are predictable but still endearing.This show will always be in my heart because of the amazing cliffhangers it kept throwing at me and, I cannot stress this enough, the madlad reference/general ending to the show.also worth noting for those who are into vintage anime this show references Urusei Yatsura and Touch! (probs more i didn't catch) which will always make me extremely happy and fond of this show. moon I have two opinions on the end.

I was personally voting for newspaper girl, main girl and the tsundere though i knew it wouldn't happen.It has surprisingly good art for a show of this caliber with some really fun characters who are predictable but still endearing.This show will always be in my heart because of the amazing cliffhangers it kept throwing at me and, I cannot stress this enough, the madlad reference/general ending to the show.also worth noting for those who are into vintage anime this show references Urusei Yatsura and Touch! (probs more i didn't catch) which will always make me extremely happy and fond of this show."", '*Note: This is a review for the main series and the sequel OVA because the OVA literally completes the arc left incomplete at the end of the main series.*tl;dr: An incredibly well made playful but also thoughtful deconstruction of highschool harem rom-coms.Oresuki at its core is a deconstruction of the standard high school harem rom-com. At times this is done through simply parodying and playing with the various tropes that are generally found in much stories, but I think this is one of the rare anime deconstructions that goes much more in depth to tackle the core themes in a nuanced and thoughtful manner.The anime...is about the protagonist, Jouro, who starts off doing his best to become the standard high school harem rom-com protagonist, the type that has a number of girls surrounding him, but that is oblivious to their feelings of affection towards him. He does this by hiding his true manipulative and sketchy self, and instead putting on the façade of a generic oblivious but overtly kind high school student. Things don’t go his way though, and the targets that he thought would fall in love with him, Cosmos and Himawari, don’t fall for him but rather for his best friend, Sun. Rather, the only girl that seems to fall in love with him is the seemingly lame girl Pansy who furthermore seems to know the true self Jouro keeps secret.It’s clear just from just that this anime is going to be incredibly different from usual, and it only further differentiates itself from there. High school rom-coms are generally a pretty light affair, wherein the heaviest thing they have is some forced drama at key moments. As this anime goes on, it becomes clear this this going to be an anime that has much stronger conflicts, wherein most arcs have a very clear antagonist who is very strongly trying to push some sort of relationship into existence, and the anime basically involves keeping track of what’s going on in order to discover who the villain manipulating things being the scenes is and/or how they’re doing so.It’s never all that complicated in the end, but to at least some degree this is a straight up psychological anime. This isn’t a mystery type anime, wherein the protagonist is always the one to figure it out and upon them solving things the arcs is over. Rather, the one who actually figures things out changes from arc to arc. And furthermore, since this isn’t centered around crimes but rather relationships, solving things is just the set up for figuring out how to deal with the aftermath. But in having such a structure, it allows for things to be far more intense, allows for far more variety, and allows for the deviations from the norm that allow the exploration of themes that are never usually touched upon.The first first major deviation from normal high school rom-coms, is that this upends the concept of fair play that seems to exist in them. It’s pretty much standard in high school rom-coms that the heroines are all good people that never actually do anything bad in the pursuit of love. There are some where they’re adversarial towards each other, but even then they never do something that just straight up seems unfair. Shoujo anime often have opponents to the heroines that do so, but they’re pretty much treated as villains by the plot, so that dynamic is totally different. And furthermore, in general the heroines all seem to be much more focused on the target of their affection than themselves, and continue to retain those feeling regardless of what happens. This anime turns both of those concepts on its head.Here characters are shown as a lot more complicated. They’re in general willing to go much farther for the sake of their own love, they’re shown as very strongly caring about their own interests, and they’re also not completely static with their feelings being subject to change depending on what happens to them. Most importantly they’re not portrayed as villains for all this, but rather this is portrayed as completely natural and something that people should be able to take in stride. Relationships are complicated, and this just basically reflects that. That’s certainly not a unique theme, but at the same time, this is a rom-com, not a drama focused romance, so it looks at it in a new light against a very different backdrop, and what it ultimately portrays has a very different feeling to it. By highlighting those traits in comparison to the standard high school harem rom-com heroine, they come across pretty strongly while everything still remains pretty light hearted.The second major deviation is that in general rom-coms have a pretty strong emphasis on the power of love, with it basically being more important than anything. This deviates from that tremendously, in that it basically insinuates that such a mentality is unhealthy, and very strongly emphasizes the importance of friendship. I’d go as far as saying that it pretty much says friendship is more important than romance. The power of friendship also certainly isn’t a unique theme, but in high school harem rom-coms it certainly is. Male characters outside of the protagonist in such stories are usually incredibly minor with little to no depth. In this anime, the protagonist’s friendship felt like it was emphasized even more than his romance, wherein the romance aspect was ultimately the cause of all the turbulence that occurred in it, but in the end friendship was the bond that went through the most development and came out looking the strongest. There some issues in that regard with inconsistency, in that it kind of feels like how a certain character was first portrayed doesn’t fit to with where the story eventually goes, but in the end said character came through really well. This also extends to the female cast, wherein the general group of friends dynamic and Pansy’s place in it especially is also exceptionally strong and feels worth being invested in.Another area that isn’t exactly a deviation, but is somewhat close in that it does feel like it somewhat deconstructs shipping though not completely. It’s pretty common for fans to have a relationship that they’re rooting for and are often able to explain why its the best while citing numerous scenes and such that show they have great chemistry and deserve to be together the most. This anime pretty much says that none of that matters, as ultimately it’s the people involved feelings are solely what counts. I say it only deconstructs partially because while it is leaning in on showing how such a situation is similar to rom-coms, the specific situation it is discussing regards real life circumstances where outsiders being invested in one’s relationship can be much more harmful. And also because ultimately this is a work of fiction, it kind of just has to lean in on fans doing so to at least some extent because investment in characters and their relationships is a fundamental pillar that can’t really be removed at all. So in this case, the anime doesn’t really seem to be saying anything on the subject, just kind of showing it. Still, it at least does seem to highlight the issue in a pretty well thought out manner.All of this is wrapped up into a well written narrative. Due to actually having arcs with actual plots and climaxes, there’s actually interesting things constantly happening and things progressing with a good amount of change between arcs. But on top of that, it still manages to keep both the romantic fluff standard in rom-coms as well as really solid comedy. The comedy is especially great I think due to how great Jouro and Pansy are as characters. Jouro’s internal monologuing is funny due to how ridiculously sarcastic and often lightly mean spirited it is, and Pansy completely outclassing him is also constantly hilarious. On that note, the two of them feel like pretty well fleshed out characters with their own wants, desires, and unique personalities, but that actually have really good chemistry together, so seeing the slow and steady romantic development on that end is also really satisfying. There’s a good flow to things where things seem to progress naturally with things constantly being tied into prior things. This extends to the comedy, such as in how the infamous bench and baseball game singularity are a running gag, but it doesn’t just use such things for comedy but for thematic and dramatic effect as well, especially in the final OVA where the baseball game, chicken skewers, and bench are all used incredibly well. The various nicknames that characters have, what they represent, and how they connect is another example. The anime also does a great job of choosing a point to stop at, wherein it isn’t perfect and it’s clear that the story goes on from here, it chooses to end at an incredibly powerful moment and thus while the desire for a more complete ending still exists, the ending is still incredibly satisfying.The production values also felt incredibly solid. The art style is really nice with pretty good though fairly normal character designs, though I will note that I really liked how it portrayed faces, mainly the eyes and mouths. The art and animation quality is also pretty great most of the time and it felt like it was really good at using framing and such to make things pleasing to look at most of the time and focusing on what matters. The soundtrack has a few interesting tracks, such as the theme of the bench, but isn’t particularly memorable outside of those, though it’s still used decently enough. The OP is great in terms of the song and visuals, and the ED has a good very ED feeling song and decent visuals as well. is about the protagonist, Jouro, who starts off doing his best to become the standard high school harem rom-com protagonist, the type that has a number of girls surrounding him, but that is oblivious to their feelings of affection towards him.

Even if the whole story is great, once the ending screwed up, it destroy the whole story.The ending of this anime is like one of the worst ending I\'ve ever seen in my life, we wanted a clear ending, who will the main character ending with? What happens to the contest between them? obviously he\'s going to loose unless a miracle. Furthermore, the ending just doesn\'t make any...sense,  the fact they didn\'t vote for the main characters but their opponent.When I finished the last episode of this anime, I was like "" Wait.... is this the last episode? did I miss something or is there season 2? ""I\'m pretty sure i""m not the only one who\'s thinking that way and it\'s very very unfortunate this anime ended like that, I was expecting something much better than that.EDIT (9 September 2020):  Now the OVA is released, I am very impressed by it, the author fixed the ending which didn\'t make any sense into something amazing. The main character didn\'t choose any girl but we all know who he really loves and at the same time for the people who don\'t love Sumireko, well technically he didn\'t choose anyone so it\'s perfect. So I will give it an 8 instead of 6 sense,  the fact they didn\'t vote for the main characters but their opponent.When I finished the last episode of this anime, I was like "" Wait.... is this the last episode? did I miss something or is there season 2?

Not...many shows have a genuinely funny joke in them to me, with most jokes being more tone setters than genuine jokes, but these were pretty good.(The audios pretty standard, except for the jokes, but in the jokes its very good.)Characters have their moments, but they dont have much that define them and pretty much every character feels pretty hollow (except for a few good scenes) besides the main character and the main girl.Art doesnt really have any big moments, but is not inconsistant and isnt bad either.Overall, it was enjoyable but if I could go back and choose whether to watch it for the first time I wouldnt atleast until the ova gets released. The lack of the ova makes the current ""ending"" pretty bad and unenjoyable. many shows have a genuinely funny joke in them to me, with most jokes being more tone setters than genuine jokes, but these were pretty good.(The audios pretty standard, except for the jokes, but in the jokes its very good.)Characters have their moments, but they dont have much that define them and pretty much every character feels pretty hollow (except for a few good scenes) besides the main character and the main girl.Art doesnt really have any big moments, but is not inconsistant and isnt bad either.Overall, it was enjoyable but if I could go back and choose whether to watch it for the first time I wouldnt atleast until the ova gets released.

I even read several reviews to that effect, and for a bit that fantasy seemed accurate. But then I realized that Joro always loses. He\'s always outwitted by the women (and men!), and all his fourth-wall-breaking diatribes and quips do is smokescreen the fact that he\'s the same old ""heart of gold"" harem MC like...always.I\'m a seasoned purveyor and oftentimes shill of the harem genre, so I can at least give credit to Oresuki for being creative; the pseudo twists and turns make each episode seem a bit like detective mysteries and psychological thrillers. Unfortunately the seeds-and-nuggets approach that works for the detective genre fails completely here because the hooks/bait are pretty much always exclusive to flashbacks. You know, the flashbacks that usually reward keen viewers with an ""a ha!"" moment...except Oresuki halfasses it consistently. It doesn\'t matter if you noticed the bait or not, because there\'s always another aspect that wasn\'t there for you to pick up on.As for the actual harem, it sucks. Through all twelve episodes Joro does nothing but act selflessly, thereby forcing all the women to fall completely in love with him. And that goes totally counter to the whole selling point in the first place. Yeah, every so often the ""le evil genius"" part of him is shown, but it truly feels more like the episode directors forgot until two hours before airing time and just had to throw something in so the TV stations wouldn\'t have to rewrite the series\' blurb. always.I\'m a seasoned purveyor and oftentimes shill of the harem genre, so I can at least give credit to Oresuki for being creative; the pseudo twists and turns make each episode seem a bit like detective mysteries and psychological thrillers.

The love of one spineless, self-righteous, pitiful piss ant named Joro.Joro wants to find love. A lot of love. In fact, he thinks he deserves his very own harem of beautiful women. Unfortunately, they are all bitches and sluts, as he calls them. And they are all in love with his best friend Sun-chan, a popular baseball player. All but one. Pansy. A stalker, blackmailer, and the main heroine. They’re perfect for each other, both toxic douchebags. But Joro doesn’t want her. He wants an angel.The English title “Are you the only one who loves me?” made me wrongly...assume this show would have a point. I thought the end goal would be Joro giving up on the harem fantasy, then coming to his senses and dating Pansy. Maybe then this vitriol could have had a decent message like, there’s someone out there for everyone! Or, if you treat girls like sewage water they’re going to hate your guts!Instead, he doesn’t. He chooses a harem. Every girl on the face of the planet inevitably falls in love with him. Strangely he no longer picks up on rom-com cliches—he is oblivious that everyone wants to jump his bones. So what do we do for twelve episodes? Your guess is as good as mine. I’ve watched the whole thing and I was left wondering one thing, “What’s the point?” Oresuki has nothing but dubious social philosophy sprayed out the pretentious anus of the main pissant himself, really obnoxious flower symbolism, and cringe-inducing fourth-wall-breaking humor. Rather than just being another banal harem, it threw as much shit at the wall as it could in hopes something would work. Oresuki wanted to be special, and oh boy is it special. But for all the wrong reasons.The plot is an amalgamation of braindead stupid conflicts contrived for the sake of selling more volumes. There is no character development at all. Every time a girl becomes stale, a new one gets added (all the fucking time). The author sharts out a never-ending stream of waifus like a goddamn broken faucet. I wouldn’t be surprised if the guy was on crack while writing this abomination. Don’t worry about giving them all personalities, he has a brilliant formula for that too. Each girl is named after a flower, and wait for it, this man wrote all of their personalities based on Wiki summaries of the flowers. Genius, what an absolute madman. For example, Cosmos (the pink one) is named Sakura Akino, meaning virtuous and respectable, so she was obviously made the class president. She is just a hollow husk of a waifu archetype; similarly, Himawari is the sunflower, representing longevity and loyalty. The childhood friend trope. There's nothing to either of them—their purpose is to look pretty and provide panty shots. This same formula is used to write every single character. There is no deeper meaning. Flowers are pretty, colorful, and they have more personality than any of the characters in this show. The wall—thoroughly covered in feces—now has a fresh layer of flowers thrown at it too. I feel like I need to give this man a standing ovation for being the first writer to make tons of money by doing as little as possible. *Stands and applauds*They say love is blind, I sure hope so because this show is butt ugly.You would think with a story this lazily written the team would have more time to work on art. Wrong. It’s hideous. Everything is blindingly oversaturated. The lighting is horrible throughout the entire show. All of the characters look passable. The uniforms are plain black for the boys, typical school outfits for the girls, boring. Most of the girls have bright and colorful hair, identical rosy cheeks with dimples, and the same height/body types. The animation is passable, from a distance it looks pretty ugly, but up close it’s primarily still art being slid across the screen. Whenever you’d expect a lot of animation, they used still images instead. When an anime puts more effort into animating skirts ruffling and lips smacking than anything else, I think the director needs to get his priorities straight. Take away the headache-inducing lighting, the art is a solid 5, it’s a 3 with it. The OP and ED are pretty boring. Every girl is symbolized with the flower they’re named after (in case you forgot where all of their personalities come from).Well, what’s next? I can’t say much more without spoilers. So I’ll give you a choice. You take the Blue Pill and the review ends—you know enough to avoid this abomination. Just do me a favor and scroll down, click “helpful,” then don’t let the door hit you on your way out. OR take the Red Pill—you keep on reading and I’ll show you how deep this burning stinking shithole goes.***RED PILL: Spoilers***I think it’s about time we talked about the bench—a long-running ‘joke’ that makes no sense and isn’t much of a joke at all. If there was an antagonist in this show it would be one of these three: Joro’s insufferable personality, everyone’s struggle to be the stupidest character, or the bench. Defying all logic, this bench appears at random points throughout the show for the same purpose. When a girl needs to have an Important Conversation with Joro, the bench appears. A park, a library, the school rooftop, it’s there. In episode one, the bench makes its first appearance. Himawari asks to talk with Joro in private on the bench. It’s heavily hinted she’ll confess, but SUBVERSION! She asks him to set her up with his best friend. Shortly after Cosmos asks him to talk privately on the same bench, shocking! This girl is, of course, also in love with his best friend. They were both at one of Sun-chan’s games when they fell in love with him. They both saw him crying, at the same time, and their hearts were moved.Their stories are the exact same for no reason. It’s an intentional coincidence, but why? There’s no reason for these two girls—no, every girl—to have all fallen in love at this one game. I can’t explain it. There’s nothing funny about every character having stupidly intertwined backstories. Joro might comment and say wow this is so coincidental, just like a rom-com! No, it isn’t. Unless it’s a really terrible rom-com. Oresuki’s author had the clever idea of putting zero effort into the plot, characters, or narrative, but because Joro acknowledges the bad writing from time to time, he tricks people into thinking it’s deeper than it seems. This is not some grand plan conjured by a 144 IQ genius. It is the work of hack author with his brain vacuumed out of his nose.Wrapping my head around the mindbogglingly awful narrative is exhausting. A more fun topic is the brainless characters and all of the problems they cause for themselves. Ah, Joro. At first he acts like a closeted incel, only to become just another banal potato self-insert. He would constantly condescend to anyone who made him the tiniest bit pissed off. Imagine Hachiman with bipolar disorder, throw in paranoid schizophrenia with how often he talks to himself and hallucinates.The one joke I liked in the entire show lasted a whopping 5 seconds. Tsubaki offers Joro help for anything because her flower means saint or some shit—she then glances at one of his stalkers and says she’ll help “whether you think someone is stalking you.” Then her gaze subtly shifted to the camera and she continued “or if you think someone is reading your mind. The latter half of the joke stood out to me. It acknowledged how Joro’s thoughts are constantly said to us, and it weirdly felt like she knew. In a better show, this would be a great joke. Unfortunately, Joro is Joro and so the inner monologues are usually voiced creepily. He comments on things could see with my own eyes, or he’ll act annoyingly smart. Yes Joro, there are boobs on the screen. Thank you for letting me know. Don’t be surprised if you see this guy on a sex offender registry before he finishes high school. I do not hesitate to say he is one of the worst harem protagonists ever.I’ve talked about the main characters, so here’s a rundown of the less-important-but-still-bad supporting characters. Sun-chan. The chad all of the girls love at first; his pussy grabbing hands entice everyone until they realize he’s evil (but Joro is still infinitely worse). He hangs around Joro for no reason than to support him. He claims to be in love with Pansy, then forgets about her to bromance it up with Joro. Blue-haired girl. The school journalist—she confronts Joro for having a harem. Eventually she realizes he isn’t flirting with all of them. She never finds out he secretly wants them all for his harem of whipped women. Then she falls in love with him. Tsubaki. She runs her family restaurant, a transfer student that already in love with Joro upon her arrival. They met once before when she was at work. He complained to her about his boring life and he didn’t remember her. Red-haired girl. She dies her hair black after Joro tells her it’s his favorite hair color. She follows him around with blatant intentions in mind, yet he never realizes it. She’s one of the more tame crazies. Kind of a creepy stalker. She spends the entire show yearning for Joro… and his *gulp* micro-penis. Joro’s Mom. Why does she talk and act like a twelve-year-old girl? If my mom genuinely thought she was seventeen, I’d be worried about getting smothered in my sleep—time to send that maniac to the psych ward.There are two prominent traits all of these fruitcakes share in common. First, they seem very soft… in the mind. The other is their undying love for Joro. Coincidence? I think not. For the rest of the series, the story is essentially dead air. There is no driving force to the plot, to make up for the lack of anything the author contrives conflict after conflict to keep you watching. The stupidest ones go as follows...Joro borrows an expensive book from a girl loses it because of a plot contrivance, then it is beaten up beyond repair. How does he apologize? He decides what she needs is a new book, so he gets a fulltime job. When he tells her how nice he is (unironically) she says over and over that he could apologize by simply spending time with her. He tells her no, adamantly, and that she REALLY wants him to buy a new book, so he gets the job anyway. Because Joro is such a nice guy, he wonders why the girl gets so pissed at him for working instead of hanging out with her (hint: she doesn’t give two shits about the book). What a nice guy, always has everyone’s best interests in mind. Eventually, she confronts him, but of course, he can’t be wrong. This entire conflict is predicated on Joro being a selfish dickhead for no reason other than his own shittiness. While he annoyingly wallows in self-pity, multiple episodes pass. Eventually, a stranger shows up and tells him how to think, then he apologizes to the girl. He learns nothing on his own. He’s simply told how to resolve the situation.Then, all of a sudden, another girl buys the book for Joro. She was the one who caused it to become damaged, unknowingly. Joro responds by telling her to shove it (up her butt). He makes this poor girl cry because he’s too egotistical to notice her kindness. Assumably she gave up her favorite sport to spend her money on the book weeks ago (yet she curiously waits until the day that Joro has enough money to buy it because we need more contrived drama). The whole scene is disgustingly framed as a dramatic climax for the arc. The girl sobs for the camera, but it did nothing but piss me off. After berating her harshly, his personality spins around out of nowhere. He apologizes and thanks her, then buys her sports equipment, and just like magic, he is the good guy.The final conflict is probably the dumbest one. The school decides it wants to shut down the library, the place where Joro’s harem meets up. You read that right. The library. Apparently no one uses it except the harem. No one goes there to get books, to study after school, or read a book. What kind of ass-backward school is this?Sadly all things must come to an end. I will give the story a 1 because there was 1 good joke. The characters get a whopping 0 because they all sucked. Lastly, I will honor the author with an 8 for enjoyment because there was never a dull moment. And so, this dumpster fire is extinguished. Haha… who am I kidding? Humans will never run out of trash, just like this author will never run out of Ore Suki. He can keep writing this forever. See you next season. assume this show would have a point. I thought the end goal would be Joro giving up on the harem fantasy, then coming to his senses and dating Pansy. Maybe then this vitriol could have had a decent message like, there’s someone out there for everyone! Or, if you treat girls like sewage water they’re going to hate your guts!Instead, he doesn’t. He chooses a harem. Every girl on the face of the planet inevitably falls in love with him. Strangely he no longer picks up on rom-com cliches—he is oblivious that everyone wants to jump his bones. So what do we do for twelve episodes? Your guess is as good as mine. I’ve watched the whole thing and I was left wondering one thing, “What’s the point?” Oresuki has nothing but dubious social philosophy sprayed out the pretentious anus of the main pissant himself, really obnoxious flower symbolism, and cringe-inducing fourth-wall-breaking humor. Rather than just being another banal harem, it threw as much shit at the wall as it could in hopes something would work. Oresuki wanted to be special, and oh boy is it special. But for all the wrong reasons.The plot is an amalgamation of braindead stupid conflicts contrived for the sake of selling more volumes. There is no character development at all. Every time a girl becomes stale, a new one gets added (all the fucking time). The author sharts out a never-ending stream of waifus like a goddamn broken faucet. I wouldn’t be surprised if the guy was on crack while writing this abomination. Don’t worry about giving them all personalities, he has a brilliant formula for that too. Each girl is named after a flower, and wait for it, this man wrote all of their personalities based on Wiki summaries of the flowers. Genius, what an absolute madman. For example, Cosmos (the pink one) is named Sakura Akino, meaning virtuous and respectable, so she was obviously made the class president. She is just a hollow husk of a waifu archetype; similarly, Himawari is the sunflower, representing longevity and loyalty. The childhood friend trope. There's nothing to either of them—their purpose is to look pretty and provide panty shots. This same formula is used to write every single character. There is no deeper meaning. Flowers are pretty, colorful, and they have more personality than any of the characters in this show. The wall—thoroughly covered in feces—now has a fresh layer of flowers thrown at it too. I feel like I need to give this man a standing ovation for being the first writer to make tons of money by doing as little as possible. *Stands and applauds*They say love is blind, I sure hope so because this show is butt ugly.You would think with a story this lazily written the team would have more time to work on art. Wrong. It’s hideous. Everything is blindingly oversaturated. The lighting is horrible throughout the entire show. All of the characters look passable. The uniforms are plain black for the boys, typical school outfits for the girls, boring. Most of the girls have bright and colorful hair, identical rosy cheeks with dimples, and the same height/body types. The animation is passable, from a distance it looks pretty ugly, but up close it’s primarily still art being slid across the screen. Whenever you’d expect a lot of animation, they used still images instead. When an anime puts more effort into animating skirts ruffling and lips smacking than anything else, I think the director needs to get his priorities straight. Take away the headache-inducing lighting, the art is a solid 5, it’s a 3 with it. The OP and ED are pretty boring. Every girl is symbolized with the flower they’re named after (in case you forgot where all of their personalities come from).Well, what’s next? I can’t say much more without spoilers. So I’ll give you a choice. You take the Blue Pill and the review ends—you know enough to avoid this abomination. Just do me a favor and scroll down, click “helpful,” then don’t let the door hit you on your way out. OR take the Red Pill—you keep on reading and I’ll show you how deep this burning stinking shithole goes.***RED PILL: Spoilers***I think it’s about time we talked about the bench—a long-running ‘joke’ that makes no sense and isn’t much of a joke at all. If there was an antagonist in this show it would be one of these three: Joro’s insufferable personality, everyone’s struggle to be the stupidest character, or the bench. Defying all logic, this bench appears at random points throughout the show for the same purpose. When a girl needs to have an Important Conversation with Joro, the bench appears. A park, a library, the school rooftop, it’s there. In episode one, the bench makes its first appearance. Himawari asks to talk with Joro in private on the bench. It’s heavily hinted she’ll confess, but SUBVERSION! She asks him to set her up with his best friend. Shortly after Cosmos asks him to talk privately on the same bench, shocking! This girl is, of course, also in love with his best friend. They were both at one of Sun-chan’s games when they fell in love with him. They both saw him crying, at the same time, and their hearts were moved.Their stories are the exact same for no reason. It’s an intentional coincidence, but why? There’s no reason for these two girls—no, every girl—to have all fallen in love at this one game. I can’t explain it. There’s nothing funny about every character having stupidly intertwined backstories. Joro might comment and say wow this is so coincidental, just like a rom-com! No, it isn’t. Unless it’s a really terrible rom-com. Oresuki’s author had the clever idea of putting zero effort into the plot, characters, or narrative, but because Joro acknowledges the bad writing from time to time, he tricks people into thinking it’s deeper than it seems. This is not some grand plan conjured by a 144 IQ genius. It is the work of hack author with his brain vacuumed out of his nose.Wrapping my head around the mindbogglingly awful narrative is exhausting. A more fun topic is the brainless characters and all of the problems they cause for themselves. Ah, Joro. At first he acts like a closeted incel, only to become just another banal potato self-insert. He would constantly condescend to anyone who made him the tiniest bit pissed off. Imagine Hachiman with bipolar disorder, throw in paranoid schizophrenia with how often he talks to himself and hallucinates.The one joke I liked in the entire show lasted a whopping 5 seconds. Tsubaki offers Joro help for anything because her flower means saint or some shit—she then glances at one of his stalkers and says she’ll help “whether you think someone is stalking you.” Then her gaze subtly shifted to the camera and she continued “or if you think someone is reading your mind. The latter half of the joke stood out to me. It acknowledged how Joro’s thoughts are constantly said to us, and it weirdly felt like she knew. In a better show, this would be a great joke. Unfortunately, Joro is Joro and so the inner monologues are usually voiced creepily. He comments on things could see with my own eyes, or he’ll act annoyingly smart.

Rurouni Kenshin Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12067/Rurouni_Kenshin_Special,"[""No one has written a review for this so why not be the first?? Many people count this as part of the original anime, many people also probably think it is pointless to write a review of one small episode but I will write a review for those who are curious. Don't worry this will be quick.Story- This is a ending of the original Rurouni Kenshin. There is no fighting and that is totally ok. I'm going to assume you have been watching or probably finished Rurouni Kenshin and are either wondering if you hould watch this or not or to compare feelings towards this....The whole 3rd season of Rurouni Kenshin was filler and this is a filler ending but it works. Everyone gets their time to shine and the love interests get stronger so nothing to complain about the story. It's as good of a story as you can get without conflict of any kind.Art- The art... I'm giving this a 10 because I think the site I used was weird. The art was the same as the original story for the most part but there was a couple of scenes that were real life. Kenshin was walking a actual beach, there were real waves and a real sky sometimes it got me confused. Maybe it was the site which is my thinking. If it is not than the people who made the special are weird haha.Sound- Exactly the same ost's as the original.Character- Same as the originalSo this special was good to say the least. Word of advice. If you are currently watching Rurouni Kenshin or the prequel and you hate filler go straight from episode 77 to this special and you will have a great ending that leads you up to Seisou-Hen the final OVA. So this isn't bad not at all, it was a nice ending to an almost perfect anime... almost. Give this episode a shot.

Give this episode a shot."", 'This is the true final episode of the 1996 Rurouni Kenshin anime series which was so poorly handled (read my review if you wish) that they didn\'t even give it an actual ending episode. Imagine following 94 episodes of an anime without even so much as a ""thank you for watching"" from the production team.Anyway Kenshin and Kaoru travel a bit to pursue their favorite hobby of visiting graves except a terrible tragedy occurs when it begins raining a lot. The two stay in a hotel together and Kaoru holds Kenshin\'s hand, literally the extent of their relationship\'s evolution after nearly 100 episodes. Sanosuke and...Yahiko also visit their main squeezes but none of these plot lines are resolved. Might as well be another random filler episode that teases an obvious attraction and does nothing with it. At the end Kenshin and Kaoru return home and everyone waves at them. That\'s it. It\'s the most boring ending possible but at least it ends the series by re-establishing part of what it is rather than ending on an irrelevant filler arc.Since this was made a while after the series and is a one-episode production it looks nicer than the series. In a sense, at least. The resolution\'s better and it\'s brighter, but the colors are flat and lack the smooth detail and shading the series had. At its best, the series looked much better than this special. There\'s also a weird tendency to make the backdrops actual photographs or videos, so there\'s scenes of animated cels Kenshin and Kaoru standing on the beach of a real ocean which looks incredibly awkward. It\'s not even the first time I\'ve seen this (Macross Dynamite 7). Must be a 90s thing.Anyway, this isn\'t a rewarding watch but if you\'ve sat through the entire series then you\'re probably used to that from its filler and might as well go all the way so you can brag to others that you got out alive.

We watch Kenshin and crew go about their lives, with a few shots of the scenery that go on for a bit too long (almost as though they're stretching for time), and then the episode just kind of ends... without much of a climax.I'd be surprised if this episode even had a writer. It's much more likely that the actors just got in a booth and recorded some new...lines of dialogue and the animators slapped something on top of it. The story is THAT poorly done in this thing. The most I can say is that there's one humorous moment with Sanosuke.As for the art, it's a slight step up from the TV series, utilizing digital coloring, digital linework, and even some live-action shots spliced in. It gives the episode an iconic look which works in it's favor, but I think I still prefer the classic hand-drawn look of the original series. That being said, the art is probably the best part of this whole special.Sound is nothing outstanding, and does little to impress, but also isn't offensively bad. The actors did a fine job, despite not having many lines... but they also didn't manage to be overly impressive either.The characters still seem like themselves in this special, but due to the extremely poor storytelling they don't really get any chance to shine, instead relegated to being there mostly for no reason.Overall, I really didn't enjoy this at all. The art had an interesting look to it, but that didn't wow me enough to warrant the 25 minutes I spent watching barely anything happening on screen.Even if you're a fan of the series, I can only recommend this special to the most die-hard Kenshin fans.

Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei shitemita. Heart,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43470/Rikei_ga_Koi_ni_Ochita_no_de_Shoumei_shitemita_Heart,"['""I am in love with you.""-- the following is a brief paragraph on my overall thoughts, followed by spoilers concerning sideplots and the final episode (as well as a brief allusion to sao ii). reader discretion advised. --Himuro-sama: Science is War, er, I mean...Science Fell in Love is back with another season that takes its perfectly good premise and squanders it by deciding to focus on other avenues that aren\'t as interesting as the central romance and shove in side characters that further hinder any enjoyment that could be had. The reason everyone enjoyed the last season is still here, but in a lesser capacity...and side characters are fleshed out with some success but mostly failure. While I got through the first season with ease, watching this one became something of a dread every week despite ending every episode with ""yeah, that wasn\'t too bad.""In the last season, Himuro and Yukimura finally achieved a kiss with the best \'mood level\' and continue their antics to scientifically explain their affection towards one another. This season starts with a new useless couple in a different lab that come off as annoying and an excuse for more fanservice. In fact, this season explores a lot more love than just that between our two MCs which is a logical step in the right direction - \'Science\' doesn\'t just refer to two people, people fall in and out of love on a daily basis. The relationship between Kosuke and Ibarada is explored more with that idea of childhood friendship blossoming into something more during adulthood, and a few other potential couples are introduced during a group experiment. Another sideplot of Yukimura becoming a tutor for a struggling highschooler is present, it\'s short and sweet with instilling an idea of preservation and the joys of education into a younger individual, but it speeds by and the two episodes containing it are so disconnected it feels like an afterthought.The most vital plot and the one that actually ends up dominating the season is Kanade and her struggles with normalcy - or at least her own interpretation of what \'normal\' is. From a young age it\'s explained that she wasn\'t like other people, a usual trope for any character in any medium, and since then she\'s done her best to try and blend in. Conforming to society\'s ideals is a frequent thing and can lead to damaging one\'s own sense of self, and, although it\'s less interesting and I don\'t like this plot as much as Yukimura & Himuro\'s, it\'s done with relative success. The problem with it lies in it being hard to root for Kanade and how it\'s resolved in the final episode. She didn\'t seem to have any problems in who she was during the last season so this sudden extreme doubt and prominence of this is jarring. I like her as a character, the want to see her happy is obvious, but it isn\'t the same in terms of gripping like Ishigami from Kaguya\'s struggle with the same general idea.Now, I was flirting with the idea of giving this a 7 before the final episode - the fence between a 6 and a 7 was where I stood. It wasn\'t my go-to first show on Fridays and I found it weaker than the last in an aspect I just couldn\'t pinpoint, but at the end of every episode I was feeling fine and enjoyed how my time was spent. This last episode though, oh do I have an idea of how to absolutely crush a relatively wholesome show.The last episode starts with a warning, a ""the following program contains violence and depictions of sexual assault or rape and may not be suitable for all audiences.""... yeah. It\'s uh, horrendous. Suddenly, the dude who\'s been courting Kanade, trying to woo her, turns into Shinkawa (Recon II as I call him) from SAO II in that a somewhat stalky character goes off the deep-end. Kanade is kidnapped, brought to a dark building surrounded by strange men, and the whole spiel about being a \'nice guy\' and it turning into a \'forceful\' relationship now... why? Why flip the script in such an abrupt manner and even then, who would find this as an acceptable play of events ESPECIALLY as a way to resolve Kanade\'s doubt in herself and - get this - a way to make this a harem as she realizes she also has feelings for Yukimura. On top of this blatantly bad writing decision, it tries to create an emotional and comical scene with Yukimura explaining to these criminals who Kanade is.I just can\'t get over this show\'s direction in the last episode. It has a rocky start, a fun and standard middle, and a last episode that plunges it down to the gutters of some of the worst this medium has to offer.It\'s really a shame that I\'ll probably go on to remember this season mainly for that final episode and nothing else. The slightest of recommendations for those who\'ve seen the first, and a no-go for people who\'re thinking about picking it up - a missed opportunity for sure. and side characters are fleshed out with some success but mostly failure.

From a young age it\'s explained that she wasn\'t like other people, a usual trope for any character in any medium, and since then she\'s done her best to try and blend in. Conforming to society\'s ideals is a frequent thing and can lead to damaging one\'s own sense of self, and, although it\'s less interesting and I don\'t like this plot as much as Yukimura & Himuro\'s, it\'s done with relative success. The problem with it lies in it being hard to root for Kanade and how it\'s resolved in the final episode. She didn\'t seem to have any problems in who she was during the last season so this sudden extreme doubt and prominence of this is jarring. I like her as a character, the want to see her happy is obvious, but it isn\'t the same in terms of gripping like Ishigami from Kaguya\'s struggle with the same general idea.Now, I was flirting with the idea of giving this a 7 before the final episode - the fence between a 6 and a 7 was where I stood. It wasn\'t my go-to first show on Fridays and I found it weaker than the last in an aspect I just couldn\'t pinpoint, but at the end of every episode I was feeling fine and enjoyed how my time was spent. This last episode though, oh do I have an idea of how to absolutely crush a relatively wholesome show.The last episode starts with a warning, a ""the following program contains violence and depictions of sexual assault or rape and may not be suitable for all audiences.""... yeah. It\'s uh, horrendous. Suddenly, the dude who\'s been courting Kanade, trying to woo her, turns into Shinkawa (Recon II as I call him) from SAO II in that a somewhat stalky character goes off the deep-end. Kanade is kidnapped, brought to a dark building surrounded by strange men, and the whole spiel about being a \'nice guy\' and it turning into a \'forceful\' relationship now... why? Why flip the script in such an abrupt manner and even then, who would find this as an acceptable play of events ESPECIALLY as a way to resolve Kanade\'s doubt in herself and - get this - a way to make this a harem as she realizes she also has feelings for Yukimura. On top of this blatantly bad writing decision, it tries to create an emotional and comical scene with Yukimura explaining to these criminals who Kanade is.I just can\'t get over this show\'s direction in the last episode. It has a rocky start, a fun and standard middle, and a last episode that plunges it down to the gutters of some of the worst this medium has to offer.It\'s really a shame that I\'ll probably go on to remember this season mainly for that final episode and nothing else. The slightest of recommendations for those who\'ve seen the first, and a no-go for people who\'re thinking about picking it up - a missed opportunity for sure.', ""Where to begin? This anime is 100% a tale of two halves, as the first half would relate to what season 1 was more like as a fun cute romantic comedy. The second half however was rough, they tried taking a serious tone, while still implementing comedy. Overall i think the execution could have been better, so in my opinion, this season falls a little short compared to season 1.Art: 7The art is nothing amazing, but the character designs are really good. I won't lie, I'm not really expecting top-tier animation or anything from this anime so the art is good enough for me,...and is easily passible, as I enjoyed the overall design of the show. Character expressions were really good too.Sound: 8The sound design was pretty good, took me by surprise, but the real kickers are that the opening and endings unironically kind of go hard. It's very happy-go-lucky but sounds good nonetheless.Characters: 6The characters as a whole were good, however, with most of the second half of the season being focused on Kanede, it impacts this score, as honestly sometimes the scenes she was in would be hard to watch and not that enjoyable.Story: 6The first half was about what I expected, However, when they tried to go serious the execution was poor in my opinion and left a sour taste in my mouth in all honesty. If there is a season 3, I think it can be better. and is easily passible, as I enjoyed the overall design of the show.

Heart just finished airing and it was pretty enjoyable for the most part.To be honest, im so glad that i have watched this series because i didnt expect it to be good. Overall, this season is slightly better than the last just because of some reasons. I dont remember that much from last season but the fanservice for this season is really something else, they really went all out on this one ( probably just me). The one thing i was worried abt for this season was that i thought that they gonna only focus...on the main couple and imo it will be a bit boring since its basically like the first season. Thankfully and surprisingly, this season they focus more on the side characters and im glad they have the chance to shine. Ibarada was one of the characters that i end up liking, maybe not best girl, because she was damn adorable and surprisingly she has her own problem and it sucks that they didnt really spend time on it since majority of us want to know more about her. Nonetheless, i was very content with the things that we covered in this season.Of course, all anime is not perfect same goes to this anime. The one thing that i found that is still an issue from last season is the comedy. Everyone knows comedy is subjective and for me, the jokes werent the best. Although, this show is not comedy but a romance so its not big deal. Another one is , maybe its just me, but the art style in this anime is weird or ugly, idk what it is abt me not liking how the anime looks but whatever its a minor issue that i have. I have praise on how this season really delves into the side characters and how they make them more relevant than the last season BUT this one character really ruins the enjoyment that i have for this anime and that is Kanade. Dont get me wrong, the things that she went through was very understandable and its probably a Japan thing but she literally ruins the mood for this anime with her overdramatic issue. Kanade, for me, is an ok character but in this season i really find her annoying with her indecisive on what she wants? I think she's just a confused teenager or just going through puberty (lol). She even said that she doesnt want to cause problem to anyone yet she's making her senior worry abt her. The problem is that the show is going in a loop with her character and with her not wanting to find a solution to this problem makes it an infuriating to watch. I feel like its not really her fault but its more on the parents, like what the actual hell are they trying to force their own daughter doing things that she dont want to and its annoying because Kanade is not a child anymore so she couldve politely state on what she wanna do. Welp, idk i didnt like her arc at all not because i dont understand but it took way too long for her to realise that she actually can be weird.Overall, this anime is good with minor issues. on the main couple and imo it will be a bit boring since its basically like the first season.

The drama is irritating to watch.The first 6 episode is enjoyable for me and at halfway on episode 6 the romance between Yukimura and Himuro is kinda resolve when they finally admit that they in love with each other. So you think by this time they should start going out and become a couple right? We will get more YukimuraXHimuro fluff right? No, the next day for some reason now they want to start a new research to determine how strong their love...is and whether they love is romantic or not. WTF? You just literally head over heel for each other and making out yesterday and now you still have a doubt that you love each other romantically or not? So, no they did not become couple. The author just want to drag out the relationship even more. Its start become frustrating to watch.Now episode 7 begin and the start of the infamous Kanade ""Normal"" arc. Boy oh boy, its awful. It start kinda okay because there is ""nice"" looking guy that appear briefly in season 1 come and confess to Kanade. Because this is romcom anime, I thought maybe this is a new opportunity to give kanade her own love interest because she keep complaining want to find her own love in a past episode. So, by the end of this unnecessary long drama 6 episode arc did Kanade find her own love interest and become happy? Nahh. The author decide to turn the last episode into psychological mess and turn that nice guy into obsess yandere that try to gangrape Kanade with his thug friend and have Yukimura come to save the day with his Powerpoint presentation.By the end of the arc, instead of giving Kanade her own love interest or just be happy being sinlge, the author make her fall in love with Yukimura instead and turn this wholesome one on one romance into shitty love triangle. Oh I forgot to mention that in the course of 6 episode of Kanade arc, the author introduce new JK gyaru girl and make her fall in love with Yukimura just for the sake to add one more girl so Yukimara can have harem now. Yes. This is harem shit show now. Now I see why Yukimira and Himuro didn\'t become couple in episode 6 even though their romance should be resolve. Turn out the author is planning to make this Harem all along.I love Kanade character in season 1 because she is good wingwoman in Yukimura and Himuro relationship but after this arc, she become the least likeable character for me. Its a lot better if they resolve YukimuraXHimuro relationship in episode 6 and focus more on developing IbaradaXKyosuke relationship instead of this Kanade arc mess. They should just stick with YukimuraXHimuro, IbaradaXKyosuke, & ChrisXSui wholesome romance instead of forcing this series in to force shitty love triangle and soon to be harem when that JK girl start getting more screentime. Now I\'m feel like I\'m wasting my time.The first 6 episode is enjoyable to watch but rest is garbage. I\'m pretty sure if this anime ever get season 3, it will turn into another shitty harem but instead with school setting, it takes place in Uni instead.3/10. Not recommend.Enjoyable first 6 episode but it just goes downhill since then. Last episode is so bad and feel force. I hate that stupid ending. is and whether they love is romantic or not. WTF?

I hate that stupid ending.', 'I was a bit excited when Rikekoi got a sequel since I will be able to taste another unique romcom experience that I had during its 1st season but rather, it leaves a bad taste following the conclusion of this season. (Spoiler-free review or maybe just a speck)Let\'s start with the good points that this season have. Tbh, I couldn\'t tell much but giving rise to the supporting characters\' exposure is a good decision since it would latter be too boring if the story only spins around our mains. Not only that but also because the supporting characters did pique the interest last season such...as Kanade, Kosuke and Ibarada and it is good that we were able to learn more of them during this season.I hate to say it but the negative points far way outshined the little good points this season have. First things first, Himuro is a main character of this series however, during this season, you won\'t sense her being a main character unlike Yukimura who still able to portray his character role. The way how things went this season is inconsistent and were not able to retain the true concept that the 1st season has. It\'s aggravating to make Himuro this insignificant to the plot.Iirc, this was supposed to be a wholesome romcom with quirky characters but everything went downhill when the pretentious drama was included. I\'d understand that it needs to have a change of pace not to make the series bland in the long run however, a good drama should have a better timing, execution and good writing which they were unsuccessful in delivering.Now, unto the best part *insert sarcasm*, what makes this season atrocious is the finale. Idk what\'s in the mind of the writer but everything\'s messed up. A successful finale should have a sensible conclusion which I couldn\'t find in this show. Everything turned upside down, a total 180° turn that fucked up the minds of the viewers. In addition, the resolution that was given to Kanade\'s conflict is just out of the blue like a rushed decision or maybe they\'re trying to experiment if a love triangle will be effecting to prolong the story which I doubt to be successful. I guess what the writer is aiming for this one is to be included as a nominee for ""MOST AWFUL ANIME FINALE"" which will earn a spot for itself.TL;DR. While there are a lot who dislikes Kanade which I couldn\'t care less because they tried it for the forced drama, it is aggravating to have this season butchered especially by the mindfucking finale. as Kanade, Kosuke and Ibarada and it is good that we were able to learn more of them during this season.I hate to say it but the negative points far way outshined the little good points this season have.

Well if you didn't know already, It's a pure Romance anime with a slight twist of science.The season does a good job of fleshing out the more under shadowed characters of season 1, the main duo does get somewhat of a decent development and there are plenty of good scenes and I love the fact that Blue balling is low and the number of ships is high, as well as the fanservice (thigh and below :3), is super high!Characters (7/10)personally, Season 1 did get repetitive after a while and season 2 is a breath of fresh air in...that regard. The main Couple is a little more mature than before and the development of the secondary characters is a welcome sight. The new characters (chris and his girl) are tropey but fun however they quickly lose their charm since they are more one-dimensional than the main cast.Plot(7/10)The Anime does have a slight plot twist and it does make for a good finale and the anime manages to leave on a positive note (Very imp for a romance anime). Not much changes from season 1, just a bit of research on love / more doki doki moments between the couples.Sound and VA(9/10)The VA is done well and is the reason that most of the jokes hit well. The rikekuma part does get on your nerves depending on your tolerance of being called an  Idiot xD. The OP ad ED are both fantastic and original songs and have a great flow of art.Art and animation (8/10)It's good, the himoru tail wag makes a return, and the well, fan service scenes o have a lot of detail put into them. Definitely comparable to the first season. The art of OP and ED is a significant upgrade from season 1 however and I do recommend checking it out!If you have already seen the first season, you would probably have a better time  with the second one so please do give it a shot that regard.

It\'s an average treat for an average romcom lover,but then when it comes to romcoms,average means it\'s pretty enjoyable.There is story,there is development(and also a major development in episode 6),yet it\'s a bit of a slice of life too.They tried to balance it but...i\'d say it was good try,at the very least.It gets repetitive,it gets dull at times,it gets too over-the-top with cheesy visuals and lines at times,but it always makes you flustered. One of the sole points of this anime is that there\'s a 10/10 enjoyment in it.We also explore romance between another 2 characters this season,there\'s not much development yet it doesn\'t feel sidetracked as the characters are very likeable.The only thing ""unique"" about this show if someone asked me that would be that the approaches they take on romance, on understanding what it means to love and how does one realize they\'re in love with someone,is not done with some dumb lines. Eventhough it sounds a little weird, they relate love to science and try to form equations and conditions based on surveys and hormone secretion experiments, etc.Most of the plot revolves around these so called ""scientific experiments of love"" and they\'re filled with cute moments. that\'s all is there to it,to this anime.Worth a watch if you\'re under any of these categories:-you\'re a romcom fan-you\'re out of romcoms-you want some cute wholesome anime-you need to do some timepass i\'d say it was good try,at the very least.It gets repetitive,it gets dull at times,it gets too over-the-top with cheesy visuals and lines at times,but it always makes you flustered.

Its kind of hard to write this for me because I went into it with a lot of excitement as I did enjoy season 1 a lot and it just…. Was very disappointing.I will be covering spoilers so keep that in mind when reading this, also touching on SA topics that were presented.Rikekoi season 2 follows were we left off in season 1, were Himuro and Yukimura are figuring out their feelings while overlaying all this complicated scientific explanations because they are both STEM nerds and we all know STEM people can’t compute feelings right? That’s the entire gag of the show...and for the most part during season 1 it was enjoyable and handled very balancedly, including humor while also advancing the narrative presented with the characters and romantic plot of the series.The problem with season 2 starts from the story, or for better words, the lack of a cohesive line thread that unites the characters like they did on season 1. While most of season 1 we spend following Himuro and Yukimura’s antics while some smaller side plots with side characters were presented, season 2 decided to do the contrary and introduce new characters with a convoluted start to the series that added nothing and as it went along, even more subplots with side characters while our two protagonists were left… Not really shining.Starting with the two first characters introduced, Chris and Suiu which I honestly found very obnoxious and annoying. They wanted to add more fan service into the series and well, if you are into that its great, but from a neutral standpoint they contributed nothing and we as the audience didn’t get to care for them that much. They never appeared on season 1 and suddenly were thrusted at us this season and…. I really did not care for anything they did. It was just a sexual gag that got old very fast.Then we had Haru’s plot with Yukimura’s tutoring which… what was the point? Like, if you are adding a subplot with one of the main characters and another character that has nothing to do with the main cast or story, it should be to develop that main character in some way but Yukimura was never developed because of this? We only got to see Haru’s change and while it was nice and heartwarming to see, as the audience, why do we care? The preppy blonde girl suddenly now understands the importance of science but like… We gain nothing new from this, a complete filler into the whole series.Then there was the Kanade plot which I want to focus a bit because they had a really interesting thread of developing into something and they just completely…. Misused it. I’ve always liked Kanade as a character, I think she works great to balance out all the other personalities within the main cast into this more grounded perspective and I feel like we as the audience are supposed to kind of step into Kanade’s role in the story to roll our eyes at the main two over dramatic antics to admit their feelings. This season however Kanade was thrown into her own character arc were we see how she struggles to keep this façade, trying to fit in and act “normal” because that’s what she grew up being taught. For the most part I thought the message was interesting, I would have love for them to take it into the angle of exploring sexuality for example and maybe something like ace and aro feelings and how Kanade finds a lot of the experiments pointless because she doesn’t really see the appeal on it.Instead we were fed a storyline of her developing a crush on her school teacher and her feeling bad because she is a girl and does martial arts which seems…. A bit outdated in this age, but I still took the bait and watched through it. And then came the whole Kanade and Naoya plot point and how it led to episode 12 SA scene and I can’t help but think how it all was handled very poorly. SA is a very scary situation and many individuals have been in Kanade’s situation, fear and impotence of the moment when someone has control over you. What does rikekoi do? Because its a gag show that shows STEM people are quirky and different, we are cut through Yukimura entering the scene and trying to dissuade the tension and buy time by going into a scientific explanation of who Kanade is and how being “normal” isn’t something she should worry about. It was very tone deaf and weirdly placed and while I understand that the show was following its usual formula of solving all issues with their dramatic scientific analysis, it belittle the situation and felt timed terribly with the situation we were seeing displayed.I also think the start of a love triangle at this point is completely unnecessary and a plot device to keep the gag going instead of showing us actual development between Yukimura and Himuro. Why does Kanade’s character who has an interesting struggle and narrative relevancy have to be reduced to a hero’s complex were she now suddenly after 24 episodes of seeing Yukimura as someone she admires and a friend suddenly finds herself in love with him? What does this add to anything when we know Yukimura is head over heels for Himuro and vice versa? It’s just another trope of the third character having to fall for the male protagonist for reasons even though they will never stand a chance in the first place. If this is the set up for a third season I can only see it going even more downhill from there.The only plot line I did enjoy and wish would have been furthered develop was the romantic interest between Ibarada and Kosuke, two characters that were relevant and important in season 1 and during season 2 they appeared like, 2 or 3 times at most. Those 2 or 3 times however shined through in comparison to the rest of the season and seeing them slowly understand their feelings for each other was really wholesome and I got no complaints about it. The best part of the season by far.Speaking of plot points and how they were handled, another big disappointment this season was Himuro’s character and her lack of…. Anything. Even though she is one of the main characters writing this I can’t recall a single moment when Himuro shined or was important to any plot line. She was there yeah sure, but she was more of a side character than an actual protagonist and taking into account how much development she was given in season 1 and how interesting she is, she was greatly underutilized. Her and Yukimura’s romance had some advances here and there but unlike season 1 they didn’t have many key moments apart from maybe one episode from the 12 we had. I think Yukimura and Himuro are the most interesting part of rikekoi with their unique premise and seeing them being sidelined for the entire season was very disappointing to see. Don’t get me wrong, the main cast was all still enjoyable as a whole and I think they are still the ones carrying the show , but the lack of cohesion between the group and seeing each kind of doing their own thing, didn’t make them shine as much as season 1 when it really is one of rikekoi’s strongest points.As for the art and sound it was good, no complaints there I think the opening and endings of rikekoi are very good and this season wasn’t the exception. The enjoyment varied due to my previous points and overall the lack of consistency and focus is what made rikekoi season 2 lose its spark. and for the most part during season 1 it was enjoyable and handled very balancedly, including humor while also advancing the narrative presented with the characters and romantic plot of the series.The problem with season 2 starts from the story, or for better words, the lack of a cohesive line thread that unites the characters like they did on season 1. While most of season 1 we spend following Himuro and Yukimura’s antics while some smaller side plots with side characters were presented, season 2 decided to do the contrary and introduce new characters with a convoluted start to the series that added nothing and as it went along, even more subplots with side characters while our two protagonists were left… Not really shining.Starting with the two first characters introduced, Chris and Suiu which I honestly found very obnoxious and annoying. They wanted to add more fan service into the series and well, if you are into that its great, but from a neutral standpoint they contributed nothing and we as the audience didn’t get to care for them that much. They never appeared on season 1 and suddenly were thrusted at us this season and…. I really did not care for anything they did. It was just a sexual gag that got old very fast.Then we had Haru’s plot with Yukimura’s tutoring which… what was the point? Like, if you are adding a subplot with one of the main characters and another character that has nothing to do with the main cast or story, it should be to develop that main character in some way but Yukimura was never developed because of this? We only got to see Haru’s change and while it was nice and heartwarming to see, as the audience, why do we care? The preppy blonde girl suddenly now understands the importance of science but like… We gain nothing new from this, a complete filler into the whole series.Then there was the Kanade plot which I want to focus a bit because they had a really interesting thread of developing into something and they just completely…. Misused it. I’ve always liked Kanade as a character, I think she works great to balance out all the other personalities within the main cast into this more grounded perspective and I feel like we as the audience are supposed to kind of step into Kanade’s role in the story to roll our eyes at the main two over dramatic antics to admit their feelings. This season however Kanade was thrown into her own character arc were we see how she struggles to keep this façade, trying to fit in and act “normal” because that’s what she grew up being taught. For the most part I thought the message was interesting, I would have love for them to take it into the angle of exploring sexuality for example and maybe something like ace and aro feelings and how Kanade finds a lot of the experiments pointless because she doesn’t really see the appeal on it.Instead we were fed a storyline of her developing a crush on her school teacher and her feeling bad because she is a girl and does martial arts which seems…. A bit outdated in this age, but I still took the bait and watched through it. And then came the whole Kanade and Naoya plot point and how it led to episode 12 SA scene and I can’t help but think how it all was handled very poorly. SA is a very scary situation and many individuals have been in Kanade’s situation, fear and impotence of the moment when someone has control over you. What does rikekoi do? Because its a gag show that shows STEM people are quirky and different, we are cut through Yukimura entering the scene and trying to dissuade the tension and buy time by going into a scientific explanation of who Kanade is and how being “normal” isn’t something she should worry about. It was very tone deaf and weirdly placed and while I understand that the show was following its usual formula of solving all issues with their dramatic scientific analysis, it belittle the situation and felt timed terribly with the situation we were seeing displayed.I also think the start of a love triangle at this point is completely unnecessary and a plot device to keep the gag going instead of showing us actual development between Yukimura and Himuro.

Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn\'t feel like it—though that\'s not to say our characters...haven\'t changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientifically perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke\'s love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade\'s unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they\'ve been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, but they are also as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I\'d say it\'s successful. Himuro and Yukimura\'s awkwardness isn\'t overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship\'s romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if it\'s under the guise of a scientific pretense.Science Fell in Love is a cute show.

From one slice-of-life-moment to another, this show concludes with a planed rape as climax (I wish I was kiddinig, but I don\'t) - while the possible victim is agonizing about the ""concept of beeing normal"". Apologizing...for beeing herself, held captive, threatened... WTF?!I think I might understand, what they wanted to get across (about everyone beeing individual), but the way its shown is sooo wrong.I really should have skipped this. for beeing herself, held captive, threatened...

I was so shocked by the ending of this season that I actually had to go and find my partner to rant at him despite him never having watched an episode of this in his life because it came so completely out of the left field. We did not need this to happen in order for it to be determined that societal expectations of normality are dumb and contrived, and individuality is where it's at. It was shown that the guy was shady from the get-go, but there is a difference from someone being off and...not taking a break-up well, and attempting something personally, to him literally tasing Kanade and being the instigator of gang rape alongside brutally beating someone with said taser. The complete tonal shift was jarring to say the least, and this coupled with Yukimura jumping in with a science presentation in the middle of a pretty bad assault scene just felt so out of place given the rest of the anime. The fact that Kanade has apparently developed feelings for Yukimura out of all this is also pretty frustrating, given that it also seems apparent that the girl he is tutoring has developed a crush on him, and I'm not here for a harem anime. We have certainly come a long way from analysing each other's spit samples at the beginning of the season, that's for sure.The thing is though, even if this did want to take a darker tone with the guy not reacting well to Kanade rejecting him - it didn't have to happen in this way. We saw him react negatively and her flipping him over, but instead of running for safety as any sane person would do whilst he was startled, she stuck around and repeatedly apologised to him throughout the whole thing. Instead of seeing Kanade overcome her fear and wanting to be some strict version of 'normal' she had in mind for herself, we see a man come to her rescue instead, which didn't sit well with me when she clearly had the physical strength necessary and the smarts to enact her own rescue. The situation was jarring enough without this developing into the guy apparently being a gang leader and going on a cheesy rant about her needing to the the normal, perfect girlfriend for him, and the beginning of a gang rape scene interjected with badly timed attempts at scientific humour.In all, I wasn't pleased with the direction of this season and definitely won't be continuing if this does get renewed in the future. not taking a break-up well, and attempting something personally, to him literally tasing Kanade and being the instigator of gang rape alongside brutally beating someone with said taser.

Oh boy are we going to talk about episode 12, but just hold on to that thought.Season 1 of this show told a pretty complete story, I thought. They weren\'t all the way to the point where they could push past their \'tism and admit they have feelings for each other, but they were officially a couple in pretty much all but name. In my mind a continuation wasn\'t all that necessary, but I was happy to see this show get one anyway. It\'s a relatively unique show, laughably conceptual to it\'s core and not afraid to stick to it\'s premise despite how...ridiculous it is on the face of it.In the first half of the season we get a really good conclusion to the series. The team being project ""prove love mathematically"" gets a dose of reality from an actual couple prompting them to collect more data. From the aggregate data they collect from all the couples they finally come up with a deterministic proof for what love is, and it\'s basically that love is determined by the person professing that it\'s love. It\'s a very roundabout anti-logic sort of answer but the way it\'s presented sort of made sense in a so-smart-it-wraps-around-to-being-stupid sort of way. Or maybe it was so stupid it was actually smart... Either way probably works.So with that main girl finally admits she\'s really in love with science man and that\'s a wra- what do you mean it\'s only episode 6, this looks likes the ending? The way they artificially extend the show feels nearly as bad as Near and Mello suddenly existing. Nearly. Yes that was intentional.So we get another 6 episodes filled with... I don\'t even know? There\'s one subplot about science man tutoring a gyaru that was pretty alright, I enjoyed that at least. But the rest of the run time is dedicated to this weird ""just be yourself"" message that tonally just doesn\'t match the rest of the content of this show. It\'s centered on the younger girl Kanade and her relationship drama and some ham-fisted moral about her trying to be ""normal."" It just felt so out-of-place and weird. I mean, it\'s not abnormal in rom-coms when the main couple hooks up to then focus on getting the tertiary cast members into relationships next. That\'s actually pretty textbook. But the way this is handled is just so... off.And then we get to episode 12. What. The. Actual. F*ck. This was supposed to be a show about weirdly attractive and probably on the spectrum lab workers empirically proving and quantifying their love for each other with science. It\'s not the sort of thing you tune in to expecting to see a crazed incel beating a delinquent to death with a stun gun, then a science man busting in with a laptop and projector showing them why raping a girl would be bad statistically speaking and threatening their lives with the various corrosive chemicals he apparently just keeps on hand at all times... you know, as a scientist. If that doesn\'t sounds like the most bat-shit out of left field thing you\'ve ever read I want to know what anime you\'ve been watching so I can add them to my shortlist.Where did this come from? Who\'s idea was this? What show am I even watching anymore? I haven\'t been this genuinely confused since that flag show turned out to be set in the matrix (don\'t ask) or... well I was going to say Darling in the FranXX but pretty much any mecha anime, really, those are all pretty bonkers. I don\'t mind sudden tonal shifts for dramatic effect in anime, some shows actually do it really well. But in a science based rom-com, and in the last half of the last episode? Anyway it ends with Kanade somehow now being in love with science man too and them teasing like a season 3 is going to be about resolving that love triangle. No. Thanks. Even if they make a season 3 for this now it\'s going to be a hard sell getting me to watch it... ah who am I kidding I\'ll watch just about anything.5/10 ridiculous it is on the face of it.In the first half of the season we get a really good conclusion to the series. The team being project ""prove love mathematically"" gets a dose of reality from an actual couple prompting them to collect more data. From the aggregate data they collect from all the couples they finally come up with a deterministic proof for what love is, and it\'s basically that love is determined by the person professing that it\'s love. It\'s a very roundabout anti-logic sort of answer but the way it\'s presented sort of made sense in a so-smart-it-wraps-around-to-being-stupid sort of way. Or maybe it was so stupid it was actually smart... Either way probably works.So with that main girl finally admits she\'s really in love with science man and that\'s a wra- what do you mean it\'s only episode 6, this looks likes the ending? The way they artificially extend the show feels nearly as bad as Near and Mello suddenly existing. Nearly. Yes that was intentional.So we get another 6 episodes filled with... I don\'t even know? There\'s one subplot about science man tutoring a gyaru that was pretty alright, I enjoyed that at least. But the rest of the run time is dedicated to this weird ""just be yourself"" message that tonally just doesn\'t match the rest of the content of this show. It\'s centered on the younger girl Kanade and her relationship drama and some ham-fisted moral about her trying to be ""normal."" It just felt so out-of-place and weird. I mean, it\'s not abnormal in rom-coms when the main couple hooks up to then focus on getting the tertiary cast members into relationships next. That\'s actually pretty textbook. But the way this is handled is just so... off.And then we get to episode 12. What. The. Actual. F*ck.

I really enjoyed s1 and s2 started off really great but it\'s as we got more and more into s2 I felt it starts to falter.  Ultimately I put that on the manga itself as it\'s likely following the story of the manga closely but the main sub story and which actually honestly takes over the main plot of this season...just isn\'t good especially when we get hints at a better substory.Story:Continues off from s1 but adds in layers for sub characters which I think...would have been good if not for the fact we get bogged down in Kanade\'s sub story for most of the season when Ena and Kousuke have their own sub stories being presented.  Kanade as the season goes on becomes less and less likeable because of what you learn about her despite how the story tries to make her to be this tragic character in an ultimately romcom show.Art:What you expect from s1Sound:Only letdown here is the s2 ed doesn\'t hold a candle to s1 edCharacter:This season really delves into sub characters but the issue is how much time they get to their sub stories in the Yukimura and Himuro just admitting they want to be together.  Kousuke is starting to awaken, Ena\'s home life is complicated, Kanade is just a fake.  We spend most of the season wallowing in Kanade\'s self pity even though it\'s multiple times played out for comedic effect.  Her arc should have had about 2 or 3 ep across 12 ep before it resolves but nah vast majority is spent on how she\'s a fake to the point Yukimura gets fed up with it.  I was vastly more interested in Ena\'s home life as it\'s played completely serious vs Kanades root issue being played off as a joke and then continuing for another 3-4 ep since it won\'t resolve until the finale.Enjoyment:Has it\'s ups but there\'s more downs due to Kanade\'s substory dragging on way longer than need.Overall:Temper expectations the first couple ep were stupid over top then you get a nice dose of ""ok things aren\'t as good for all the characters,"" then Kanade\'s substory just grinding everything to a halt. would have been good if not for the fact we get bogged down in Kanade\'s sub story for most of the season when Ena and Kousuke have their own sub stories being presented.

It\'s truly something to behold. The things other people have said are absolutely right; it lacks taste, it\'s not funny, it goes against character development -- that\'s all true. But there\'s certainly been other shows that have those unfortunate distinctions. What makes this final episode live in my head rent-free is just the plain dissonance...between it and literally every proceeding episode. It\'s like they pulled in the director of ""School Days"" for the finale and juiced him up on crack cocaine for shits and giggles.The first season was a pleasant romp (with an amazing OP) and a surprisingly unique and sweet portrayal of college romance. The second season picked up pretty much right from there and resolved the main relationship in the first six episodes. The back six (including The Episode That Shall Not Be Named) are primarily centered on Kanade and her personal feelings and development, taking a bit more of a serious tone. While I didn\'t quite enjoy the focus on her, it\'s still balanced out neatly enough by side couple shenanigans and the main character, Yukimura, and his role tutoring a disobedient student. The messages and morals remain solid throughout with some fairly nice (if standard) commentary to boot.But then there\'s the ending. I know it\'s not really a review if I\'m just explaining the plot -- but frankly, the final episode is so utterly gob-smackingly interesting to dissect in how terrible it is, please excuse me while I summarize events to provide some context before I attempt to do so.So, through the back half of the season, Kanade hooks up with this guy. He\'s portrayed extremely reasonably. Seems like a nice bloke. Kanade isn\'t so sure of herself, though, lacking self confidence due to events in her past (that are kinda silly, but whatever). As a result, she self-reinforces a complex around her being ""not normal"". In addition to that, she\'s started to grow affection for Yukimura through him helping her throughout the show. All this builds in her mind and leads us into just before the final episode, where her love interest formally asks her out -- to which she turns him down. If you\'ve watched nearly any romance anime, this is fairly standard stuff. The science-y spin this show usually masks its\' plot and subplots with is toned down for a more serious approach while this is happening, which I thought was a bit of a shame -- but going into the last episode of what has been an overall sweet show with some nice commentary (not to mention said science elements) I can\'t say I was dissatisfied.Immediately at the start of the final episode, the first of many death knells are sounded with a large on-screen content warning: ""The following program may contain violence and depictions of sexual assault or rape and may not be suitable for all audiences. Viewer discretion is advised.""Now, Crunchyroll\'s been doing these lately for more risque shows and to be honest, while it raised a few red flags, I didn\'t think much of it. Big mistake. The warning should have read ""not suitable for any audience,"" because what follows is twenty three minutes of complete garbage. Out of nowhere Kanade\'s love interest goes full psycho, ELECTROCUTING her and drags her limp body away to a remote location. We then get five minutes of him and a group of nefarious people sexually assaulting and electrocuting her while bound and semi-unconscious, to which she ultimately effectively submits to due to her aforementioned inferiority complex which she panickdely brings up on repeat. It\'s bizarre, out of left field and extremely discomforting to watch. This is only reinforced by how there was no way to tell whatsoever that her love interest would be a twist villain -- and not only a twist villain, but the leader of a gang raping ring (??????)What a stupid setup for the final episode. At best, it\'s clumsy and irresponsible. But oh well, at the very least the resolution will ultimately tie everything together and realign the show\'s moral compass, right? Just as Kanade is about to submit to the gang\'s assault, Yukimura bursts in like some kind of superhero. What? Did the writers just forget the incredibly shockingly serious scene they just set up? What follows an honestly dark and strenuously comforting scene is some of the worst timed """"""comic relief"""""" you\'ll ever watch. Our main character proceeds to outline exactly how he was able to find where they had taken Kanade through a systematic scientific analysis of potential locations. He then pulls out a fucking projector and a PowerPoint presentation to the member of the gang and a partially exposed Kanade outlining exactly why Kanade is 🌷 fine just the way she is 🌷. This presentation goes on for ten minutes -- nearly half of the episodes run time -- all the while the gang, who were about to rape her, watch in silence. It\'s not funny, it\'s not sweet, it\'s just disturbing. I have no qualms with a show presenting graphic depictions of rape where it\'s appropriate to do so and is grounded in good moral value. But its\' use here as a means to an end is frankly wrong and abhorrent. The remainder of the episode that follows this is a contrived ending in which our main character ultimately 😎 defeats the baddies 😎 by threatening them with chemicals (???) and ultimately getting them arrested. Of course, the real purpose of this absurd series of events? To get Kanade to reconcile her feelings for our main character and setup a harem. Naturally.I watched this show several months ago when it was coming out and the final episode has been living rent free in my mind ever since then. It\'s rare that a single episode can so dramatically change my feelings towards a series. But this one is such an abrupt and irresponsible tonal shift it turns a nice, fluffy show into something downright unsalvageable.

If you have to watch this show, watch the first season and first six episodes of season 2 and skip the rest.', 'Science Fell in Love is one of those shows that had a crazy premise so I ended up watching the first season when it aired. I enjoyed it, but then forgot everything about it. First season was decent, but nothing to remarkable. So I was genuinely surprised to see that 2nd Season was coming so I added onto my list of weekly shows. And I gotta say, I was left disappointed. Was it bad? No, definitely not, but it fails to catch the charm that the first season had.Basically, second season starts from where we were left off. Yukimura and Himuro had their first kiss,...but they are still trying to figure out if they are in love or not. But surprisingly, they aren\'t even the main characters of this season as they are sidelined after Episode 6-7 (i think?). Season 2 tries to work on already established side-characters, while also bringing in some new characters. While I liked some of the new additions (like the tsundere couple and the high school girl), I felt like they were just last minute additions to fill in the episode time. For example, the high school girl is in two episodes out of 12 and while those two are great, I can\'t really see why showing her (or any other new side-character) was that important. Also I gotta say, I really dislike Chris and Suiu. They were clearly added as fan service, but other than that, they barely appear on this show, apart from 1 minute overly-sexual comedic gags. Not a fan.Adding in all these new characters and their side-plots really sacrificed character development with Himuro and Yukimura I\'m afraid. First Season established Yukimura and Himuro as overly-dramatic dumbasses that were essentially perfect for each other, but they still had personality that made them separate from each other. Here, once their experiment is finished, Himuro just becomes your average romcom character that likes Yukimura and her friends and that\'s about it. While Yukimura becomes just your average smart guy, who solves situations with dramatic powerpoint presentations. And this kinda sucks, as these two were the deciding factor of making this show distinct from other romcom shows. Yes, similar goofiness from Season 1 is still here, maybe ever better in some aspects, but as we no longer need to be convinced that these two love each other (or neither do they), any further experimenting or ""haha funny powerpoint"" is there to just serve humor, not the plot or character development.I personally would had preffered to see more episodes of these two just interacting with each other, while maybe having a wholesome sideplot on the side. But that doesn\'t happen, as Kanade was promoted to a main character role.I liked Kanade from Season 1. She essentially served as audience\'s self-insert that reacted to whatever ludicrous stuff Yukimura and Himuro would do. And she still does that here, but most of this season ravels on Kanade trying to be so-called ""normal person"", while according to her, she isn\'t one. Instead she is just throwing up a façade to appease to people. And this plot line wouldn\'t be that bad if Kanade would just accept to be herself. But this plot line goes on for ages and is only solved in the last episode. Meaning that most episodes that have Kanade as a central character, have her just wonder how she wants to be ""normal"" but just cannot. And it gets frustrating fairly quickly. It doesn\'t help that she is pretty stubborn and refuses to look outside her box so she just maintains her fake happy persona everywhere she goes, which leads to scenes of her acting frustrated or stressed out.She also starts going out with somewhat friendly-looking guy Shikijou (who already made an appearance in Season 1) only because her parents were absolute assholes during her childhood and she loved a teacher of hers from high school so she wants to escape her past by ending up in a ""normal relationship"" that would somehow prove that she is a normal person? I do understand her struggles, as I had to go through similar problems when I was a teenager. But again, it makes her pretty unlikable, which is frustrating as she takes a lot of screentime away from our main couple.However, what kind of ruined this season for me was the last episode. I don\'t want to go onto spoilers, but you know exactly what I\'m talking about once you see the ending of Ep 11. Basically the show goes from goofy but wholesome romcom to very dire tone out of nowhere. And while this happens, Yukimura comes in and ends up serving as a comedic relief (I do admit, I did laugh at his scene, but knowing the seriousness of the situation, it was badly executed). Also, last scene also suggested that the show would turn into a harem if it were to get another season, which is an instant no-no for me personally.  Harem CAN BE good if executed well, but it very rarely is well-executed and it just doesn\'t fit this show in my opinion. Yukimura and Himuro are basically a perfect couple so breaking that dynamic feels completely wrong and forced for the sake of more wackiness.However, I did really like the episodes with Ibarada and Kosuke. Their relationship was hinted at during the Season 1, but during Season 2 it was explored very well. I think what they did here was excellent, while still maintaining their status as supporting characters. In fact, their scenes were usually the best ones from this entire Season. Unfortunately, they still have less screentime compared to Season 1 just like Professor Ikeda and Yamamoto, two that barely even show up in Season 2.Music and voice acting is consistently good in this show and while art of this show is definitely a hit or miss, it isn\'t bad in any way. Just a preference.Science Fell in love Season 2 isn\'t bad, it is best enjoyed as that show you watch when you have nothing else to do. But I still felt disappointed with how some plot-related things were handled. I did read some other reviews on this show and I gotta agree with one point another reviewer did. Somehow, every week, this show was always last in my viewing order and watching a new episode always felt like a chore, even if my initial reaction after seeing each episode was something like: ""yeah, it was a fun episode"". Judge that how you\'ll.

The plot is still cliché and the show as whole still lacks good writing.From episode 1 the season doubles down on the quantity of slapstick comedy without raising its quality, at least in the beginning. The first 2 episodes are painful to watch. The show can’t go 3 minutes without a cheap joke during them.I did have some hope for the show around the halfway mark. That’s the...moment when the show presents some episodes that are more dramatic and have more focused writing. I don’t want to say they are competently written but they are a lot better than the whole of season 1. Even the conflict between the cast has some sense in it.If I had to name one thing I liked about this season it would be that it elevated Kanade to almost an actual character instead of a flat, one trick pony. If only it didn’t do it in such a half-assed way. They showed her with something that could be interpreted as some personal, psychological issues but it turned out to be something lame, lazily written and cliched. There was absolutely nothing original or thoughtful about it and the resolution… Ok I’m gonna be honest, it had potential, but in the end it turned out dull. The moment they showed the core of her “pain” I lost all interest in her drama. It was so stupid that it’s not even worth mentioning.Apart from that the plot dives deeper into clichés. It has even less originality than it already had. There isn’t really anything wrong about it as long as the delivery is at least original or enjoyable. This show… doesn’t have that. The delivery is competent enough that it doesn’t turn You off and You can actually have some enjoyment watching a good portion of it but at the end of the day it’s just mediocre.Compared to season 1 the show does get a little more competent with its writing as the show goes on. It’s not enough to make it something worth Your time if You didn’t enjoy the previous season but it is enough if You were on the edge about it. You just need to survive the god damn abysmal first 2 episodes. moment when the show presents some episodes that are more dramatic and have more focused writing.

I have witnessed bad endings plenty of times, but never before have I seen something quite like this.Let me start this off by saying that this really didn\'t need to be made.  The first season\'s ending is exactly what you would expect for this type of show, and there was always going to be issues going forward.  The first few episodes re-affirmed to me that this was just going to be a worse version...of the first season.  The new characters introduced for the season all ventured a bit too far into the wacky anime comedy side-characters territory for me, and the comedy was noticeably worse than in the first season.  After four episodes, I lost the will to continue watching it weekly and shelved it until the end of the season.I picked up episode 5 expecting a similar level of quality as the first four episodes and to my surprise the show remembered what it was supposed to be.  The annoying sides left and the main couple got to shine.  I only really have one issue after the first few episodes, but I\'ll get to that later.  The parts of this season that are good far outshine the best parts of the first season.  Specifically episodes 6 and 10 were far above anything I would have expected from this.The biggest surprise for me during the middle episodes had to be what they did with the side couple.  I found the both of them to be alright in the first season.  This season gives them more to work with and they really benefited from it.  I am convinced at this point that male tsundere\'s are just the superior breed.  Every good friends group needs a punching bag, and he fills that slot really well.The best part of the show is still definitely the main couple.  If this show was just the two of them goofing around in the lab I could honestly almost give it an 8, but unfortunately we do not live in such a blessed timeline.Kanade is one of the worst executed characters ever written.  Everything they tried to do with her failed horribly.  It\'s really a shame, I thought that in the first season she did a solid job playing the straight man, but the author decided that that was not enough.  In goes everyone\'s favorite thing, forced drama!  Her backstory is painful.  Her relationship with Yukimura is painful.  Her awful definition of normal, and the way the show tries to force it\'s themes down the audiences throats is painful.  And the way it all blows up at the end is, more shocking than anything.If PN2 didn\'t exist the last episode would be the worst episode of TV that I\'ve seen.  I just don\'t understand how any human could watch that and enjoy it.  I don\'t understand how the guy who wrote the rest of this managed to think up such an abominable conclusion to this arc.  I don\'t understand how an entire Anime studio came together to create this, or how this was actually approved to be shown to the masses.  Everyone who allowed for this to happen should be ashamed of themselves.What could have been a great addition to the Anime Rom-com library was obliterated in mere minutes.  They managed to completely kill any desire I had for a second season, or even to continue reading the manga.  I can\'t even recommend this anymore because I know that ""just don\'t watch the last episode"" will never work.  At the time of writing this review I still believe that the upsides of the middle are enough to just barely give this a 6, but that could easily change.TLDR- fuck Kanade, all my homies hate Kanade of the first season.

It was very amazing when they can found out the problem they face with the data XD. You must watch it if you already watch season 1.Art (10)The art for this anime is awesome as before but I see more from this season such as shadowing that more realistic.Sound (10)All the sounds that they used are really very good and adjusted to the animation....Character (10)The main character is very memorable along with the supporter role. But this one Kanade become the spotlight in this season.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2022.Overall (10)Recommended to those who love research, data, and comedy with ecchi scene XD Character (10)The main character is very memorable along with the supporter role. But this one Kanade become the spotlight in this season.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2022.Overall (10)Recommended to those who love research, data, and comedy with ecchi scene XD"", 'Pretty good show ruined by a nasty ending.Ok rikekoi 2 started off pretty good actually, since there\'s no exposition needed, and we know the bullshit these characters do on a regular basis. Those who watch this season should expect more. And we get more, more wacky shenanigans about science and love, and I semi dig it. However, BRUH the last episode.So, the story is kinda bad in general, the premise of the story doesn\'t make sense (even in the first season), but we all know why came to this show, to see some smart yet stupid people find their love for each other. The...show delivered, their moments were really satisfying and the way they interact with the people around them makes this a pretty good show. BUT THE ENDING....The characters pretty much remain the same in the first season, the main couple\'s only development is towards each other, and the rest of the cast get good development. Yukimura is dense and logical, and Himuro is logical, but knows how to act like a normal person, and that\'s just made clearer in this season. Kouske and Ibarada have nice development, Ibarada gets a nice character moment, and actually admits to liking Kouske. While Kouske remains the same, it\'s actually kind of annoying, how he can\'t believe that he likes anyone other than Aika, but yeah that feeling is still there and he acknowledges it. The professor and the manga artist remain the same, or rather we\'re given new developments that already inline with their established character. Also, we\'re introduced to other characters who are Yukimura\'s student, and other couples. The other couple are just there to show us and the characters more romcom stuff, and Yukimura\'s student\'s character is very good for this show\'s standards. Ok last is Kanade, I mean I get the problem the show is trying to portray, but damn was it handled like trash.**SPOILER TIME** (Just skip over the spoiler section if you don\'t want to get spoiled)Oh my God, Kanade being ""not normal"" is a nice character problem to give to her, since before she was just there and didn\'t have anything going on with her. So it makes sense that she has this problem, and now that I think about it yeah this was really a good call, she was kinda bland to me at first. However, the fact that this was all an act, really raised my opinion on this show and really developed her character. So when it was her character arc, it was pretty good at first, it climaxed (what I want to believe) when Yukimura called her out. This was the perfect opportunity for her to accept her flaws and try to build a relationship made on her actual personality, BUT NOPE what we got was her falling deeper into despair and ultimately facing the consequences. I mean okay, I wondered how they would make her accept and change in one episode, maybe even accept her past and stuff like that, however, a GANG!? wtf. And of course, Yukimura comes in and saves her ass and other science bs. Still though, gotta be honest, they HAD to pull the twist that he\'s (kanade\'s partner at the time, I don\'t remember his name) an evil scum. Like WHAT THE HELL, to be fair even if he wasn\'t kanade did lead him on. Imagine how much better it would be if the last 3 episodes were her living a healthy life and confronting everyone, like her old teacher, her family, and her boyfriend. But nah, we gotta let kanade get captured and get saved by the powerpoint master. Alright rant over.**SPOILER OVER**Anyways, the rest of the elements like the art and the sound track were great, I really don\'t remember the ost coming in, but the op and ed slap.So my complaints for this is that some stuff really gets repetitive and kinda cliché at times. Look I really don\'t know how to express this, but the show was just overall an 8. However there was the ending, so a 7.Final thoughts: So, this show was a ride, we got to see some amazing couple developments in the main couple\'s side and also with the other characters, especially the others. Only held back by its repetitiveness and ending. But overall, a decent anime, what a season 2 should be, apart from some stuff. So yeah, good anime if you just don\'t watch the ending. show delivered, their moments were really satisfying and the way they interact with the people around them makes this a pretty good show.

But I couldn't take her monologue seriously with the situation she's in, it feels like the author wanted to get her development across with her being honest with herself and coming to terms with her own feelings but would Shikijou and those guys really wait for her to finish? It just didn't sit right with me especially after she...said she loves Yukimura but Shikijou didn't have much of a reaction to that...I do admit Yukimura coming in and bringing out a presentation was funny but I was expecting the other guys to shut him up a lot earlier than when they did...Though I have to admit it's much better getting to see Kanade being more honest with herself and acting freely around Yukimura, it's amusing how Himuro is like completely okay with Kanade having feelings for Yukimura, you'd think she'd want to monopolize Yukimura to herself but now they will compete with each other and see who Yukimura has more feelings for I guess. Does this mean Kanade will also get to have Yukimura for two minutes to indulge herself in?...Also Kousuke not being able to propose to Aika is so funny, the way he reacted to Ibarada was so funny too, it seems like he's getting more and more conscious of his feelings if they're affecting his love for Aika...Overall this was a fantastic series and I'd be so happy if this gets another season so we can see how Kanade's feelings for Yukimura affects the plot and how things will turn out for Kousuke and Ibarada, I was already surprised this got a second season so it's not like it's completely unlikely but I won't keep my hopes up too high.

Season 1 was literally perfect, sweet and funny and so heartwarming. And the first 6 episodes of this 2nd season were lovely! Then ep 6 really seemed like an ending, and I was confused... then the bear was like ""Don\'t worry, there are still six more episodes!"" and I, being blind, was so excited for more cute sciencey romance...between Yukimura and Himaruo that I got used to, and then the series TOOK A 180 and SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE. I was like ""Oh, the focus is on kanade, okay I guess, character development"". And then episodes 8-12 were like someone completely different TOOK CONTROL AND CHANGED THE GENRE TO A MUCH DARKER ONE AND MESSED EVERYTHING I ENOYED ABOUT IT UP. ALL WHOLESOME FUNNY ROMANCE WAS SHATTERED. KANADE TRAUMA??!! While I know that being treated that way had a severe psychological effect on her, and her behavior was not her fault by any means, BUT the way she fixated SO MUCH on the whole ""I have to kill who I really am and be a slave to society and fit what other people want me to be in order to be acceptable"" gave me such an ICK, and there was no realization about how TOXIC that was, she was FINE WITH IT. AND THE LAST EPISODE WITH THE CONTENT WARNING???!!! WHAT WAS THAT? KIDNAPPING AND BLOOD AND THEMES OF SA?! LIKE THIS TAGGED AS A ROMANCE COMEDY, WHERE DID THIS COME FROM??? DARK ANIMES EXIST AND THAT\'S FINE, BUTS THERE A TAG OR A WARNING GOING IN , AND THIS WAS JUST A COMPLETE BLINDSIDE. AND THE ""OH NOW RANDOM HAREM\' AT THE LAST LIKE, 2 MINUTES OF THE LAST EPISODE?

The main two scientists have the exact same dynamic but this time with a different relationship status. A few new characters get introduced. Himuro gets more backstory. So the season does expand on some necessary elements. It still executes them in a fine way.The ending to this season is weird, not going to spoil anything but it hit...the direction in a weird left field area. the direction in a weird left field area."", ""Anyone going into this anime needs to be warned in advance about its second half.If you liked what this anime was in its first season, I'd suggest you stop once it gets to Kanade's arc. Up till that point, this season was an easy 8/10 for me. But in its second half it goes from romantic comedy to some SAO-level, psychopathic, sexual harassment bullshit that violates everything good this anime had to offer. To be fair, this is mostly the last 2 episodes, but if you want to keep your experience of the anime untarnished, the first half is a good stopping point.This...used to be one of my hidden gems. When I first came across its premise, I was hesitant because I suspected it might end up being some boring edutainment show. So I was quite happy to find it was a genuine rom-com about 2 researchers who have feelings for each other and are trying to understand and quantify it. The quirky chemistry between the characters was endearing, their shenanigans were funny in an amusing, if not laugh-out-loud way, and the trivia was also pretty interesting. I found all the real-life studies researching various aspects about love, attraction, and emotions quite fascinating, and more importantly, I found this an interesting angle for a rom-com to take. And Himuro is just an absolute goddess! She's the nerdy girl you dream of, the kind you'd study your ass off for just to be in the same major as her.All in all, unless you were absolutely averse to science, this was a nice, wholesome romance that was very enjoyable.Which is why this sudden shift in tone is so criminal. Mind you, I'm not talking about the more serious themes of 'conformity' and questioning what is 'normal'. I'm talking specifically about those disastrous last 2 episodes. They sit about as well as you'd expect if you put a rape scene in Sesame Street. Not only does it feel like it belongs in some trashier, edgier anime, it's also executed abysmally.SPOILERS AHEADKanade, who's been struggling to be 'normal' and conform, gets abducted by a psychopathic guy, who spouts some lazy, brain-dead justifications for his actions, and about how she is the ideal 'normal' girlfriend he wants. Enter the hero, Yukimura, just in the nick of time!Now, you'd expect said hero, being the lauded 'science-type', to pull off some Heisenberg-esque (Breaking Bad reference) badass move....He pulls out a projector.And proceeds to give a presentation on Kanade's uniqueness and the virtues of non-conformity, as proven by her unique DNA. The next slide of his presentation has a video of all her colleagues sharing what they like about Kanade. She's tied and surrounded by hostile men, but sure, lets address her emotional baggage first. It's such a ridiculously juvenile approach to a very, very adult scene.Naturally, he's punched in the face for his efforts, which is the most logical part about this episode.Honestly, this ending has dethroned Darling in the Franxx to become the single worst ending I've seen for an otherwise good anime. It's like the heart and soul of the series was sold to milk it for more drama and more episodes. I can only hope its third season doesn't go the same route. used to be one of my hidden gems.

Each season covers 4-5 volumes.I heard voices of criticism that this anime is too 'squandered' instead of just going forward with love plot.I will risk a brave hypothesis and say that love as in, romantic feeling between people, is just a premise to something bigger. This might not be visible in anime, but if you read the manga you'll see that it focuses much more on the scientific world and the way science types see the world and express themselves. Which is really revolutionary because scientist representations in media...are limited to either nerd no-lifes or mad scientists, both of which are much too common.

They are also an inspiration to go forward with science studies.You'll see a lot of funny, awkward moments (such as the oxytocin competition) that could only appear in anime, but they're a nice cherry on top and if you're into this kind of hermetic humor, you'll be delighted.You'll see them struggling to make sense out of their emotions, because hey, emotions can't always be made sense of and when you use your brain that much, it'll be even harder.Go ahead and try it out if you need a refreshment from all these standard love and comedy anime, and especially if you are a science lover, like me.And if you really need a strong, straightforward romance option, try Steins;Gate instead. are limited to either nerd no-lifes or mad scientists, both of which are much too common.

In doing so, however, it takes things a step too far and jumps the proverbial shark.The last quarter of this season features such a severe shift in tone that I couldn’t help but wonder if I was watching another show entirely. There were attempts at comedy, sure, but they couldn’t soften the blow; simply put, this was not the show I signed up to watch. Even if another season gets released, I won’t be watching.

I don't know what got into the author's head but he just turned the whole plot upside down.The last...5 eps are an arc for the side character Kanade.

There are new characters and some character development, but viewers should know what to expect from this unique bunch of science and technology students.The second part, however, focuses more on Kanade and her struggles to lead a “normal” life. While the concept is a good idea, the arc is more drama-oriented and may stretch too much at the expense of the main plot. The worst part is the infamous, inappropriate, last episode. The themes of this episode are way too heavy and traumatic for this kind of story, and are treated with a cartoonish, psychopathic, delusional character.CHARACTERS: new characters, more character developmentThe main couple, Yukimura and Himuro are still the main focus with their unorthodox research. While they are still as logical as ever, they become more and more honest with their feelings for one another, making them now an uncontested couple However, they are not enough anymore to maintain the flow of the story.The other characters are not outdone.

While Ibarada's have been pretty much established since the first season, Inukai is the star, with his undying love for the virtual Aika seriously challenged in hilarious ways by the scientific facts of his peers' research and by his childhood friend's bolder and bolder teasing. This is always welcome in a slice of life, romantic comedy.New characters are also introduced: an established, luscious couple from another research lab. They are just as wacky as the other characters, but offer a different, informative view about love which is useful for the main couple's research.MUSIC: catchy songsThe opening and ending songs are catchy and memorable and fit the theme of the anime.

I will make this review as short as possible. The story continue where it left off in the last season, so nothing change much. I still watch it with the same expectation. My expectation is the relationship between Himuro and Yukimura. The other characters are secondary. I also didn't focus much on the story or rather I didn't try to reason the story and just went with the flow.  It's obvious that the story is crazy but my focus was elsewhere so my recommendation to those who are wanting to watch the second season is to not expect...anything much from this anime. If you do, you will end up writing a sh*t review. A few things you can expect from this anime are characters. About half the of the episodes are about Kanade's past and her struggles. But, it doesn't bother me. Lastly, the last episode is good. Now, I want a third season even if it has to been an OVA. I need the next stage of relationship about the ending of the last episode.

The story\'s mood is guided through friendly arpeggios, seamless key changes, and befitting subtle dynamics. Using only a piano, the piece stays true to its semi-minimalist nature. This adds on to...the beautiful, and sincere tone that ""Shashinkan"" exhibits.Its visual expression is very unique and stylistic. The characters have a simple and soft color pallette, and is contrasted by the detailed background, complimented with gorgeous patterns. All the colors are very harmonious, and creates a strong sense of \'togetherness\' as a piece. The character design is very charming, and allows the viewer to empathize with them.

The story is delivered in several segments, or snapshots, where we watch as a photographer struggles to bring the smile out of a young child. Photography plays a major role in this anime.The whole movie is void of any speech or talking. There are sublet background noises such as moans, laughs, and ones of nature. But this is all layered over with a classical soundtrack which if anything compliments the piece.The styling reminds of the Professor Layton Games, especially with the coloring. As we are presented...with a new snapshot, the time frame skips forwards a few years and we watch as the child grows up. The layering comes into play here as well. For instance, as the family descends the stairs to the photographers home, the landscape of neighboring houses is layered on top.The setting was placed during the first world war, though that was more layered to the background. If you were to see family photos from that time, you'd have hinted that war was taking place but there would be nothing overwhelming nor obvious as to how bad it was. This is nothing short of genius as overall, the whole story is presented to us as a family album. If you were to flick through one of your parent's albums, you'd see years skip by before your eyes. You'll see a story play out as how family members come and go. This whole concept was clearly taken into consideration and folded into this nice little 16 minute short.As it is short, it is well worth the watch and the story itself is heartwarming, to say the least. So if you have a few minutes to spare, if you need to take a little break. I suggest this is a nice way to do it. with a new snapshot, the time frame skips forwards a few years and we watch as the child grows up. The layering comes into play here as well.

But as I went on, I unearthed the true essence of this short. And while I can appreciate both its narrative and overall storytelling, I can't praise it too much.For starters, the run time is by far the weakest aspect of this video, everything that happens besides when the young girl is getting a picture goes by so quickly and unmentioned that it simply becomes a faint afterthought. The beginning scene, her mother almost has no place...in the story until the very end where they use her portrait to steer you in some emotional way.Same thing with the husband in the military who has no actual standing in providing substance to the plot until they decide to throw in sub-themes of war and loss. I understand the sub-themes are a way of progressing the morale of the picture and I can appreciate it but a lot of the oomph is removed when much of the emotional investment depended upon characters who I was never invested in.And no, I'm not some robot who didn't take anything away from the short just because of these inconveniences. I couldn't stop a smile from creeping up my face as I watched the final scene because I, in that moment had a sense of relatability. Just like her, perhaps I should smile more, and in general just see the better parts of life. As their town is getting urbanized and less people visit the store, a subtle detail I enjoyed, they are still able to smile after going through what they have gone through.A powerful and emotional message to be sure, but one that is so barely fleshed out that I really only found myself feeling anything at the climax.I'm feeling a decent 5 on this one. in the story until the very end where they use her portrait to steer you in some emotional way.Same thing with the husband in the military who has no actual standing in providing substance to the plot until they decide to throw in sub-themes of war and loss.

The problem I have with this is that it has a large roster of characters, but doesn't do the best job at convincing us to care about them. The show is fun to watch -- mostly for the character designs -- but they don't do the best...job of investing us in the storyline and plot. With maybe the exception of Li Qiang and the childhood friend, Memory of Chang'an, the characters aren't fleshed out enough to be interesting. Also, Li Qiang almost seems kind of OOC in the second season, especially when compared to the first - and it's nice that he's opening up a bit, but the rest of his changes, the oft-patented jealousy especially, don't really feel natural; the lying, especially, is kind of cringy. I got second-hand embarassment watching it. Compared to better Chinese anime like qzgs and mdzs, Memory of Chang'an is fairly mediocre. However, if you're just looking for something to pass time and/or some pretty characters, Memory of Chang'an has that. All in all, not the worst show out there. job of investing us in the storyline and plot.

Seitokai no Ichizon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5909/Seitokai_no_Ichizon,"['*Hekiou Academy Student Council Meeting Log*“… I am Kaicho (president), I am KaichoO! By the way, does the president do anything?” – excerpt from episode 11’s ending theme.What happens when four pretty girls and one handsome guy spend most of their school time everyday in a confined room? Naughty thoughts aside, if you were thinking “oh my god, not another harem” then you were right! Seitokai no Ichizon is NOT a harem, strictly speaking (though our male protagonist tries very hard to make it so). In reality the poor dude gets bully by his female mates more than he ever deserves. So who might...this anime be good for? If you are looking for a parody that pokes fun at itself and the entire anime industry in general, then Seitokai no Ichizon will surely meet and most likely exceed your expectation! In fact not only does it do a good job with the too-frequent parodies, but with high quality animation, and impressive new ending themes every episode, Seitokai no Ichizon is a great anime for all ages.The story of Seitokai no Ichizon centers around the everyday “adventure” of the student council in Hekiyou Gakuen high school. Its setting primarily consists of one place, the student council room, although exceptions do occur in the show from time to time. Now you must be wondering, what can a show that limits itself to one cramped room has to offer? Surprisingly the answer is, plenty. With plenty of jokes and plenty of parodies targeted at other recent well known anime, there is never one boring moment in the show for viewers to complain about. Even if the story itself does not attract the viewers enough due to its random episodic events, but by combining the story with the character interactions, nice consistent animation, superb voice acting, and addictive soundtracks and theme songs, Seitokai no Ichizon has some of the deadliest combination to make it stand on its own ground.It was interesting for the characters to repeatedly admit that “nothing ever happens” in their show. And yet they never fail to entertain the viewers with what they can do to make the show appealing solely by chatting. In fact, it is hard to judge these characters in any normal anime standard because they are out of the ordinary. As the casts themselves have put it, “This is where we end after airing twelve episodes? … The main character is supposed to mature after a time (but) … nothing changed.”. They poke fun at their own lack of character growth, but in actuality most characters have had their fair share of developments through learning about each others’ past or family problems. The characters certainly made a positive impact to the overall success of Seitokai no Ichizon due to their unpredictability.The animation is nothing but greatness. The characters are very nicely designed and even the one and only classroom is very detailed in design with a large variety of decorations and hidden rooms. Fluid scene to scene transition, consistent high quality animation, and a great choice of “scenery” also made Seitokai no Ichizon very attractive to the eyes. Additionally, comedic-like faces on the characters whenever a random chat start appearing also helps crack people up. The animation definitely is another strong point that makes up for the lack of story.At first I was very skeptical with the seiyu in this show because all the main female leads are apparently voiced by rookies. Yes, they are ALL rookies. New to the anime industry, these female seiyu all tried exceptionally hard to make themselves stand out as a bright star. Unfortunately they were all excellent in voicing their roles so I could not say who seem to be the most talented (unlike in other shows where one can clearly tell some seiyu just don’t go well with the particular role at all). It is, however, quite clear that these voices bring life to the characters in the series and bring entertainment to the viewers.Special honorary mention goes to the ending themes. Whether they are good or not, one must admit it was creative of the producers to make a unique ending song (same rhythm different lyrics) for each episode thus resulting in a total of TWELEVE ending themes. Even without the lyrics (and I strongly urge you not to miss them), the songs in itself is tremendously addictive. In fact, I could dance around my room all day with the song set on repeat in my computer. The opening, while less catchy, is still very pleasant to hear and once again it showed us the talents these new seiyu possess.Seitokai no Ichizon is a wonderful addition to the anime industry and made itself stood out among the mist of millions of other similar anime largely due to its parody at poking fun at itself and everything anime-related. The jokes are never too old or too repetitive throughout the show and the references are relatively simple to grasp (provided you are semi-familiar with recent anime). Keep in mind the show is made in Japan and is intended for Japanese viewers who most likely have a more knowledgeable database of the anime series in Japan than we do. If you don’t seem to be able to spot a parody or two in an episode, chances are, you have already missed out on some of the jokes they are making fun of. In that case, you should reconsider whether to continue watching the series or not. Lastly I would recommend anyone who have trouble at school, whether it is your grade or having trouble making friends, to try playing love simulation games (ie. harem games)! this anime be good for?

This is because to truly understand parody you have enough experience with the things that are being parodied.  As a foreigner to Japan and the majority of its culture, a great deal of this goes over my head as it would a foreigner trying to understand some of the humor from my own country.  All of that being said some things are universally funny in comedy and that brings us to Seitokai no Ichizon, an anime that forgets to deliver the most important element...a comedy must have... humor.There isn’t any real story in Ichizon.  The episodes are loosely tied together for the most part and center on the exploits of a high school student council.  While shows revolving around clubs and student councils are quite common, initially Ichizon appeared to be unique.  However the freshness of the series quickly wanes as I found just getting through each new episode was somehow a test of my patience and sanity.  I really wanted to like this series as well but as it went on and on I found it more torturous to watch.Is Ichizon bad anime?  Not really.  It’s just incredibly boring anime.  And that is the main problem it has.  Let’s begin with the humor.  The parody and comedy is way too forced and thus doesn’t have any flow to it.  It’s almost as if the writers thought the more anime and culture references they could pile in the funnier people would think it was without any regard to whether or not the jokes were actually, well funny.  Just because I can recognize that something is being lampooned or a joke is being told doesn’t mean it’s funny.  Sure there were many things I did find amusing and a few that I actually did laugh out loud at, but for the most part Ichizon is humorless and clichéd.The other main issue with the series as a whole is its claustrophobic setting.  90% of the series takes place in the student council room.  Even when they do leave the confines of that room then they soon seal themselves up in yet another small room.  Had the jokes and parody actually been funny, this might not have been such a problem but each episode is mostly just the five of them sitting around a table screaming, talking at the speed of light, or spouting whatever cliché or stereotype their personality type is based on.The ending is also rather bizarre.  While Ichizon by its own admission doesn’t take itself very seriously, the rather somber and serious nature of some of the last few episodes felt very much out of place.  For something was all about randomness and silliness this was a strange course to take.  It's a bit ironic that these episodes were actually the best ones in the series, which makes you wonder how much better it could have been as a whole if it had worked on developing the plot to lead up to them.Among Ichizon's characters, only Sugisaki Ken stands out in any way.  With most harem type shows the male lead is usually the dullest and most uninteresting character in the show.  Not so in Ken's case as he manages to carry the series by himself.  Pretty much the only times I really laughed was because of something he said or did.  The various girls of the council all have their own quirks but they all miss the same thing, actual personality.  Sure they were all adorable and cute to look at but each of them had two or three personality traits that were just used over and over making each of them less substantive than cotton candy.Artistically I found the characters to be very pretty and the styles and costumes were appealing.  However because the series is set in a rather dull and plain club room that means there is little in the way of backgrounds and that makes the show as a whole to seem more drab and uninteresting than it really should have been.  So while I found the art and animation to be very good, its setting brings it down much as it did with the story.What I did find refreshing was an almost totally fresh faced seiyuu cast.  In a time when the same dozen or so actors are reused ad nauseum it is really nice to hear some new blood.  That being said the performances really aren’t that strong and in the end sound just like what we are used to hearing already.  The music is fluffy and cute and not all that interesting.  Though some of the ending remixes were funny, particularly the one from episode 11.Ichizon in the end is disposable anime.  Its worth a few laughs and then meant to be throw away.  I doubt that anyone in a couple of years will even remember this show even existed.  Its a real shame since as I said before, I really wanted to like it.  While I don’t think it’s really terrible and maybe overall not quite as bad as I rated it, it was so boring and unenjoyable that it was painful to complete.  If you are fairly new to anime or haven’t seen more than a couple hundred shows you might find this to be pretty good.  For the more experienced viewer though, Seitokai no Ichizon is likely to be a disappointment. a comedy must have... humor.There isn’t any real story in Ichizon.

For a while there it felt like anime, as a medium, had decided to be a bit more inventive, a bit more creative. Hope is a great thing, no?To be fair, what happened next wasn\'t really the fault of SHnY, but the damage was already done. Beginning with Lucky Star, which was a pretty good comedy for the most part, the slippery slope of formulaic school based parody shows with a supposedly eclectic set of characters who literally do nothing rapidly became a tiresome methodology, with numerous shows following this trend until the...advent of Seitokai no Ichizon (The Student Council\'s Discretion).The story is based on a series of light novels, published from January 2008, by Aoi Sekina (with illustrations by Inugami Kira). Now one would think that an adaptation of a novel would have a bit more depth to it, but Seitokai no Ichizon seems to follow only one path - try to please as many people as possible.It\'s no surprise then that the show really struggles with plot coherency and development, especially as, barring a particularly dull sub plot, there isn\'t really any point to the story. The whole series is set, for the most part, within the confines of the Student Council Office, and while this may at first appear to be an orginal approach, one should remember that SHnY, amongst others, had very similar settings. The big problem with confining the story to a specific area is that there is a only so much the writers can do to develop the plot. Thankfully (maybe), Seitokai no Ichizon doesn\'t really try to develop what little plot it has, and is content to follow the path set by Lucky Star - lots of parodies, sketches and jokes while the characters do nothing.Now, one could consider the comedy in this show to be funny, and some of it actually is, but the fact remains that much of the humour has actually been done better in other shows (or do I need to mention Gintama). In addition to this, the series makes a great show of trying to get the audience involved, a bit like a really bad Christmas pantomime, but this effort begins to cool after the first few episodes. Instead of going down the route of actually showing how a typical student council works, and adding humour to that premise, Seitokai no Ichizon travels at breakneck speed towards one of the most pointless and inconclusive outcomes I\'ve ever seen.In all honesty, the one saving grace the series has in terms of it\'s story and plot is that I found some of the jokes to be funny, but even that wore off pretty quickly.Now don\'t get me wrong here. There isn\'t anything specifically wrong with Seitokai no Ichizon per se, especially as there have been other shows that have little to no back story, and arecompletely relian on parody, humour and audience partcipation. However, this shouldn\'t come at the cost of the characters, ir even of the humour itself, and it\'s unfortuante that the series has fallen into that trap. While the show resoundingly denies that it\'s a harem anime, the tried and tested stereotypes are available throughout the story, and the series has the feeling of being written by someone who really does believe they know what the audience wants, even when it comes to looks.That\'s right. Seitokai no Ichizon is very clearly on the moe bandwagon, especially when it comes to character designs. From the fiery tempered tsundere to the outspoken loli. From the silent but deadly hot chick, to the shy and withdrawn bundle of cuteness. This series makes no bones about who it\'s target audience is, and it targets that market with a certain degree of ruthlessness.That said, there hasn\'t really been a lot of thought as to how the characters should look. The presentation is that same, tiresome, fanservice tinged moe that that makes up up over half of the school based comedies around to date. While the presentation is pretty decent, one can\'t help but wonder why the cast doesn\'t feature anyone with any kind of physical blemish. The backgrounds and backdrops also follow a similarly over-simplistic style, espcially as most of the show is set in the student council office.As for animation, well, it\'s actually pretty good, especially during the parodies. The choregrpahy and animation design isn\'t the greatest, however it does serve it\'s purpose in that the whole show is simply a joke delivery system, and as such, there isn\'t really any need for top quality animation and CG. The characters move reasonably well for the most part, however the series looks and feels very similar to a host of others, and that is one of it\'s biggest problems.In terms of sound, Seitokai no Ichizon isn\'t too bad really. The OP, a boppy little J-Pop track called ""Treasure"", is sung by most of the cast and, aside from being fairly well chorepgraphed, is nothing to write home about. The ED, on the other hand, is where things get a little more interesting as the series features a variety of ending themes that are sung by at least two members of the cast.That said, they\'re still forgettable J-Pop songs.Acting-wise, the show is reaonably well represented, especially as the four main female leads are relative newcomers to anime. Given that fact, it wouldn\'t actually be unreasonable to assume that the entire show is nothing more than a platform to launch their respective careers (it\'s been done before after all). That said, there is some merit to their, and the rest of the cast\'s, performances as the characters, barring one or two annoying voices, are pretty well portrayed for this type of show.As for the characters themselves, well, where do I begin? The fact that this is an epsiodic parody harem comedy should give you a hint as to what you should expect. While the series is extremely moe-centric, the characters are all nothing more than stereotypes of the first order and, while they are reasonably good in that respect, at the end of the day that\'s all they are. The show tries to add some deeper meaning to the characters, especially to Sugisaki Ken, but these efforts don\'t fit in to the plot in any substantial manner, and serve as nothing more than distractions from the comedy. The characters don\'t develop in any manner that is both plausible, and in keeping with the story, and this is the main reason why the series is so reliant on the comedy content.There will be those who laud Seitokai no Ichizon for a number of perfectly valid reasons, and in certain respects it\'s a good series to watch. It\'s quirky, humourous, and somewhat engaging, and I will freely admit that it managed to make me chuckle, especially with Mafuyu\'s burning passion for BL. That said, the series could easily have taken things one step futher by throwing out all the stereotypes and going for something truly original as the parody would have had far more impact in that way. It\'s a shame then, that the show tries to take the more satirical path and tie it to parody as the two don\'t easily mesh, so what\'s left is a mish-mash of jokes and sketches that jump from one to another like a frog on a hot rock, and coherency is the first to fall victim to the lacklustre plot.All in all, this isn\'t a bad show, but it\'s not really a shining example either. Fans of shows like Lucky Star, Hyakko, PaniPoni Dash, and even SHnY, may find the series enjoyable, but may also find that much of the humour is a bit flat, or has been done better elsewhere. It\'s sad to say, but those who haven\'t had the opportunity to watch this type of series before may find this far enjoyable. It all depends on one\'s perspective.On the whole, this isn\'t the best example of a parody anime. Gintama, Lucky Star, even Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, give parody it\'s due, and use the gags in unusual and original ways. Seitokai no Ichizon, on the other hand, tends to stick to formula, and it\'s efforts to try and please everyone is the main reason why the show is as mediocre as it isl. advent of Seitokai no Ichizon (The Student Council\'s Discretion).The story is based on a series of light novels, published from January 2008, by Aoi Sekina (with illustrations by Inugami Kira).

It\'s a shame then, that the show tries to take the more satirical path and tie it to parody as the two don\'t easily mesh, so what\'s left is a mish-mash of jokes and sketches that jump from one to another like a frog on a hot rock, and coherency is the first to fall victim to the lacklustre plot.All in all, this isn\'t a bad show, but it\'s not really a shining example either. Fans of shows like Lucky Star, Hyakko, PaniPoni Dash, and even SHnY, may find the series enjoyable, but may also find that much of the humour is a bit flat, or has been done better elsewhere. It\'s sad to say, but those who haven\'t had the opportunity to watch this type of series before may find this far enjoyable. It all depends on one\'s perspective.On the whole, this isn\'t the best example of a parody anime. Gintama, Lucky Star, even Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, give parody it\'s due, and use the gags in unusual and original ways. Seitokai no Ichizon, on the other hand, tends to stick to formula, and it\'s efforts to try and please everyone is the main reason why the show is as mediocre as it isl.', '""What happens when you have 4 beautiful girls,a good-looking guy,a student council,parodies & comedy?Yes,you are right,the answer is HAREM,oh,no I mean Seitokai no Ichizon.This anime is a parody so you better be prepared before you watch this anime.Watch other anime it parodies or else you won\'t understand the jokes in a better way""(Story:-8/10)There isn\'t a linear plot in this anime i.e. each episode begins & ends randomly.The student council consists of 5 members.The first 4 student council members are chosen by votes.The top four who get most votes gets to be in the student council while 5th spot is for the student who gets most...grades.We have our 4 beautiful girls Aka-chan,Mafuyu,Chizuru & Minatsu who got their positions due to being well-liked by everyone while Ken who got in council simply by his hard work & good marks but his reason of joining it or more like the motivation of all of the study he did  is........only to form a harem.Sounds pretty generic,doesn\'t it?but it isn\'t.In fact it is better than most of harem anime I have seen.Almost the whole show occurs in a simple room which is obviously student council where all the members have fun almost all the time & do work only if they really have to do it.Afterall,They are not a ordinary student council.The majority of the show is spent in doing parodies of other anime like Lucky star,Suzumiya haruhi,Death Note,etc with reference of some others like baka test.There are also Mafuyu\'s crazy yaoi fantasies like she wants Ken to end up with her imaginative Nakameguro-kun or with his nii-san,who of course do not exist.These parts are really funny & you will be laughing really hard even if you are against yaoi.Often Ken mentions this student council to be a place of his dreams,a harem only to be beaten up or to be shut up by the girls.There is also a journalism club that likes to degrade council by spreading false news lead by Lilicia but that is only for comedic reasons.8/10 since the plot is very random.Art:-(9/10)The art of this anime is very clean & beautiful.It is not rushed & each area is explained carefully.The characters designs are also drawn beautifully & they look awesome.The backgrounds are also very impressive.Since most of this anime occurs in a single room so I am amazed how they end up not  making this room look boring.Most of time is spend in student council so it is described very well.There are also some scenes outside of the school & they still manage to do it impressively.There isn\'t a moment in this anime where I found the characters\' proportions weird plus I don\'t think so that I have seen this much of a single room before,lol.So,9/10 for its awesomeness:)Sound:-(9/10)Opening & ending songs do not feel anything memorable when you hear them for the very very first time but they will gradually grew in you,especially the ending song.The opening song may sound boring at first but by the end of it you will be already trying to download it.The ending song is actually one of my favorite.It is very funny especially  ""I am Kaichou"" one is awesome & you will be laughing very hard.I didn\'t noticed the BGMS very much since I was too busy laughing but the ones I noticed were nice.They are suitable to the mood the scene is trying to give.Voice acting is done very well.All of the female voice actors have done a good job.I especially liked Ken\'s voice actor.He has put great effort on his flirty side.Even when he cries,it almost feels like he is really crying.You can see the effort being put into it.Character:-(10/10)Now this is the department where this anime truly shines.At first you think that ""Oh no,this anime consists of usual archetypes."" but as you see more of it you realize that are different & are explained rather well,a thing some other anime lacks.It feels like all of them can understand each other.Even the side - characters in this series are not boring.Chizuru is a sadist who is very mature but there is an evil side to her.She loves teasing others as much as she loves our main heroine aka chan.Aka chan...is well....aka chan,the usual bubbly,loli & childish kid,errr,I mean girl(sorry aka chan)who wants to make the student council the best one in the world.Have you ever seen a tomboy who is good in maths or any other subjects?If not then you will see here.Minatsu is a tomboy who is good at maths.She likes action manga & is the strongest one in the group.Also she has a bit of yuri taste(I didn\'t really wanted to say it,err....anyways).Mafuyu may seem like the usual underclassman who is kind to other but can\'t make friends but here comes the difference.Even if she can\'t make friends she doesn\'t care about it,She is not like the usual,""Oh,I can\'t make friends"" type of girls she is different because she doesn\'t care about it & is happy with her seitokai friends.Her BL love is absolutely entertaining.The main character,Ken himself isn\'t boring either.In fact he is the most interesting main character in an harem or in this case HAREM-LIKE anime I have seen.Ken is a  KINDHEARTED  pervert who likes to play H-games & wants to make student council his harem simply because he loves happy endings due to an incident involving his girlfriend(I won\'t spoil it for you further)I like how the creator has took risks on her/his characters but they have come out really well.10/10 for this outstanding choice.Overall/Enjoyment:-(10/10)You will really enjoy it since enjoyment is one of the prime factors of this series.You will love the comedy & the jokes in this series.This is one of the best comedy series out there after all.If you can handle the little yaoi moments here & there then you will absolutely love it.Also remember to watch other anime before which it parodies to get a better idea of what is happening.Have fun & enjoy!!!^_^ grades.We have our 4 beautiful girls Aka-chan,Mafuyu,Chizuru & Minatsu who got their positions due to being well-liked by everyone while Ken who got in council

Sugisaki never fails to amuse me because he is always over dramatizing things and he adds a lot of amusement to the series.

The story tells us about the student council of the Hekiyou Gakuen, they are led by a Moe-type girl that often create a strange policy and do their strange job.Actually, there is no real plot in this anime, Seitokai no Ichizon is an episodic series that stands alone between episodes. The anime filled with parody spit out all over the place. Now, a parody series  can extremely fail if the audience didn't know what is being parodied.

The character design was decent.As for the sound settings, we have a well-produced sound but not really represents the symbol of this anime.

This is a prime example of this and the fault lies entirely with the producers, because they need to deliver what fanboys want, they do not want to make good anime.The result is something like this, and of course many others, but since this is a review, or perhaps a bit of a... mm... discussional block of text(?) I will confine myself to this production known as Seitokai no Ichizon. An anime about...a student council and their daily antics (like that's never been done before eh?).But for the sake of argument; fine. It's about a student council. I was, like always, very sceptical about this anime, but I thought hey let's give it a chance, atleast for one episode. The first episode did not suck as much I thought it would, which is a good start for any anime when it encounters me as its viewer.Soon enough though, the problems start piling up. First of all, as my initial paragraph states, this anime does not know what it wants to portray. Parody? Sure, it had parody, it has spoofs and it tries to keep a lighthearted slice of life-ish approach to everything, but it can't stick with it. It floats around too much, it feels the need to introduce character development which in this anime should have been kept far, far, far, far away. Who the hell introduces character development in a slice of life, school parody in the 11th and 12th episode when the entire anime is 12 episodes long? It felt so misplaced I was about to drop this anime both on episode 11 and 12, but I don't like dropping anime so I kept on watching this all too predictable anime til the end and I saw a conclusion that anyone with a typewriter and normal IQ could have written.Like I said initially, I truly hate when anime don't know what it wants to say which basically means it; briefly passes over 10 different genres and never stays at any single one long enough to even give some small depth which in turn turns into entertainment value. This, of course, causes it to decline in quality very rapidly which is why I was going to give this anime a 3, but then I remembered a certain scene fairly early in the anime that had to do with a spoof on yaoi and I decided it was worthy of a 4.No, please do not share with me your thoughts unless you agree with me, it will be too much effort for me to delete your comment from my profile. a student council and their daily antics (like that's never been done before eh?).But for the sake of argument; fine.

Involving a student council, as the name suggests, discussing various subjects in their room for the most part.  A student council made up of the four most popular students and the most studious student.  Unsurprisingly the four most popular are girls.  Funnily enough, or not, the most studious is a male.  So begins their story, or they say.The real name of the series, or so I heard, is actually the Hekiou Academy Student Council Meeting Log....True to that namesake, the whole of the rather episodic plot takes place in the student council room.  Well, that's not the worst that could happen (they even warned the viewers about it in typical fourth wall demolishing fashion).  They only good thing I appreciated was the back story that runs parallel to the episodic gags of the day.  As the seasons pass, the motivation for our male lead is fleshed out.  It may seem jarringly out of place as there is no warning when there are flash backs tough.  The conclusion that is reached at the finale of sorts is the kind that brings about a warm and fuzzy feeling.The art is quite characterful.  It shifts willingly between detailed shots and standard animation thoroughfare. Being a mostly cutesy little thing, I have no problem with it.  Those who have watched more anime than I will have quite a time identifying visual references, which is part of the anime.  However, since the majority of the action takes place in the student council room, it is a shame we can't see pristine backdrops for anything outside.On the other hand, the sound not something to write, home or anywhere else, about.  Most of the time, you wouldn't even know its there.  But I guess that's what background music is about.  I have little to say of the voice acting either except that its adequate.  However, the Konami code in some of the endings is a nice touch in running with their style to reference everything as obviously as possible.Since the show lacks some what of a plot, it tries to make it up with characters.  A brave attempt as initially, we are presented with seemingly one dimensional stereotypes called main characters.  Its as the show progresses that we are shown another side.  Its brief and fleeting yet still manages to impart a small sense of triumph over the discovery.  Okay, so the president gets less comedy driven defining moments and is as happy go lucky as a lark, but that doesn't diminish her effect on the cast as a whole.  The secondary characters get their little moments too.  They support the main cast well with their infrequent interactions such as Nakameguro, our lead's bromance soul mate (or so Mafuyu likes to think).A good thing too.  Over reliance on over used or stale gags and references could not have possibly made this show tolerable for more than a few minutes.  That is probably why I was able to enjoy Seitokai no Ichizon. A personal favourite moment would be Elise who manages to corner her own sister, to name one of her victims, using words and trains of thought that probably shouldn't exist in someone her age yet.  Under no pretence is this show trying to do something new, but it can be enjoyable.  I don't know whether that'd make me broad of mind or simplistic but let's not go there.  As such, this review, finito! True to that namesake, the whole of the rather episodic plot takes place in the student council room.

However, the Konami code in some of the endings is a nice touch in running with their style to reference everything as obviously as possible.Since the show lacks some what of a plot, it tries to make it up with characters.  A brave attempt as initially, we are presented with seemingly one dimensional stereotypes called main characters.  Its as the show progresses that we are shown another side.  Its brief and fleeting yet still manages to impart a small sense of triumph over the discovery.  Okay, so the president gets less comedy driven defining moments and is as happy go lucky as a lark, but that doesn't diminish her effect on the cast as a whole.  The secondary characters get their little moments too.  They support the main cast well with their infrequent interactions such as Nakameguro, our lead's bromance soul mate (or so Mafuyu likes to think).A good thing too.  Over reliance on over used or stale gags and references could not have possibly made this show tolerable for more than a few minutes.  That is probably why I was able to enjoy Seitokai no Ichizon. A personal favourite moment would be Elise who manages to corner her own sister, to name one of her victims, using words and trains of thought that probably shouldn't exist in someone her age yet.  Under no pretence is this show trying to do something new, but it can be enjoyable.  I don't know whether that'd make me broad of mind or simplistic but let's not go there.  As such, this review, finito!"", ""[Story: 5.5] The success of shows like Suzumiya Haruhi and Lucky Star has initiated many new trends – from having characters dancing in the theme songs to featuring genre-savvy meta characters as the central gimmick. Seitokai no Ichizon is yet another anime jumping onto the bandwagon, bringing with it a setting that parallels said shows. Clearly, the influences are undeniable. Again, this is understandable. Since references and parody anime has become the new fad, it is natural (expected, even) for the industry to produce more of such shows, because ultimately, the industry exist to sell itself. With that said however, it all goes back to...something fundamental: doing something that is considered popular does not make you popular. And that’s where Seitokai no Ichizon flops.Seitokai got too ambitious for its own good, overestimating its own limits. Every episode, the show tries to cram in as much references as it could and here’s the problem: it merely made references, rather than crack a joke using the references it made. It is obvious that they’re merely deliberately using popular references to appeal to as much of the demographics as possible; It is often random, redundant and often lacking in any sort of punchlines. Ichizon does have a few funny moments. Then again, too few funny moments anyway.Seitokai is like guidebook that is supposed to teach you how to be funny so it’s crammed with lots of comedic technique, except that the author of said guidebook has no sense of humor. Theoretically, Seitokai is supposed to be funny. In reality, Seitokai is akin to the poor awkward kid who memorized the “list of top 10 jokes” and tried to make someone laugh but wasn’t good at delivering the punch line. Or just printed out the list from the internet and read it out to others, without an idea of what ‘articulation’ means. Similarly, that’s also why their attempt at things like self-deprecating humor, and sometimes hypocritical humor, is ironic for different (read: wrong) reasons.[Characters: 6.0] Strangely enough, a lot of the scenes that had me chuckling a little are the ones where they don’t try to randomly hurl references. It was thus quite a pity as all the unnecessary references interfered with the characters, giving them very little chance to go for a gag centered on their personalities. This also ruined some of the more sentimental scenes in the later part of the show – these scenes simply had too little time to be shown. The result is, the supposedly touching scenes felt rather shallow and forced. Not good for the characters’ development, particularly bad for Sugisaki.Playing with the 4th wall is a popular meta-fictional technique that once challenged the concept of the boundary between a medium and its audience. However, this technique is now so prevalent in pop culture that it is no longer a guaranteed trump at being witty. Also, the characters used it way too often to the point of abuse. On another note, Seitokai lacked subtlety; the references are too obvious – and sometimes too blunt - to even be amusing.[Art: 7.0] The art quality is decent; not too shabby, but not fabulous either. Character designs are also more of above average. Well, then again, considering the show’s genre, fanciful animation isn’t exactly a prerequisite so that’s okay, I guess.[Music: 6.5] Nothing impressive with the music either. The theme songs are basically that of those generic harem/ rom-com sort of show but in this case I’ll assume that’s what they’re going for – though that still doesn’t change the fact that the music is rather bland.[Summary] Watch Hayate no Gotoku instead. Or Gintama (if you don’t mind the crude humor that goes with the parodies and references). Gosh, now I really can't wait for an anime adaptation of the manga, The World God Only Knows. something fundamental: doing something that is considered popular does not make you popular.

There is no visible plot (or yet) and it pretty much just injects a fair amount of lulz and references into some sort of situation...which presents itself each episode, which a great amount of us wouldn\'t mind seeing if that was the case.The problem began after the first half of the episode. In a somewhat awkard way, the show attempted to bring in some heart-warming/ somewhat depressing scenario which would propel the plot forward, creating inconsistent and confusing pacing. It feels kinda unsatisfying I guess; you want gag but they throw in the serious. you want serious they cheapen it with gags. In my case, who can\'t seem to comprimise in the middle, this show is around average.To reconfirm my stance, i actually went and read the manga a bit. And... it feels like an alternate retelling rather than an adaption...The attiude when watching this to avoid dissapointment:Don\'t get overhyped by the gags. getting too much excitement in your brain makes it difficult to swallow the next half.well, since I\'m lazy I ain\'t commenting on other parameters (technical-wise, it\'s pretty good). Despite all i\'ve said, do have a look at Seitokai. After all, I\'m known are being slightly paranoidPS. if you don\'t understand most of the technical wording in this review, you might not be for this show yet and you might miss some of the punchlines.

On the rare occasion that the Seitokai was actually shown going outside for a prolonged period of time, the background details were decent; I couldn\'t notice any sloppy or rushed animations. As for the characters, they were well-drawn and easy to look at.Characters (9/10)What I like in an anime is for the characters to be different. Variety makes for a good experience and this is exactly what Seitokai no Ichizon did. Despite using common archetypes...like the loli, the sadist, the tomboy, the shy girl and the perverted male, the combination of these characters made watching the show enjoyable. It is evident that, because of these archetypes, the gags and jokes shown in each episode work well. In a show like this, I\'m not looking for character development but character compatibility instead. If characters don\'t fit well with each other, the comedic moments won\'t have as much impact. Fortunately, this is not the case with Seitokai no Ichizon. I found that all the characters\' interactions were smooth and natural, with the included comedy helping to define each of the characters\' personalities.Sound (7/10)Most OPs and EDs take time to grow on me but for Seitokai no Ichizon\'s OP, it was different. After hearing it for the first time, I immediately had to look it up and download it. It has a upbeat and catchy rhythm along with great vocals. To top it off, the seiyuus of the four Seitokai members sing it. The ED was decent but the variations didn\'t impress me. To be honest, the BGM was barely noticeable. I actually don\'t remember any of the tracks as I am writing this review. The voice acting was decent; though I don\'t think much ""skill"" was needed in this show when compared to those that are drama-heavy. Overall, I would say that the sounds in general met my expectations.Story (7/10)Well, I didn\'t really expect much of a ""story"" given that it\'s a comedy and parody series. Nonetheless, the last couple of episodes did explain a bit about the main protagonist and his relationship with the other Seitokai members. There were also some bits and pieces about the lives of the other characters but nothing too significant. Since I didn\'t expect a story but got still got a broken but interesting one, I think I\'ll leave the score at a 7.Overall (7/10)Aside from the disturbing scenes with BL, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Seitokai no Ichizon. It\'s something that I think helps you unwind after a long day or after watching something depressing. The more anime you watch that aired before Seitokai no Ichizon, the better your experience will be when you watch it since they reference many other popular anime out there. I recommend this to almost anyone who enjoys some comedy or who is looking for some anime to kill their time with. No matter what kind of anime you may be seeking, give Seitokai no Ichizon a try. As for me, I\'m going to wait for season two. Hopefully, it will provide the same feel as season one but with something new.

Looking forward to it.', ""Allow me to share my opinion on Seitokai no Ichizon.Student Council's Discretion (Seitokai no Ichizon) is a parody, comedy, harem anime based on the light novel by Aoi Sekina and Kira Inugami. The show was produced by Studio Deen and aired between October 2, 2009 and December 18, 2009. The anime has 12 episodes in total.Story-line (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon doesn’t have a plot, as its episodes are standalone and the events of all episodes don’t add much to the next episodes. Every episode shows the council members chatting, instead of doing things a normal student council should do. Each episode is packed with plenty...of jokes and parodies from other anime. The show doesn’t have enough characters’ development; yet, it does describe characters, which helps the viewer to form a better opinion on the anime’s cast.Art (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon’s art style uses a mix of colors to make the show more appealing to the viewer. The show takes place mostly in the student council’s room, which is surprisingly doesn’t get boring at all. For the scenes that don’t take place in the student council room, they are beautiful to look at. The characters have all been well designed and are pleasing to look at. Overall, the show’s art style has a feel that nothing has been sloppily made, or rushed, which was, of course, a big plus of this show.Sound (8/10)The music of the opening gives the viewer a nice feeling with its cute and soft vocals, whereas the ending songs leave the viewer with a laugh, as the lyrics make fun of the otaku culture and are just funny to listen to. Each ending song is different to give the viewer something new at the end of each episode, which I liked much. The background music has been well-made, because each music piece fits the mood of what the characters are talking about. To my big surprise, all voice actors did one hell of a job voicing their characters. They were new to the industry; yet, they managed their work.Characters (10/10)The anime follows five members of the student council at Hekiyou Academy.--Kurimu Sakurano, voiced by Mariko Honda (Yuuko Aioi from Nichijou and Mazinger Z from Robot Girls Z) - is a child-like president of the student council, who acts somewhat childish and loves sweets. At the beginning of nearly every episode she writes briefings on a white board.--Chizura Akaba, voiced by Yuka Saitou (Mira from High School DxD and Ritsu Kisaragi from Kiniro no Corda: Blue♪Sky) - is a sadistic secretary, who loves Kurimu and is always trying to cuddle and abuse her.--Minatsu Shiina, voiced by Misuzu Togashi (Origami Tobiichi from Date A Live and Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki) - is a tomboyish vice-president, who loves shounen to a point that most of her suggestions are based on them.--Mafuyu Shiina, voiced by Yuki Horinaka - is Minatsu’s little sister and the club’s treasurer. She is addicted to video games and loves BL novels.--Ken Sugisaki, voiced by Takashi Kondou  (Hibiki Laytis from Fairy Tail and Takumi Kaizu from _Summer) - is the valedictorian, or “blue chip” seat on the council because of being the highest scoring student. He loves to play eroge and bishoujo games. He dreams and plans to make the rest of the student council members his harem.Enjoyment (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon is an anime that shows that a heavily detailed plot isn’t always needed to make an enjoyable anime. Its use of jokes and parodies really helps to carry the show. The anime’s cast made the show very amusing, and I found them quite likable. The message that is given to the viewer in Seitokai no Ichizon is friendship. It reminds the viewer what most high schoolers find important, being able to spend time on studying, talking, relying on others for support, and building bonds with people they like.Overall (8,4/10)Seitokai no Ichizon has a nice charm to it with its comedy. The only problem of this show is that some of the show’s jokes rely on the viewer and that the viewer should have a good experience in anime, which may be difficult for one. While there are many anime better than Seitokai no Ichizon, it may still be enjoyable for one.

I recommend this show to people who like comedy and simple stories without the need for a deeper plot."", 'Seitokai no Ichizon is a parody anime, so, therefore, it would make a lot of sense for me to try to fit in as many references as I can because, why not?Story: The story of Seitokai no Ichizon revolves around 5 people who exist in a school that determine their student council via a popularity contest.  Because of that, they are usually good-looking girls.  The fifth member is always the person who scores highest on a midterm.  And so, with 4 girls and a guy, what\'s going to ensue?  HAREM!  or not.  With this in mind, the plot...of this anime doesn\'t really go anywhere.  In fact, it goes nowhere.  But, for an anime that purely focuses on its characters and comedy, plot really has no need to exist, so yeah.  Think about it like ""Lucky Star"" or ""Love Hina"" if you will.Characters: For the main characters, we have, as I have stated before, 4 girls and a guy.  Ken Sugisaki as literally the only guy in this anime is well, a pervert.  Constantly playing h-games and trying to set ""flags"" on the girls like Keima, his only goal in this anime is to not date one of said girls, but to create his own ""harem ending"", which basically means that he wants every girl to love him, without actually dating them.  This goal came along with the motivation to actually get into the student council and meet said girls.  Similar to animes like Love Hina, the world god only knows, and Nyarko-san.  (They all have a harem ending sort of deal).  However, this character has a more, softer side to him.  After they finish pissing about in an episode, he always accomplishes the work that they were supposed to do together, by himself.  Showing that he in fact wants the girls to be happy.  Next, Kurimu Sakurano.  As the lolita of the series, she is the oldest of the group, being a third year in high school.  As the student council president, she makes sure everyone is doing their job and no one is slacking of-hahahaha!  I can\'t go through with it.  Being the smallest and most child-like of the group, she basically acts like a 7-year old.  To summarize her briefly, she has a sweet tooth, she\'s child-like, she\'s horrible at school, and she\'s self conscious about her body.  Not really much else to say.  Next, Chizuru.  As the most ""sadistic"" one of the group, she bears resemblance to Mikako from Sora no Otoshimono, as they are both insane!  Thinking about world domination and possessing Kurimu as a servant, she truly is the most ""evil"" one out of the bunch.  It should also be noteworthy that she has a Death Note with her.  Next, Minatsu.  To put it short, Sports, fighting manga, aggressive attitude.  As the tomboy of the group, she has is basically who she is.  Not too many characteristics with her.  And finally, Minatsu\'s sister, Mafuyu.  As the youngest member of the student council, she possesses incredible game knowledge and doesn\'t really possess much of a personality other then being shy talking to guys.  As a master of games as she is, she constantly works on blogs for game strategies and love yaoi.  Yes, yaoi.  All these characters are very one-sided with very little character growth.  The side characters really have no purpose other then pose a problem or move the story along.Art and sound: The character designs in this anime a incredibly well done due to how fine detailed they are.  Because the school outfits have ruffles in them, it\'s very plain to see how precise the creators are when it comes to designing them.  As for sound, well, it\'s definitely good to listen to, but not really anything to get stuck in your head.  The OP has a sort of somber feel to it which is very off putting because of how energetic this show actually is.  It doesn\'t really fit.  The ending however has a comedic chibi art style and is quite energetic, but not as much as it should.  In short, the soundtrack sounds good, but not as memorable as it can be.Personal Enjoyment: As a harem fan, I was pleasantly surprised on how this show would turn out.  In fact, it surpassed my initial expectations with the idea of a harem only being in one person\'s head, which is actually pretty funny.  The comedy in this is slapstick to a certain degree, with Japanese humor which sometimes, people don\'t get.  It\'s always funny to see the lead male get mistreated to the point of actually feeling sorry for him for suffering the abuse he gets from the girls, i.e. getting thrown into a cramped locker so the he wouldn\'t see the girls in swimsuits.  They sometimes break the fourth wall which is usually pretty entertaining.  i.e. the fact that they have an anime in the first place, and trying to change their characters via a sentence ending.  Ex. Squid girl\'s ""de geso.""  While this show has many references that entitle it to being a parody anime, it sort of loses its touch with the amount of references it shows.  Sure, there\'re a bunch in the first few episodes, with its first ""opening"" in the first episode being lucky star, but to me, there should\'ve been more references/episode.  Another turn off for me was the addition of plot.  As a comedy anime, there shouldn\'t be any plot whatsoever.  But the thing is, the anime tries to take itself seriously for 2-3 episodes and make it seem like an actual story.  To me, a comedy should just be pure mindless humor, and the addition of trying to make a plot just made it lose its touch.  But nonetheless, it is interesting to delve into the minds of these characters and see if there were any ties, which there are, but it doesn\'t really all come together as nicely as it could\'ve.  In any case, Seitokai no Ichizon is a hilarious little short anime that almost lives up to the parody name, and I would suggest to watch it if you want to just kill time. of this anime doesn\'t really go anywhere.

The side characters really have no purpose other then pose a problem or move the story along.Art and sound: The character designs in this anime a incredibly well done due to how fine detailed they are.  Because the school outfits have ruffles in them, it\'s very plain to see how precise the creators are when it comes to designing them.  As for sound, well, it\'s definitely good to listen to, but not really anything to get stuck in your head.  The OP has a sort of somber feel to it which is very off putting because of how energetic this show actually is.  It doesn\'t really fit.  The ending however has a comedic chibi art style and is quite energetic, but not as much as it should.  In short, the soundtrack sounds good, but not as memorable as it can be.Personal Enjoyment: As a harem fan, I was pleasantly surprised on how this show would turn out.  In fact, it surpassed my initial expectations with the idea of a harem only being in one person\'s head, which is actually pretty funny.  The comedy in this is slapstick to a certain degree, with Japanese humor which sometimes, people don\'t get.  It\'s always funny to see the lead male get mistreated to the point of actually feeling sorry for him for suffering the abuse he gets from the girls, i.e. getting thrown into a cramped locker so the he wouldn\'t see the girls in swimsuits.  They sometimes break the fourth wall which is usually pretty entertaining.  i.e. the fact that they have an anime in the first place, and trying to change their characters via a sentence ending.  Ex. Squid girl\'s ""de geso.""  While this show has many references that entitle it to being a parody anime, it sort of loses its touch with the amount of references it shows.  Sure, there\'re a bunch in the first few episodes, with its first ""opening"" in the first episode being lucky star, but to me, there should\'ve been more references/episode.  Another turn off for me was the addition of plot.  As a comedy anime, there shouldn\'t be any plot whatsoever.  But the thing is, the anime tries to take itself seriously for 2-3 episodes and make it seem like an actual story.  To me, a comedy should just be pure mindless humor, and the addition of trying to make a plot just made it lose its touch.  But nonetheless, it is interesting to delve into the minds of these characters and see if there were any ties, which there are, but it doesn\'t really all come together as nicely as it could\'ve.  In any case, Seitokai no Ichizon is a hilarious little short anime that almost lives up to the parody name, and I would suggest to watch it if you want to just kill time.', ""There have been a lot of mixed feelings about Seitokai no Ichizon,  I for one think this anime was quite good and this is why.  (Ya I suck with introductions)Although Seitokai no Ichizon has no real plot to it I still found this anime very refreshing to watch.  The anime includes a ton of references and quite a bit of the material made me laugh.  However at some points I did feel that Seitokai no Ichizon overdid it with the comedy.  Even though it was fun to watch at some points I felt some of the material was really random...and it really had no point to it.One of the things I really liked about Seitokai no Ichizon was the serious story at the end of the episodes.  Although at first I didn't know what it was there for in the end it all tied together in the end, which is one of the main reasons to why it got so much popularity during it's last episode.  I think that the back story behind Seitokai no Ichizon was what pulled me in because to me a comedy just for the sake of being a comedy is not good. However that is just me, other people might not like the serious story behind it.The artwork for this anime was actually pretty good except it has one major flaw, about 90% of the anime took place in one room.  I don't know if this was because they had a limited animation budget or what. Other than that I really liked the artwork but since everything happened in one room I can't give it that high of a score for this category.The characters were greatly done.  Each character has a distinct feature that makes them, them.  The main male lead was especially well done, I cannot put my finger on it but he just stands out from other male protagonists.  Although I liked the characters I still think they were a bit plain but not that much.Overall this anime is a really good time waster, it's very refreshing but it does overdo it.  If you want to watch something that would make you laugh I would recommend Seitokai no Ichizon. 7/10 and it really had no point to it.One of the things I really liked about Seitokai no Ichizon was the serious story at the end of the episodes.

The artists did a great job on creating moving backgrounds which captures the eye of the viewer and draws you into the scene even more.  However, the backgrounds were barely used as a majority of this anime takes place in the student council room....Fear not for the characters of the student council were each beautifully drawn and their movements throughout were fluid and seamless.The characters were each unique and filled all the particular slots needed for a true harem to Kens approval I am sure.  The relationship between the characters steadily grows throughout the anime despite the girls utter disrespect towards Kens goal of forming the student council into his own personal harem they still grow closer as a group as they realize each others passions and feelings.The plot of this anime is souly focused around the student council and their activities with a side plot of Kens Harem.  This plot is very weak, yet through humorous chatter, a multitude of paradies (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Death Note, Clannad, and many more), and the over all want of Kens dream to come true this series remains very entertaining.  I found myself quickly finishing this anime.The comedy of Seitokai No Ichizon was hillarious.  The main reason I feel is not only because of the jokes themselves but also that each character is so well concieved that their personalities become part of each joke.  This is somehow seamlessly done within just a few episodes that it amazed me how I was able to feel connected to the characters in such a short time, without background stories and just by watching and listening to the endless banter.Due to the sheer volume of entertainment this anime provides I highly recommend this series and I look forward to season 2 which has been confirmed :D (http://www.ani.me/zine/anime/article/709/).  However despite the entertainment value it does lack substance in plot and character progression, but hey…its a comedy…deal with it :D.Rating 7/10@GameJok3rhttp://animejok3r.tumblr.com Fear not for the characters of the student council were each beautifully drawn and their movements throughout were fluid and seamless.The characters were each unique and filled all the particular slots needed for a true harem to Kens approval I am sure.

very first review on MAL,and I \'ve decided that it\'s going to be about my favourite fall season show which just ended recently,Seitokai no Ichizon.This review might contain grammar mistakes and wrong uses of words,since I myself am not a native speaker to begin with.however,I\'d be very glad if someone found this useful.Please notice that the overall ratings doesn\'t show how much I like this show.It\'s just the average of all the aspects like animation or sound,etc...Therefore it should provide you a true and fair view about how enjoyable this show is in my opinionStory:left outAs mentioned,SnI is a show about the...endless chatting of a group of teenagers in the student council room.There\'s not much thing going on,therefore I decided to leave out the rating for the story,since it might be unfair to do the rating for such a serie like thisSound:9/10SnI features a bunch of rookie voice actors (4/5 of the main cast had their first debut in the show).However, I must say that they did a really great job there.The voices greatly suit the characters\'s personalities and successfully reflect them,from the shy,BL and games addict Mafuyu to the ""so-called"" tsundere Minatsu;the manipulative and dark but mature and kind hearted Chizuru and the childish Prez.And,of course we can\'t forget about Kondo Takashi,a rather experienced voice actor who did a really great job in dubbing Sugizaki Ken.Put all of them together in a show and you are sure to experience fast-paced,gatling gun conversation exchanges,which I found to be very exciting and unique on its own.The BGM is nothing special,as well as the OP song,althought the varieties of the ED songs might be a plus point(there is 1 ED for each episode!!!)Character:9/10At a glance,the cast of SnI might seem to be nothing special,a harem consisting of a specific group of girls:a student council president,a tsundere,a shy girl and a mature one;and a main lead.However,each an every character has their own traits which make them very unique.The Prez is a loli inside-out,the tsundere doesn\'t have any ""dere"" at all as well as being good at maths and athletic(very contrary,I know) ,the mature girl is a bit of a sadist and a lesbian while also being manipulative herself,and the common shy girl also happens to be a game addict and a BL lovers(which gives wings to many of her fantasies between the main lead and a certain boy).And,unlike your common harem,the girls hardly show any feelings towards the boy,results in the show having no ""romance"" tagdespite being a harem anime.And,last but not least is the main protagonist,Sugizaki Ken,who serves as a punch-line character,a harem lead without any usual wishy-washiness as he declared to conquer the student council and make them his own harem but actually is a good boy at heart.The rest of the cast is also interesting.I had to admit that Elise is one of the most(if not the most) interesting and manipulative loli I\'ve ever seen,despite her cute appearance.Art:7/10The art is above average.The character designs are cute,however as the show features mainly in a room,there is not much thing to say about itEnjoyment:8/10As a parody show it requires a bit of experience in watching anime to fully appreciate all the jokes and parodies(personally I could only catch 70% of the references after having watched anime for 5 years),therefore it might be not that good for people who just start watching anime .The drama is a bit lame as it only gives us a vague idea about Sugizaki Ken\'s past.The fan service is suprisingly good an humourous since more than half of them coming from the main lead\'s fantasies.Overall,it is really an enjoyable show and my favourite for the fall seasonThank you for reading.Hope this can be useful for you

be kind of weird so here we go!!... anyways Seitokai no Ichizon was an amazing anime!! It was funny, so very moe, and very entertaining. The anime is about a school council, that...well does nothing. The School council consists of 5 students, Kurimu Sakurano, the president, who has a small stature and has an insane sweet tooth, and has a lot of moe moments. Then there is Ken Sugisaki, who in my opinion is the greatest lead male character ever. He is addicted to H-games and wants to make the student council into his harem....Then the two siblings Minatsu Shiina and Mafuyu Shiina. Minatsu being the athletic one who is really into Action manga etc. and Mafuyu who talks in 3rd person throughout the whole anime, and is heavily addicted to RPG's and BL's (Boys Love). Then last but not least there is Chizuru Akaba who is probably the most intimidating person...ever. Thought she has one of the cutest moments ever :3. The art work for the anime is very well done! It was a delight to watch and everyones character was unique in a way. Everyone ('cept for Ken) has moe moments that are just soo adorable you just have to rewind the video. And with great character design comes great voice acting too. Each character has a voice that matched their appearance! And in my opinion Mafuyu and Ken had the best voices. The anime is extremely funny and makes refrences too almost everything out there. For example on the first episode within the first 5 min then make fun of Dragonball Evolution! (the crappy american made dragonball live action movie that we all wish never existed). But this anime does have one drawback. (in my opinion) This anime makes references to a lot of other anime out there and knowing what they are referring is what makes it funnier, and more enjoyable. So if you are just starting to watch anime i don't recommend this one just yet. Watch a bunch of other anime first then watch this one. This anime is very funny and cute, tho it doesn't have a super deep story line, it has one that is pretty decent and the anime ends in a nice fashion. Hope for season 2 X3 Then the two siblings Minatsu Shiina and Mafuyu Shiina.

Even being an ""average"" ecchi anime, Personally, I enjoyed this anime from the first episode to the last. But that\'s only personally, and SURELY this anime won\'t appeal to everyone.Main character is Ken Sugisaki, being the only male in the Student council club while all the other club members are all females. Well, that does sound like a average ecchi/harem anime! Nothing special.Story- No story. Nothing. All its about is random events and chatter of the members of the student council club. Although Ken Sugisaki has one objective, which is to make the...club his own harem. He repeats it in each episode, but in the end, only gets bullied/ beaten up by the other council members. To put it simply, he is only a perverted idiot who cares about his objective- and I mean to make the club his own harem. There were many parodies involving Suzumiya haruhi, Death note, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and even Resident Evil(a.k.a Biohazard) which I knew. There were also many other parodies, but I didn\'t recognize them. I think the only flaw of this anime was the story, but also it is a big flaw.Art- Graphics/animation is amazing, that\'s for sure. Nothing bad to talk about in this section. Well, many anime made in these modern times mostly had good graphics/animation of course.Sound- Voice-acting was good and suited to their characters. Opening Theme and ending theme was also very good. Personally I found the OP very ""catchy"".Character- Characters were all nicely ""designed"" and had funny attitudes. Personally, I liked all the characters in the anime. Nothing bad here.Enjoyment- Well, It was funny, but not really that funny. It gave me few giggles and chuckles but not to extreme laughter. Some episodes revealed the council members\' pasts and that was enjoyable. I recognized most of the parodies but also some I didn\'t know of, which led me to blankness. I didn\'t know what they were talking about sometimes. It is funny only if you understand. Well, that\'s only small flaw I found in this section.Overall- Seitokai no Ichizon can be a good anime to watch for some people, but not to all. Lets say, maybe 50% chance that you might like it and a 50% that you might despise this anime. I only recommend it to anyone who likes ecchi/comedy/drama anime. And of course its also recommended to anyone who likes random stuff. club his own harem. He repeats it in each episode, but in the end, only gets bullied/ beaten up by the other council members.

At first I was confused: was this a comedy, a slice-of-life, or somewhere in between? Why wasn\'t this straightforward? It didn\'t matter; I fell in love with each and every character. This wasn\'t the typical slice of life, because something bigger was working behind the scenes, something larger than each character\'s problem, one that would eventually tie everything together.Story: 8/10A little background: Sugisaki is one lucky man. The student council at Hekiyou Gakuen are chosen by popularity vote, and it so happens that all 4...of the members are girls. There\'s a fifth slot, however, for one student with the best grades in the school: and that happens to be Sugisaki. It\'s his dream come true, literally: he openly discusses his desire for a true harem, often inviting the girls to make his dreams come true, but of course that never happens. What may seem like a happy, carefree, go-lucky student council quickly changes as certain pasts are revealed and conflicts arise...It\'s weird, though, honestly: I expected this to be complacent, slice-of-life I could sit back and enjoy thoroughly. There were subtle hints here and there, showing that their pasts couldn\'t hide forever under their seemingly implacable demeanor. Student council life is tough: it requires work, determination, skill, people skills, and other notable traits. However, the council generally goofs off while Sugisaki, the stupid one, the one that obsesses with adult games and harem fantasies, stays after and does the council\'s work all by himself. The girls don\'t take much notice of this until later, when they realize the reasons why.Art: 8/10Nothing special here, but nothing bland either. There was enough detail to please the eyes, sometimes much more than needed. That\'s never a bad thing; usually the art never disappointed me. However, I couldn\'t give it a higher score simply because since the anime mainly stayed in one room, nothing much changed. Also, the art never went above and beyond, so I can\'t give it a superior score because it simply didn\'t impress me. I did enjoy the OP and ED a lot, especially the chibi animation in the ED. Cute. The characters were drawn short-ish, differently, with wide eyes and child-like expressions at most times. Lovely.Sound: 8/10The sound wasn\'t anything crazy either. I didn\'t see anything insanely amazing, but there wasn\'t anything horrid either. The background music was pleasant, soothing. The OP was catchy and fast, making the lighthearted mood seem even more lighthearted. The ED was similarly bright and cheery, but it makes the underlying serious theme a little dumb-downed. The voice-acting, though nothing special, satisfied me immensely and solidified the characters well. I loved the sound-effects and other little things, like Sugisaki\'s adult games or the sounds of them in general.Character: 8/10Here we have a classic set-up: a tsundere, a serious one,  two sisters that are nothing alike, and a guy that loves women of every caliber and trait. However, as the anime progressed, their interactions melded in such a way that it was different than the norm. I thoroughly enjoyed the backstory and how it was slowly revealed. Loved it. However, many of the characters stayed static and didn\'t change all that much. Though that was disappointing, there was also the fact that there were only 12 episodes, so there wasn\'t much time to even develop different personalities. But in that short amount of time, Sugisaki, Kurimu, and the others really grew on me.Overall, this wasn\'t a bad anime, and I was very entertained for the ridiculously short 12 episodes. Loved the way it was presented, loved the way the characters interacted, and loved the music. I was entertained and satisfied, though not to an ""ZOMG THIS IS AMAZING"" but just extremely content and I wouldn\'t want this any other way. It was presented well, kept me wanting more, and made me happy the entire time because the comedy was pretty stellar (as well as making frequent references to other anime - those were gems).

Remember, never, ever judge a book by its cover; give the book a chance and you might just uncover something that\'ll change you forever.', ""First off, we’ll start with the characters.  Sugisaki is our main character, and his personality is easily described as a pervert with a heart of gold.  Unlike many other ecchi or harem series, it’s quite explicit that he’s a pervert.  He constantly thinks of situations in terms of hentai games and his goal in life is to achieve the “harem ending.”  That said, he is fiercely loyal and protective to the girls in the student council and is a generally kind and unselfish person.  The quartet of girls, for the most part, fit into stereotypes of the genre.  Kurimu...is the student council president, but she is also the most childlike out of the quartet.  Minatsu is literally made of hot blood, shonen action, and a booming voice.  Mafuyu is a borderline hikikomori yet has a surprising amount of inner strength.  Finally, Chizuru is the aloof big sister type character, and can at times be downright dangerous.Most of this series rests on the comedy aspect.  Parodies of various anime series and aspects of Japanese culture abound, and if you’ve been watching anime for the past few years, you should be able to keep up.  The one that really sticks out in my mind is a very long salute to the Sentai genre where they all try to figure out what color ranger they would be and what kind of plot their supposed series would have.  They also poke fun at genre archetypes.  In one episode, they all attempt to write a novel of their lives in the student council, which all vary wildly based on their interests.  There’s also a two-minute segment where the cast manages to make a joke about almost every drama archetype in existence.  Since tropes are my thing, I really enjoyed how the writers played with them.  The writers make sure nothing is safe here, and stretch out enough that everyone will have something to laugh at.The series is not entirely episodic though, there is a bit of a plot involved, but it’s quite nonstandard.  You see, all the character development that would usually take place in an anime series has already happened.  You get the characters as they exist in the present.  The story aspects, which usually take place in the first and last few minutes of each episode, trace back the characters and their pasts.  Every girl gets a small piece of the story, and all four have suffered some kind of trauma.  Sugisaki serves as the focal point that connects all the girls together.  Once you finally get to the end of the series, the individual threads converge on him as they play what would have been the opening seconds of the series as the ending.  What we would laugh off at the start is actually kind of a touching moment at the end.  This is no deep plot, but it’s enough to nicely tie the series together as one collective work.From an animation standpoint, the series is executed very well.  I honestly have to say that I have never seen a locker portray so much emotion before, just wait for episode 5 to understand that.  Given that the vast majority of the series takes place in one little room, the artists put a lot of detail into the design, but that doesn’t leave the few scene changes in the lurch.  Also, since this is a parody series, there’s a lot of call for style shifts and costume changes, in addition to the change in uniform as the seasons pass.  The voice acting is one of the areas where this series shines the most.  All four women in the student council have rookie seiyus, and they nail their roles to the wall.  Takahashi Kondo voices Sugisaki, and he really conveys the pervert quality to his speech and tone.  The OP is your standard Jpop fare, while the ED is somewhat nonstandard.  A lot of series like this have different EDs for each episode, and while Ichizon does that, it always uses the same tune, just different lyrics or inflection.  Unfortunately, one or two of the rookie team can’t quite stand up to the task.All things considered, Seitokai no Ichizon is a fairly standard series.  The series doesn't manage to break any new ground within its genres, but it does everything well enough that I feel it warrants a look.  It also manages to do it in such a way that it doesn’t grate on people who traditionally avoid its core genre, such as myself.  It might be worth a look for you. is the student council president, but she is also the most childlike out of the quartet.  Minatsu is literally made of hot blood, shonen action, and a booming voice.  Mafuyu is a borderline hikikomori yet has a surprising amount of inner strength.  Finally, Chizuru is the aloof big sister type character, and can at times be downright dangerous.Most of this series rests on the comedy aspect.

Despite its plain and uncomplicated story, the comedy inside this show was so top-notch it'll probably cleanse the every last of depression you have left inside of you. In fact, it might cleanse you so hard you might have a higher possibility of dying from this rather than from that one disease we're all aware of.Seitokai no Ichizon has a slow-paced harem which depressingly blossoms 14 episodes into the series ( Season 2 Episode 2 ). Those who’ve come to this series expecting to increase their stimulation scale because...they’re a degenerate might find Seitokai no Ichizon an utter disappointment. However, just because of the fact that the harem is a lackluster compared to many other shows categorized as harem doesn’t mean that the show is right up bad.As said somewhere above, the comedy is gold. Pure gold. 99.9% gold. In fact, you’d probably wouldn’t be able to see it because this yellow precious thing shines even brighter than the sun. I haven’t laughed this hard ever since a long time now. It’s so comical and entertaining. It’s even better if you understand a few references provided that you’ve seen the referenced shows and understand the references ( Fate, Suzumiya, Jojo, etc. ).The comedy outweighs the harem. Filling the holes left by the lack of harem. Seitokai no Ichizon was awesome. One of the greatest comedies I’ve ever seen and probably one of the best harem ever as it's not exaggerated.I recommend this to everybody who’s interested in comedy. I do also recommend this to people looking for a harem anime. However, here’s a warning for the harem people. Harem is not the main focus of this show thus it’s very lacking. At least for the entire first season. Though this may actually be good for some people if you're looking for a good harem that isn't exaggerated. they’re a degenerate might find Seitokai no Ichizon an utter disappointment.

I had heard a lot about Ichizon and had seen a few Youtube clips, and it looked like decent comedy. On the recommendation of a few trusted recommendations, I decided to take the plunge and was quite surprised at how absolutely hilarious this series is.I normally am a fan of the skit-based slapstick style comedy like in Arakawa, Nichijou and the recent Daily Lives of High School Boys, so Ichizon's slice of life-style presentation was a nice change of pace from...my usual favorites. For a comedy, it actually does a really good job at developing the characters thanks to this format. Speaking of which, the characters in this series are amazing. They have some of the best voice acting I've heard in anime, especially Ken's seiyu. I can't help but crack up whenever Ken starts into one of his heated rants about his dream harem ending.The sense of comedic timing in the voice acting is out of this world, they know just when to change tone with the current situation. The girls surrounding Ken may seem to be typical anime personalities and to an extent they are parodies of stereotypes but I found them all to be very well written, as they know just when to through the view off into an unexpected fit of laughter.There are also lots of guest appearances throughout the series, which I will not spoil for you. I will say that Fumihiko Tachiki's cameo had me absolutely rolling, as I'm a huge Eva and Kaiji fan.My only real issue with the series that it's very short and some of the backgrounds are a bit drab (probably budget constraints, and they are in one one for most of the series).

For the most part, it is an anime that parodies many other popular animes, such as Haruhi, Death Note, Bleach, Majutsu no Index, and many, MANY more, so it's natural to assume not to take this anime very seriously. It is, after all, a lighthearted comedy series revolving around a student council.The biggest strength of this anime was it's characters and comedy writing. There's no doubt this is one of the funniest animes I've ever seen. I found...myself rolling in laughter at all the characters' fantasies and obscure anime references (the Death Note reference always got some good chuckles out of me). I also loved the characters in this anime very much. First of all, you have Ken, the lighthearted harem junkie that tries to do all the work to make the girls happy, Kurimu, the adorable president that acts more like a child than a high schooler, Chizuru, the calm and dark council member with an ominous presence, Mafuyu, a cute, mild-mannered video game junkie that also has an obsession over Yuri (or Boys' Love) games, manga, and the like, and finally, her older sister Minatsu, a strong, athletic personality that loves her action games and manga. Overall, I found this to be an interesting mix of characters that made for some great dialogue.The biggest weakness of this anime, which I'm not really sure if I can consider it a weakness considering that they never really tried, is that there is no plot to this thing. It really is just an episodic anime of these five council members doing next to nothing during their meetings, or more specifically, how they get sidetracked from doing actual work. It just doesn't make for an interesting story. Even part of this anime's running gag were the characters commenting on how there is no story to their own anime. The artwork was also fairly sub-par...not terrible but nothing really that unique other than the anime's OP and ED.However, despite this anime's weak plot/story, there was a sub-plot discovered later in the series that actually made it kind of interesting. I can't really say a whole lot about it without revealing it but I can honestly tell you that it revolves around Ken before he was in the student council and how he knows each of the girls. There were some fairly touching moments in the last three episodes that made me wonder, why didn't they try this sooner? Then again, perhaps it might not have worked if they tried it sooner.Overall, it's a very nice comedy series if you're not looking for anything too complex and want to get some cheap laughs. There isn't really any fan service or ecchi moments, even though Ken's (and Mafuyu's) fantasies get a little revealing, so I find that to be a plus.

I only used it because it's a mandatory field.I had low expectations coming into this show.  I first heard about it on [GG]'s blog, which talked about how terrible it was, and later how glad they were to dump the project onto Eclipse.  They were further lowered when I watched a stream of the first few episodes.  They weren't as bad as the blog and general chatter implied, but I still wasn't impressed.After downloaded it on a whim and started watching episodes over lunch it started growing on me...though.  Episodes grew progressively more enjoyable, as the show threw off its ecchi comedy disguise to reveal its true form, slice of life.  This little anime that could, with no plot and a cast of purely archetypal characters, left me feeling satisfied that I had invested my time well, and disappointed that it was over so soon.Is the show good?  I choose to skirt this question entirely and say it's enjoyable.  If conversation and character development appeal to you, and you have a decent understanding of Japanese culture (terms like eroge and yandere are tossed around quite a bit) then you will probably enjoy it as much as I did.

Now then, lets get started with the review.Story:Seitokai no Ichizon is about a male student, Sugisaki Ken, who is the only male student on the Student Council which consists of four girls and a female teacher who is their advisor.  The rest of the plot revolves around the days of student council members and on how Ken wants to make all the girls on the council, his...harem.  That is all there is to say about the main story.  At first it sounds really lame and boring but it slowly grows and at the end, explains the rather honest and sincere reason for why he wants to have all the girls be in his harem (yes, the reason is good, even if the word harem is used to describe it lol).    Although that is the main story, what makes this anime different than a regular comedy anime, is that it is a parody comedy.Throughout the show, especially the first half, there are countless references to shows such as Higurashi, The Mel. of Haruhi, Strike Witch, Death Note, K On!, and possibly others.   However, instead of limiting the comedy to just parody, there were many moments where the characters would practically break the fourth wall in and say things like ""So why is it that the main character in the anime talked this episode?"" or on episode 1 ""We need a opening theme for the show, but what should we do?""Art:Nothing too special about the art style.  It does have a similar style that reminded me of Higurashi (especially with the main male character from both anime), and School Days.  When doing the parody parts, the art style would briefly change to fit the theme, but overall stayed true.Sound/music:Nothing special here either.  The OP was fine, the ED was cute, the sound effects used were fitting.Character:I thought they were great at fitting their own little niche, like the girl who is too innocent to realize what others mean when they say certain things (even though she likes BL novels), or the girl who was the more busty n lusty yet deadly and scary.   The main male, Ken, did a great job at being awkwardly perverted and still be enjoyable when he was honest and serious.Enjoyment:Well, I enjoyed it, so hows that?  Ok, I liked this anime quite a lot, but it was getting dry near the end, but once you make it to the final episode, you learn about the true reason why Ken is doing what he is doing, which was a really sweet and touching moment that made it all worth it.  The fact that the show was a parody type, made various references to the viewers watching the show, and other things, made me enjoy this.  I don\'t think this is the anime that everyone will enjoy , but for those who want a comedy that uses parody, then this is a good find. harem.  That is all there is to say about the main story.

However, instead of limiting the comedy to just parody, there were many moments where the characters would practically break the fourth wall in and say things like ""So why is it that the main character in the anime talked this episode?"" or on episode 1 ""We need a opening theme for the show, but what should we do?""Art:Nothing too special about the art style.  It does have a similar style that reminded me of Higurashi (especially with the main male character from both anime), and School Days.  When doing the parody parts, the art style would briefly change to fit the theme, but overall stayed true.Sound/music:Nothing special here either.  The OP was fine, the ED was cute, the sound effects used were fitting.Character:I thought they were great at fitting their own little niche, like the girl who is too innocent to realize what others mean when they say certain things (even though she likes BL novels), or the girl who was the more busty n lusty yet deadly and scary.   The main male, Ken, did a great job at being awkwardly perverted and still be enjoyable when he was honest and serious.Enjoyment:Well, I enjoyed it, so hows that?  Ok, I liked this anime quite a lot, but it was getting dry near the end, but once you make it to the final episode, you learn about the true reason why Ken is doing what he is doing, which was a really sweet and touching moment that made it all worth it.  The fact that the show was a parody type, made various references to the viewers watching the show, and other things, made me enjoy this.  I don\'t think this is the anime that everyone will enjoy , but for those who want a comedy that uses parody, then this is a good find.', 'Harem! Taken a little further in Seitokai no Ichizon, as our hero aims to have the entire student council (all composed of cute girls) his own personal harem!..... That made it sound soooooo weird. But in many ways, this anime is also weird. In the outer part, Seitokai may look like it\'s just a conventional harem. But once one looks deeper, one may find that the fun part about Seitokai, is not in its ""Harem"" part, but it\'s story.Now, usually a story in a Harem is pretty much shallow. The girls fight over one guy that is usually hated, something happens, and poof! they\'re...all in-love with him. But in Seitokai\'s place, almost none of that happens. I have seen a lot of Harem anime before, but Seitokai has my vote when it comes to originality of story.Now as for the art, it\'s a little bit off for me. I find the 2D face-style a bit old, yet attractive and cute at the same time. It comes with an array of colorful sceneries that need no more explanation.The sound on the other hand, I\'m not too satisfied with. I was not that impressed or taken by its OP and ED, so I can\'t really say much about it.All in all, Seitokai no Ichizon was a great watch. It\'s one of the anime that made me think and recover myself, so to speak. I suggest you watch the entire season, so that you can get the most out of it. all in-love with him.

Seitokai no Ichizon focuses completely on Hekyiou\'s Student Council and then... BOOM! It finishes unpredictably well! Nice choice! It also parodies many famous works, including even TTGL!{STORY - 7/10}As its name says, it\'s about Hekyiou\'s Student Council reunions. No darker plots, no twists, no enemies, just the story of Ken Sugisaki, a guy who struggled a lot to enter the council, with the sole dream of having his own harem. Like any other pervert, he\'s a total douche, but with a kind, sweet side, that...the other four girls take some time to see and understand.His efforts on getting closer to all this girls have a deep meaning, later revealled. His intentions are above having a bunch of pretty girls surrounding him... He wanted to make them happy... Helping with all the main activities and calling enough attention during reunions with his dumb jokes and shameless actions are some of his ways to show affection... Would this end as expected? Strong feelings may disturb the council\'s peace, but who knows?{ART - 6/10}Overally pleasant, but with no distinctive characteristics. Actually, it reminds me of an anime I\'ve watched two weeks ago, with the same oversized eyes, despite not being based on a VN this time... Protagonists have mostly the same basic visual aspects, with small changes on their appearance and, obviously, different personalities.{SOUND - 7/10}The song featured on its OP theme is stuck in my head... It\'s not that special or amazing and, still, is kind of addicting... However, I was most impressed by songs used on endings... I mean, there\'s more than one, every one of them performed by the voice actresses, but they don\'t differ too much and on some themes, singers become desynchronized and their voices, out of tune... That\'s way too funny and, actually, pretty nice, despite being terribly awful... Don\'t try to understand me...{CHARACTERS - 4/10}Like on any other harem, we have a male protagonist with this ambition in mind. Ken is totally shameless, but he hides a sweet side and can be really affective at some moments. Council\'s president, Kurimu, entitled as the ""kawaii/moe"" female protagonist is a typical childish girl, whose attitude is able to attract anyone.We also have the mysterious and mature Chizuru. Her strong and sadist personality reminds me Makiko from Sora no Otoshimono. Maybe she was based on her, since this anime parodies SnO as well. Mafuyu, addicted to both games and yaoi manga, is the shyest and her gentle and calm behaviour compares to Asia, from High School DxD. Minatsu is the one chosen to take the tsundere role and acts like a boy on many different ways. One of those is reading many shounen mangas.{ENJOYMENT - 8/10}This was also the first parody anime I\'ve ever watched. Seeing ""Haruhi Suzumiya"" and ""Death Note"" references, besides many others was awesome! Despite all that, it was so unique, original...{OVERALL - 7/10}From the beginning, it may seem weird... Expecting 12 episodes about school stuff? It\'s a parody, with a few romance and tons of comedy.

It is mainly a show about... nothing. Basically, the story follows 5 high school teenagers through their ""Student Council Meetings"". However, the ""meetings"", if that, are just the characters\' rambles ranging from BL, harems, sports, action, masochism, and loli. To top it all off, most of the anime is contained to one room,  the Student Council Room. While this idea may seem like a horrible setting and a recipe for disaster, the setting is the perfect fit for...their meetings. The anime\'s comedy is essentially what holds the entire series together, and it would certainly hold anyone\'s attention for the duration of each and every episode.Personally, I love each and every episode of Seitokai no ichizon. Each character has their own moment, and no one is left out. The entire series, both first and second season, hold a special place in my heart. Now, I might be a little biased, being that this was the first anime that I had ever watched, but I stand by my position nonetheless. This anime\'s plot of complete and utter nothingness is pure gold. The freedom that it gave itself was infinite, and the creators certainly put it to good use. I found myself laughing each and every episode,  and I couldn\'t help but watch the next episode. In conclusion, the anime set the standard for what I feel every harem comedy should be. The anime isn\'t full of action, drama, or suspense. However, if anyone out there is looking to laugh, I feel that they should give this title a chance to make them do just that. their meetings.

This series is almost a parody of this generic plot and instead, on day 1 of joining the council ken sugisak the protagonisti openly admits he will make the council made up of 4 women fall in love with him. This series is a light hearted, good feeling anime with little drama but many jokes and lots of references to other anime series.This anime is similar to seitokai yakuindomo but not as funny...or as lewd.

It has the ability to take you to a completely different world. Yet, sometimes I just can’t be bothered with that. Sometimes all I want is to turn my brain off and laugh at some goofy people goofing off and being stupid. Seitokai no Ichizon is the perfect anime to lay back, relax and chill out to—it’s cosy, silly and light-hearted, and, honestly, I just can’t get enough of it.In the very first scene of the first episode, “Understanding the differences in media” is written on the whiteboard. The characters joke about how they...can make the anime more appealing than the light novel, with some self-deprecating jokes along with it. Out of curiosity, I decided to actually investigate the differences in media by reading the first volume of the light novel. While the light novel definitely has its appeal—one that’s slightly different from the anime—I think the anime’s funnier. The ‘difference in media’ I observed was the sheer power of visual comedy, voice acting and comedic timing. The anime breathes life into the interactions by adding so much energy and liveliness that’s only really possible in an audiovisual medium. On top of that, I noticed how the plot was shifted around a bit. Rather than adapting the story one-to-one, they took bits and pieces and mixed them with others, with different contexts, to make it flow a little better. So, I have to say, the anime and light novel did help me understand the differences in media. Thanks for bringing it up, President!One of the big reasons I decided to watch this was that it’s a 2000s anime. I realised that I hadn’t watched many older anime and wanted to broaden my horizons by branching in that direction. Now, it’s very clear from the art-style that it’s an older anime, but I don’t mean that in a bad way. Older anime have a certain appeal to them that’s hard to describe. Although I’d say animation quality has improved over the years—especially in action scenes—I might prefer the character designs and style of 2000s anime. For the record, that’s not nostalgia speaking. I was a little poopy baby boy when the anime came out so I can’t say “those were the good ol’ days”. Well, peeing all around the house probably was the good old days, but that’s not the point. Despite not having experienced anime in the 2000s, there’s a particular charm to them, similar to that of a childhood summer. With the art-style and general ‘vibes’, the anime radiates that feeling and makes it so incredibly endearing.The anime revolves around the main character, Sugisaki, and four other girls that he wants in his harem. Every episode consists of them sitting in the student council room talking, chatting, goofing off, wasting time, erm… that’s about it…? It’s as close to a sit-com you’ll get in anime (I think? I’ve never actually watched a sit-com). Slice of Life is one of my favourite genres, so I love this kind of dynamic, but I’d imagine a lot of people would be put off by this. Moreover, there really isn’t much conflict at all. Stories normally centre around conflict, so without it you’d think it would just be boring. But, slice of life seems to be the exception, for some reason. This anime is stress-free and never takes itself seriously, which is nice every now and then.One of the funniest things about it is how self-conscious it is. It might even be the most self-conscious anime I’ve ever watched. I mean, even in the very first scene that I mentioned before, one of the characters read a review that says ‘the story’s the same and nothing goes on’, taking a dig at itself. Not only that but it’s pretty much a parody of harems. It realises how silly the idea of a harem is, so it doesn’t take it seriously at all. It’s so goofy and ridiculous that it sometimes feels like a parody of anime itself. It knows exactly what it is and doesn’t try to be anything it isn’t. Something I noticed around half-way through was that they change the lyrics to the ending each time. And each time, it’s complete gibberish. Utterly random and super silly. In episode 11, the ending is the President mouthing off about how great she is and how you must vote for her for the whole ending. Sometimes the ending has the voice actors laughing at themselves, forgetting the lyrics or singing out of sync, and they kept all of that in. Now, I don’t know about you, but I think the voice actors had a lot of fun with this anime.Something that stands out is the references. I know Gintama is supposed to have a bunch, but I haven’t seen it yet, so this anime probably has the most I’ve seen in an anime. It mentions Naruto, Gurren Lagann (even kind of spoils it), Haruhi, Index, Fullmetal Alchemist and even freaking Metal Gear Solid. I can’t remember if it was in the anime or light novel, but one of the lines is, “Don’t speak until Hunter x Hunter is finished!”. If Sugisaki took a vow of silence and became a monk to obey that, he still wouldn’t be able to speak (please finish HxH, Togashi, I’m begging). Also, they reference the light novel’s publishing company a bunch. They go so off the rails with the references that they often have to censor themselves to avoid copyright, which, in itself, is pretty funny.What’s more, the anime breaks the 4th wall more than any anime I’ve seen too. The first scene I described is one example of that. But throughout they constantly say how Mafuyu’s characterization is being ruined by her BL love, or how Minatsu being good at math doesn’t fit her character, or how having a meeting about what to do with student absences is too basic and wouldn’t be fun for the viewers to watch. It takes all the rules about immersion and throws them out the window for the hell of it.Now, in terms of the actual comedy, it is hilarious. The skits and gags are utterly absurd and it never takes itself seriously. It’s fast-paced with ridiculous situations, great one-liners and goofy slapstick. It’s not necessarily adult comedy, but definitely not pee poo childish humour either. The lack of emphasis on immersion and realism allows them to do the most nonsensical and stupid things. The bread and butter of the comedy is the straight man, funny man act, where one character will say something stupid and the other will retort, addressing how little sense it made. But the characters aren’t type casted into either role—it usually changes to fit the situation. Anime usually has a ‘comfy’ type of comedy as opposed to other media, for me at least. Though Seitokai no Ichizon made me laugh out loud time and time again.The characters themselves are quirky and hilarious. Each with their own unique qualities and flaws, such that you can simply put them in a room together and it’ll be hilarious no matter what they do. Despite lightly fitting into certain character archetypes, they each have plenty of aspects that distinguish themselves from that and make them lovable by their own merit. The anime drops us in with them already being friends, so they’re close to each other from the beginning. This lends to the comedy involving each character teasing or making fun of the others a lot of the time, which is possible because of how quirky and goofy they inherently are. It reminds me of a bunch of teenagers messing around and mouthing off to each other, which is what they actually are. But it really does capture that youthful dynamic of being so rude and horrible to each other, in a loving way. They can only do that because of how close they are.Despite how much they tease and poke fun at each other, the anime makes it clear how much they genuinely value their friendship. They truly cherish the time they have together and the safe space they’ve created in the student council. And whenever necessary, they stand up for each other and have each other’s backs. As cheesy as it is, that’s a true friendship being portrayed.Comedy is such a powerful tool, especially with how it can contrast seriousness. Don’t get me wrong, it’s mostly jokes—the author even said it’s “90% jokes and less than 10% serious”—but there are a few moments where it strips back the goofiness and has some thought-provoking scenes. There’s a scene where they’re in Tokyo and watch the sunset silently together, and somehow it’s really beautiful. A few scenes like that are scattered here and there, and although they’re not what stands out in the show, they’re rather impactful because of how rare they are.It’s hard to really criticise a show that doesn’t take itself too seriously. I would’ve said that the interaction between the girls was lacking, but then there was an episode when Sugisaki got sick and it was just them, and they held out together great without him. I suppose it could be lacking some climactic and memorable moments, but I’m not too hung up on that.Overall, it’s so lovable, silly, hilarious and has some great moments shining through. I’m looking forward to season 2 of this, which is hopefully just as good. 9/10. can make the anime more appealing than the light novel, with some self-deprecating jokes along with it.

Shin Chou Kyou Ryo: Condor Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/959/Shin_Chou_Kyou_Ryo__Condor_Hero,"[""This is a compact review based on all THREE seasons (78 episodes) of the Legend of Condor Hero series.*Please note that only season 1 was voiced in Japanese but all 3 seasons have been Chinese dubbed.*Before proceeding with the actual review of this anime, I would like to clarify the name of the story. Based on the original novel written in the late 1950s, this story should be called The Return of the Condor Heroes. But somewhere along the way, the Japanese decided to change the name to Legend of  Condor Hero, which to add on to the confusion is the same name as...the prequel story to the story that this anime is based upon. So to sum this up, Legend of Condor Hero (anime) does NOT equal to the actual Legend of Condor Hero, but in fact, the anime is the sequel to the Legend of Condor Hero. For those who can read Kanji, check this out and everything should be clear.The Legend of Condor Hero is, to many Chinese, the Romeo and Juliet of the West. Not because the story have much in common, but rather it is the reputation that it earned over the last 50 years as a romance story. You can literally go walk to a Chinese and ask them the story of Legend of Condor Hero and 90% of the time they will be able to tell you something about it.The story revolves around Yang Guo and his lover Xiao Long Nu in their adventure against the dominating Mongolian Empire (~1250 AD) under Genghis Khan's grandson. However, what really captivates viewer to this story is the taboo/forbidden love between the two as one is the master and the other is the apprentice.While the anime adaptation follows the actual story quite closely, there were some missing characters here and there (for example, Sha Gu played a key role in providing the background story of Yang Guo's deceased father, but she was completely taken out in the anime). However, I was glad that the production crew did a good job with the crucial Battle of Xiangyang as that was the &quot;heart&quot; of the story in the actual novel.Since I have personally read the entire trilogy -the official Chinese novels- of the Condor series (The Legend of the Condor Heroes, The Return of the Condor Heroes, and The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Saber), I was expecting a lot from this anime. It failed me in many ways, from the poor animation quality, to the overly repetitive scenes and soundtracks. All in all, it was fairly decent in terms of story retelling, but for an anime in this day and age it certainly can be a whole lot better. the prequel story to the story that this anime is based upon.

You can really feel the immense depth of the love. This together with the abundance of strong female characters in the story makes it one of my favorite anime series. The only minor point is that there is a lot of silly martial art fighting going on.The OP and ED are addictive.Hotness: very intense forbidden and pure love.Bishounen: The main lead is a cutie. He could have been more intelligent and more sensitive though. ', ""This is not a place for those who seek best design, animation, soundtrack. This anime only portrays more on a well written story over everything else (including character developments, interactions, story flow).After dedicating myself to all 3 seasons , the anime has played a role in showing the realization that best story are not only to be told from Japan, for it can also be found from other countries as well. It is not a simple task to win over this in terms of story plot.My review of this anime series (all seasons):Story S1 + S2 10/10Completely mindblown Jin Yong is a...masterpiece. Story flows consistently well from the start until the end. All main and supporting characters plays an essential role, some sticking to the series until the very end, including the big bird in the opening song. Character grows over each seasons. The naive and childish Yang Gua in S1, evolving into a legendary, matured man in S3. Yang Gua and Xiao Lung Nu love to each other: lovely and pure.Story S3 8/10Disappointed with the last few episodes.Animation and soundtracks S1 6/10Decent designs, just not up to today's standard. Love both the OP and ED. Japanese dub is average.Animation and soundtracks S2 + S3 5/101)Animation doesn't look like much effort is inserted. Crushing sea water onto ship looks like mountain emerging from the bottom. 2)Repetitive long flashbacks, flashback of Yang Gua rescuing Huang Rong shown twice. 3)Certain scenes repeated broken soundtracks. OP and ED songs changed yet uses S1 OP animation, doesn't fit.Cantonese dub is otherwise, good. Perfectly fits the character. Made me laugh.Enjoyment 10/10Because of the story.Overall 10/10 (ignoring animation and sound)Love it. Lots of meaningful messages to the audiences: grow over mistakes, independent life, knowing when to stop, never stop learning, be helpful, be a good example, forgive and forget, etc.I give my credits to the author Jin Yong for introducing such an amazing story. Also a big thanks to the production staff for making an anime version of the Condor Hero series.  Have no regret watching it. One of the world's greatest ancient chinese story ever told! masterpiece.

Even though there is a lot of drama adaptations(by the Chinese), I find the anime appealing in some ways as it gives a simpler design of characters that have been overemphasize through the years.Nonetheless, this anime is not without flaws.The title is incorrect: Unless you read the original story, the actual title of it is actually Return of the Condor Heroes/Condor Heroes and Companions for direct Chinese translation. The title that it is currently named by refer to the prequel of this storySome of the appearances of...characters are incorrect: the main protagonist Little Dragon Maiden(literally how you translate it) is known as a peerless beauty of her time with pale angelic skins and long black hair. I mean I know Japanese animators love to color in women of all different hair colors, but it would be nice to get the lead girl's hair right.....Over repeated scenes: I guess this is the biggest turn down as the animation is probably run on budget. During the process, if this was to compete with other Japanese animation of its time, it would not do well. However since it is a Chinese classic, the story starting at Season 2 was exclusively Chinese and I believed it was air in Chinese Kids showsDespite these aspects of it, I really enjoy seeing this story again as at least in the first season of the show, it was faithful to the original story. Yang Guo the lead male is a trouble maker and trickerster(he actually more devious and cunning in the original story) while Little Dragon Maiden other than her martial arts is a sweet innocent girl who just want to settle for a peaceful life with her beloved.P.S. If anyone has any questions on this story or comments about this bad review, feel free to message me. In terms of romance that I have watched, I usually don't feel this way about it other than Inuyasha. characters are incorrect: the main protagonist Little Dragon Maiden(literally how you translate it) is known as a peerless beauty of her time with pale angelic skins and long black hair.

Some try to hide it and make it more natural, while other try to limit it to a few big ones that shape the entire story. This anime doesn\'t do that. It\'s an unbelievable serie of coincidental meetings, people splitting up and meeting again and splitting up again by plot demands.This is difficult to go into details without getting into detailled spoiler territory but for instance, at one point the main character was looking for someone.He doesn\'t find this person by searching for them. Instead he finding them randomly after following the people arresting a random...guy he ate with earlier in town. That\'s a pretty good representation on how everything goes into that anime. (as there are many more exemples and most of the plot feels incredibly forced.)This is by far my biggest issue with this show, which undermine when some characters says the world is a big place when the entire story has to take place in a small square for things to keep happening this way.There are others things that I disliked about the story like the way the final villain is defeated (I guess you could say it was foreshadowed but it is still very lame), and the entire final arc is pretty mediocre in general.Overall I\'d say the story start decently enough, but quickly gets into a downhill slope until around 2/3, where it really gets quite bad.The art is quite mediocre and I prefered the art of some older animes. In general, it is decent but it is during the fight it\'s at it\'s worst. Most of the fights are pretty poorly animated.The sound isn\'t that memorable to me, either positively or negatively. It did it\'s job It is quite fine and didn\'t affect my view of the anime negatively at all.The characters were also fine. There was the cliche ""Almost every girl falls in love with the MC by being arround him for a day"" but I guess that\'s pretty common. Of course, the final villain is basically a mustache twirling villain that\'s only there to serve as an obstacle between the romance between the main characters.I will say, that at least, I didn\'t find the anime boring.My main issue with it really is the story (and to a lesser extend, the animation). guy he ate with earlier in town.

Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou desu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42826/Seijo_no_Maryoku_wa_Bannou_desu,"['Do not be fooled by the relatively low score of this anime. I can already classify it as a hidden gem, an underrated masterpiece if you enjoy isekais. In this review I will tell you why.First off, lets address the low overall score of the general MAL public. At the moment only 4 episodes are out yet there are plenty of ratings given. What I found on the forums the majority of haters give arguments like ""The MC is female so I can\'t relate"" or ""wow, a reverse-harem"". Dismissing an anime because of random shallow reasons and giving a 1 speaks volumes about how you...shouldn\'t blindly follow others evaluations and see everything for yourself.Anyway, about the anime itself. Do you enjoy a stress-free isekai? Do you enjoy watching the main character adapt to their new surroundings and grow as a person?  Do you enjoy seeing them discover amazing powers that help everyone around them? Well get ready for a wonderful time.The Saint\'s Magic Power is Omnipotent pacing is perfect - there\'s just enough story and progression that you want to keep binging it, however not to the point that it overwhelms you. You can enjoy seeing cute characters exchange sweet smiles and small talk, yet still sense a goal. A goal of remaining a normal girl in this unusual world, with your powers inevitably getting noticed by more and more people.If I were to compare the environment and world-building to some other great title, Ascendance of a Bookworm comes into mind. The art is beautiful and the atmosphere is cozy. There\'s no lurking danger around the corner, however the character\'s inner thoughts and struggles keep driving the story.In conclusion, if you like wholesome anime\'s with a cute and strong MC, if you like putting yourself into their shoes and experiencing the progression together, you are at the right place. Lets cheer on the ordinary girl Sei, who just happened to receive the powers of a Saint and decided to brighten up everyone\'s world.

Yay!', 'What do you get when you mix the two best genres of anime, shoujo romance and isekai? An amazing experience like Seijo.I’ll be sweet and short with this one, Seijo was one of the best shows of the season, it’s really a shame it didn’t get much attention. But, for those of us who did get a chance to check it out, week after week we got to see an incredible character driven and grounded fantasy story. Sei’s one of the most loveable characters I’ve come across in an isekai. If you have traditionally struggled to get into isekai because of generic OP MCs...and a lot of fan service, which are great btw, this is a departure from that norm. Instead, we have a female MC who gradually works her way up the social hierarchy and becomes the “Saint” or highest level magician in the land. It’s a slower paced story, but what it lacks in action, it makes up for in character interactions. The story is written so well that you can’t help but become attached to the characters and want to see them do well. Stories like this, with small character pools, allow you to get an intimate feel with them and I loved that.If you have ever seen Honzuki, or “Ascendance of a Bookworm”, this is a very similar story and similarly paced. If you enjoyed that, I think you’ll find seijo to be great as well. Myne and Sei have a lot in common as well. I thought the romance was subtle enough to not be overly dramatic, but also obvious enough that you couldn’t miss it. Really nice balance to strike. All the character interactions feel unique and organic which is always a plus in these types of stories.Obviously, there’s not much action in this show, but there’s a few times, particularly in episode 8 that the staff deliver some phenomenal animation. Character models are really attractive and the background art was gorgeous. No complaints artistically.I have to say, I knew nothing about this series coming into the anime and instantly fell in love with the world and characters. It’s been such an enjoyable experience over the past few months, I am certainly sad to see it end. I just ordered the first LN recently and am looking forward to diving deeper into this interesting world. Seijo gets 10 spells out of 10. and a lot of fan service, which are great btw, this is a departure from that norm.

Seijo gets 10 spells out of 10.', ""The low score is based on the lack of: antagonist, plot twists, suspense, character dev, quality dialogue, and etc that a good story should have.I found this series from recommendations of another shoujo anime that I watched, Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. Some 8 people recommended watching this series... What a mistake! Generally, I enjoy shoujo and the like with sentimental stories even if it's a harem. Sadly, Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou Desu failed my expectations.Story 2/10: The plot is super basic, predictable, and therefore boring. There is no antagonist in the story, no real conflict or anything that can cause emotions, characters just exist. The...dialogues are boring. Either character say what will happen next and it happens, or its just a filler talk. I have not seen an anime with filler talk before. Who do they think will like this??Art 4/10: You can feel the cut corners in the plain basic backgrounds and characters don't carry any unique designs. At least they use a normal modern anime style and it helps to make the story more bearable.Sound 5/10: No complaints, no annoying music, but no masterpieces or even catchy tunes. Mostly elevator music that is good enough for this show. In some scenes, voice actors were a bit hurried and didn't get enough time to perfect their lines. I attribute that to the low budget.Character 3/10: Little to no character development, effortless magic. Love from first sight.Enjoyment 2/10: I would say for a certain demographic (12 and under) this will be an okay show to watch. I did not find it enjoyable at all, it feels like a Disney fairy tale written through the eyes of a Japanese salaryman. Not a true shoujo. dialogues are boring.

Not much has changed in the anime, but the artwork has gotten worse than the manga.]This is not like the other isekai because it's not about an OP surrounded by scantily-clad women: TRUE.This does not play the usual fan-service tropes: FALSE.The most famous isekai are probably Tensei shitara Slime... and Mushoku Tensei. These two are steeped in seinen/shounen tropes. In contrast, Seijo no Maryoku plays to all the usual josei tropes.MC is a very introverted woman who gets isekai'd to a world where for very little effort, she gets treated as the...most important person in the world. She is quite on the short side, and is surrounded by very tall athletic hunks who are all very protective of her and wish to dote on her at every opportunity. She gets her own coterie of maids who derive great joy in stripping her, bathing her, massaging her, putting on her makeup, selecting dresses for her and then dressing her. She gets to take culture classes where she is taught how to dance, how to be more lady-like, etc. She gets pampered by the most eligible bachelor(s) of the kingdom. She gets abilities that let her absent-mindedly make products that would have taken experts of the kingdom several days to make. Everything she cooks is considered innovative and supremely delicious in the kingdom. The cosmetics she makes are so effective that they even fix her eyesight!The worst person so far is someone who appeared in the first episode. The one who ignores Sei and treats Misono Aira as the real saint. The worst person ever (!) is the one who neglects MC. Talk about shallow storyline and character development! I'm also up-to-date with the manga and LN, and this continues to be the case even much further into the story.All of this is as much fan-service as manhwas where the MC gets magical powers to service his harem. To anyone who has read a few romance manga or manhwas, this story would come across as too saccharine.If you're new to this genre (josei wish fulfillment fantasy) you might like it for a while. most important person in the world.

This anime immediately jumped to the top of my seasonal list.You see, Saint Isekai doesn\'t do TOO much new in the field. We\'ve seen Isekais before, and we\'ve seen that one fantasy world maybe a bit too much.But still, it is able to play its cards...right.Sei, our main character, voiced by Ishikawa Yui (aka Mikasa from AoT) does an excellent job at giving her a more ""chill"" and relaxed voice, as opposed to the usual shouting we know she does.Sei as a character was definitely a fun one. She originally gets summoned to the other world against her will, and cast aside by the summoners, making her feel very annoyed and angry about the situation. But after taking some time she decides to at least make the best of what she has and even make it a better life compared to what she had before at home.Meeting new people, making new friends, and slowly learning about her own powers, was definitely a treat to watch. On top of that, add the various funny expressions she did, and you\'ve got yourself an extremely adorable, yet human, character.In addition, we\'ve got some slow-paced romance sprinkled on top of it. It\'s not exactly THE main theme, but it\'s definitely there and gives us the spice we need in between.Unfortunately for Saint Isekai, I felt like the worldbuilding in general was very lacking. Magic boiled down to a few basic elemental spells and the Saint herself can basically just use different degrees of healing abilities.It also doesn\'t really help that the fight animations are also pretty non-existent and we mostly have ""powerpoint presentations"", but since it\'s not really the focus of the show, I did not feel it was that bad.Although the art in comparison did feel very off and having half-drawn faces was pretty off-putting.All in all, Saint Isekai was a fun show to watch. Watching Sei grow as a character alongside her new friends, seeing her experiment with different aspects of her power and having a bit of romance in between.8/10 right.Sei, our main character, voiced by Ishikawa Yui (aka Mikasa from AoT) does an excellent job at giving her a more ""chill"" and relaxed voice, as opposed to the usual shouting we know she does.Sei as a character was definitely a fun one.

Finally we have an anime that we can rate the studio for its progress and execution in adapting a show based on a Light Novel. Honestly, since the demise of Domestic at Kanojo, I've had no hope of a studio that has been known to significantly damage the original material and which has consequently crippled the entire franchise. But now it's an exception, this time we have to recognize a good job!Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou Desu is the kind of show that arrived in 2021 with an idea that was often questioned about its own functionality, even...more so by those responsible for the show. Diomedéa's staff, as mentioned above, does not have a positive reputation, as their latest projects were weak and didn't even present quality or exclusivity. This is not the case with this anime. Of course, Sei is the protagonist who enters and is summoned into another world, more specifically, the Kingdom of Salutania, along with another character, Aira. One of the two aims to save the kingdom from the evils of a miasma, which strengthens and attracts monsters against unprepared people. Unlike the more common isekais, where the main character automatically fits into a group of strong heroes and mages, Sei starts out in the world as another civilian who is unaware even of the concept of magic and potions.She, like us, arrives in this world without many expectations of consolidation and positivity, considering that the universe is classic for being boring and uninteresting. Sei even expresses at the beginning of the episodes her breaking of expectations, until curiosity takes her to formidable places. After meeting Jude, one of the employees of the Research Institute, who use herbs and other plants to create medicines and healing potions, Sei becomes interested in a new branch in his life, while his powers and his supposed qualification like Saint are still kept secret and in rumors throughout the kingdom. Sei develops from the beginning the practice and techniques of magic and begins to stand out within the Institute, attracting the interest of Johan, one of those responsible for the place. Along with this, the protagonist begins her shy adventures with responsibility and caution, while she forms good friendships and relationships throughout the kingdom.Her evolution as an important character is remarkable, in fact, the universe and the natural environment work positively and create a perspective very close to Sei, where she builds strong bonds and wants to help as much as possible. Well, even though Prince Kyle had segregated her and ignored her during her summoning, Sei wasn't shaken at all. In fact, the setbacks made her more mature and decisive in relation to her actions and honors, which made the character popularly known. Even though he had an internal responsibility not to expose himself too much for being the real Saint, if an emergency could be resolved by her, Sei wouldn't hesitate to help. Part of this makes her a miraculous person in the lives of the citizens of Salutania.But it's not just Sei who stands out during the show. Like Jude and Johan, other characters who come into her life promote her well-being and support her in the simple moments of her research. Ashley, her first friend, sees Sei as a modest girl, but recognizes her incredible potential to save many lives, Drewes is the strongest wizard in the entire kingdom, becoming a teacher and a support for research and improvement. Aira is a character constantly subdued by being considered a farce by the students of the magic school, but Sei supports her, even though the title of Saint has already been used by both of them, by others. Finally, Hawke. He is the head of the third order of knights and is always with Sei, just as a prince accompanies the princess on her tours of the realm (and beyond). I must say that the coolest and most relaxed moments come from their conversations and the relationship that can become a very prosperous love.Although the show has a greater dedication to the characters, the universe is not harmed during the adventures. Sei is basically the catalyst that promotes future adventures and discovery, like the Klausner region, the herb land of the Kingdom of Salutania. Sei's desire to discover new things during the episodes is conveyed by the audience with competence and dedication. Even though some episodes are sometimes tiring at first glance, episode composition and direction help sustain the show as he connects Sei with his new receptions and events. This promotes a very good show in character and world building. In fact, it's the biggest highlight of the entire show. Without that, we would possibly not have a charming potential within the anime.Finally, Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou Desu is an anime that really deserves greater prominence, as it consolidated well in 2021. I didn't imagine I would find a strong show that was interesting in so many ways at the same time, especially in the last moments, where good stories are lost, or in shows that dedicate more to the universe and forget to incorporate good characters. Seijo is an example of an anime that did very well and united these two audiovisual construction elements in a dynamic and promising way. It's a show that I look forward to a sequel as soon as possible. And again, congratulations to Estúdio Diomedéa, even with a low expectation about this project, the staff was very important to keep the qualities visibly high. If you haven't seen this show yet, give it a try, it sure is better conducted than countless recent isekais. more so by those responsible for the show. Diomedéa's staff, as mentioned above, does not have a positive reputation, as their latest projects were weak and didn't even present quality or exclusivity. This is not the case with this anime. Of course, Sei is the protagonist who enters and is summoned into another world, more specifically, the Kingdom of Salutania, along with another character, Aira. One of the two aims to save the kingdom from the evils of a miasma, which strengthens and attracts monsters against unprepared people. Unlike the more common isekais, where the main character automatically fits into a group of strong heroes and mages, Sei starts out in the world as another civilian who is unaware even of the concept of magic and potions.She, like us, arrives in this world without many expectations of consolidation and positivity, considering that the universe is classic for being boring and uninteresting. Sei even expresses at the beginning of the episodes her breaking of expectations, until curiosity takes her to formidable places. After meeting Jude, one of the employees of the Research Institute, who use herbs and other plants to create medicines and healing potions, Sei becomes interested in a new branch in his life, while his powers and his supposed qualification like Saint are still kept secret and in rumors throughout the kingdom. Sei develops from the beginning the practice and techniques of magic and begins to stand out within the Institute, attracting the interest of Johan, one of those responsible for the place.

It is not amazing or thrilling, and it definitely isn’t bad or disturbing either. It’s good. It isn’t something you’d watch when you’re looking for your next top anime, but it’s also not something you’d only watch if your desperate for something new either. I’ve been watching this and Yuru camp lately, and both of them are just relaxing and enjoyable.The story is nothing new, but it’s presented in such a way that it flows nicely and is paced well enough that you’re neither confused nor bored (although episode one was a bit fast paced, but it improves shortly...after.)The art style is pretty, and there’s nothing noticeably poor about the animation either. The soundtrack and voice acting are good too, and all get the job done.The characters aren’t really deep or enticing, but they’re not annoying or overly cliche either. They’re fun to watch and their interactions feel natural.Overall, this show is a great one to kick back and relax to after work/school. Normally I wouldn’t make a review after only 3 episodes, but because of the nature of this show being slice of life-esque, I don’t see a “bad ending” ruining it, and I don’t see some huge plot point coming that’ll make me want to give it a 10. after.)The art style is pretty, and there’s nothing noticeably poor about the animation either.

However how the story progresses from there is a little different and quite refreshing.As the story continues forward it focuses on one of the two girls who were summoned and but wasn't chosen by the hero to party up with. She then continues with her life as a saint, experiencing a different side of the fantasy world, that we don't often get to see, as she develops her magical power and uses them in different ways.The story is more light hearted and refreshing than most seasonal isekai with it focusing...more on romance then action leading to a more relaxing an laid back experience which is perfect to unwind with after school/work.The only thing letting the story down at the moment is the lack of character development and the lack of a more detailed and engaging plot but hopefully these will both be expanded on as more episodes are added.Overall this anime isn't anything too amazing but is just a nice show to watch and i think that i will really enjoy watching as the story progresses forwards. more on romance then action leading to a more relaxing an laid back experience which is perfect to unwind with after school/work.The only thing letting the story down at the moment is the lack of character development and the lack of a more detailed and engaging plot but hopefully these will both be expanded on as more episodes are added.Overall this anime isn't anything too amazing but is just a nice show to watch and i think that i will really enjoy watching as the story progresses forwards."", ""4/10 -do not recommend-I haven't read the manga, so when it was first announced, I was thrilled because isekai is one of my most favourite genre. Looking at the trailer I thought this was gonna be at least enjoyable.The anime is slow paced. In fact, too slow that I lost interest because there is no progress at all with the development. The thing that drawn me is the magic aspect of the show when it was first announced, but I was truly disappointed with just how much potential they've wasted.The characters were rather bland, and lacks a resolute to their ambition. Except for...one character, and it was not the main protagonist T w TThe animation is mediocre, every fight scene were lackluster. The reason I had to finish it because I was kinda waiting for the main character to show growth... But she didn't. Her magic was supposed to be omnipotent, not omniwasted. I was TRULY rooting for her, but why did she have to be so dependent on the men that surrounded her?The potential for this show was a lot, considering the premise is a lot more tensed and broad. But since I didn't read the manga, I really didn't know what I was expecting. They could have covered the dullness of the animation with outstanding magic system and endearing story.

Stabbed or Crushed to Death? Truck-kun? Or in the case of the female MC, 20-year-old Sei Takanashi: a sudden light at her doorstep after a long typical day of the stresses of being a workaholic? Personally, even with the clichés and tropes of the now oversaturated Isekai genre, everyone secretly wants to live a fleeting dream like Sei\'s, to be suddenly transported into another world, and with the passing of time, slowly get used to the ways of the medieval-like...fantasy world and imitate Isekai Bookworm\'s Myne: the passion for books traded in for this series\'s flowers and herbs potion-making development.For this to be yet another adaptation of a Syosetu work (along the likes of Mushoku Tensei, not to mention Re:Zero and TenSura), the Isekai influences that are written by novelist Yuka Tachibana are very clear, and her story pens the journey of a wholesome, relaxing, slice-of-life, reverse-harem of an Isekai that doesn\'t grate on your nerves. All those tropes and clichés you\'ve seen time and time again are non-existent here, and Yuka Tachibana does a very good job subverting and going against the ""popular"" trend to deliver a story that honestly IMO, is an unique thing, all on its own. Also, like Isekai Bookworm\'s Myne, female Isekai protagonists are a rarity that you don\'t see everywhere within the genre\'s overstretched reaches.The story goes like this:The medieval-like world of the Kingdom of Salutania. Since ancient times, the kingdom has been victimized by shrouds of think and heavy miasma, warps the bodies and minds of living creatures, churning out monsters whom are ravaging destruction upon the world. While the Salutania Kingdom\'s Order of Knights relentlessly fight to quell this uncontrollable ""death flag"", the miasma sometimes overwhelm to restrict the movements of the monsters. During those periods, a holy maiden will appear in the form of a ""Saint"", utilize her powers to defeat the monsters, even more befitting, the lifting of the miasma. Her Saintly power and grace is tantamount to the peace of the Salutania Kingdom, and acts like a beacom of hope for people whom live alongside her at a kingdom level, but if the adverse happens, the Kingdom\'s sages will devise a Saint-summoning ritual to ""summon"" a woman with the Saint\'s divine powers...or so their ""prophecy"" was written to be like.Here\'s where the problem lies (and not with the story): where this ""Saint-summoning ritual"" would cast a light upon the chosen ""Delieverer"", where the optimal result would\'ve been one sole woman as the Saint, instead, 2 girls are summoned instead, leaving the royalty to wonder who is the real and fake Saint. Alas, as puzzled as Sei is, there isn\'t much to go on other than hearing the ludicrious story in disbelief. But with much convincing by the Palace\'s high-ranking Sers (that would go on to become Sei\'s trusty reverse-harem aides), Sei, having heard enough, without the option to ""head home"" and the heavy possibility that she would meet her death outside the kingdom walls, she has to get used to her new life in the Salutania Kingdom. And so it is, that both summoned girls: Sei, and 16-year-old Aira Misono, begin their new journey in this fantasy world, unclear and unsure of what to expect going forward.Let\'s cover the true Saint first: Sei Takanashi. As mentioned, Sei hasn\'t had much to go on about other than her presence looming around the Salutania palace, so her only option is to invest her stress-free life in something that is deemed useful, and that leads her to the flower and herb garden outside the palace. Having an in-depth knowledge about the flowers and herbs (that the fantasy world people wouldn\'t even have dreamt of), Sei slowly develops an interest, starting from making potions (and saving Commander Albert ""Ice Knight"" Hawke with her high-quality healing potion from an instance of the fight between miasma monsters) to being a researcher at the Kingdom\'s medicinal institute, helping out the director Johan Valdec and her trainer Jude. NGL, the Ikemen and Bishounens in this show are talented with grace and valour, much less the point that they look handsomely adorable and treat Sei like she\'s a literal diamond gem (other than treating girls with graceful sincerity). Commander Hawke is one fine Ikemen of a gem, literally always by Sei\'s side when she tries to request for more things to do and the proceedings thereafter, so much so that he develops a crush for Sei, and she knows it all too well, not just from her ""Saintly"" powers of love. Both Johan and Jude are also nice guys too, helping Sei at her time in the medicinal research institute. Add an extra Ikemen by the name of Yuri Drewes who acts as the kingdom\'s Grand Magus, as is with noblewoman Elizabeth ""Liz"" Ashley for pep talks, and plus the fact that Sei\'s potions are 50% or 1.5X more effective for the healing treatment of soldiers who went outside the kingdom to fight those miasma  monsters, Sei\'s ""Saintly"" omnipotent magic power of a mundane life is about to get more hectic, but lovely, and a sense of accomplishment, all at the same time. And Sei is a ""law-abiding"" person that always treats people with respect, and I find her character quite all the more intriguing in a very good way.Next, we head onto the fake Saint: Aira Misono. Compared to Sei, Aira\'s life in the fantasy world is the exact opposite of Sei\'s, being handled mostly by the Crown Prince of Salutania, Prince Kyle. His behaviour and attitude isn\'t the best, and he can be arrogant and ignorant of his surroundings, much less of Liz being his fiance to deal with his short-temper attitude that earns the ire of everyone, including his father, the King Siegfried, whom is sympathetic towards Sei. It\'s honestly sad to see Aira being the outlier, and pair that with Kyle\'s nonchalant attitude that he swears by his word that he\'ll help her adjust to a support role, she\'s been the support character suffering behind the scenes, even if we don\'t pay a thought about her that much (since Sei is the main MC). It\'s only through sympathy that Aira soon gets to meet Sei with the help of Liz and confront each other about their own struggles and come with a compromise that sees the 3 ladies have some good time together, chained by heartfelt bonds. As much as I can feel happiness for Sei, Aira is just as important, if not more so.It\'s been sometime since Diomedea has made a comeback into seasonal anime production with the sole focus on the year-long Ahiru no Sora for the past 2 years, and I\'m glad to say that this studio still hasn\'t lost their unique mojo ever since. With that said, this anime looks gorgeous and beautiful, and while not outstanding, it\'s enough to make jaws drop at how the visuals make a reference to the show\'s simplicity and careful planning of its structure, balancing both happy and (at times) depressing moments so that the audience (and yours truly) stays focused on what\'s going on within the setup.Even the OST\'s visuals look very nice and attractive with the soft motif accompanied by the OP and ED\'s resepctively soothing and cheerful songs. I have always been a big fan of Aira Yuuki\'s songs ever since Imouto sae Ireba Ii.\'s ED, and her OP song ""Blessing"" is really, nothing short of a blessing of a soothing song that\'s as every bit blissful. As a tidbit, there is the usual Japanese version, but there is an English version of the song as well, and it\'s just as good as the Japanese counterpart to listen on its own. As for the ED, this is the Seiyuu idol group NOW ON AIR\'s 4th ED song, and given the song calibre in Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro and Muhyo to Rouji Season 2, it\'s definitely gotten bearable overtime, but I still feel like it\'s always a hit-or-miss with this girl group. At least for this show alone, the song is a good one that matches up with Aira Yuuki\'s OP, so suffusive to say that this OST fits perfectly with the anime\'s themes.Instead of my usual rantings of recommendations, let me put it this way to you:Are you looking for an anime where you can just be a couch potato to sit and relax on?Are you sick of the usual clichés and tropes that the Isekai genre is wrought with?Most importantly, are you looking for a safe haven to destress at the end of your typical busy day?Then this show is for you, in all of the perfect ways possible to gush out the winds of kindness and love to brighten your day.The Saint\'s show is no masterpiece, but it has its Magic Power that is Omnipotent to attack the heart-strings of people to give the feeling of walking in Heaven. That\'s how pretty good this show is, and a definite heartfelt recommendation in awe of the great Saint in me. fantasy world and imitate Isekai Bookworm\'s Myne: the passion for books traded in for this series\'s flowers and herbs potion-making development.For this to be yet another adaptation of a Syosetu work (along the likes of Mushoku Tensei, not to mention Re:Zero and TenSura), the Isekai influences that are written by novelist Yuka Tachibana are very clear, and her story pens the journey of a wholesome, relaxing, slice-of-life, reverse-harem of an Isekai that doesn\'t grate on your nerves.

It\'s an isekai slice of life? I mean, the competition is big so maybe the author is just that confident in themselves.Oh, so it was targeted at a female audience and I\'ve been jebaited... Well so be it. Otome game was also aimed at a female audience and I enjoyed it, so really it can\'t be that bad, right?Well it was that bad.Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou desu,...or the Saint\'s magical power is omnipotent is, as you may have guessed already, a power fantasy slice of life isekai, with a twist, twist being that female exist and they probably like to have their own self insert power fantasy. Who knows, maybe there\'s been outcry asking for that and if there was, rejoice woman, you can now also have a mediocre anime to your demographic.But more actual criticism rather than me just shitting on an anime that was very obviously not made for me.One big issue I have that may sound like a small nitpick, but the naming convention in the anime, while it wasn\'t the best, was plenty good enough. Now can someone explain to meWHY THE FUCK WOULD YOUR EUROPEAN INSPIRED MEDIEVAL FANTASY ALTERNATE WORLD HAVE A CHARACTER NAMED KYLE?! That may not be much, but to me it was extremely painful to hear. Kyle? How the fuck is that a medieval sounding name? Fucking hell he was even one of the two better characters. But whatever, I\'ll just chalk it up to the author being drunk.Next, the story, it was shit. It\'s your classic world ending calamity threatens to take over the world and only your very powerful but very uninteresting self insert protagonist can destroy this menace. Now I\'m not the kind of guy to pee in the cum sock, I know it\'s a slice of life isekai and therefore the story is kind of a lower priority, but it would have been a lot better if you didn\'t pretend to care by having random uneventful battles where things happen and the protagonist gets some sort of boost. Also, talking about boost, the power of love? This anime is clearly targeted towards teenage girls, or perhaps emotionally immature female adults? Who knows, that\'s clearly beyond me.Now, my personal philosophy is that the ""It\'s slice of life, so of course there is no story"" excuse is only valid if your characters are good. Is it the case here? Fuck no, or this review would have been a lot nicer to this garbage. The more obvious thing out of the way, this anime has a bad harem vibe to it, as in, every single character interaction revolves around our protagonist. That\'s a real problem, because it makes the world feel static. One small upside is Aira\'s small arc in the story, which lifted up this Anime for one second before it fell back down into the crapper, because she took over some of the character interaction before Sei took back the monopoly.Secondly, the characters are as interesting as a plain wall. You have to watch them, but they are extremely boring, and their purpose is very obviously to support our main character, which is yet again a self insert, meaning that every interaction is boring as shit and very few characters have slightly decent quirks, you\'ve seen them for 10 seconds and they already feel old, and even those with said quirks get boring fast, because that\'s all they have going for them.Fuck, now I feel like the anti-moe patrol, this anime was very clearly not for me.The production was actually alright, hell it even looks good at times, so I can\'t really deck it on that one. Great going Diomedea, you\'ve carried an irredeemable piece of garbage.And that\'s it, this anime doesn\'t have any good aspect, consumes itself like a bad fanfiction and can only cater to teenage girls, the kind to look for romance in every little interaction. A waste of time but that\'s what anime is all about. or the Saint\'s magical power is omnipotent is, as you may have guessed already, a power fantasy slice of life isekai, with a twist, twist being that female exist and they probably like to have their own self insert power fantasy. Who knows, maybe there\'s been outcry asking for that and if there was, rejoice woman, you can now also have a mediocre anime to your demographic.But more actual criticism rather than me just shitting on an anime that was very obviously not made for me.One big issue I have that may sound like a small nitpick, but the naming convention in the anime, while it wasn\'t the best, was plenty good enough. Now can someone explain to meWHY THE FUCK WOULD YOUR EUROPEAN INSPIRED MEDIEVAL FANTASY ALTERNATE WORLD HAVE A CHARACTER NAMED KYLE?! That may not be much, but to me it was extremely painful to hear. Kyle? How the fuck is that a medieval sounding name? Fucking hell he was even one of the two better characters. But whatever, I\'ll just chalk it up to the author being drunk.Next, the story, it was shit. It\'s your classic world ending calamity threatens to take over the world and only your very powerful but very uninteresting self insert protagonist can destroy this menace. Now I\'m not the kind of guy to pee in the cum sock, I know it\'s a slice of life isekai and therefore the story is kind of a lower priority, but it would have been a lot better if you didn\'t pretend to care by having random uneventful battles where things happen and the protagonist gets some sort of boost. Also, talking about boost, the power of love? This anime is clearly targeted towards teenage girls, or perhaps emotionally immature female adults? Who knows, that\'s clearly beyond me.Now, my personal philosophy is that the ""It\'s slice of life, so of course there is no story"" excuse is only valid if your characters are good. Is it the case here? Fuck no, or this review would have been a lot nicer to this garbage. The more obvious thing out of the way, this anime has a bad harem vibe to it, as in, every single character interaction revolves around our protagonist. That\'s a real problem, because it makes the world feel static.

With the protagonist's isekai role, the story organically escalates into her growing into her role as a saint.The story follows a somewhat slow burn, with expected cases of everyone being amazed at the protagonist's capabilities surrounded by her exploration of this new world and its customs.I love the art direction as well, with warm colours, a consistent setting and reasonably tasteful CGI use.

It is certified wholesomeness, without any of the dramatic things that plagues recent adaptations. Now, one thing to note is that this is not a reverse harem, like many people think (at least for the first season of the anime, idk about manga). There is the main couple, and the other male characters are not in love with the fl. This, personally is also one of the strong points of this peaceful isekai: It does not contain a obnoxious harem trope like most recent adaptations. Another strong point is the fact that it feels completed, even though there is supposedly a season 2 in the works, set to release this year. Overall a very fun watch, and I would recommend it if you like chill and tranquil anime like this, with a relaxing pace.

However the faults of this one outweigh any chance to truly enjoy it, or for me they did anyway. I've never seen an anime where magic looked so... unmagical. Its next to non...existent here and by that I mean, people just put their hands over or on something and concentrate with their eyes closed. Thats really it. Healing spells just have them say heal or something along those liens to heal. Lightning attacks were the best since they LOOKED like magic and we saw it like once out of the 9 episodes I saw. Ice magic is also disappointing. Anything else is just them going about their lives touching/making stuff without their eyes closed and somehow the magic is just used...The setting... not bad, but I find it insulting as a woman to see that Sei and the other girl are basically forced to conform to the living standards where women have to be careful with boys they interact with and have to be polite, and other victory times stuff that women had to put up with. If this were the past that'd be more acceptable (as it was the time but this isn't the past, its a different world they were summoned too! So it comes off pretty insulting especially when one of the girls who may be the Saint is being isolated, shunned and almost picked on by other girls when again, she is being called the Saint and they know this! (They also know she's not from their world)Let's also address the prince, the jerk who shunned Sei and looked down on her just because of her attire. The anime explains why later so he's not as bad as he initially comes off, but all the same, he is still a jerk for how he treated Sei and he was making the other girl's life harder too even if he thought he was helping her. I also found it offensive he dismissed Sei when he talked so much about wanting to help the other girl. Again, all because he looked down on her for her appearance. Its also this that made Sei very angry at him, however, this gets played off and handled poorly in the 9 episodes I saw... which brings me to another issue I have with the story, any part that COULD be used to make the anime better, gets handled poorly so the anime doesn't get better as it should. Instead am left with disappointment as I said. Lastly, the title is misleading. The Saint's power is not limitless and it certainly isn't god like either.As I said, this anime can be enjoyed, and it certainly has some episodes where you wanna know how this sitch is handled and what happens next, but it ends in disappointment and I don't need to see the last few episodes to know I won't change my mind.

Usually in iseki  shows the protagonist (main character) is fighting with a sword  or magic, but in this show it's not like that. Sei (the main character) isn't even on the battle field, and I kind of love that cause it kind of explores what an iseki anime might be like if the protagonist never went into battle. Sei, is instead enjoying her life at a institute that makes potions out...of herbs. This show in my opinion is so far the best anime of the season. of herbs.

On other hand it also means that heroine is likely to be shy, act reserved, be somewhat awkward in social situations, get embarassed often and might be wearing glasses.

It wouldn’t be a regular broadcasting year without em, and I don’t watch many of them since they end up being the same thing (except shield hero, I don’t care what the critics say about it, but I’ll stop there). However, I found that I really enjoyed this one for some reason.The story was pretty familiar… protagonist gets teleported to another world because it is in some kind of danger and now they have god-level powers. In this one specifically, the protagonist isn’t given a warm...welcome at first. (I got real excited ‘cause I thought maybe this would be the female version of shield hero, but alas it is not like that) Not to worry though, she eventually gets pampered and even has the liberty of choosing what she wants to do with her new life. So, through the rest of the story you watch as the protagonist tries to lead a normal-ish life with as little attention drawn to herself as possible. Overtime though, the plot will thicken and (somewhat expected) big revelations will occur.I kind of liked that the story went down that route. I like that the MC didn’t desire the limelight; because of that, you get to see an interesting method of character development. The only thing I will never like about isekai, including this one, is how the protagonist(s) are rarely ever sad about being basically kidnapped from their life and home. The creators use excuses like, “Their life sucked anyway!” but you’re telling me that the protagonist here didn’t at least feel one bit of sorrow? What about her family and/or friends (this anime paints her as an introvert but there’s gotta be someone out there worried about her) that are panicking about her disappearance? But I mean, I get it… it’s anime… it’s far from the real world, so I’ll try not to let it taint anything.Other than the MC, the other characters are pretty entertaining in their interactions and I would genuinely smile when something funny or cute happened. The way the MC is able to cast her god-like magic is kind of… what do I say… cliché?… stupid?… *searches google* VAPID?… but it was still cute to watch her process of casting despite it being redundant.The other thing that made it enjoyable for me was just how easy it was to watch. I could relax and get an entertaining story without thinking too hard or wondering what’s gonna happen. Don’t get me wrong, that excitement is why I like some animes more than others, but a chill anime like this one is nice too (will never be as chill as Yuru Camp tho). Sure, there is some fighting in it, but it’s not a spectacle, and surprise! It’s not a shōnen… in case you were wondering…So, if you want a chill, easy-to-watch isekai, with a pretty cute protagonist who may or may not have magic of a god… then Seijo no Maryoku wa Bannou Desu, is a watch for you. welcome at first.

This is a very basic, josei power fantasy – basically a female-oriented counterpart to the trashy shounen isekais that flood the market for years now. Whether that\'s a bad thing though... Depends mostly on your taste and expectations, particularly because unlike the typical harem isekai, this formula is hardly overdone, or even common in anime.Like it should be in every trashy isekai, this is a show where the protagonist is bestowed with immense power, high standing, a perfect love interest and minor obstacles she can easily overcome with her gifts. The two things that...make her stand out a little bit is that she\'s a woman rather than a girl and her academic interests which give her a calling in the new world (alchemy) that isn\'t just about her inherent magic abilities (although still very much boosted by them).The plot is barely there. There is no real antagonist, aside from minor annoyances from a prince that makes a major error at the beginning and tries to salvage the situation in most asinine ways (which also involves being rude to the protagonist, but without real detriment to her). Probably the most interesting/emotional parts are not even connected to the protagonist, but rather the ""fake"" saint – a younger girl from our world that gets accidentally sucked into the summoning ritual, but doesn\'t receive the powers that should result from it.If you\'re going to like this show at all, you have to treat it as a healing anime, just enjoying the slow journey, the pleasant vibe and the decent production quality of it all. It\'s obvious that the plague affecting the land will be pushed back, the love story will have a happy conclusion and the saint will fulfill her destiny... But it\'s just nice to see all the wholesomeness play out on the screen. Still, there\'s also a good chance you\'ll find the utter lack of meaningful conflict and weak character progression extremely dull.In the end, it\'s a nice-looking, nice-sounding and heartwarming show that you\'ll either love or hate, depending on how you take in its tropes and peculiar pacing. Personally, I\'ve found it quite satisfying – while by no means an emotional masterpiece, like for example Violet Evergarden I\'ve seen people comparing it to, it was a nice change of pace. And I definitely wouldn\'t mind more shows like this at all, with female-centric isekai plots. make her stand out a little bit is that she\'s a woman rather than a girl and her academic interests which give her a calling in the new world (alchemy) that isn\'t just about her inherent magic abilities (although still very much boosted by them).The plot is barely there.

The Saints Magic Power is Omnipotent will probably be in my top 5 spring 2021 animes (stand alones, not including continuation). I\'m still yet to get through the ones I want to watch, but it started and ended on such a good note that I wouldn\'t be surprised if it stayed there.I knew it had some romance in it, but I didn\'t expect it to have as much as it did. Obviously it\'s very different to your standard high school romance plot as it is isekai, but...I enjoyed it a lot. I\'ll admit the plot is straight-forward, the enemies are clear cut, no complicated drama or anything like that. In fact, don\'t expect anything other that a simple storyline. The story and world-building won\'t wow you, the fighting/action scenes aren\'t even remotely exciting and honestly, it is a very ""feel good"" kinda anime. It is of no surprise that it ended the way it did.But I wouldn\'t say that\'s a bad thing. As long as you don\'t expect too much from it, you won\'t be disappointed. It\'s not complex, the characters aren\'t properly fleshed out or anything and you probably won\'t be attached to any of them.That being said, the MC was extremely refreshing. She was, unsurprisingly, kind. But she was also normal? Quite literally average in personality. She had realistic reactions to things, eager to learn and was overall very likable. I\'ve seen a couple animes that have ""normal"" MC\'s, mostly males, but I\'ve loved all of them as characters because I\'m used to the quirky, problematic (respectfully and lowkey charmingly) ones. She has her moments where she\'s very OP and again, straight forward story.I liked how you got to see Aira\'s POV and her version of things, albeit only for one episode, but still. The secondary female character was never portrayed in a way to make the audience hate her and she was also quite likable too. She\'s what most female MC\'s are like in some romances, shy, pretty and the obvious choice among most guys.Ignoring the extremely handsome love interest, who doesn\'t need to be written about because he pretty much speaks for himself in the first episode, the prince surprised me. I quite liked how they did his character. They had the potential flesh him out even more but that would\'ve totally flipped the simplicity of the anime because then the MC would be lacking in development.Characters aside, it is a slow burn pacing wise. Although it takes its time building the story and character relationships, it never really goes beyond the surface. It\'s slow but also perfect for the 12 episodes it has. I enjoyed every single episode, adored the romance and ngl, was screaming in some moments.I love my complex shows, I love animes that get me fully attached to the characters and I don\'t tend to like slow burns (some are exceptions), but The Saints Magic Power is Omnipotent hit all the right places. No attachment to the characters here but my enjoyment of it and the characters was high enough to make up for that. Also, the romance was just *chef\'s kiss*. No faults on the simple chemistry between those two characters.I highly recommend watching this with little to no expectations and if you want a break from plot driven animes. I enjoyed it a lot.

The art is beautiful, the story is fairly well written, and it's fairly straightforward (i.e. not a convoluted mess of a premise like other Isekai out there). If you're looking for a more relaxed 'summoned to a new world' type of anime, this is definitely for you.DETAILS:The real beauty of this show comes in the form of its character-driven focus. Don't come into this show looking for action - the show is very low on that so far. However, the way the show looks at the struggles of its main...character (and even some of the side characters!) is its main selling point. You really feel the surprise, shock, and other dilemmas of Sei and the supporting cast. One episode goes out of its way to focus on the internal struggle of a side character just to add context and realize that the show's conflict is much more nuanced than you would expect at face value.The art is gorgeous! The colors are bright and well defined, not falling into the modern Isekai trap of muting many of its colors.The story is slow paced, and I could see why that would annoy some. However, I like the pacing - it allows for more character development and world building (which the show does a decent job of, as well). Another modern Isekai trap avoided here - a lot of modern shows make their plots rather complicated to differentiate them from others in the Isekai genre, but The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent doesn't need to do that. The story is simple and streamlined but still well-paced enough that it can focus on the characters and their struggles in order to further progress the plot.Another small nitpick is that I've noticed that the subs don't always match what the characters are saying. The meaning has been changed ever so slightly either to streamline something or provide more context.CONCLUSION:The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent gracefully dodges the pitfalls of many modern Isekai shows to provide more of a fresh take within the genre.

It has a good opening, its female characters are fairly cute and charming, and it has a main character that loves pharmaceuticals, much like one of my favorite manga, Akagami no Shirayukihime.But unlike one of my favorites, which features politics, conflicts of interest, intriguing events and goals, and well written, complex characters... this show seems wholeheartedly dedicated to being about as bland as imaginable.The prime offenders are in the secondary cast. The protagonist herself seeks out interesting things fairly often and is comprehensible, and is about as flavorless as a protagonist might be expected to be. However, every person she...comes across is more tasteless than the last. The other summon, Aira, is placed in a perfect position for excellent storytelling, but she is completely marginalized in the show. The love interest for Sei, commander Hawke, is possibly more bland than prince charming himself, a tool to tell the wilting love story the main character needs to use her powers. The institute's director is the most interesting character in terms of complex motivations plays a sort of guardian role for Sei, but even he fades over time as she leans on the commander more and more.As for the rest... it's safe, and totally forgettable. Somehow making potions and learning magic is instantaneously boring. They just put leaves in water and boil it and put magic in it.

To write this review I'll look at the story, characters and how much I enjoyed it.Story: The story felt like the plot of every other Isekai at its most basic form, the main character gets summoned, she needs to save the kingdom and to absolutely no one's surprise she's the strongest person in the world and that's it. I guess the only thing that could be counted as different would be the romance but even that seemed underwhelming because it...barely developed as the story proceeded. In relations to conflict there was actually none and this made the story even flatter.Art: So there was this one running scene that seemed really weirdly done to me but for the most part I didn't really mind the art so I have no other comments about it.Characters: With the exception of one character the characters never really grew or developed, they were all very plain and 2 dimensional from the beginning to the end of the show. The one character that did show some depth still failed to be compelling in my opinion so not only did the story rarely develop the characters failed to be compelling enough to at least slightly carry it.Enjoyment: At first I was really excited for the anime and I think this excitement lasted like the first four episodes then I just ended up forcing myself to the end  because I had already started watching it.Here's the thing though, I feel like people who like slow paced easy going shows might actually like this as there's no over complicated plot twist or magic system you need to wrap your head round when you want to relax. The story was also funny in some areas so that's also a positive. Overall though I'd say the anime was mediocre at best. barely developed as the story proceeded.

That, along with the slice of life tag, gives a very sweet change of scenery.I personally enjoyed anime a lot. Storyline is told in an excellent manner and protagonist being a girl gives a more “soft” vibe to it. Characters develop at a normal pace and all the emotions and decisions seem just right, seem realistic....All the social interactions take into account the social position of characters and there are no awkward inconsistencies. Everything makes sense.There is one thing that seems very wrong and does it very consistently, however. Authors made an incredible job making a build up for an intense moment. You feel the drive, the heavy atmosphere, the emotions of the characters. You are hyped up about what comes next, you are waiting for culmination. And then it happens. One frame. Two. Then producer shouts “Ok, that’s enough, cut the tape here” and in a blink of an eye it ends. It’s gone, like it wasn’t there. You didn’t even feel it, you didn’t even have time to comprehend, to enjoy it. “They blew it” – you think, and you aren’t wrong.Yet, the story continues, and it’s very enjoyable. Though there are some decisions I don’t fully agree, the flow is still taking you on a rollercoaster of emotions that may or may not be the best thing you’ve ever experience.Second season is coming up and I’m hyped about it. Especially I’m waiting to see the culmination of the romance and hope that this time they won’t blow it. All things considered.

There\'s not a lot happening in each episode, and no real antagonists, but there sure are a lot of pretty, pretty boys going out of their way to be nice to the main character.Happily, the show avoids a lot of the dumber cliches that can weigh down these shows;  the main character seems decently smart, and there\'s no ""too dumb to clear up a misunderstanding"" clogging up the plot, such as...it is, other than the main romance.All in all, a nice, well produced, slightly bland show.

If you're expecting a female MC that is strong then this is not for you because even though she's supposed to be strong, her harem of men protects and cuddles her to the point that it's annoying.-----She and another girl was summoned into another world to be a saint and protects them but the first thing that happened was, the Crown Prince and thus most people ignored the MC and only care for the other girl.

The main character reminds me of tohru from fruits basket, but older and more mature yet still kind. The ml is the typical perfect strong soldier that protects and is only nice to the fl, BUT ITS SO CUTE. Because it goes back to the standard concept of princely ml making moves on the fl, it is so wholesome.

I am definitely reading this and its going on my ranking AS ONE OF THE BEST MADE ISEKAIS SO FAR.', 'Not the best execution of such a simple plot [Spoiler free review]I just wanted a wish-fulfillment isekai in which a woman goes to a fantasy world where she is the Chosen One and gets a hot boyfriend while fighting evil. It is a simple formula and I like it. However, the awful pacing made this anime difficult to enjoy.We meet the protagonist, Sei, as an office lady who is working until late. She arrives at home, where she lives alone, and is suddenly summoned into a fantasy world. Another girl (Aira) was summoned with her. The prince announces Aira is the Saint they were waiting...for. Then, the scene is cut to Sei having a meeting with some characters who explain the situation to her: the Saint, who has a great magical power, was summoned to fight the evil creatures that are threatening their country, but somehow two pleople were summoned instead of one. Sei can\'t go back to her world, but can live confortably at the palace if she wants. She is free to do as she pleases. After a time-jump of one week, she is bored af and gets a job in a research institute, where she learns how to use magic to make potions.Doesn\'t seem like a bad first episode, but the pacing... THE PACING. It is just so fast. The scene where she is summoned, I swear. Two frames and it is over. The fact that the prince declares the other girl the Saint and ignores the protagonist is actually very important for the plot, but barely any attention was given to that. Several episodes later, Sei says that she was furious for being ignored, but we never got to see that! The scene happened in a flash, and we never saw her having any particular feelings about it! We only saw the ""after"", when she is listening to their explanation and seems upset for being summoned there against her will -- and even that doesn\'t last long, as she accepts her new life quite easily.It is very difficult to care for a character we don\'t understand. Did she have friends and family, or anything important to her? There was no mention to it. Was she working until late because she likes her job, or did she hate it? She seemed pretty neutral about that. Did she wish she was the Saint instead of Aira? No clue. We can only guess all of that, nothing is shown. And the worst is... around episode 7 or 8, we finally see how things happened to Aira. We see she had a family, we see her crying because she can\'t go back, we see her motivation to work hard as the Saint (the prince promissed to find a way to send her back if she solves the kingdom\'s problem). We UNDERSTAND her. We even get to see more subtle aspects of Aira\'s personality, which were actually done very well. So why didn\'t the writers show the same dedication in writing the protagonist?The romance also suffered from bad pacing. The first meeting between Sei and her love interest was a great scene, I really liked how it was done, but after that... time jumps. Lots of time jumps. He gives her some rides, and time jumps. Suddenly they are into each other, but I guess they fell in love when we were not looking, somewhere between the time jumps. How about showing us those interactions??I really wish they showed us why the two of them are good together. Do they have shared interests? Do their strenghts and weaknesses complement each other? Being handsome/pretty is not enough for a compelling romance. Writers need to work a little harder than that.To be fair, this show does improve from the middle on. They start doing time jumps when it actually makes sense, showing the important events in real time and jumping baggage packing or whatever. They start making up for the mess that was the first episode by explaining how Sei felt and showing the events by Aira\'s point of view. They also show Sei and the love interest working together, and having meaninful interactions. It was much better, but too little too late.Plot (3/10). The plot is sooo contrived. The basic premisse of fighting monsters is ok, but when we get to the details... ugh. Everyone seems to be so bad at their jobs. What annoyed me the most was the writers trying to frame a certain character as sacrificing himself and playing the bad guy to protect someone else... However, if you actually think about the situation, his decisions don\'t make any sense. He could have solved the problem in a blink of an eye if he just acted with common sense. So, so contrived.Characters (4/10). The protagonist is very blank. I get it: we are supposed to put ourselves in her shoes. However, we also need to have something to identify with. I already ranted about not knowing anything about her motivations and thought process, so I will say what I liked. I really liked the fact she is a researcher (maybe because I\'m a researcher too lol), and that aspect of her gained more emphasis at the last half of the show. There was some novelty to it, and I think it is great to show girls doing science. As for the other characters... the love interest is just pretty and kind, with no depth at all. A little boring. Aira doesn\'t have much screen time, but she had a short emotional arc that was probably the best of this show (and kinda made me wish she was the protagonist). Other secondary characters were interesting to watch, such as the king, Elizabeth, and the other potion researchers. Most of them were more memorable than poor love interest whose name I forgot (Sorry. It is Hawk.), but still there was no depth in any of them.Design/graphics (8/10). The graphics are beautiful and give a nice fantasy-like atmosphere to the show. The character design for the main couple is as generic as their personalities. I wish they had kept Sei\'s glasses or added some original detail, because without them she looks exactaly like all other girl-next-door type of protagonists. I did love the design of many of the side characters, tho. The king was a daddy.Music/voice (8/10). The soundtrack was nice and blended well with the scenes. The OP and ED songs were also good. But I have to praise Sei\'s voice actress (Ishikawa Yui) for her great acting skills, which couldn\'t make up for the poor writing, but gave as much personality to Sei as possible with that script. Hawk\'s lines were very repetitive, mostly saying ""Sei"" softly/kindly/sexly. Sakurai Takahiro indeed sounded soft/kind/sexy, so... lol. Good job too, I guess...?Enjoyment (6/10). I was entertained enough to watch until the end, as the second half of the season got better. But, if they make a new season, I\'m probably not watching it.

And it is honestly a bit funny how the reviews vary in that from being either good or bad.It is somethig in the middle, there isn't really much of a point in the Anime where it gets super exciting but is more relaxed and I see potential of a continuation of the series as well which might be better.Otherwise the Isekai-Concept is pretty average, I would think this one is just more for a girls-audience (aka Shojo) considering the pretty bishounen and Romance in this (It is not very strong so everyone should be fine with...it) even though i really also like the message behind the magic's power it doesn't difference very much from others, but the idea of all this could have indeed had more potential than what was shown to us and I think that's kinda a bit of a missed opportunity, the series lacks Characteristics.If you are good with a casual show to watch for once, you can watch it.

The male lead is a gentleman and simply just a nice guy, I'm not digging his whole character design though, I'm done with dem blondes. In short, all the characters are wholesome. The whole anime is just fluff....Most importantly, no fanservice (ecchi) -- thank god T_TYea the plot literally makes everything go her way, she's overpowered, etc. but I just love how drama-free the anime is.

I won't judge too much because so far we only have 6 episodes available but i'll review based on that and i'm only judging the story and not focusing too much on the art and soundtrack, not that those aren't a good fit but i tend to focus more on the plot and writing rather than the art/sound when i watch anime unless those two parts disrupt the flow and enjoyment too much, but i do have to say that the current rating (7.62) is quite apt. There...isn't much to say about this anime yet, as i mentioned before it's a very lighthearted one and it reminds me of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, it has the same feeling and there are hints of an early romance but no reverse harem or anything like that, though there are indeed a lot of handsome men around her.Now let's talk about the only flaw i've seen so far and of course this is my opinion, the main character is too naive and innocent, it feels very unrealistic because just by living in our world and growing up one would definitely not be so pure like her to the point of believing anything others say to her, but while that is something i consider a negative point it can also be considered a positive point because there's room for growth and you could even compare her to those shounen main characters or maybe a blank piece of paper, she's plain in both personality and appearance, even somewhat indecisive and she knows it too, but that means the author could fill that piece of paper with content that is defined and developed by her experiences in this new world and that could be very interesting depending on the direction the author takes this story.I don't expect this anime to suddenly turn into a dark story but i am hoping she will eventually be taught a lesson which will in turn help her mature and grow as a person, perhaps she's not as pure as i imagine but the anime format definitely doesn't help when it comes to inner thoughts and long text descriptions that could be inserted in the novel, there's no space for that in a short 20 minutes episode unfortunately. Now for my final thoughts, would i recommend this anime to others? Sure, it's that seasonal feel good type of anime that anyone could get into and it doesn't require you to think too much, i also noticed it only has 12 episodes but i wonder if there will be a season 2 in the next anime season, it probably has enough story in the light novel to cover that much and i think this anime deserves another season unless it suddenly takes a drastic and catastrophic turn in the next six episodes of this season. isn't much to say about this anime yet, as i mentioned before it's a very lighthearted one and it reminds me of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, it has the same feeling and there are hints of an early romance but no reverse harem or anything like that, though there are indeed a lot of handsome men around her.Now let's talk about the only flaw i've seen so far and of course this is my opinion, the main character is too naive and innocent, it feels very unrealistic because just by living in our world and growing up one would definitely not be so pure like her to the point of believing anything others say to her, but while that is something i consider a negative point it can also be considered a positive point because there's room for growth and you could even compare her to those shounen main characters or maybe a blank piece of paper, she's plain in both personality and appearance, even somewhat indecisive and she knows it too, but that means the author could fill that piece of paper with content that is defined and developed by her experiences in this new world and that could be very interesting depending on the direction the author takes this story.I don't expect this anime to suddenly turn into a dark story but i am hoping she will eventually be taught a lesson which will in turn help her mature and grow as a person, perhaps she's not as pure as i imagine but the anime format definitely doesn't help when it comes to inner thoughts and long text descriptions that could be inserted in the novel, there's no space for that in a short 20 minutes episode unfortunately.

The male protagonist has prince-charming-look (not mentioning the red hair prince that I don\'t want to recall its name cause ew) and also Hawke\'s vibe resembles to Usui Takumi from Kaichou wa Maid sama. I also like the way the male chara\'s was created with...a balanced variant of personality like every ""shoujo romance reverse harem"" should be.2. The FL is not tsundere. Yes, I don\'t mean to bad talking over tsundere, but I just saying that she\'s probably too often to run from the ML cause of being shy to him, but she\'s not annoying to see. Still watchable for me who easily triggered especially towards those characters that don\'t have any composure nor attitude that fit to be strong and independent FL. Although sometimes I think Sei was kinda weak and too slow to move over some problem, I just managed to not hate her cause she\'s still got that conviction that brings everyone to trust and love her.3. Liz. Of course, she should be the best girl for this series even for the FL herself. Liz successfully bring confidence and also she managed her emotion to not feel triggered over the-other-girl and his trash fiancee. I love how she\'s being humble and at the same time has an unwavering vibe and elegance, such a very good representation of how the noble should behave (not like that dumb red hair).I don\'t actually hate the series, it just feels like I\'ve watched the same plot, the same characters, and background conflict like in every anime then gather it to make this anime. There is nothing new, but I just watch this for enjoying the lovely male charas and shipping the FL and ML.And for some people said that this series is loss on antagonist or villain... it\'s true, that\'s why you may watch this when you just feel free. Really easy to watch for everyone who finds enjoyment through easy romance and light series. a balanced variant of personality like every ""shoujo romance reverse harem"" should be.2.

And very underrated. For starters it actually gives a good background information about the kingdom and what is going on about it. The story art IS AMAZING both in the manga, light novel, and anime. I would suggest reading the light novel as well because it gives so much detail about it. And in the manga there are some cute scenes that the anime has left out. The characters designs are well thought out and I love how the characters treat one another. Everyone is treated well and no one is...treated badly because of their social class. They give a good description for what is going on. And it shows how much passion the MC has for everyone. Throughout the story it goes into deep detail about her powers and how it actually works making it somewhat logical.And how other people might say it does not have a good plot because there is no main antagonist. Not every single anime has to have one they can do well off without one. Having no main antagonist makes this different from any other isekai anime because it does not follow any stereotypic isekai anime rules. The mc has its own choice for choosing life and what she does for it not being forced into fighting someone or something. However people might say this is so boring and it does not have a good plot. Not every anime needs fighting in order to be good. It is very refreshing to watch something new. Not every single anime is a fighting or drama type.Watching this anime is so refreshing because the plot is so easy to understand and you do not feel overwhelmed by it.

It's not something with video game mechanics, and it's not similar environmentally to morrowind. It's just more of a slow paced thing where she's making potions and learning magic, but of course her potions and magic are powerful because she's the saintess that was summoned.This show is more aimed at women as far as the love interests go, but it's not heavy on it, and it's not an ecchi or anything, It's very wholesome. The art's pretty good and the main character isn't boring or obnoxious. It's a pretty solid isekai.At the...beginning of the show, two women are summoned, and the main character is ignored by the prince. The rest of the kingdom isn't stupid though, so they take care of her and try to stay in her good graces. So rather than doing this for the sake of the main character being able to get back at people, it's more a device to allow her to more freely discover things in the world rather than being on some set course.Rather than needing some speech or fight to prove her worth or her title, just her ability with magic is enough to make it more and more undeniable that she's the saintess. It's a refreshing change of pace from certain other shows. beginning of the show, two women are summoned, and the main character is ignored by the prince.

The synopsis of this anime is pretty much what you get; it's a pretty generic shoujo isekai with a pretty generic fantasy setting and plotline. The story is slow and plodding; the art is beautiful but the animation was clearly budget-limited. However, despite all these things, it quickly became my favourite comfort show of recent seasons by the first few episodes.The character writing, while not anything breathtaking, was definitely what sold the entire show. There's a nuanced undertone to each of the conversations between the characters; a sense of gentleness...and tacit understanding between them. The relationships between them were warm, supporting, and realistically developed. The dialogue writing is thoughtful and grounded.I especially loved how they addressed Sei's initial reluctance to come into the role of Saintess. It was a little bit of a shock; I'm so used to watching action-packed isekai shows where the MCs adapt into unbelievably harsh and challenging environments despite being nothing but normal people in a peaceful modern society in their past lives. In this case, seeing the people in Sei's life gently support her no matter what decision she ends up taking (and all this done with very little explicit addressing of the actual topic!) was such a beautiful thing to watch.A scene I also particularly enjoyed was watching the scene between Aira and an unnamed female student at her school on the rainy day; the time spent on that quiet, wordless exchange between them with Aira finally being left behind and simply using magic to dry herself instead was such a wonderfully written moment. It was such a small scene but the choice to emphasize it added so much colour and depth to her character.All in all, this was a wonderfully comforting and simple series, with the ending being a beautiful revelation as to why the title of this show came to be in the first place. Execution on all fronts of this storyline was lovely to watch, particularly with this cast of loveable characters. and tacit understanding between them.

With Isekai being my least fave subgenre, I\'ll always have to go in with very low expectations for I\'ve disappointed experiences with the potential of many Isekai stories being squandered with otaku subculture going over the top as unfunny comedic timing/humor & meant-to-be serious plot that has little or no stakes due to (male) protagonist being the only one to be a sudden overpowered hero. The latter statement is proof that Isekai stories always feature a self-insert protagonist given that 99% of the stories are written by amateur authors at Shosetsu website.Now just because you see/hear the...word ""amateur"" doesn\'t mean all of them are bad writers. In fact, I believe only 1% of the existing Shosetsu Isekai writers have written a worthy Isekai story though it depends on your luck of trying & deciding if you should purchase every single volume of certain series. Well I\'m glad to tell you that Saint\'s Omnipotent Magic is one of those 1% worthy Isekai stories to your reading list.Of course SOM isn\'t any different from what I\'ve said above. Sei, the protagonist who\'s the actual Saint, is obviously a self-insert protagonist given her background of being alone back in her world without any parents or friends to greet to or rely on. Nevertheless, she\'s meant to be written like that so that we as the viewers can relate to her situation of being suddenly whisked away to a literally foreign world.What\'s different from other copy-and-paste isekai stories is that most of the characters, especially Sei, has displayed rational actions and motivation somehow that you realise some realism elements has been implemented in this series. I love how the series emphasized on the characters blinking eyes in between/during their dialogue. Surprisingly to say, I\'ve watched Diomedéa\'s previous works that have either subpar or an okay level of animation quality, and I conclude SOM is the best work they\'ve done.(I\'m still waiting for an ""Animators Rights"" Bill to come true someday. The sooner the better.)From Sei\'s various emotional portrayals to Aira\'s backstory and POV being told with realistic revelations, I believe why SOM has managed to become a worthy isekai to watch is because the execution of its premise & plot points are done right in a fell good way. Majority of this series\' tone is calm & relaxing given that this is catered to a different kind of audience, mainly the female viewers. It\'s also thanks to Sei being expressive and her inner monologue has let viewers know what she\'s feeling & thinking, especially how she prepares herself to have her life get a drastic change once her Saintly Powers are getting discovered soon by the general public.While it may not be mind-blowing or have a lot of action like those male-oriented Isekai stories, Saint\'s Omnipotent Magic is one of those isekai stories where you can experience the realism that blends well with the calm & relaxing storytelling of a female MC\'s daily life (a.k.a. slow life) in another world.I only recommend SOM if you want a change of pace from watching the usual male-oriented Isekai stories, especially ones that feature ""an OP hero who gets a harem too easily"" kind of premise. Furthermore, I don\'t recommend SOM to those who are expecting battle/fight scenes for majority of the runtime & those who are unable to take in cheesy romance.At end of day, I can say that Saint\'s Omnipotent Magic has shattered my low expectations of it which in case they\'re able to portray the realistic developments between various characters at most times. It\'s definitely worthy your purchase of the source material\'s volumes if you were to love SOM as much as I did. word ""amateur"" doesn\'t mean all of them are bad writers.

Beautiful backgrounds and attractive, good people everywhere! While it can be slow to get to the isekai flavour, and what it does show lacks the complexity of other popular isekai, it is still entertaining. The final bow on this parcel is the completion of a cute, interpersonal arc for the heroine that leaves me wanting more, but feeling satisfied with the 12 episode run of the anime. For those who like pretty boys, pretty fantasy worlds and pretty feelings.ReviewHaving been getting back into watching...anime again by swiftly binging season 2 of Dragon Maid and wailing about how everything else looks shit in comparison, “The Saint\'s Magic Power is Omnipotent” sates me. Certainly it doesn\'t come close to the top tier aesthetics of DM, but it has been good enough to get me through it\'s 12 episode run and make me read the manga.You can\'t say they don\'t try here. The backgrounds are stunning, the shot composition is varied, character designs look good and there are moments of quality animation in depiction of magic and what little combat is present in the series. Even despite the lack of typical anime exuberance in character reaction, they still throw in those small piece of animation - cow lick quivers and heroine screams - that remind you you\'re still in anime land. It all feels very good natured and relaxing. Like ""Shirayukihime"", but with the shoujo melodrama stripped out of it. In it\'s place is the older office lady, who straddles the line between world weary and pure maiden (when it comes to her love interest).I was actually very impressed with the characters in this series. Namely Prince Kyle/Liz, and I also enjoyed the relationship between our two isekai\'d heroines. It was nice to feel like the dickhead royalty trope was getting turned on it\'s head a bit - Kyle recognises his faults (some of which are a ruse to greater ends) and he made an effort to rectify it. Sei and Aira also don\'t have any ill will towards each other, but actually demonstrate empathy. Sei being the older one realises the hard position Aira is being put in as girl still in high school, with false preconceptions and expectations placed upon her by a foreign aristocrat. When Aira is then removed from her social vacuum and finally given a chance to make her own place in her new world, it may be saccharine and easily found, but it just felt good.I would also be remiss to not mention the very clear and direct romance that is central to the narrative of this story. I was already grasped from the beginning when Sei just straight forwardly proclaims to the audience that Hawk was very much her type. Nice. Hawk\'s design isn\'t my favourite, even though I think he looks good (I\'m probably more likely to remember Prince Kyle than Captain Hawk at this point), and his personality is one of the least explored. But their relationship does end up being the interpersonal backbone of the season; the broader plot is really only getting going by the time the 12th episode finishes after all. No, instead the creators of this anime choose to have the main pairing literally creating life with the power of their love. More foliage than flesh, but still.Reading the majority of available manga chapters did make me realise that this series is currently best consumed via that medium though. There are just a lot of little details that have been cut out in the anime. Probably for good reason, but it is still missing lore and cutesy energy. The anime also takes 3 episodes before it even starts touching on magic, versus several chapters in the manga, and that just didn\'t feel as good to me. I\'m a big fan of concepts and lore being woven into shows. Even better if it is done in an intelligent way where it reveals more about the world and our protagonists place in it. They do have this in the form of the saint’s powers, but as already mentioned, these are plodding discoveries over our 12 episodes. Unfortunately “The Saint’s…” reveals little else, so that dimension of this show is quite a bit weaker than the average isekai as a result.BUT, I probably should hammer this home. This show is quite clearly not going for a deep dive into fantasy concepts and mythos. The very comfy energy stands in stark opposition. No, this is a different kind of isekai. One which probably has a name which I don\'t know of, but which I would define by the isekai\'d hero shirking their duties in favour of finding true freedom in their overwhelming power. The ability to set up a business somewhere and commit oneself to that enterprise. This is depicted as truly different to the tensions and stresses of the office work so commonly the cause of the deaths of our protagonists. It is much more iyashikei than a fantasy action/adventure. Though this has sort of wound down by the end of ""The Saint\'s..."" with her beginning to have to take part in her saintly duties, after being thoroughly exposed.I do think this show is worth the time of anyone who likes pretty boys, fantasy asesthetics and a little bit of isekai flair. If I had to choose, I would read the manga. But I also don\'t believe I would be able to sit through the anime if I had read the manga first.

I won't say anything more but I'm sure it's fairly obvious what it's about. Suffice to say it better get a season 2.To at least pretend at a review... :)This anime is nothing original, girl gets whisked away to a new world and slowly learns about her powers while being surrounded by a throng of ikemen. The usual.That said it is a nice love story, there's a few enjoyable ups  and  downs and generally speaking there's nothing really outstanding about it (maybe except the...MCs power, that's really pretty).Now, it's shallow enough in its character development that even the MC has moments where she's paper thin as does the main heartthrob, but honestly it's to be expected.For me most notable was the Great Mage and I think he totally deserves his own show...

But when two young women are pulled, our protagonist, office worker Sei, gets quickly pushed to the side...in favour of high schooler Aira. It\'s clear that this show wants to do things a bit differently, right from the start. As Sei adjusts to what initially seems like it should be a fairly quiet life, she uncovers her high potential for magic, and gets involved with various other characters. Again, nice and simple.And honestly, what\'s refreshing about it is that, for the most part, that\'s where it stays. While its action scenes (mostly later in the series) are competently done, where the show often shines is in the more slice-of-life elements. Seeing Sei\'s life and relationships grow as she ingrains herself into this world is a gentle but fun and enjoyable journey. This is especially true of the show\'s central romantic relationship, which manages to be simple yet effective, content to let itself be soppy and romantic, if a bit cheesy, leading to some really sweet scenes later on.It\'s not a remarkable show. The animation and artwork is very competent, I couldn\'t say anything particularly bad about it, but it\'s fairly conventional. The same can definitely be said for its soundtrack, which is a good but fairly standard RPG-esque affair.But, with it\'s unique, yet gentle, twist on the isekai genre, it manages to be a genuinely enjoyable watch, that makes very few slipups, and leaves plenty of room for later seasons, should they want to dig into the rest of the Light Novel series. If you\'re bursting with show\'s you\'re in the middle of, it\'s not a show you need to rush to watch, but if you\'re looking for a nice, fun, entertaining series, this is definitely a good choice. in favour of high schooler Aira.

I keep seeing points docked because there is not enough action, or not enough fights, or not enough plot. Please, please for the love of god read the tags for the show. It is a Slice of Life show as its main genre. Let me repeat, SLICE OF LIFE. Action is not even one of its tags for god sake. So if you want a slice of life that does not even have enough drama in it to give...it a drama tag, this does what you want. Gives you a story that is a slice of life with magic being the next big thing genre-wise. Romance is low for the show but is precedent and does pick up, but it picks off the way a slice of life show normally has it do, slowly. It is essentially a slow enjoyable show.

Who would have thought.If you are looking at this show and you just want to watch something that is slow and just enjoyable to watch, this is it. All I did was smile during the show and enjoyed the pacing. The only bad thing about it is that it ended kinda open. Don't get me wrong, the arc finishes but it does not give you full closure. That is more due to the lack of episodes they did and how the show would need probably a 24 season to cover the information needed to fully close the show out.

Though the manga was better.And I would have given this 7 or even an 8 but the one and only Prince Kyle Sultania (the Mr. Red Bullshit that needs death for redemption) totally destroyed this anime for me.Every single of the character from mc Sei,...ML Hawke or Yuri, Liz, Johan, Jude, Aira yada yada were quite wonderful people and i loved everyone of them but Kyle this bitch!! The moment I saw him, that scene were he disregards Sei and goes off with Aira, I hated him since then but let\'s just say he is the Mr.Spoiled Crown Prince who has no understanding of basic etiquette, i.e. to respect others.What pissed me off the most was episode 9, the fact that he behaved as the stubborn prince to save Aira!! And the fact that Liz, the King and his assistant/ butler were proud of him, BAH!!Super cliche, but alright, I\'m used to it. But Stupid Red, don\'t you know the words "" I\'m Sorry""!? There was absolutely no need for him to ""sacrifice"" himself like that, he just caused more pain and problems among the students, the fiancees and the factions and not to forget the public humiliation of Liz and Sei!That wanna-be hero attitude of his was so very annoying. It just proves he is stupid.If that\'s how you are going to solve problems your kingdom won\'t even be just a piece of land under your name in the future. It wasn\'t a great problem, just a simple one where simply by accepting your fault and letting Aira get along with others it could have been solved. No one would blame her and she has her talent in magic if she wants to help the Kingdom. But he had to be the source, the catalyst, the amplifier and the extinguisher (hardly though) of the problem; remove him and Viola! the problem vanishes, everyone is happy.IK this is more of me ranting how annoying the stupid prince is than a review for the anime. However, that\'s the only unbearable thing. Otherwise everything is good enough and I specially liked the innocence in the romance, the fluttering feelings, the second hand embarrassment, the slow and cute developments were very much to my liking specially since it\'s been a while with shojo romance.So yes it\'s worth the watch.

If we can enjoy a slow life show with mindless feasts of big anime tiddies, op mc, story and enemies that just serve as fodder ""for the PLOT"", why shouldn\'t girls get the corresponding gender-swapped equivalent too?If anything, the gender reversal vs other typical shows that at least I personally see for the first time makes it interesting enough to score a 6. Probably more if I were a girl ;)On that...topic, should MAL have a tag for that? ""Ikemensekai""? Or is ""shoujo""+""harem""+""isekai"" basically the same thing?

Both series were also broadcasted during the spring 2021 season, surprisingly enough.Here we have Sei, who is both the hero and the heroine of our story. This is essentially a saint isekai - Sei got into this new world as one of the legendary Saints who appear once in a generation or so. She basically takes the role of being the Jesus of this world - going around healing people and...performing miracles.This anime is labeled as Shoujo, but I would very much say that it\'s a Josei story. Because Sei is a mature woman in her late twenties and possibly her early thirties - we don\'t know her exact age, but we did get a hint during the series that she doesn\'t see herself as a ""young girl"" like the second girl who fell into this isekai from 2021 Japan, with her. There was a scene where Sei thought of what she could talk with the other girl about and she then thought to herself: ""what do I even have in common to talk about with a young girl?"". Meaning, that Sei\'s definitely not in her late teens nor early twenties. Also, she has a love interest in the new world, and their vibes definitely shout that it\'s a Josei romance, rather than a childish shoujo crush.On a personal note, it makes me wonder if the isekai genre suddenly got popular with mature women in Japan, or something. We\'ve also got Slime 300 in this season, after all, featuring a 27 year old woman falling into an isekai. I just think it\'s kinda funny that the focus is on this demographic and not teenage boys, in 2021. Not that I mind, because I\'m 28 myself. So, I find stories like that to be much more relatable anyways.I would also call it a Power Fantasy, as it is clear that no one can hope to surpass Sei in her role. She may not be much of a fighter, but her knowledge of herbs and ability to study and develop potions and magic, very much put her at a league of her own. performing miracles.This anime is labeled as Shoujo, but I would very much say that it\'s a Josei story.

I just think it\'s kinda funny that the focus is on this demographic and not teenage boys, in 2021. Not that I mind, because I\'m 28 myself. So, I find stories like that to be much more relatable anyways.I would also call it a Power Fantasy, as it is clear that no one can hope to surpass Sei in her role. She may not be much of a fighter, but her knowledge of herbs and ability to study and develop potions and magic, very much put her at a league of her own.', ""This was one of my favourite anime of the season!I love it when anime pack in a decent story while being super laid-back and chill, and that's exactly what this one did. Look, I get it. Isekai is done, dusted, overused, killed, burnt to ashes and resurrected all over again,but I'm amazed at the creativity that flows from the genre even now!This story follows a girl who's summoned to be a saint, but there are 2 summoned, and we don't really know which one is a saint. SO our hero just wants to find a job and adjust to the world. Realistic (as can be)...and down to earth. It's why I like it.i loved the art, especially when she uses magic, and there's SOMETHING about the way they present that love story which has ME squealing like a 14 year old, because it's just so dang cute!Also, I dunno why but there was some miserable animation in the last but one episode, but otherwise, calm anime, fun story and interesting characters. give it a go! and down to earth.

The animation is one of the highlights of this show, particularly within this genre. There are a surpirising amount of decent action scenes with a good amount of flash to them. The background are amazing in this anime, and the monsters look really neat as well. The character detail isn't high, but it is very clean and expresses more subtle facial emotions very well. The characters are not fantastic, but they are decent. There isn't a lot of backstory to the characters, but the main characters have a fair amount of emotional depth.

The casting is decent, but there really are not any standout performances either. There are some good performances, just not great. It's competent for a dub, just not great.

I feel like a lot of the reviewers who left disappointed didn\'t properly read the tags or understood what the series was trying to do.It\'s basically a slice of life in an anime world with an ""OP"" MC. It\'s not going to have plot twists, amazing writing, intricate villains, or insane action sequences.

The pacing was slow, which is expected from the story’s focus on slice of life.

But, lo and behold, this time it was very good, and even, surprise, original because here we have an anime that combines Isekai and Josei-type romance.In summary: In the fantastic world of this Isekai, the regions are semi-wild and humans live in cities that are constantly under pressure from monsters and an evil mist from the outside. Occasionally, a saint appears, who has the power to repel monsters and mist and bring many other blessings.Unfortunately, it's been a long time since a saint has appeared, and the country is in difficulty and decides to resort to a ritual to summon one. It's...our heroine, a young Japanese woman, who gets chosen along with another Japanese girl she doesn't know. Since the prince of the country expects only one saint, he chooses the young girl, and our heroine finds herself relegated to the status of a prestigious guest, but not too much, and ends up delving into herbology and potion-making.Of course, the situation will evolve, but I don't want to spoil, so I won't say more.The big strength of the anime is to set up a romance that will be the heart of the story. Unlike some Josei, the anime avoids the pitfall of the stagnant reverse harem, and here it's really focused on a single, very sweet romance. Another strength of the anime is that our heroine is of a certain age and is not a middle or high school student. And that's already quite rare in normal times, but in an Isekai/Romance, it's a bonus.And well, it was cute, the heroine is adorable, and everything is very well put together. It's not perfect-perfect either: it could have been longer, had a better soundtrack, been a bit more original in the universe, which is just another medieval fantasy world without much character. But it's already very good as it is. I recommend it. Oh, and even though I would be happy to have a Season 2, Season 1 is self-sufficient and doesn't end with unanswered questions or any cliffhanger. So you can go ahead and watch it with your eyes closed.For me, it's a solid 9/10. our heroine, a young Japanese woman, who gets chosen along with another Japanese girl she doesn't know.

This anime is bland as hell. This anime has a bad case of tell don\'t show. They skip along at an enormous pace, peppering the episodes with ""a few weeks later"" cards and giving us zero development. Every character is one dimensional and so boring.

Even the supposed antagonist is one dimensional and doesn\'t feel scary at all. I mean they essentially made the villain a mean high school kid. Pitting him against an adult woman who just very clearly outclasses him. There\'s basically zero suspense. The main character feels like she has very little agency of her own either.

Production quality is decent but low budget. Don't watch. It's a waste of your time. If you want to get more details keep reading.--No character development. What you see if what you get and what you see in episode 1 is what you see in episode 12 so 0 on any development for the MC at all. A potato has more growth than her as at least it would have grown instead of stay as static as a piece of cardboard or a pair of pants.In fact that's all the MC is is a pair of pants to step into...for wish fulfillment as she's so generic it's painful to watch so basically no personality and the same role as a pair of shoes for the target audience to fit themselves with. I've seen extremely generic harem anime protagonists with more personality than her and that's already such a low bar most of the time that it's just sad.The world itself is generic too so not much going for it except the decent production quality and the interesting side characters. The sad thing about the side characters is that the MC acts like a black hole just sucking everything and everyone around her into blandness so it's still painful to watch their interactions. I guess that's the best way to spot a Mary Sue so by definition that's what she is.I guess the only reason I really watched the whole thing was the side characters but by the end of the last episode I've felt I've wasted my time and was cheated as I thought there would be some plot, conflict or character development but I didn't get any of those things. Instead all three of those were busy being warped and sucked into the MC's gravity well of blandness. It has such wasted potential I bet an amateur fanfiction or a parody such as an abridged version would be better.4/10--If you want romance and fantasy I would highly recommend The Ancient Magus' Bride anime as it has top notch production, an interesting enough plot and a good MC to act as an audience surrogate.9/10If you want an interesting tale of a healer that finds himself using his gift in an interesting and clever way then read either the manga or light novel of The Wrong Way To Use Healing Magic.

I was four years old and i could still see the difference between this and cartoons. I recently found my old dusty vhs of this and introduced my kids to it. These are some truly beautiful stories.Witches, princesses, knights, monsters, goofy animals, spells, and swords. A little bit of everything, and each episode is a completely different tale. All based on the works of the brothers Grimm. This is from the 80s so dont expect cutting edge animation, but for its time, it does have pretty visuals and decent music.Some of these stories are familiar. The...ones that arent familiar, are so intriguing that it is surprising that movies havent been based on them. Yes these are fairy tales but they aren't as flowery as disney features. I do not exactly recommend that you buy this and watch it by yourself, but it is alot of fun for the family. ones that arent familiar, are so intriguing that it is surprising that movies havent been based on them.

Slayers Gorgeous,https://myanimelist.net/anime/867/Slayers_Gorgeous,"['I\'ve talked about JC Staff\'s\xa0Slayers franchise quite a bit. And by quite a bit, I mean thrice with reviews of The Motion Picture, Great & Return. For those of you who aren\'t familiar with it, it\'s a largely comedic fantasy tale about a powerful sorceress who stops rampaging monsters, grabs treasure wherever it glitters and claims victory over her foes. Along with a colourful cast of companions. So, is this film as good as the others we\'ve looked at?Story:So, we open with Lina and Naga sitting in a town square, enjoying some tacos, when everyone around them starts panicking and running indoors. They find out...why when an armoured girl appears with dragons. Lina fends her and her dragons off only to find out that her father rules the town and they\'re fighting over a raise in her allowance. That moment when you realise you suck as a parent. Naturally, both Lina and Naga are brought in on opposite sides for the promise of gold.The biggest weakness of this film is that it does hit some of the same beats as Great did. That on featured a father and son building golems for opposite lords in a dispute while Lina and Naga took opposite sides. To be fair, the reasons for parent and child fighting were different and the way their dynamic plays out is different, but the basic story lines are pretty similar. Another, more minor gripe is that the imagery accompanying the ending credits has a segment with Lina flipping a coin that\'s pretty close to the same as the scene that Great had in its.The strength this has is that the humour is at a very high level with most of the gags landing very effectively. This film also demonstrates the ability this franchise has to introduce a big threat and have a cool action sequence, but also add in a bunch of comedic elements during the fight that make it tonally fit perfectly. The reveal of the ultimate antagonist is also very cool.Characters:In terms of character, the strength of these films has consistently been Lina and Naga\'s dynamic. They\'re similar and distinct enough that you can both understand why they keep one another company and why they drive each other crazy. I can really buy them as friends. Hell, I\'d buy them as lovers of the ""old bickering couple variety"" if that had been the route they\'d taken. And their dynamic really shines in this film at the point where they\'re working in combination and you can see them communicate intentions without saying a word.The side characters also follow the same pattern as the ones in the last film. They aren\'t complex, but they\'re quirky enough for some good gags and to make them memorable.Art:JC Staff has consistently done a great job with the artwork in this franchise. It features some strong visual gags, well designed characters and some really good action sequences. My biggest complaint about the action sequences is that some of the scenes in them are a bit too clichéd. For instance, it has that scene where two opponents run at each other, it pauses for a moment and then you see the result.Sound:Hayashibara Megumi & Kawamura Maria are amazing as ever. The actors for the film exclusive characters give strong performances as well. You can\'t really fault Hikami Kyouko, Kamiya Akira, Takiguchi Junpei or anyone else in that regard. The music is pretty great. Hayashibara Megumi\'s ending song in this one is Raging Waves, which is fantastic.Ho-yay:There\'s still none to be had. Yeah, they could make Lina and Naga work as a couple, but there are no hints of that.Areas of Improvement:Vary the film plots more. I get that every writer has a ""thing"" but it\'s going to get a bit tired if we keep seeing parent/ child squabbles as a central plot element.Lose the action scene clichés. I\'m sorry, they just don\'t work all that well.A different ending gag. I get that they vary it slightly, but it\'s close enough to the same thing that it doesn\'t work all that well when you\'ve seen the film before it.Final Thoughts:This is a pretty great film and definitely worthy of the franchise. Ultimately, my complaints with it are more minor nitpicks than serious, enjoyment affecting problems. So, I\'m going to give it an 8/10. If this franchise is your thing, you\'ll enjoy this film. If it\'s not, at least look up the song Raging Waves by Hayashibara Megumi. why when an armoured girl appears with dragons.

Shinrei Tantei Yakumo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7662/Shinrei_Tantei_Yakumo,"['\'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo\' (\'Psychic Detective Yakumo\') is about Yakumo, an university student and private detective, who has a red left eye that lets him see ghosts and spirits.The premise and atmosphere of this show is very similar to \'Ghost Hunt\', just that the good guys have no offensive super powers, and the ghosts and spirits are directly harmless. The basic format of the show begins with Haruka asking Yakumo to investigate on a case, he takes a look at the scene, ask for help from allies (police detectives, journalist, priest etc), and puts the spirits at ease after a showdown. At the same time, there...is another parallel story of a group of villains watching Yakumo\'s move and plotting a evil scheme.The introduction was done very well, the characters seemed very interesting, but it seemed to be downhill from there instead of picking up in pace and intensity.One thing I liked about the story was that it focuses on human beings despite being a show about ghosts. Instead of senseless showcase of super powers, Yakumo and company actually trace back the problems like a real detective, and also focuses on the issue of discrimination he faces for being different. The problem was that none of the cases were particularly interesting nor memorable, and the showdowns are rather anticlimatic. Even the main and final case was severely underdeveloped, as we still don\'t know the reason ""red eyed man"" became a spirit, why he had the ghost-seeing red eyes, or his relationship with Yakumo and his mother other than the obvious. Painfully slow pacing certainly did not help.Of course, we\'re left with an open ending that explains nothing, and starved for another season.Yakumo was an interesting character though, with a complex and painful past that\'s gradually revealed to us as we follow the cases he was assigned by Haruka. I particularly liked how his antisocial personality was explained by his past and ghost-seeing eye that enabled him to see things others can\'t. Unfortunately, Haruka existed mostly to set up the case and an attempt to add a little romance to the story. Their chemistry was rather poor, and she rarely play any significant role in solving the cases or development of the protagonist. She was also portrayed as an extremely dumb girl just to demonstrate how smart Yakumo is compared to an ordinary person.Art style was very generic, but the backgrounds had a nice atmosphere. The characters seemed disturbingly flat though. I can\'t quite put my finger to why it is so, but if I had to guess, it was either awkward shading or lack of detail despite realistic design.The presentation was also very boring, standard still camera or slowly moving screens.BGM was rather good for this series. Sets the creepy mood well, and some sound really touching or melancholic. Unfortunately, the story was nowhere near engaging, and could not take advantage of the music. It also lacked variety, as if every scary scenes had the same song, one for touching scenes, and another mysterious theme.No complaints for voicing, everyone sound they should and performed average or better in my opinion.OP is rather original with the song that sets the mysterious mood for the show, ED was rather ordinary.I hate to use this word to describe a series, but there\'s no other way... dull. \'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo\' had a strong introduction and all the ingredients to make it a great show, but it just didn\'t live up to its potential.

There\'s no eye candy since action was very limited, the story lacked suspense despite being a mystery, and the presentation was boring.It turned out to be yet another bland forgettable mystery anime.', ""Shinrei Tantei Yakumo revolves around a strange college student with a cursed red left eye. Through his eye, Yakumo is able to see and communicate with spirits of the dead, helping them move on from their earthly dwelling.The events unfold in an episodic format familiar to detective series fans, giving STY the double effect of being easy to follow while having a tendency to be repetitive. Personally, though, I liked the format. Despite the mini-cases, the plot still followed the main conflict, which is big and complex and absolutely mind-boggling. Technically, the art is so-so, but the sound is fantastic. BGM is perfectly timed...and gives just the right feeling.I love this show for its complex plot, and its excellent script. (You know those cheesy lines you only get out of detective stories with psychological drama tendencies?) I hate it for what I feel is its lack of attention on character development, given we only ever hear about Yakumo's life and nobody else's. Oh yes, and the stories aren't scary at all.Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is recommended for lovers of old-style detective mysteries and ghost stories. Although there's admittedly less of the latter than the title implies.

He spends his spare time tricking kids out of their money with fake card tricks, or just sleeping about. But, once in a while, he'll take a spirit associated police case that has piqued his interest. But with his troubled family past and issues with humanity, will Yakumo ever be able to live a normal life?STORY: (9/10)While not an entirely original premise, they definitely utilized it to it's full potential,...much more effectively than many other similar shows. The story basically has everything a good anime needs: A complex main character with a troubled background, a helpful and insightful love interest, a devoted detective, and ghosts. Really, that's all they needed here, but they added even more into the mix to give it an added level of depth and enjoyability.Yakumo's disturbed background piqued my interest in him, and also apparently the interest of those around him. But the best part isn't when they discuss Yakumo, but when Yakumo discusses with the accused how he knows that they are guilty. With pounds of accurate speculation, Yakumo presents his inner monologue better than even Yagami Light of Death Note.He solves murders, abductions, and even poltergheist possesion, making for an interesting watch.ANIMATION: (9/10)What can I say, it suits the series. It's dark and forboding when it's supposed to be, and bright and happy when it's supposed to be. Also, although not littered with fight scenes, when they pop up in Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, it looks damn realistic. The character designs aren't the most original I've ever seen, but I suppose that look best suits their personalities.When it comes to animation, this show did it right.SOUND: (9/10)To be honest, the opening theme represents the show so well I was actually considering making this review simply a link to it on YouTube or something. The opening theme is truly fitting, and the ending just as much so. The voice acting was just as it should be to match the theme of the show, and the background noise/music was never out of place.Once again, a 2010 show did animation and sound well.CHARACTERS: (9.5/10)Although sometimes the main love interest (Haruka) can be absent minded occasionally, every other character plays their role perfectly.Both of Yakumo's parents are dead, and he has always been shunned or even beaten up due to his red left eye.Later you find out that Yakumo and Haruka's past goes back further then either of them thought, giving their relationship and added level of depth.What I absolutely love about their relationship though is that there is no stupid blushing, and the girl is simply trying to help the guy, which is a refreshing change of pace seeing as most anime series these days have the protagonist being an emotionally immature nitwit who freaks out at the sight of anything related to women.In this show, Yakumo doesn't express any feelings for her at all, and instead simply allows her to tag along, while she is trying to help him in dealing with his troubled past. It's obvious they are concerned about eachother and harbor feelings, but the best part is that it's successfully conveyed without either character being awkward or embarassed in any way.The supporting characters also offer comic relief and intel on future missions, as well as being occasionally super adorable(I just wanna give his deaf little cousin a hug for being so cute much more effectively than many other similar shows.

I spotted Psychic Detective and the cover art struck me. I read the synopsis and I had to admit that I thought it sounded a bit plain, but something was telling me to watch it. After a few weeks of procrastinating and reading comments from the watchers, I half-heartedly started the first episode. Needless to say, I only got as far as the opening that day (was very busy). But the opening was very unique. Still, I wasn't convinced.Finally, I pushed myself and watched the first episode. My first thought about the main characters...was that Haruka reminded me of the chick from Eureka 7 and the guy was the typical shoujo guy. A lot of the characters had the same names as the characters from Hakuouki, which was interesting.After I finished the first episode, I found myself watching the second, and the third, and so on. Now I honestly think I'm hooked.Needless to say, the story isn't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It doesn't have one focus plotline throughout the series, merely just a problem that they solve within the episode etc.There are some parts that I favored in the series. The part when Haruka is thrown into the river to drown and Yakumo doesn't hesitate to go after her. The part when Haruka stops Yakumo from throwing his mother's necklace into the river, and the scene where she finds him tied to the chair after being kidnapped by his father's accomplice and confesses to him, thinking he is dead. Those scene's seemed to hold the most emotion and character development for me. Even so, my inner masochist wanted them to torture Haruka in front of Yakumo to see his reaction because you can almost never tell what he is feeling, especially toward her.Overall, I give this anime an 8. :) was that Haruka reminded me of the chick from Eureka 7 and the guy was the typical shoujo guy.

Watching one episode makes you want to watch the next, and the next, and so on. Just when things seem predictable, it ends up twisting a smidge.

', ""Having seen 9 episodes I have finished the first story arc which was three episodes long, this last arc was in stark contrast to the usual single layered plots we've been getting throughout the series. I loved the first episode it really showed promise, after that the show pretty much established itself as mediocre, the scope of what it could have been is limitless though, the characters are likeable (if not a tad typical - but hey its hard to have completely original characters nowadays). Yakumo is a lazy, unapproachable uni student with an emo attitude - I think they're trying to turn him into...the male version of a tsundere. Haruka the female lead is pretty, full of life, and in love with Yakumo. Gotou is the series' typical detective, the type who wears the same clothes all day and doesn't seem efficient at first glance but he gets the job done - he often relies on yakumo's help to solve cases (as yakumo can see spirits). The art is wonderful, it gives the show a dark atmosphere in exactly the way it should. The art is probably the best thing about the show in my opinion.Series with episodic plots ARE NOT ALL BAD some have been EPIC look no further than bebop, darker than black s1, or katanagatari. For me yakumo is lacking the same flair those shows had, after the first episode I wasn't sucked in and during the melodramatic multiepisode arc I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat I  found myself not caring. I give this show 7/10 unless something good happens between now and when the show ends. Sadly this was a show with the makings of death note 2.0 but it is a chance that has been wasted by story writers not wanting to experiment with novel stories instead they are content with a supernatural version of CSI - think ghost whisperer or true calling - tried and tested formulas. the male version of a tsundere.

We can even communicate with one another. To be clear, I don’t have the power to purify or exorcise. I can only see them.” –Saitou YakumoThat quote completely describes the beauty of Yakumo’s power. Because of his cursed red eye, he can see the spirits of the dead. But he cannot touch them, purify them, or exorcise them. He can only speak to them. This is a cause for internal conflict for him, and what a heart-wrenching process that is.One of Shinrei Tantei Yakumo’s strong points is its story. It is not completely original, but it is appealing...and well-written. Everything in the plot is utilized to its full potential.

The set-up is slightly repetitive, but only slightly, and will be familiar to those who revel in the detective genre.The style of the art isn’t particularly ground-breaking, original, or gorgeous, but it’s well done.

She has strength, a big heart, and an adorable relationship with Yakumo. It’s apparent that she really wants to help him. Their relationship, though it doesn’t develop into anything huge, does grow in a really sweet, convincing way.Supporting characters are equally lovable, and though they aren’t developed as much, they have wonderful moments and are never just tossed to the side.Overall, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a good anime that is certainly worth a watch.

While some episodes were a bit to fast pased for me, some of the characters were not developed as much as I wanted and the art was not the best of quality, the show made all 12 episodes enjoyable, the art was, even though not of best quality, good enough to want to watch in HD, the sound/music was brilliant, the openings and closing themes and animations were brilliant and the cast of characters kept me interested in a story that was done well and was enjoyable.If you are put of this anime, because it is not that popular and doesnt have the hightest average score, please don't be as it is fantastic and you won't regret it and it is easily one of my favourite animes of all time."", ""This anime is surrounded by mystery that has a place in the supernatural world, but is also made pretty realistic. This made it very easy to picture myself in the situations.The only thing I missed in the story was a huge plot twist, because, even though there were some unexpected events, I wasn't put completely off track all at once. However, I did very much enjoy trying to solve the puzzles they're solving in this detective anime.Another thing I liked, was the art: it showed a lot of detail.One of the details, by example, is the pupils of Yakumo. If you closely you can see...a round pupil in his green eye, but the one is his red eye is more cat like, making it more inhuman.And this is probably the best thing in the whole anime: there was character development! Oh, do I love character development...That said, the combination of mystery with some supernatural, good art and character development made this a good anime.It is the kind of anime you can watch in a very short amount of time, really enjoy, but don't have to become all obsessed over, which is a nice thing, if you have too much too fangirl/fanboy about already in your life like me.In short, just go watch it. a round pupil in his green eye, but the one is his red eye is more cat like, making it more inhuman.And this is probably the best thing in the whole anime: there was character development!

I watched this to try and alleviate my boredem. The synopsis will not be typed here for obvious reasons. This is just my opinion and attitude towards this series.This series is suppose to be a horror but I have no recollection of being scared, nervous, alarmed or even startled while watching Psychic Detective Yakumo. The ghosts were more of a joke than terrifying really. They come off as people\'s shadows . Could you please just for the sake of this review try to scare someone you know by standing still and asking...them to look at your shadow whenever you have free time. The episodic structure of the show is a chance for this show to tell refreshing stories that improve on the previous episode, but it is the exact same formula over and over and over again. Girl asks psychic for help on a potential case, psychic insults girl, detective that the psychic helps and vice versa becomes involved in the case and the trio set off to solve the mystery. After a few episodes watching became more of a chore. There is no unpredictablity and the writing is just flat. How can I get rid of this ghost? Why don\'t I try the exact same method I used the previous week.The characters are complete strangers to the viewer with no real development. The only characters that I really cared for was detective Gotou and Isshhin Saito but they can\'t really save this series from being the exact oppisite the creators were trying to achieve. You will read about this in a lot of reviews but it\'s still a complaint from my side: The villian is a complete alien. You get that type of my kids should stay away from that guy whenever possible vibe but he does not live up to his full potetntial. His goals are never stated which means everytime the show cuts him you have to squeeze interest out of yourself to listen to something that may or may not have something to to do with the plot. If you hear what everybody calls him in the series you will realize exactly how uninteresting and stale this weirdo is. The romantic plot that that makes up alot of the show\'s ""story"" goes nowhere. I was really expecting something , anything. I have to listen to whining and arguing between two people I dont give a damn for for 13 episodes. Give me something,anything!The sound is run-of-the-mill voice acting with the exception of the most intersting characters Gotou and Isshhin. My cousin told me he realized that a lot of voice actors speak with a mono tones when they have to dub anime to english. This is the exact case with Yakumo. When he is supposedly shocked or sad yo just hear that mono tone (a lot like Edward\'s tone of voice from Twilight). The OP  is terrible. If you can classify under what type of music this falls under please let me know (I only listened to it for about 10 seconds).The ending theme was actually beautiful,it is that type of song you can understand without speaking the language it is performed in.The art was alright. It\'s not like Dragonball where everyone is drawn according to Asian sterotyping,you know that saying . These characters have looks that fit what liitle personality they have perfectly. The backgrounds are okay and the ghost are just ""meh"".The show was alright at the beginning but went to make my weekend feel a lot longer and declined after just 2 episodes. I have to admit I liked the ending, I\'m a sucker for stuff like that and because the experience was over.

Or in my case, it\'s a break from a long anime like KHR. If you liked Ghost Hunt, you\'d enjoy this too! The more I watch, the more I feel the similarities between GH and Shinrei Tantei Yakumo.Story:An anime adapted from a novel, again like GH. The idea isn\'t exactly original, but the storyline is. Because it\'s a short 13 ep season, some of the plots are quite fast-paced. Depending on personal preference, it may be too rushed for some, but it\'s just right that it doesn\'t bore or leave you behind in dust....There is a nice blend of supernatural and detective, with a tinge of romance in it. A word of warning though, if you\'re going for sappiness, you will be disappointed.Yes, there are plenty of unanswered questions and mystery, mostly regarding the Red-eyed man who\'s supposedly Yakumo\'s father. Though since the novel is still on-going, we can hope for possible second season (:Art:The art is really pleasant to the eye. Okay.. I\'m a fan of red-eyed bishies. That aside, I\'m not expecting huge, explosive reactions, but the lack of expression of the characters bothered me a little. The characters are also a tad too flat and stuck in the background.Sound:I loved the OST! In fact, I got it after the first episode. The song ""White Wing"" is one of my favourites.Character:Hm, they were all the usual characters you\'d find in similar animes; Yakumo\'s the cold, unsociable guy with a reason for acting as so; Haruka the friendly, cute girl who accepts Yakumo for who he is; Ishiin the understanding uncle who wish for Yakumo\'s happiness, Gotou the rough but really caring friend; Ishii the side-kick who\'s clumsy and a coward, who decided to face his fears for his friend.I still love the characters despite their typicality, because they do develop and grow along the way. And the seiyuus definitely did justice to them!!Although I cannot help but get reminded of L from Death Note and Naru from Ghost Hunt when I watch it. Yakumo reminds me too much of the both of them! His dressing and personality wise!Overall:7/10. It\'s definitely worth your time if you like animes from similar genres (: But you probably want to skip it if you hate endings with tons of unanswered questions.

It's had two manga adaptations, the second of which is still going. In 2010 it got an anime adaptation from Bee Train. Not long ago we looked at their work with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I've also looked at Murder Princess. So, they're two for two so far. Of course, this is the first thing I've reviewed from them where they weren't co-producing. Still, let's see if they can make it three for three and give me something good to close out the month.Story:Ozawa Haruka...has a problem. After she and some friends went inside a forbidden building, one has committed suicide and another is in hospital, possessed by spirits. Haruka seeks out the help of Saitou Yakumo, a supposedly psychic boy at her University. Yakumo agrees saying that he can see spirits and might be able to persuade them to leave her friend. Over the course of that investigation, Haruka discovers that Yakumo can, indeed, see ghosts and that his left eye is actually red. From there, the two keep finding themselves involved in more mysteries involving spirits. Meanwhile, a shadow is closing in on them that's intimately connected with Yakumo's past. Can the two of them stay alive and find the truth?Let's start by discussing the weaknesses of the series. In this case, the big one is the mysteries themselves. Most of them have answers that are made really obvious to the audience through the use of really unsubtle hints or, in some cases, by the series actively showing you who's responsible. Which just leaves you to see how the characters are going to figure them out and makes the investigation portions a bit lacklustre. There's also the romance betwixt Haruka and Yakumo. While it does have some good moments here and there, it's also pretty static. Haruka develops an obvious crush on Yakumo really quickly and then the two of them hang out a lot, in spite of his seeming disinterest. From there, it moves at a really slow pace. There are some hints that he also has feelings for her, especially towards the end, but nothing gets done with it and, ultimately, it comes across as more of an excuse to keep her in the story than a serious attempt at writing romance. There are a couple moments that are a bit nonsensical too. For example, there's a scene where Haruka is in a car and its driver can't move. Rather than climbing over him to hit the brake, she just settles for steering. There aren't many moments like that, but the ones they have are really head-scratching.Let's move on to the positive factors of the series. The first is that the world is built really well and there are defined rules for what ghosts can and can't do. It's not one of those vague things where it bends and shifts based on plot convenience. The series is paced really well and it is interesting to see how the characters solve the mysteries even if the audience has already been handed the answer. The series is also good about showing the plot elements that it's going to use in the climax early on while using those elements in a way that it feels very unique and is actually compelling. Tension is used  effectively in the series and its portrayals of sexual assault are respectfully done. They're told through description rather than actually shown but they have a lot of weight to them and they're actually relevant to the story instead of being thrown in.Characters:The characters are well written. They have a good level of complexity and they do come across as actual people. Crazy people, in some cases, but not in an exaggerated or forced way. There are some really compelling dynamics in the series as well both friendly and antagonistic. On the down side, I will say that the way that Detective Gotou's character ultimately develops is a bit contrived.Art:Taken as a whole, the character designs and animation are quite good. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well and the supernatural effects are visually interesting. The biggest fault with the artwork is that, like they did in Phantom, Bee Train mistakes putting their animation at an odd angle for intensity. Showing someone slanted diagonally isn't more intense nor does it make the scene more dynamic, it's just annoying.Sound:This series has a strong cast. Ono Daisuke gives a strong performance in the leading role. Fujimura Ayumi does well as Haruka. Takase Akimitsu makes quite a villain. Touchi Hiroki is good and, I really have to give credit to Koshimizu Ami, the voice of the young deaf girl, Nao. She does an amazing job conveying the thoughts and emotions of a character who communicates entirely in grunts without a single line of actual dialogue. I knew she was a good actress from hearing her performances as Claes in Gunslinger Girl, Alita in Murder Princess and Holo the wise wolf, but this was a really difficult role and she aces it beyond what I would have expected. The music isn't as strong as the cast. It's all right but nothing that really grabs you.Ho-yay:There isn't any. The closest it gets is that there's a period where Gotou thinks his partner, Ishii, might be romantically attracted to him. This causes things to be awkward for a while as Gotou freaks out. I can't fault the series for lack of realism, since there are plenty of blokes who freak out about the idea that another bloke might be into them, but it's a pretty stupid reaction. Just tell him you aren't interested if he confesses. Chances are very high that he'll understand and accept it. It's not like you have to give him a good long snog just because he expresses interest.Final Thoughts:Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a solid series. It certainly has some issues that detract from it, but in spite of those it has a compelling narrative, strong characters, a great cast and good artwork. Overall, I rate this one a 7/10. It is a good series. Next week, I'll take a look at the final instalment of the Kara no Kyoukai films. Have a happy Halloween in the interim. has a problem.

The storytellers pack quite a lot into those 13 episodes. The focus begins on the two main characters and deftly brings in other characters, expanding the viewers knowledge of their friends and family, while at the same time giving us a broader, more insightful, look into Yakumo and Haruka.The usual tropes are there, but there are reasons these tropes are used over and over again. When done right, they make for good story telling.Yakumo is the tragic, good looking hero who just needs the love...of a good heroine to put him on the path of righteousness and, of course, happiness.Haruka is the naive, heedless of her own beauty and charm, heart of gold, but courageous of spirit, young woman, who finds herself drawn into our hero’s world. Both hero and heroine are forever changed.Good overcomes evil, love overcomes hate, but what happens in between, and is told in the 13 episodes, is definitely worth watching.The story has a great buildup of seemingly unrelated cases that begin to intertwine and mesh into each other in unexpected and delightfully twisted ways. There are places where one does guess accurately what will happen but then the show will surprise you when you least expect it. Don’t be surprised if a gasp or two escapes you while watching.There are a few areas that I did find lacking, but certainly not enough to detract from the enjoyment I took in watching the series. I’m not certain if the intention was to do more than one season or not and they may have been planning to fill in or fix those areas at a later date.The villain, while suitably evil, was not a satisfying villain. They were more of a caricature of evil than something or someone to truly fear. The story, in my opinion, would have been better served if we had learned more about the motives and history of the villain—something to flesh them out, so to speak.The last episode was done well in that, if it was the last episode it would be fairly wrapped up with a few loose ends so that if a second season were coming they could build on it.Overall, I loved this series. If you like mystery, romance and a good story, you need to check this out. of a good heroine to put him on the path of righteousness and, of course, happiness.Haruka is the naive, heedless of her own beauty and charm, heart of gold, but courageous of spirit, young woman, who finds herself drawn into our hero’s world.

If you like mystery, romance and a good story, you need to check this out.', ""Review in Short:The beginning episodes are fantastic in terms of plot, very much like the movie The Sixth Sense in terms of investigating the circumstances surrounding each haunting. Very suspenseful, with well-though out 'cases.'However, towards the end the anime tries to unify all of the cases under a single plotline, which ends weakly and unresolved. The romance aspect of the anime seems to be completely jammed within the last 4-5 episodes, and detracts from the rest of the experience.Overall: Worth a watch if you're bored and have nothing else to do. "", ""Why is Yakumo's red eye creepy? Its just red.this anime has a good storyline. When i first started watching it, I felt this anime had potential. For example, Yakumo's dark past gives me a reason to watch it and I thought that he was cool.But after watching episodes after episodes, I was bored because of the CHARACTERS development. It's like the characters were emotionless.Yakumo: he is a swindler who sleeps all day and solves paranormal cases. Moreover, he never shows his emotion. He never explains the situation fully when a case is solved.Haruka: typical ordinary girl who brings cases to Yakumo. She is too ordinary...if you ask me.Gotou: a detective that is full of himself and could not solve a case without Yakumo. when he got missing, I actually felt good.Yuutarou: a coward.Nao: no impact on the story nor a purpose for being deft.Isshin: probably good if needed for Yakumo's background story.In my opinion better than the detective when handling a case.when a case is solved, they (yakumo and his gang) did not put any effort to show any slight feelings. Which makes it no real purpose than doing what they are told. if you ask me.Gotou: a detective that is full of himself and could not solve a case without Yakumo. when he got missing, I actually felt good.Yuutarou: a coward.Nao: no impact on the story nor a purpose for being deft.Isshin: probably good if needed for Yakumo's background story.In my opinion better than the detective when handling a case.when a case is solved, they (yakumo and his gang) did not put any effort to show any slight feelings.

You decide.Short Summary:The main heroine, Haruka Ozawa, experiences many unusual phenomena and reports it to Yakumo Saitou. They soon begin investigations together.

Slayers Return,https://myanimelist.net/anime/869/Slayers_Return,"[""Last August I took a look at Slayers Perfect. My final conclusion was that it was a fun little watch, albeit a bit rushed. Its final rating was a 7/10. This week I'm going to look at the second Slayers film, Slayers Return. There are actually five films in the franchise at this point, the last one of which came out in 2001. Is the second film an improvement over the first? Let's take a look and find out.The film furthers the misadventures of Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent. A young woman named Saleena finds them and requests their help to save her...village, which has been taken over and the villagers forced into labour unearthing some strange device. Lina agrees, much to Naga's surprise, when she hears the village's name and remembers tales of elven treasure. The humour in this is highly effective and enjoyable throughout. The story itself is much better paced than Perfect's. It does a good job of building up some suspense and the climax is both funny and interesting.The characters don't have much depth. That being said, they are very effective from a comedic standpoint. They're ridiculous, absurd, and quirky. They all have a lot of comedic potential and their interactions are really funny.The art is a lot better than it was in the first film. It's more like the actual series in that it looks like time and effort went into it as opposed to looking rushed. Its bright, vivid and the characters have interesting designs. The action scenes are really well executed and the backgrounds look nice.The vocal cast remains excellent. Hayashibara Megumi and Kawamura Maria, both amazing actresses, are joined by Hiramatsu Akiko, Ootsuka Akio and Utsumi Kenji, all of whom are masterful at their craft. The music is really splendid as well.The Ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There are a few moments where things between Lina and Naga look a bit homo-erotic, like Naga telling Lina to pay for her meals for the rest of their lives, but nothing substantial.That's Slayers Return. It is an improvement over the first film, with a lot of that film's problems being absent. It has a lot of really funny moments, the art is great, the voice acting and music are excellent. If you want a good comedy, check it out. My final rating is a 9/10.

Animated by J.C. Staff, it was released in August of 1996 and has a runtime of just about sixty minutes. Chronologically, it takes place sometime after the first movie, Slayers Perfect.The gist of the plot is that an evil organization called Zein is looking to obtain an artifact from a small village, Biaz. To that end they have enslaved the citizens of the village, and it’s up to Naga and Lina to save them – though of course Lina is mainly interested in fulfilling her own goals.Slayers Return...is a lot more enjoyable to watch than Slayers Perfect; it’s funnier, for one thing, and the character interactions are amusing to watch. There’s not much for character development – Lina, Naga, and the rest are pretty stagnant – but let’s face it, we watch Slayers for comedic moments and parody, and character growth is optional (though not completely unwanted). Thus, the lack of metamorphosis is not a bad thing at all.The scriptwriter is nothing to sneeze at; while Slayers Return takes place before the animated television series, and is pretty much a part of a series of episodes involving Naga and Lina’s adventures, it can absolutely be watched as a stand-alone work. It makes no references to either the previous movies or OVAs, or to the television show. That being said, there’s nothing wrong with being familiar with the characters beforehand, and honestly, it would probably bolster your enjoyment of the movie a lot.Technically speaking, the palettes used in Slayers Return are pretty dark. However, the animation is fairly fluid most of the time bar jitteriness during running scenes. Fight scenes themselves are pretty well-animated. There’s also a good amount of detail in many frames. Characters look just like themselves and the movie-only cast have pretty good designs.Soundwise, the movie is fairly average. The OST is all right, though not very memorable in my opinion. It does its job for the most part. I will say I did like Slayers Return's soundtrack more than Slayers Perfect's. The movie features a vocal track sung by Hayashibara Megumi and Kawamura Maria. It’s entitled Just Be Conscious and plays during the credits. It's a very enjoyable song to listen to and it's definitely the highlight of the soundtrack. It certainly bolsters up the sound rating.Overall, Slayers Return is a nice little standalone title that I certainly liked watching, and I’d recommend it to any Slayers fan. is a lot more enjoyable to watch than Slayers Perfect; it’s funnier, for one thing, and the character interactions are amusing to watch.

Her village has been enslaved by a bad guy hoping to unleash an elvish creature that will lead him to world domination. Naga and Lina, hoping to make some money, wind up doing battle against this creature in a pretty underwhelming and otherwise unnecessary sixty minute film.There’s really no point reiterating my thoughts on Naga and Lina, or the animation and music. There’s nothing that makes these films distinct in any way; neither from their predecessors nor from anime movies in general. This one...has a weak plot, boring side characters, uninteresting action, and can be summed up as: eh. It has an occasionally decent chuckle here or there but I don’t understand the appeal of these. First of all, they have nothing to do with the vastly superior television series. The TV series is well-balanced, with a cast of characters that work off of each other and a plot that allows for enough action and comedy to keep the viewer engaged. The movies and OVA’s, so far, have showcased a very different Slayers, one that isn’t so much a parody of fantasy as much as a stagnant fantasy/comedy of its own.A friend of mine put it best: the Slayers movies are filler. The problem is, filler is annoying in the context of an ongoing series (such as the Excalibur filler of Soul Eater) but even more annoying when it comprises an entire product (such as this, or the whole seasons of filler in Bleach).Return isn’t a bad movie; it’s just another average, unmemorable money grab. has a weak plot, boring side characters, uninteresting action, and can be summed up as: eh.

There were more characters this time and it brought back the self-aware humour that I liked so much in the show.Still absolutely no backstory to either Lina or Naga, though. This came out a year after the original show had ended and more than halfway into the second season. Perhaps they thought fans of the show at the time would watch the movie as well, but that just makes it dated and shallow.Further more it doesn't help that the hwole film is like 5 scenes max, just stretched out to fit the one hour checkmark. Again, sometimes that...works, sometimes it doesn't. Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublyof, for example (Why am I comparing Slayers to Andrei Tarkovsky?) can be summed up in only a few scenes and yet it manages to hold your attention for the entirety of the film. Same as Cassablanca, The Cube, Full Metal Jacket, Terminator 1, Breathless (the original from the 60s) John Carpenter's They Live; none of these movies have a huge variety of scenes like the big Hollywood stuff, they just have a few good ones and they make the most out of them. Yet the reason they're so memorable is becase each scene feels complete and adds to the film. There's very little of that in Slayers Return.Despite the shallow plot, it is a plot. It beats whatever toilet paper tier they wrote in the first movie by a mile and the animation is still very pretty. I loved how blalant the bad guy was this time around. Gotta feel for the guy. So far, of all the Slayers films my money's on this one, even if it's decent at best.Some interesting tension between Lina and Naga too. If it wasn't obvious before then it is now!The ending song was nice too; very 90s. works, sometimes it doesn't.

Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1081/Space_Pirate_Captain_Herlock__Outside_Legend_-_The_Endless_Odyssey,"['First of all. This is not an entry point into the series. If you want to get started on Captain Harlock then look elsewhere. Oh yeah. There was one other thing. Endless Odyssey is also shockingly bad. Most of the pieces are there. But they\'ve all been assembled incorrectly.Here\'s how I think the pitch meeting went down. In 2002 Madhouse presumably thought that anime fans wouldn\'t be interested in going back to watch a series that was over 20 years old at the time, if such a thing was even available to find at the time that is. I\'d say that was a correct assumption....Especially considering the negative attitude most current anime fans has against  pre-2000\'s shows. Instead this series is squarely aimed at people who had seen the original 1978 Captain Harlock series. Not a bad idea I suppose. Make a bit of money of some nostalgia. I\'m sure Leiji Matsumoto wouldn\'t mind some licencing money so he could buy a ship in a bottle or some hair extensions for his wife. So what could go wrong?I can only presume that whoever wrote this had never actually seen the original series. But instead had a drunken friend describe the show for him. Everything is explained to him in a series of half remembered plot points, vague explanations of the majority of the cast, a need to stress that manliness is one of the core aspects of the show and an extremely enthusiastic need to emphasize that Captain Harlock is a pretty cool guy. When the writer presses him for more information about Harlock and what makes him such a cool guy he had already passed out.Endless Odyssey would claim to be a sequel to the original show. The Mazone invasion and the ending is referenced. Despite this Tadashi is not a former crew member. His father Professor Daiba is still alive somehow too. So it\'s kind of a continuity snarl I guess. But that\'s not exactly a deal breaker.  On the surface everything looks like it checks out. A darker take on the original to reflect the fact that whoever caught the show when it originally aired was around their mid to late 20\'s when this came out. A pinch of horror atmosphere to go with that nostalgia. It\'s just a shame the plot is really dumb. The Earth is stolen(?!) by Cthulhu-esque horrors. None of that can faze Captain Harlock of course. He can just stare them down or whatever since he\'s such a cool guy. You\'re kind of pushing it here guys. The supernatural twist isn\'t really working.But hey. What would a captain be without his crew? Well. Unfortunately they get the short end of the stick. Because all of the lovably crew of the Arcadia are criminally mishandled and underused. They\'re used for cheap nostalgia moments or callbacks. When they show up for the first time you\'re supposed to go ""yaaaay!"" ( Ok maybe I did get a bit excited when Miime first showed up. ) and then? They do pretty much nothing. None of them have any impact on the plot at all. A great supporting cast just squandered. And before you ask. No, Captain Harlock isn\'t bringing his A-game to carry the show. At best he\'s on auto-pilot. At the very worst he\'s grossly mischaracterized perhaps to make him seem more ""cool"". You\'re not expected to follow orders? Yeah it\'s not like he\'s the captain of the ship or anything. Fuck off. Yeah he let the crew do what they want when they were off-duty in the original. But they were all expected to follow his orders when it was go-time. Get this personality-free body snatcher off my screen and bring back the real captain. Even the voice actor for him is totally wrong. Sorry. Makio Inoue is the definitive Harlock. Anyone else just sounds like a pale imitation.I will give Madhouse some credit though. The art is just wonderful. It is very faithful to the original work and lovingly rendered although with that modern shininess of course. The cast has never looked better though! Quirks of the original show such as the tall, slender women with long hair and the cartoonishly deformed small people are all accounted for. The Arcadia also looks great which is obviously of huge importance. I have no doubt that whoever drew this was a big fan. So I can only hope he never actually watched this. To match the ""darker"" tone and horror posturing the art is suitably dark. But good art can only get you so far. And for being an OVA the animation is nothing special. Pretty much just TV quality. Still I would call this show a visual treat. So it has something going for it.I will also give it credit for a kind of interesting ending. And a relatively understated sense of masculinity. A breath of fresh air in an era where manliness is relegated to a post-ironic and over the top sideshow in anime. Don\'t think I need to name any examples there. You know what I\'m talking about.If you want to get into Harlock I\'d suggest starting with the lavishly produced Arcadia Of My Youth movie and go from there.

Anyone else just sounds like a pale imitation.I will give Madhouse some credit though. The art is just wonderful. It is very faithful to the original work and lovingly rendered although with that modern shininess of course. The cast has never looked better though! Quirks of the original show such as the tall, slender women with long hair and the cartoonishly deformed small people are all accounted for. The Arcadia also looks great which is obviously of huge importance. I have no doubt that whoever drew this was a big fan. So I can only hope he never actually watched this. To match the ""darker"" tone and horror posturing the art is suitably dark. But good art can only get you so far. And for being an OVA the animation is nothing special. Pretty much just TV quality. Still I would call this show a visual treat. So it has something going for it.I will also give it credit for a kind of interesting ending. And a relatively understated sense of masculinity. A breath of fresh air in an era where manliness is relegated to a post-ironic and over the top sideshow in anime. Don\'t think I need to name any examples there. You know what I\'m talking about.If you want to get into Harlock I\'d suggest starting with the lavishly produced Arcadia Of My Youth movie and go from there. Endless Odyssey is for completionists only.', ""At some point, a show along the lines of Harlock has to come around. It doesn't shake anything up. It doesn't really do much new. Hell, it's the 90's sequel/reboot/alternate universe canon to a show that came out before Gundam. Even so, the elements of what make it great come from something more than something like originality. It even basically proves that just because the ideas presented have been in works that have come out before it, the compilation of such ideas, as well as amazing characters, atmosphere, and theming can allow even a remake like this to shine.The characters of Harlock are beautifully designed...with a semi-sloppy art style that flows well into the atmosphere of the show. It's a show about a universe where nothing new happens. All of the space pirates are gone. No new planets are being discovered. However, it's still a manly man's world with plenty out there, but everyone is in an eternal rut, until a scene of some old men in a bar decide to go pirating again in a scene beautifully directed in that the lights in the bar are stage lights that go on suddenly, and go out smoothly for whichever character is talking. It cut to Daiba, our main character, beating the crap out of two guys. Then his dad dies. Harlock appears out of nowhere with an ultimatum off manly destiny. He tells Daiba that real men hang out on space ships and explore doing what they want. Then, EARTH IS STOLEN!In the end, this is the best Harlock rendition yet. It's great. Watch it, whether you're a Harlock fan or not. with a semi-sloppy art style that flows well into the atmosphere of the show. It's a show about a universe where nothing new happens.

I am the same kind of strong silent and willful type with Nordic temper/character.This show loves and worships Herlock so much that it even makes most other characters about twice as short compare to him. Miime and Key are the only crew members of roughly the same size.So if you like Herlock you will enjoy this show overall. If not then you probably won't.Herlock is independent and unconventional hero who does what he wants and rejects all duty and obligations. He achieves great...things despite that.This time around story is actually rather psychological and philosophical even. This installment of Herlock saga tries to be as deep and profound as Revolutionary Girl Utena, SEL or Umineko. It even has some of the SEL vibe to it.Being deep and profound kind of works half of the time. Some good ideas are often mixed with some cliches of living like 'real men' and such. It is somewhat intellectually stimulating nevertheless. I would say it begins and ends rather poorly, but middle part is rather good.Art quality overall is rather good for 2002. However the show deliberately imitates old style art of the original Herlock of 1978, so many characters are in that deliberately retro style.Overall I can recommend this for everyone. It is probably more accessible for a modern anime fan than old original Herlock and also much shorter than it.

Didn’t see that coming! Is this really a kids show? wtf?” when some pretty dark things happened- However, most importantly, by the end I thought to myself “Wow, this is pretty fucking bad.”I honestly thought this show...was going to be pretty average at first (5 out of 10). Then I thought, “Oh wow! This is actually pretty good!” from 9 to 37-ish (7/10). However, towards the end the show started pulling both random and shitty plot twists out of its ass, and then shooting them at us like it’s a “shit machine-gun” (2/10)...TL;DR at the endStory:(4/10)The story mainly follows two cliche and initially overpowered main protagonists named “Rokuro” and “Benio” as they overcome many hard trials thereby growing stronger and closer together displaying mild romance. They’re prophesized to be the “twin stars” or two chosen exorcists that will get married, have a baby, and the baby will be the most powerful exorcist called the “miko” (basically something like a baby Jesus that will save the world from all of the evil kegare monsters). The evil kegare monsters are sealed in an alternate dimension called “megano”, where the exorcists must go to fight them. Almost all of the characters are slowly introduced with background stories that are supposed to be tragic, but their backgrounds came across as overly done to the point where it was kind of just stupid-silly after a while. The story emphasizes that Rokuro and Benio both want to get stronger... and they do... At a snail’s rate anyways, but no worries because they often get sudden power ups out of nowhere. Mm~ sudden power ups. My favorite… (sarcasm)The story really doesn’t have any depth, and it certainly isn’t realistic. For example, one of the main antagonists is basically just some psychotic kid with attachment issues. One thing that really pissed me off is that all of the villains kept saying phrases like:""I am all powerful! and you are weak!""“It is no use for you to try to win!”“Oh, but it was all part of my master plan!”“THIS TOO IS PART OF MY MASTER PLAN!”and then the shitty plot twist that I mentioned earlier would be another antagonist saying,“But your master plan was part of my SUPER master plan ALL ALONG! I have been using you, lesser antagonist, this whole time!”I often just sat in my chair, apathetic to all of the bullshit that the characters kept pulling out of their asses.I feel the story’s pace was much too slow, often dwelling much too long on the characterization and development of the twin stars. It wasn’t really exciting, so I didn’t feel like waiting to watch each new episode once a week. I actually ended up binge-watching once every four months. It had its ups and downs. It’s a pretty a pretty bad story overall. Towards the end, we randomly got hit with some pedophile plot twist shit, and I honestly don’t know what the hell to make of this anime anymore. It had its moments, but the story was actually pretty bad overall.Art:(5/10)The art in the fight scenes sometimes looks like it’s from a game where they pause and call out the name of their attack with an epic pose before actually doing it. Everything freezes when this happens, so it adds a certain ""style"" to the art.The art\'s okay overall, but I feel that the series would be more appealing if the characters weren\'t so... bright and cute...? Except there\'s one thing that gets to me every time... It\'s Rokuro... There are scenes when his art turns into something out of a horror movie.  The animation is not the best with many still-frames and lack of dramatic camera angles. The art\'s fine overall.Sound:(8/10)What can I say? They did a pretty good job on the sound. The OST is mainly dubstep, which threw me off at first, but I kind of like it now. The fighting works well, background music fits completely and enhances the setting. Openings and endings are also very fitting. It\'s actually relatively unique, but it\'s not special or powerful like something like something Yuki Kajiura or Sawano Hiroyuki would make. Only one OST was memorable for me until episode 27\'s opening theme. But now that I finished the anime, I actually occasionally catch myself thinking about their OSTs! (I guess 50 episodes of an anime will do that to you).Characters: (4/10)The characters were okay, at best. However, towards the end, they ended up having little to no real depth at all. In general, they’re  pretty much just average characters with nothing much special about them except for Rokuro\'s shark teeth (main male character). I initially hated both Rokuro and Benio, but, I actually started liking the main characters around episode 14/15 after they unnecessarily spent all of that time developing the twin stars. However, they\'re basically just kids with sad background stories tasked with saving the world from Kegare. Honestly, they probably could have made this series into about 24 episodes if they skipped the unnecessary development episodes.There are a lot of side characters with the potential to be interesting, but they all got little to no development. The dynamic between Benio and Rokuro is pretty nice to watch, but there\'s nothing too special here. Rokuro\'s starts off as kind of annoying, fiery, not that smart, and overpowered, but the enemies do get much stronger and Rokuro matures quite a bit and actually becomes a pretty cool character. Benio is the typical smart, cool, amazingly strong, but lonely character. She too grows as the series progresses.Enjoyment: (?/10)This show… is hard to describe in terms of enjoyment... At first, it was fun because it reminded me of a cool game (7/10). As it progressed, the initial excitement died down (5/10). It was very predictable up until a certain point, but things started becoming less predictable as it progressed (7/10). Some of the plot twists were cool, but the plot twists towards the end were just plain stupid (2/10).  In fact, I was legitimately shocked by how ridiculous and incoherent it started getting. It\'s definitely more suited to a younger less mature audience, but there are some aspects of the anime that are unexpectedly dark for a kids show. An older audience may still enjoy it because it\'s somewhat entertaining (maybe), although you probably won\'t be able to relate to it much as an older individual.TL;DROverall: (5/10)The story progressed too slowly, they took too long to develop the MCs, the characters were too cliche, but the anime wasn’t all that bad and actually had a decent amount of good moments. The show is bearable, but I wouldn’t recommend this anime to you unless you’ve already seen a bunch of the other top shounen out there. So basically, it was pretty bad and I think your time would be better spent elsewhere.“Do I recommend this to you personally?”Personally? Absolutely not. I could never wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone. It’s just something I watched to kill time.However, if you like exorcists and shounen anime, are younger than 16, and like slow stories, then maybe you should give it a shot someday.If you want realistic and mature characters, then no you should look elsewhere.In fact, you probably should just look elsewhere unless you’re out of anime to watch.I strongly recommend that you check out these other similar, but better exorcist/demon-related shounen anime first if you haven’t already:1.

It might seem at least a bit nice at first but, it quickly becomes a somewhat repetitive and uninteresting ride. However, the anime has a little special charm of its own and decently developed characters (at least, before the original arc). But, is that enough to call Sousei no Onmyouji a good anime?Story: 4/10The story of Sousei no Onmyouji, isn\'t something new or very original, as we have already seen lots of anime that center on certain people who possess a special...ability (Exorcists) and fight against supernatural enemies (Kegare) in order to protect the world. The problem is not that it uses an overused theme, the anime does have a little charm of its own but, it doesn\'t manage it in a way that will make it less cliché. Also, it doesn\'t give anything interesting enough to get hooked on and you just end up watching a story with almost no impact on you. The story had potential to be much better but, it depended on predictable shounen elements and was pretty much wasted.The romance between the two main characters shows a little progression after a few episodes and some of their interactions contribute to it. Although, there are others which are only supposed to be funny but, they end up meaningless and annoying. The humor of the show isn\'t that funny, most of the jokes fall flat and they even repeat some of them often. The random fan-service that they add from time to time, also, feels out of place and doesn\'t contribute to any aspect of the anime.Putting a filler arc after a major time-skip that would have contributed to the development of the main characters and their relationship, wasn\'t a good idea, either. At the end of episode 20, the main characters decide to live in a different place together for a couple of years in order to become stronger. So, you would expect them to become stronger, more developed as characters and their relationship to actually have progressed a little, right? Unfortunately, due to the arc following the time skip being an anime original, they probably didn\'t know how to handle the story and characters in a way that will actually make it obvious that two whole years have passed so, everything remained the same and the time-skip didn\'t even make any sense.Characters: 5/10At first, the characters seem as dull and insignificant as the story. Their personalities may still be kind of flat and boring but, their chemistry, interactions and development is what makes things better.The protagonist, Rokuro, seems to be a powerful character who doesn\'t want to return to being an Exorcist, because of a dramatic childhood experience. He is the kind of MC with not much depth, mostly cheerful but, kind of annoying, too, wants to always protect others and become stronger and his actions are all predictable.The main female character, Benio, also didn\'t use to have much to be described with. She was the cool and silent type of character and another powerful Exorcist but, after a few episodes, she showed us a friendlier and more sensitive side of her.The two main characters may receive development after a lot of episodes, but it happens in pretty much the same way all the time. Something bad happens, they think they are strong and they can face it, they fail, they get angry and cry, they get overpowered, they win. Then again the same thing from the beginning. It is a positive thing that they received character development but, the way it is done can end up repetitive and not very exciting.The chemistry between them has become better. They got to know and care about each other more, each of them wants to protect the other and they feel stronger when they fight together. Their more romantic interactions can sometimes be funny and cute and actually contribute to the development of their relationship but, there are times that they can be pretty meaningless and cliché.Unfortunately, despite all the development they managed to get, they remained completely the same after the time-skip, which makes you wonder if it was even necessary.The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, most of the characters are just there to fill their role and they receive little to no development, at all.Art/Animation: 5/10The art of Sousei no Onmyouji may not the best and most detailed out there, but it\'s quite satisfying. Although, personally, I\'m not really a fan of the art style and the bright colours, but that\'s a matter of opinion, and it may also be a good point of the anime, because it gives it a somewhat special touch. The biggest problem here is how terrible the animation is most of the time. Scenes that are often reused, the same movement patterns again and again, overusing images with no motion at all and generally, the show is poorly animated. It might be something that you can get used to quite easily, but it is kind of off-putting to watch action scenes without the impact that they should have.Fortunately, as more episodes come out, art and animation seem to become slightly better, although I wish they were at the level of the 2nd OP of the series, only this one was really well done when it comes to animation.Sound: 6/10There is not much to say here, as the first OP (""Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-"" by Wagakki Band) and ED (""Eyes"" by Hitomi Kaji) seem to be fine and the OST is decent enough, but they become uninteresting after a while. The second ED (""Yadoriboshi"" by Itowokashi) wasn\'t significant either, but the second OP (""Re:Call"" by i☆Ris) was actually quite good and the animation was the best they\'ve used so far. The third OP (""Sync"" by lol) is rather bland and the first part can feel a little out of place but, the third ED (""Hide and Seek"" by Girlfriend) is more lively and enjoyable than the other two.Enjoyment: 2/10I don\'t really think that Sousei no Onmyouji can offer much enjoyment, watching it ended up a chore after a few episodes and the original arc made everything worse.Sousei no Onmyouji has some cool classic shounen moments but, they are not extremely worth watching and there are other anime where they are done better. The humor isn\'t the strong point of the anime, as most of the jokes fall flat and it gets repetitive after a while. If you like romance in shounen anime, this one offers some but, don\'t expect too much.Overall: 4/10Sousei no Onmyouji falls into a category of anime with a theme which has been used many times by series greater and more amusing. There are many things that could be done about the story, characters and animation to become better but, it ended up as wasted potential. If you don\'t mind watching another average shounen anime with nothing much to offer to the genre, you can go ahead and give it a try. ability (Exorcists) and fight against supernatural enemies (Kegare) in order to protect the world. The problem is not that it uses an overused theme, the anime does have a little charm of its own but, it doesn\'t manage it in a way that will make it less cliché. Also, it doesn\'t give anything interesting enough to get hooked on and you just end up watching a story with almost no impact on you. The story had potential to be much better but, it depended on predictable shounen elements and was pretty much wasted.The romance between the two main characters shows a little progression after a few episodes and some of their interactions contribute to it. Although, there are others which are only supposed to be funny but, they end up meaningless and annoying. The humor of the show isn\'t that funny, most of the jokes fall flat and they even repeat some of them often. The random fan-service that they add from time to time, also, feels out of place and doesn\'t contribute to any aspect of the anime.Putting a filler arc after a major time-skip that would have contributed to the development of the main characters and their relationship, wasn\'t a good idea, either. At the end of episode 20, the main characters decide to live in a different place together for a couple of years in order to become stronger. So, you would expect them to become stronger, more developed as characters and their relationship to actually have progressed a little, right? Unfortunately, due to the arc following the time skip being an anime original, they probably didn\'t know how to handle the story and characters in a way that will actually make it obvious that two whole years have passed so, everything remained the same and the time-skip didn\'t even make any sense.Characters: 5/10At first, the characters seem as dull and insignificant as the story. Their personalities may still be kind of flat and boring but, their chemistry, interactions and development is what makes things better.The protagonist, Rokuro, seems to be a powerful character who doesn\'t want to return to being an Exorcist, because of a dramatic childhood experience. He is the kind of MC with not much depth, mostly cheerful but, kind of annoying, too, wants to always protect others and become stronger and his actions are all predictable.The main female character, Benio, also didn\'t use to have much to be described with. She was the cool and silent type of character and another powerful Exorcist but, after a few episodes, she showed us a friendlier and more sensitive side of her.The two main characters may receive development after a lot of episodes, but it happens in pretty much the same way all the time. Something bad happens, they think they are strong and they can face it, they fail, they get angry and cry, they get overpowered, they win. Then again the same thing from the beginning. It is a positive thing that they received character development but, the way it is done can end up repetitive and not very exciting.The chemistry between them has become better. They got to know and care about each other more, each of them wants to protect the other and they feel stronger when they fight together. Their more romantic interactions can sometimes be funny and cute and actually contribute to the development of their relationship but, there are times that they can be pretty meaningless and cliché.Unfortunately, despite all the development they managed to get, they remained completely the same after the time-skip, which makes you wonder if it was even necessary.The rest of the cast is rather forgettable, most of the characters are just there to fill their role and they receive little to no development, at all.Art/Animation: 5/10The art of Sousei no Onmyouji may not the best and most detailed out there, but it\'s quite satisfying. Although, personally, I\'m not really a fan of the art style and the bright colours, but that\'s a matter of opinion, and it may also be a good point of the anime, because it gives it a somewhat special touch. The biggest problem here is how terrible the animation is most of the time. Scenes that are often reused, the same movement patterns again and again, overusing images with no motion at all and generally, the show is poorly animated. It might be something that you can get used to quite easily, but it is kind of off-putting to watch action scenes without the impact that they should have.Fortunately, as more episodes come out, art and animation seem to become slightly better, although I wish they were at the level of the 2nd OP of the series, only this one was really well done when it comes to animation.Sound: 6/10There is not much to say here, as the first OP (""Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-"" by Wagakki Band) and ED (""Eyes"" by Hitomi Kaji) seem to be fine and the OST is decent enough, but they become uninteresting after a while. The second ED (""Yadoriboshi"" by Itowokashi) wasn\'t significant either, but the second OP (""Re:Call"" by i☆Ris) was actually quite good and the animation was the best they\'ve used so far. The third OP (""Sync"" by lol) is rather bland and the first part can feel a little out of place but, the third ED (""Hide and Seek"" by Girlfriend) is more lively and enjoyable than the other two.Enjoyment: 2/10I don\'t really think that Sousei no Onmyouji can offer much enjoyment, watching it ended up a chore after a few episodes and the original arc made everything worse.Sousei no Onmyouji has some cool classic shounen moments but, they are not extremely worth watching and there are other anime where they are done better. The humor isn\'t the strong point of the anime, as most of the jokes fall flat and it gets repetitive after a while. If you like romance in shounen anime, this one offers some but, don\'t expect too much.Overall: 4/10Sousei no Onmyouji falls into a category of anime with a theme which has been used many times by series greater and more amusing. There are many things that could be done about the story, characters and animation to become better but, it ended up as wasted potential. If you don\'t mind watching another average shounen anime with nothing much to offer to the genre, you can go ahead and give it a try.', 'The word \'adaptation\' for anime has quite a flexible definition.  Most often, the term \'adaptation\' means that the production company takes the source material and tries their best to make a carbon copy of the series that they decided to make in animated form.  But at the same time, the word \'adaptation\' can mean ""based on"" the original source material, and have their own anime-original plots and endings that contradict what the original series may have entailed.  Twinstar Exorcists, or Sousei no Omnyouji is an example of the latter.Story: The world we live in is a place that exists parallel...to its antithesis, a place known as Magano.  In it, the negative thoughts of humans merge together and form creatures of corruption and sin known as \'Kegare\'.  Kegare feed off of the spirtual power of humans and are destructive creatures that threaten the world we know.  In order to combat this, there are people known as Omnyouji with high spiritual power and battle the Kegare in a never-ending war to save humanity from their power.  To save humanity, the power of the Miko, a being born from the twinstar exorcists must be brought into the world.  Who are the twinstar exorcists?  Some shithead named Rokuro and an equally prissy girl named Benio.  Oh boy...Omnyouji\'s story is in short, arduous.  Spanning 50 episodes of content, what we\'re given as a plot is, in simple terms, a slew of shonen tropes that span from the power of friendship, all the way to wanting to save everybody, and sudden bursts of power because, plot convenience.  Despite being an adaptation of a relatively popular series, Omnyouji doesn\'t have much to offer.  It becomes painfully easy to see what comes our way, and a lot of what it is boils down to ham-handed philosophies of two opponents fighting each other with fists clenched while shouting each other\'s names.  Rinse and repeat that process over twenty times over, and you have what roughly equates to the entire show\'s runtime in a flash.The main attributer as to why the show is so devoid of any originality or interesting developments is because, rather than following what the manga had already mapped out for Perriot to adapt, the studio decided to take a different turn and by Episode 20, change the show\'s path down an anime original path that has no connection to its original source material at all.  This proved to be a very big contributor as to why the show has such big flaws with its story, as the saga we\'re introduced to turns the show into a display of power as our protagonists ""get stronger"" as more and more opponents get introduced for no other reason than to make the penultimate plot of ""The end of the world is coming"" a reality for the end so that the show would have some form of grand finale.Another problem comes with how I feel as though the show had too much time.  Most often than not, the case of screentime boils down to not having enough time for a series in order to tell the story that was intended.  Many episodes felt like throwaway episodes, as the show would squander its screentime with flashbacks that have already been shown many times over, recaps of what happened in the last ten or so episodes, or would have episodes solely devoted to talking just to fill up the twenty-four minutes that were allotted for the episode.  As such, episodes like this added to the weariness of how Omnyouji displayed itself, making the what was already tedious, even more tedious to watch.Omnyouji\'s problems arose when trying to milk what had already been drained dry.  The show doesn\'t try anything new in the realm of shonen anime, as the roughly twenty five hours it takes to watch this series can be described with just a tropes that almost every shonen anime uses in its plotline.  That, combined with how slow some of the episodes feel, and how predictable everything is, ultimately creates a tiring experience that isn\'t worth the time or effort to have.Overview:- All the shonen tropes- Predictable story- Many pointless episodes- Deviation from the source material did not workCharacters: Likewise, characters have the similar problem with being your run of the mill shonen tropes without what seems like little to no thought with how to make them interesting beyond what they\'re given.Both of our main characters, Enmado Rokuro and Adashino Benio start off the series hating each other\'s guts.  With the series intentionally pairing them up in order to bring the Miko into the world, it\'s no surprise by what the end result of the series becomes.  The pair of Omnyouji are as expected.  You have the reckless, brash boy who listens to no one and wants to get stronger with his own strength and his own merits, and you have the girl who doesn\'t like the boy (at the beginning) who also wants to get stronger and basically has the exact same goals that the boy does.  The character progression for the relationship between these two is noticeable and gradual, which is something that I believe that the show does well on.  However, as far as everything else is concerned, that\'s about where the positives end.  Their goals are nothing special, their progression is somewhat minimal, and the show makes it very hard for them to lose.  They may struggle, but everything turns out extremely ok at the end.  They\'re boring.  They\'re boring because the show doesn\'t even attempt to make their pains and struggles seem minimal when everything just comes to them so easily, and it becomes very hard to care for characters who despite everything, have plot armor so thick that not even someone who is virtually god can\'t break through it.As far as villains go, most if not all can be described as characters who have a single goal that serves as an obstacle that can easily be overcome once given enough episodes.  Become the best, take over the world, destroy humanity; all of these goals have been done over and over again in more interesting ways that have been displayed here.  It doesn\'t help that the villains spend more time talking than executing their evil plan, or hell, let the protagonist live when they could easily kill them, so they become minor hurdles that the characters have to jump over to continue on with the story.Side characters are a wide bunch that, like most long-running shonen series, are either the friends that the main protagonists are fighting for, and are the less than stellar characters of the same kind who will never amount to anything when compared to the feats that the main protagonists have achieved.  They\'re your standard group of side characters in a shonen series, and there\'re very few if any noteworthy characters to talk about since they\'re largely tropes like; the third wheel, the mentor, the annoying mascot, and rivals.Overview:+ Character development for the protagonists-  Entire cast feels like a giant soup of tropesArt: Perriot\'s art shines as an example of inconsistency and quality issues.  While normally the show has a lot of blunt and bright colors that are less than stellar in quality, the main problem with Omnyouji\'s art is how consistent the company is with making their scenes.When the show wants to, the lighting and the shadows can make the scene look good enough to actually look good.  However, when the show doesn\'t want to, the art looks like a mess of colors combined with clear flaws in the details when it comes to characters\' appearance.  Fight scenes in a supposedly action heavy series are mostly characters standing and talking about each of their side and philosophies while not mercilessly beating the crap out of each other.  A one-two punch, a lot of talking, some more punching, a lot more talking, and end the fight.  The fight scenes hardly have any \'fight\' in them, so they feel very disengaging and unexciting to watch.Overview:+ Can look good- Largely inconsistent- Minimalistic fight scenesSound: Omnyouji\'s soundtracks are not memorable.  Being roughly 4 cours long, the show has 4 pairs of OPs and EDs that help run the show\'s opening and ending bits to section off each of the four parts that the show\'s in.  Despite having watched all of the songs in full, none of the tracks stick out to me in my head as something that was both enjoyable or memorable.  So if you ask me, the tracks are not worth your time.Personal Enjoyment: It\'s been about a year since I started watching the first episode, and I honestly can\'t remember the reason why I even started it in the first place.  Coming out of it though, Omnyouji stands as a show that ultimately was a huge waste of time.  Nothing about it made me excited about watching the next episode, and slogging through episode after episode felt like a tiring excavation to find any glint of originality to make me interested in the series.  The shift from the source material certainly didn\'t help its case, as the random encounters with new anime-original villains didn\'t do anything but make the series even more difficult to like.Did I like this series?For me, there\'s nothing to like.  You can find better examples of everything this show did elsewhere.What didn\'t I like about this series?Though I\'m tempted to say \'everything\', the biggest problem I had was with Benio\'s shikigami, Kinako.  Kinako\'s high screechy voice shouting at the top of his lungs was like nails on a chalkboard.  He wasn\'t cute, was extremely annoying, and became a huge hindrance to the series because his constant shouting and attempts at \'helping\' had me in a tizzy on whether or not I should finish the show, or quit halfway.Would I recommend this anime?To me, Omnyouji is not worth it.  Reusing almost every shonen trope that exists, Omnyouji\'s adaptation has almost nothing original about it as its largely anime-original plot turns its 50 episode runtime into a bingo game to see if you can get a bingo from all of the tropes that they shove into the series.  Its lack of originality makes it a tiring experience to have, and I for one am thankful that it\'s over.  Because there is no way I\'m ever going to watch a 50 episode on-going series ever again. to its antithesis, a place known as Magano.

The relationship between the two main characters (Benio and Rokuro) is a gloriously refreshing spin on the commonly used trope...of arranged marriage, and Mayura is THE waifu.-Posted after watching episode 19. of arranged marriage, and Mayura is THE waifu.-Posted after watching episode 19.', 'So I see a lot of people give this show negative reviews, usually 4\'s, but let me tell you, it\'s worse than that.This show is literally the most generic thing ever. It has nothing going for it at all. The characters suck, the romance that\'s forced on the characters sucks and has no bearing on the series as a whole, the art sucks and the fights are boring, and the story is overdone to all hell. We get it, for no real reason, these two characters gotta make a baby.So the two main characters are a tsundere boy and a kuudere girl. Tsundere...boy has a tragic past and doesn\'t want to be an exorcist, but he\'s not good at anything else. At all. He\'s horrible at everything but he has the overpowered ability but they even managed to make that boring because he only really uses that one ability and it\'s just a punch. The kuudere girl is also overpowered, she\'s smart, she\'s cute and is better than the boy in every way. They try to give her a personality but the writers just make her do whatever to fit the scene, rather than have her character naturally react to what happens in the scene. Every other character is uninteresting or annoying, especially the girl\'s pet and the head exorcist guy.The art consists mainly of stills in fight scenes and there\'s nothing interesting about it. It\'s a very ""anime"" art style that people who don\'t know much about anime would imagine every show looks like. The colors are kinda interesting sometimes, but not that eye catching.The story is literally just, ""you two make a baby that will be ultra strong lol. But we don\'t wanna. WELL I\'LL MAKE YOU BY MAKING YOU DO STUPID STUFF THAT WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU LIKE EACHOTHER"" Anime like this where the story relies on romance, but for whatever reason the romance is actively avoided by the characters really annoy me. For the most part, the two main characters avoid the romance and don\'t even really talk about or even consider their ""destiny"". They both care about getting rid of the bad guys and protecting their friends, but they won\'t even consider just making a baby so they could permanently destroy the bad guys. It just doesn\'t make sense, it\'s not a human story and you can\'t relate to the characters at all.Overall, it\'s just painfully generic and boring. Nothing standout about this show, but it seems to be quite popular. Can\'t even say there was effort put into this because it\'s horribly cookie-cutter and generic. boy has a tragic past and doesn\'t want to be an exorcist, but he\'s not good at anything else.

It took them almost two years to realize the Naruto manga was over and they can stop doing anime fillers, and now they’re doing this show called Twin Star Exorcists (listed here as Sousei no Onmyouji), an anime that feels like it should’ve been released a good ten years ago. Main character has a rowdy side of his otherwise...casual personality that comes with a tragic backstory, and he wants to be the best at whatever; main heroine is actually good at whatever, pretty attractive but not fanservice-y, hates the MC for whatever reason but you know they’re gonna fuck someday anyway, and they have to fight some stuff. Lots of fighting. Yippee.“Oh boy, this guy’s another elitist who just complains about shows by comparing it to other anime!” Nah, I’m okay with shows being similar; in fact, some of the frontrunners that aired alongside this show are pretty basic and I love them a lot, but they have their reasons for being watchable. Sousei doesn’t do a lot to differentiate itself from the tropes it uses; most of its appeal as an action is merely weighted on its gimmicky combat, which incorporates traditional Japanese elements a bit.- TRADITIONAL JAPENESE ELEMENTS - *poof*HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAThat’s every fucking fight. Someone will say an attack, then time will stop so the name of the attack can appear on the screen and the person can yell. Does it look cool? Yes. But just because it looks cool doesn’t mean it’s necessary, so after about two instances it gets pretty damn irritating and makes me feel like I’m being looked down upon.Actually, Sousei just seems to look down on its viewers in general. A lot. One of several things is that whenever someone reflects upon something, a terrible-looking flashback will be shown of that event or quote, even if it happened five minutes prior. Even worse is that a character was made exclusively for the anime, whose only purpose is to suck the heroine’s dick. EVERYTHING that’s said by this Victini-looking motherfucker is just to make play up how badass Benio is so that maybe you’ll like her more. “HEY, IMP! (?) YOUR USELESS ASS IS HOLDING BACK BENIO’S AMAZING TALENT!!!” This isn’t complicated writing, Pierrot. Mommy says I’m a big boy now, so I can understand basic human emotions all by my alone.If you actually want to know what the story’s about and don’t want to read the synopsis or other “objective” reviewers, it’s about our world if it had a bunch of creepy, weirdo interdimensional things called ‘karaage’, which… do… bad things. To people. Come to think of it, I don’t remember getting a good explanation of these things. Except that they’re bad. Are they bad? I guess they’re bad… They look creepy so they must be bad. And then people who aren’t bad perform exorcisms on them; in other words they do action-y stuff in special costumes and use magic with talismen.- TALISMEN - *poof*AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHThat also has something to do with it, I guess.The real kick of this story is that the two main characters are being forced to get married, hook up, and have a kid together. Twin Star Exorcists? More like Twin Star SEXorcists!!! AHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAnyway, they need to breed because somehow their kid will inevitably become the Hokag--ehsorry the Miko or whatever. Which is like the best exorcist ever. This kills the karaage. I appreciate that Sousei doesn’t beat around the bush with these two, you know they’re gonna hook up by the end anyway, but now that fanfiction-generating quirk has actual weight to the story. And instead of having the two fuck like wild rabbits, they have a typical but effective dichotomy between liking and hating each other. I’ll admit that I don’t like Rokuro much, but Benio’s cool, and more importantly they have a weird chemistry that makes their relationship fun sometimes.“Don’t forget about their complicated backstories!”Yeah… I won’t talk about how corny that is. You can probably find the basics of it on 4chan’s “write an anime plot” threads.The backstory and villainous reveal could actually considered to be a good part of the series, as it adds a lot of drama and really darkens the story even if it wasn’t all that cheery to begin with, but it plays out in such a typical and over-the-top way that I started to laugh at it instead. But, to be knocked down means you come back stronger, right? So after a grim reveal and crushing defeat comes… an awkward couple of episodes of the two kids “training” by “bonding” together through some weird exercises. Oh.Since the romance is what makes Shipping no Onmyouji possibly stand out in the crowd, they should make it count, right? …Eh. One, the characters aren’t that interesting to begin with. Two, a lot of it is just… awkward. Much of it is forced--no, literally, it’s forced by other characters because they want them to fuck immediately so they can have a kid and so the kid can save everyone, and so Benio and Rokuro get thrown into some strange shenanigans that force them to cooperate. Oh boy, I really feel the love in the air! I think putting the two in a nice villa was a good move, but everything else just seemed excessive and annoying. Little of it is about Rokuro and Benio growing as people and getting attached to each other, it’s about them reluctantly playing a shitty game by one of their bosses. I guess down the line this could evolve into a good romance, but I think thirteen episodes is a bit too long of a wait for what should be a major draw to this series.Last thing I’ll mention before moving on, but there’s a lot of filler in this anime, as could be expected from a fifty-episode series by Pierrot. A lot of episodes have some sort of nonsense going on between Rokuro and Benio, and to make it seem important somehow, the firefox fuckwit mascot character will make an incredibly irritating scream about karaage showing up, so a little bit of action will happen. There’s slow pacing, and in the case of Sousei, there’s just general dicking around.Alright, now the art. This has potential, I’ll give it that. If this show was brought down to even two cours, this would probably look pretty great. But unfortunately, Pierrot doesn’t want to spend all eighty-nine quadrillionteen yen they made off Osomatsu-san to make the whole product look good. Therefore, faces often look janky and off-model at even the slightest of distances, and what little animation Sousei has is pretty weak. The actual character designs look good, though, with some rather beautiful eyes (to the animator guy saying that eyes take too long to draw nowadays, sorry) and good clothing. Rokuro has some weird shark teeth, but I think it’s okay given his character and design.Stylistically, it’s interesting. The action takes place in another dimension, a very desolate and apocalyptic-looking dimension with a lot of red shading and outlines. The karaage are incredibly off-putting, weird, shadowy monsters that occupy it; altogether it brings about an interesting setting. Unfortunately, the setting is all it can be: a setting, so it doesn’t make the actual fights look great, which is a shame because I quite like the idea of using magic with talismen and shit.Less ideally, all the flashbacks seem to have been filmed from an iPhone; the aspect ratio becomes more vertical and looks super awkward, and they fill the empty spaces on the sides with some distracting, scratchy graphics. What’s with this weird design? If this was trying to be original, that doesn’t mean it was a good idea either way. And since this is your average shounen, get ready for 25% of the episode to be composed of flashbacks.The one notable thing about the sound is the hellish, creepy “voices” of the karaage. It’s fucking bizarre and I love it. Other than that, everything here’s another mixed bag of mediocre. The OP is by Wagakki Band, another interesting gimmick J-rock band that combines hard rock with traditional Japanese elements.- TRADITIONAL JAPANEoh i did this meme already.Anyway, if you’re into Japanese music these days, you’ve probably heard of their song, Senbonzakura, which blends these styles really well. Valkyrie, the Sousei OP, is a different story; the song itself sounds decent, but if you took out the traditional instruments then you wouldn’t have much of a difference. Thematically, it’s still a good choice for the show, I guess. The actual OST should’ve taken some notes with Wagakki Band’s ideas by blending traditional and modern sounds; instead it just sounds modern with some shitty electronic music playing in the back of the fights and some softer piano tunes wherever else.Would I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? Based off of this first cour, I wouldn’t. There are some good ideas, but nothing’s really getting done here, and saying “it gets better later” doesn’t really prove a point. In the six+ hours it’ll take for Sousei to “get better” you could… read the manga, which people have apologetically claimed to be a much better experience, and given the amount of filler here I can see that.Would I recommend Sousei no Onmyouji? ...More like NOsei!!! 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oStory - 3/10Art - 4/10Sound - 3/10Character - 4/10Enjoyment - 2/10Shipping - eh/10Overall - 3/10Favorite character - BenioFavorite episode - 13 until they did that stupid fusion attackRecommendation level - Low casual personality that comes with a tragic backstory, and he wants to be the best at whatever; main heroine is actually good at whatever, pretty attractive but not fanservice-y, hates the MC for whatever reason but you know they’re gonna fuck someday anyway, and they have to fight some stuff.

It is annoying the fact that they aren't made to sound a little more immature and kiddie.Now the bad:-Most of the story seems to be filler.-They added too many original characters and moved in characters shown later in the series much earlier as...well.-They keep on showing the names of the attacks which added to some of the many spaces in the series just seem to add a few minutes to each episode, and it happening in 12 episodes, it's like they added a whole episode of wasted space (and not counting filler plot).-They focused a lot on stuff that didn't need too much focus and rushed through many of the important points and there were tons of needless filler adventure that didn't seem necessary to the story.-The characters don't actually seem as interesting in this as in the manga. The manga was actually MORE fast paced than the anime (which is strange).-Also, I disliked how they showed a lot more focus on the childhood friend's crush on the MC, it was kinda a down turn. In the manga, she was implied to have feelings, but it wasn't directly shown.All-in-all:The story feels pretty dragged out, it isn't that great of an adaption with needless filler and gaps and adding characters that were obvious mascots (which wouldn't be much of a problem if they made it more important to the story, and also made the story more interesting).Only the art and good music were able to make me not completely abandon this.The story and characters were poor, and the enjoyment was made even worse because I kept on comparing it to the original source.I cannot recommend this anime to people.

It could just be the site I was using to stream, but there would be times when the voices wouldn't match up with the character's lips moving. Since this was only available in Sub, it wasn't a huge deal for me, but it is still annoying to know about.Overall I LOVED this anime, and can't wait for season 2!  Oh, one little thing though. If you think they're gonna kiss, then you best hold your breath a bit longer. It took them a long time to have their first kiss, and there may have been a huge battle going on behind them.

It just added to the sweetness of their first kiss IMO.10/10 Would recommend.10/10 Will watch again.-JNutt22"", 'FAST REVIEW BASED ON 10 EPISODES:Sousei no Onmyouji, it starts in a slow pace, but try to give it a chance; it\'s a decent anime.Everything at the beginning it\'s very stereotypical, ""loud guy with potential to do great things"", if you like shonen genre, you\'re going to like this one.I gave it a chance and actually SURPRISED me after a few episodes!Art: 9.0 - Everything is beautiful, colorful at the ""Normal world"" and creepy at the ""Demon world"", it makes a really good contrast.

This anime is amazing. The plot twisted so much it probably would have looked like a towel being wrung out if you could see a plot. Threw me an almost infinite number loops. Main characters have absolutely amazing backstories. The antagonist is so ridiculously cruel that I wish he was real so we could drop a nuke on him. (And for somebody who doesn't even exist to get me this riled up is a feat in itself.) The art is glorious. The sound is flawless, and the one mistake I could find was so miniscule that it couldn't detract from the...overall score I gave it if it wanted to.

Hunred was slightly more understandable but THIS? Not TSE!!!! This was my anime of choice...before i started watching Re: Zero. So allow me to be a diamond in the rough, a review for those of you looking at the 3s and 4s overall in the other reviews and saying ""is this anime really that shitty?"" well I can assure you that it is not. Allow me to explain.The three main genre for...this anime are Action, Shounen, and Romance (even though MAL doesn\'t even list it as a romance). These will be analyzed at the end. Now for the other stuff.Story (9/10):A lot of people might think it is your typical shounen anime. Main character has a rough past, hates his power, girl comes, changes his mind, now he\'s a total badass. Well this both is and is not exactly what I described. Are those the main components of the story? Well...yeah. But the anime just pulls of this typical shounen story so well.Rokuro had a legitimate reason to never want to fight again. He was scarred at such a young age, and I honestly felt for him. Then this girl comes along, who is not like our typical strong female in a shounen anime who is basically like ""Go main hero! Fight! Save the day! You are amazing!"" Nah, Benio-sama don\'t play that shit. Benio-sama gonna fuck shit up and if you wanna join just do not get in her way.Anyway, the story is pulled of really well so far, and there have been some plot twists that I shamefully did not see coming. Lumping this in with all other shounen anime would be a mistake, 9/10.Art (8/10):Unless something about art or sound really stands out, do not expect anything other than an 8 out of me. I do not give a flying shit about art or sound. Doesn\'t make my eyes hurt, 8/10.Sound (8/10):Same concept. Good voice actors/actresses for what it matters. The little rat dude that Benio has can get annoying, but he shuts up pretty quick. But seriously if you care so much about sound go watch the Sound of Music or something. Bleh, 8/10.Characters (10/10):Oooohhhh boyyyy, probably a really controversial rating. But I honestly love the characters in this anime. Rokuro and Benio fulfill there teenage pseudo-lovestruck roles extremely well and make the anime extremely funny at times.The head exorcist guy (although super sketchy, like seriously he\'s up to something) is interesting and moves their relationship further which is always good.Rokuro\'s other friend with the bountiful feast of melons is your typical osananaj-Fuck it-childhood friend, who is cute and sweet and cares about Rokuro so much, she\'s adorable and a great addition to the love triangle.Honestly the only slight flaw so far is that the anime has introduced some characters then just kind of not done anything with them. But with more episodes that would change, sooooooo I can\'t fault them for that yet.Overall the characters are entertaining and fun to watch, 10/10.Enjoyment (10/10):Every week I cannot wait to watch TSE. It\'s one of those anime that makes you want to write a review about it when shithea-oops, I mean respectable MAL reviewers who are allowed to have their own opinions- don\'t give it the credit it deserves. It\'s funny, serious at times, and the romance has been good so far.Overall (9/10):Time to break it down by genre:Romance:The kids are supposed to be in like 9th grade, so obviously they are inexperienced and shy and adorable. The love triangle between Rokuro, Benio, and Melons is actually pretty legit. Benio is clearly the favorite so far and I think Melons sees her as a legitimate threat to her being with Rokuro, which makes her act even more adorable and ah, it\'s just so good. And the blushes from Rokuro and Benio, staples of every romance anime, just amazing.Score: 9/10Composition: 40% (meaning I think the anime is about 40% romance(Shounen:Yeah...it\'s pretty damn shounen. But in a really good way. Rokuro is not so overpowered right away that he can one-punch everything (though he can one-punch a lot).

Both of the shows ARE FULL OF FILLERS. The only episodes where they actually follow the manga are the first two and the rest aren't even canon. It's not even good filler and I'm pretty sure the whole show will be like this.The show focuses too much on trying to improve the relationship between the main characters, and turns it into a trashy teenage romcom instead of focusing on the action and shonen parts. The manga doesn't even do this and yet the studio manage to make 10+ episodes of this. I am quite sure that if they did follow the manga then it will be more enjoyable than what you just watched.TLDR : Watch 2 episodes of the show and if you're somewhat interested then read the manga. the studio does not follow the manga at all.

A satisfying experience for supernatural and fantasy anime lovers along with the scent of romance. Unlike traditional stories in which the main role will be the strongest of all or will become the strongest and destroy all evil, this story has a more practical approach.Interesting story line with nice phase modulations to clear the stress with romance and comedy. If you are the type who likes the slow romance in which the characters gradually fall in love unlike sudden movie like romance you will like this.The screenplay keeps the possibility of guessing ‘what will happen next’ to a minimum.

Give your titles to a studio worthy of them. My issues with this anime stem from the very idea that it has no loyalty to the source material.

If that's the case read the manga..."", 'TL;DR: At the moment I recommend watching the first 20 episodes that were adapted from the source material, then dropping it for the manga or your next show for non-manga fanboy related reasons.I\'m not going to lie, I\'m a little butt hurt about this one. The first 20 episodes were at least an 8 in my book. One of the better Shounen anime I\'ve seen in a little while. I couldn\'t understand why it had such sub-par reviews. At first I thought it was another World Trigger in the sense that it would take some time to warm up to it, but never get...the chance to really shine because of a lack of support. Twin Star Exorcists is in a different boat.I\'m not a die hard manga fan, at all. As a matter of fact, I hardly read any manga,  but I\'ve watched enough anime to tell when a show has diverged from source material. There is usually a significant drop in progression, consistency, and intrigue involving the plot and characters. This makes it hard to rate overall, and I may wind up adjusting this review after I finish, admittedly forcibly, watching the last half of what appears to be an imminent train wreck.Now the first 20 episodes weren\'t perfect or transcendent by any means. The community has every right to expect high quality content and admonish the not so high quality content, but I believe people expecting every show with the slightest bit of promise to turn in to the next Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood have their heads up there arses. I\'m nowhere near that picky, and if my defense of World Trigger has yet to clue you in, I am also an uncultured swine who is easily entertained. Sorry, not sorry.I like the cheesy anime tropes and running gags, even those that have been beaten with a stick repeatedly. Yes, those. Character obsessed with a certain food, mascot character, fan service character, hard-ass character that\'s really a softy, and I\'m probably omitting a few in this series that have also been used ad nauseum. These might be deal breakers to some of you, but they are staples of the Shounen genre in my opinion.I love the gritty side to the story. The deaths, the pain, the suffering are all well presented. I\'m a sucker for that sympathetic shock value, and cheap plot twist producing deus ex machina, so much so that I can forgive occasional sub-par writing such as a horribly sudden and forced ""This must be a power of the twin stars"" in place of quality progression.I liked the dub-steppish BGM, wasn\'t crazy about the intros and endings despite the fact some of the sounds remind me of some bands I like. Even though it\'s sung by a female the one intro feels kind of like a cross between Taking Back Sunday and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. To me at least.The animation is okay in my book. Nothing breathtaking, but nothing detrimental as well.I\'m not a big fan of Benio\'s Seiyuu at times. Her voice gets on my nerves occasionally, but it was of a diminutive impact to me. Her character took me a little bit to warm up to and that may have contributed. Rokuro\'s voice really makes both the comedy and the serious parts work. You got a love-to-hate antagonist and a hard-to-hate-despite-being-a-total-bastard antagonist whom are both excellent \'bad guys\'.But everything that made this a good watch has disappeared post-haste as of episode 21. I expected a time skip but I didn\'t expect them to diverge almost completely from the ongoing plot. Instead it\'s some monster of the week bull shit leading up to a non-canon filler ending. My least favorite of which was a blatant Don Flamingo rip off art-wise. It is seriously like some video game shit. They just rendered him different colors. Its ridiculous that a group of employed individuals thought that was a good idea. Crazier yet, that idea was financed and came to fruition! That\'s almost as bad as doing a filler arc(s) longer than the canon arc. Naruto didn\'t even try that shit! Well they may have, they just didn\'t actually do it. Much like Log Horizon season 2, the series is beginning to feel like a dead waste of time. It\'s not terrible, for filler at least, it\'s just such an obvious downgrade of everything it already had going for it.It\'s such a shame that so few series ever get adapted start to finish or accurately. *Sigh* Here\'s hoping this is a lesson learned for the anime industry.

This makes it hard to rate overall, and I may wind up adjusting this review after I finish, admittedly forcibly, watching the last half of what appears to be an imminent train wreck.Now the first 20 episodes weren\'t perfect or transcendent by any means. The community has every right to expect high quality content and admonish the not so high quality content, but I believe people expecting every show with the slightest bit of promise to turn in to the next Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood have their heads up there arses. I\'m nowhere near that picky, and if my defense of World Trigger has yet to clue you in, I am also an uncultured swine who is easily entertained. Sorry, not sorry.I like the cheesy anime tropes and running gags, even those that have been beaten with a stick repeatedly. Yes, those. Character obsessed with a certain food, mascot character, fan service character, hard-ass character that\'s really a softy, and I\'m probably omitting a few in this series that have also been used ad nauseum. These might be deal breakers to some of you, but they are staples of the Shounen genre in my opinion.I love the gritty side to the story. The deaths, the pain, the suffering are all well presented. I\'m a sucker for that sympathetic shock value, and cheap plot twist producing deus ex machina, so much so that I can forgive occasional sub-par writing such as a horribly sudden and forced ""This must be a power of the twin stars"" in place of quality progression.I liked the dub-steppish BGM, wasn\'t crazy about the intros and endings despite the fact some of the sounds remind me of some bands I like. Even though it\'s sung by a female the one intro feels kind of like a cross between Taking Back Sunday and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. To me at least.The animation is okay in my book. Nothing breathtaking, but nothing detrimental as well.I\'m not a big fan of Benio\'s Seiyuu at times. Her voice gets on my nerves occasionally, but it was of a diminutive impact to me. Her character took me a little bit to warm up to and that may have contributed. Rokuro\'s voice really makes both the comedy and the serious parts work. You got a love-to-hate antagonist and a hard-to-hate-despite-being-a-total-bastard antagonist whom are both excellent \'bad guys\'.But everything that made this a good watch has disappeared post-haste as of episode 21. I expected a time skip but I didn\'t expect them to diverge almost completely from the ongoing plot. Instead it\'s some monster of the week bull shit leading up to a non-canon filler ending. My least favorite of which was a blatant Don Flamingo rip off art-wise. It is seriously like some video game shit. They just rendered him different colors. Its ridiculous that a group of employed individuals thought that was a good idea. Crazier yet, that idea was financed and came to fruition! That\'s almost as bad as doing a filler arc(s) longer than the canon arc. Naruto didn\'t even try that shit! Well they may have, they just didn\'t actually do it. Much like Log Horizon season 2, the series is beginning to feel like a dead waste of time. It\'s not terrible, for filler at least, it\'s just such an obvious downgrade of everything it already had going for it.It\'s such a shame that so few series ever get adapted start to finish or accurately. *Sigh* Here\'s hoping this is a lesson learned for the anime industry. I won\'t hold my breath.', 'I promise the spoilers will be trivial and won\'t reveal the big ""plots""Right. This anime... had a stupid amount of potential to be one of the best animes out there but at the end I\'m just sitting here going... typical. Nothing stood out. And this pretty much sums up the review but ofcourse, details and reasoning, now\'s the time to stop reading if you don\'t want to be spoilt at all but as mentioned, they\'ll be trivial.So the story revolves around 2 protagonists who are exorcists, 14 year old kids with a terrible past and the same goal. Prophesied to be the ""twin...stars"" who are expected to marry and give birth to ""miko"" who\'ll save the world.  Its not unique, for sure, but has potential.Story: (a 7/10 but because of the ending plot, 5.5/10)Since I did promise a minimal spoiler review, all I can say is that the pacing was rather moronic, it was fairly slow, character development was present but lacked any depth whatsoever and mainly revolved around the two protagonists, the supporting characters were introduced in a magnificent manner and there were moments I went ""Woah"" that guy is cool and in the end you don\'t care much about them since they barely had any focus and you don\'t connect to them they way you\'d want to since ofcourse the focus was only on the two characters. Excessive use of flashbacks to attempt to relate to characters. Timeskip had little to no effect on anyone apart from one of the protagonists becoming a bit more disciplined. Apart from that the protagonists have no development in battle and its frustrating to watch this where they are gaining strength at such a stupid slow pace, even after the timeskip they use the same attacks, sure a couple of new ones here and there and stronger versions of their previous attacks.. but urm, their strength was comparable to running with a needle to fight a war, the thing is, they win, being protagonists ofc, their powerspikes, while temperorary come out of nowhere, there\'s little explanation and its bogus leaving you with a disappointed feeling even tho\' the battle itself was amazing. why? Plot. armor.Tl;Dr: They focused only on a handful of characters and the story revolved around them, several plot holes, predictable plot twists and a rather disappointing ending plot made this feel like a let down.Art (excluding battle scenes, 8/10) Including battles: 6/10The art was marvellous, vivid colours, well designed characters, and oh my, the sceneries in this anime were pure eye candy, except when the battle starts, the characters call out their attack, the anime pauses the fight to display the words of the attack the character is carrying out in a ""stylish manner"" its gonna be a hit or miss thing, but apart from that man this anime looked pretty as hell.Sound: (based on music alone: 8/10) based on how they used it? 5/10Dubstep... I initially didn\'t know what to think of it but damn it got your heart pumping in action scenes, the problem however is when sad scenes were shown, the music didn\'t match up to it, its not very obvious but easily noticeable.Character: 6/10Shallow. Very shallow. Protagonists had their characters developed with a focus on romance, making the romantic aspect develop quite a bit, apart from that? Hm, Rokuro (the male protagonist) has some development after timeskip. Supporting characters had some focus from time to time but developed little compared to what was possible. Expecially the strongest of the exorcist faction.Antagonists: They only existed because they were needed. I felt a severe lack of any beliefs or goals on this side. Making the fights seem pointless, it only revolved around one party trying to destroy the world, for no reason. Another party trying to save it. At the end you have an amazing antagonist but man the way they dealt with it was disappointing and naive and made no sense.Enjoyment: 7/10I had nothing better to do, I finished watching this in 3 days. It was interesting in some aspects, especially the middle but it seriously falls off in the end.Overall: 6.5/10I\'d only recommend this if you have nothing better to do or you only want to watch this with your logical side turned off.

But then there were also many things I enjoyed about the anime with encouraged me to give it a high rating anyway. Skip to the bottom for a TL;DR. Warning: I will try to avoid spoilers but there may be some very minor/vague ones throughout.First off, I\'m not really a fan of long shows unless I start partway in an watch as they air, and this show I didn\'t find until after it was over. The pacing was so poor in some parts that I actually started falling asleep during some episodes, which I...never do while watching anime no matter how tired I am. I still don\'t know what happened to two or three characters because I slept through their episodes and didn\'t want to rewatch them. But on the other hand, the long story was good because it gave the show more of a chance to flesh out Rokuro and Benio\'s relationship. But that long time to flesh hit out also meant that their relationship developed very slowly. Every time something is about to happen to advance their relationship, something comes up last second and the actual event that was about to happen is delayed like 5 episodes because they\'re too busy getting their asses kicked.Speaking of getting their asses kicked, another thing that really bothered me was how throughout the whole show their goal was to get stronger but they seemed to get weaker. They started out powerful enough to be able to kill kegare in one hit, but then to create obstacles for them, super powerful enemies started getting thrown in and by halfway through the show, legitimately every fight scene would consist of them continually getting beaten up (or attacking the enemy but doing no damage) until they ran away to form a new strategy, or pulled a random, absurd, never before mentioned ability out of nowhere and won through some deus ex machina bs. Pulling random abilities out of no where kind of reminds me of SAO.Speaking of things reminding SAO, this show is full of every shounen/fantasy/romance anime cliche you can think of. There is an entire arc that near perfectly mirrors SAO\'s Yui arc. At least this one actually made me care for the little girl instead of finding her annoying.There is actually a lot more I hate about the show which I can continue to rant about, but as you can see from the rating I gave it, my goal with this review is to convince you to watch the show, not drive you away, so now I will turn to the things about the show that I enjoyed.First and foremost, as a closeted hopeless romantic, the thing that won me over the most about this show was the romance. After calling this show a romance twice you must be thinking rn like, ""hey, LAPX, MAL doesn\'t label this show as a romance, tf are you talking about?"" Yes, the show isn\'t really a romance anime, calling this a romance would be like calling Romeo & Juliet a romance (a lot of people don\'t realize R&J is a tragedy, not a romance). I just like to think of it as a romance because love and emotions do play a very important role in the story, especially towards the end. It\'s kind of similar to SAO\'s romance, only the show isn\'t 75+% trash (I know I did give that impression though in the first half of the review lol). The relationships between the characters and their feelings for each other actually seemed believable (or as believable as you can get in a show about two middle school kids being forced to live together for over 2 years) and they changed as the show went on (even the relationships between background characters)Second thing I liked was the ending. The story for the ending may have been a little meh (especially with the deus ex machina crap I mentioned earlier) but it was executed well. There was a good balance between seriousness and comedy and it was easy to jump between the moods as needed (as opposed to all the other fight scenes which were either all serious, all comedy, or an awkward combo) and I really felt invested in the climax, despite it being very cliche and sort of meh story wise. But then again, it some of the comedic moments could\'ve been just an awkwardly written scene that I mistook as a joke, but I\'m gonna stick with it being on purpose, because I was laughing my head off while still being worried if the heroes would win or not.The show has many, many things wrong with it, and the quality was like a roller coaster, but there were also many good parts that were good enough to stick with it and still recommend the show to others.TL;DRThe show has many cliche tropes and falls flat in many vital areas, but it picked up well enough in other places were as long as you\'re NOT the kind of viewer who drops out as soon as things get dull, you will enjoy it never do while watching anime no matter how tired I am.

Cannot wait for another idea like this one soon!Story 9 - It had Great Story was a little slow for action at first but stories start as slowArt 9 - the art was magnificentSound 10 - the music like techno and dubstep with the fighting scenes were epicCharacter 8 - there were a few characters i wished had more screenplay but great nonethelessEnjoyment 9 - Enjoyed every episode because anime is always enjoyableOverall 9 - my overall rating was a 9 because of the few characters i wish had more story to them but if they did it would've been a 10. This anime had a lot of heartfelt moments and that's what life is all about!!"", ""After watching first 20 to 25 episodes, you may think that this anime is good. That it has certain pattern which is very basic and done so many times but nevertheless the delevopment in the story is rapid.However, do not raise your expectations. This anime is very very average.I observed following signs of medeocrity and/or bad quality:* Characters are dense in terms of romance* Very average action although very loud.* Miserable attempt to serve exposition as dialogue* Kiss in the last episode* In a single episode, characters are interrupted twice when confessing (or equivalent) in a HANABI like style* There is cringey SAO like papa-mama...arc* Each episode features some kegare which is superstrong or unprecedented.* At some point 7-8 basaras are introduced which begs the question why don't they team up and defeat the 12 guardians. Many such questions appear as one watches this anime. There are very obvious plot holes and plot armours.I will recommend to not watch this show it you have something else in your PTW list. arc* Each episode features some kegare which is superstrong or unprecedented.* At some point 7-8 basaras are introduced which begs the question why don't they team up and defeat the 12 guardians.

It may get updated later as the episodes come out! Unless I drop it by then...I just want to start out by saying this: this anime is not bad, just nothing special!With that said, this is the perfect anime for people who haven\'t watched much anime, especially within the action/romance genre. It\'s a pretty good gateway into it, but if you\'ve seen ANY standard action/romance anime you\'ve seen this anime.Story/character: I decided to put these two together since I feel the same way about them: they\'re cliche and pretty boring. It doesn\'t try to do anything unique...and stands by a checklist of everything that makes a standard action anime. It doesn\'t step out of that safe box, and that\'s disappointing. Not bad, just nothing more than cliche. Rokuro is a standard delinquent MC who is seriously way too overpowered, Benio is the ""badass"" way to proud girl who is supposed to be strong, but the moment MC arrives she is suddenly always being saved just so she can stare in awe and say ""he\'s so strong"", and the rest of the characters are just typical action tropes. Oh, and all Benio and Rokuro do is bicker, even after touching moments. It get\'s old really fast.*Feel free to skip the rest of this section since it\'s basically me just pointing out everything wrong with this anime\'s animal sicekick and comparing it to a good one from this season*The only character that stands out from the rest is Kinako, the animal sidekick of this show. This mention is not because he\'s a good character, but because he ruins all the enjoyment I try to get out of this anime. Everything about him, from his design to his voice and personality is so annoying. Now, let\'s compare him to the animal sidekick I find to be the best this season: Chito-san from Flying Witch. She\'s proud and intelligent, but takes it easy. She loves pranking others and going on adventures and is generally a very fun character. She cares for her owner and they fit each other well, filling up each others shortcomings, and even though Chito doesn\'t talk the owner understands her. Through no words we can clearly see that they care dearly about each other. Kinako is rude, loud and his only purpose is butting in and ruining moments, and yelling OH NO when a monster is nearby. His affection for Benio is ruined by the fact that they fit so poorly together and instead of showing he cares he just yells exposition and rude comments. You could remove him from the anime and it would be a lot better. Sorry for this little rant, but I just had to get it out since he is really ruining the few things I like about this anime.Art: The animation on the fight scenes, at least in the beginning, are pretty good. They show style and makes the fight more intense. The characters often stop to yell the name of the attack, pretty standard, but then time ""stops"" and these cool and stylish Japanese characters splat onto the screen as if it was a video game. I like that! Later on these fight scenes become way more standard, just like the rest of the show. Most of the character designs are also pretty meh. It\'s pretty much the safest designs you could have.Sound: Though the OST is pretty generic and doesn\'t stand out, the opening by Wakkagi Band is pretty kick-ass at times. It fits the style this anime is trying to go for, and though it\'s failing, this opening stays pretty cool. The ending theme is nothing too special, but it\'s pretty okay at least.Enjoyment: I\'m honestly getting bored. During episode 9 I could literally guess everything that was going to happen based on the anime I\'ve seen from before. Kinako is also taking a lot away from my enjoyment. Since this anime is so predictable and safe, it\'s hard to take seriously. Even when the anime is trying to be intense, all I end up doing is guessing what will happen next and more than often I\'m correct. It\'s just boring.Overall: I guess what I\'m saying is: haven\'t seen any anime like this before? Watch it, you\'ll like it! Other than that, it\'s a snorefest for people who have seen this recipe before. It only works as pure entertainment, like dangling keys in front of a baby.

I will say that the story line should've been thought over a lot more though since this had a lot of potential to be like a kill la kill type anime.Art: 6The art is quite visually pleasing despite being an older anime. The animations weren't the best however as an example: Benio talks without her...mouth opening like 2 times I believe. Small mistakes that should've been gone over before airing. Other than that, the art was pretty decently made but I still think it could've been better if more time and effort were put into it.Sound: 6The soundtracks were typical but fit in. I wish that they had added more variety in the background songs however because sometimes it felt like the music didn't fit in. Again like the art, it's decent but could've been a lot betterCharacter: 8Now I honestly would've put a 6 if I were harsher, but thinking about the characters they were all quite unique. The 12 guardians were unique and each very different. Of course because of so many characters you would think it could be hectic, but to be very honest it wasn't. The only downside of having so many characters is introducing them made them feel repetitive. The mc's stories were different and felt like Yin and Yang (tiny little spoiler joke). I didn't quite like the mc Roku but he's a unique character all in all.Enjoyment: 8I was quite hooked on this anime despite its flaws and ups/downs. The story wasn't that well thought out but it was enough to get your interest. I wanted to finish this anime ever since I started it.Overall: 8Now I may get some smack for giving this high of a rating, but I admit. This anime was quite bad but also good at the same time. If this had a better team making this anime I'm sure this would be a lot better of an anime, however the way that the mc's and side characters always had a role and eventually winning in the end  felt like a very well made ending.

First and foremost, the character designs themselves are nice to look at and the colors surrounding them are great. There are a few weird design choices that were made, and some of them work to the benefit of the show while others are more of a distraction. An example of something good: Seigen’s dark circles under his eyes show that he really struggles to sleep at night. But Rokuro’s teeth are more like a...row of shark teeth than human teeth really just gets distracting, because that trait is unique to him. There is a weird change in art style whenever they encounter a Kegare, the art of that beast looks to be more “brushed” than drawn. The main character themselves are really quite interesting. Rokuro is an exorcist that shows a lot of spunk and a whole lot of passion when it comes to the people he cares about. Benio on the other had is cold and distant, really only focusing on her own ambitions.Music/Sound: The music throughout the show is actually pretty good. The battle scenes feel intense and the calm moments are a breather in between the action. The opening track really showcases the show in a way that is enjoyable to watch and nice to listen too. The music that we find in battle scenes specifically is really put together to pull you into the fight as well. The sounds that occur at times are a little distracting, for example when the characters say a certain spell that they want to use, it will appear in Kanji on the screen along with some stinger sounds and then an accompanying scream from Rokuro or Benio. While I am not against this, it made the show feel much older than it was, but then again I am pretty sure it is common for Shounen manga to do this, so an adaptation would really be faithful to the source material.Story: Rokuro lives in a world and with people who are known as Exorcists. These Exorcists purify monsters (Kegare) that terrorize a parallel world known as Magano. Because of a traumatic past experience Rokuro has no interest in being an exorcist and does his best to avoid the life at all costs. But suddenly when he is saving someone from a Kegare attack; he meets a girl, Benio, who is working hard to become the strongest exorcists in the world. As the two are barely getting to know each other an oracle from the Twelve Guardians (the twelve strongest exorcists ever known) proclaims the pair the Twin Star Exorcists, aka the two destined to marry and birth the strongest exorcist the world has ever seen. The two spend time learning what it means to fight as a pair and how to burst through problems that come along the way including Benio’s family, enemies from Rokuro’s past, and the strongest Kegare that they’ve ever encountered called a Basara.Personal Reflection: So I was a little skeptical when I chose to start watching this show earlier this year, but I have to say that it does not disappoint. This show has gotten me to feel a lot of things, including; joy, excitement, fear, terror, pity, and even sadness (for an enemy!). I fell that this is one of those shows where you don’t really anticipate much because it sounds like it is going to be just another “underdog takes the world” which those shows are plentiful and popular, but it is so much more than that. The funny dynamic between two socially awkward teens who are told that because they have been prophesied to be the two most powerful exorcists, they have to get married and conceive a child–This really through me through a loop. While I have found a plot hole here or there, the show really has a great base and I am excited to see where they continue to go with it. Being this is only a mid-series review; I have seen only 25 of the 50 episodes that are supposed to be a part of the series. So if you enjoy action, spells, prophesy, monsters, and a classic Shounen feel, catch up on Sousei no Onmyouji!Overall Rating: 7.6/10 row of shark teeth than human teeth really just gets distracting, because that trait is unique to him.

So if you enjoy action, spells, prophesy, monsters, and a classic Shounen feel, catch up on Sousei no Onmyouji!Overall Rating: 7.6/10', 'IntroTwin stars’ exorcist or its official name Sousei no Onmyouji is based off the popular manga of the same name and is a direct adaption of it. At 50 episodes, long this is one of the longer animes that I have seen recently as most animes these days are not as long as they used to be. So far, the longest running animes that I seen since I started watching animes have been at 366 episodes long and Fairy tail to which the number is probably higher but I have yet to finish that one.  At 50 episodes, long Twin suns is around...just over two full seasons of 24 episodes each.Twin star’s exorcist is an action/fantasy anime with some supernatural elements thrown into the mix as well and in this is actually quite similar to the likes of Bleach. As a result of this along with the setting and the characters was one of the reasons that drew me to watch it.Story and settingThe main story for Twin star’s exorcists revolves around the adventures of its two main characters Rokuro Enmado and Benio Adashino who are both exorcists whose main job is to protect the world from monsters called Kagare that exist in a parallel world called Magano and exist only to feed on people. To better understand the story a little background information will be needed here. The story for Twin Stars exorcist takes place in modern day Japan much like the age that we currently live in. In this world exists a parallel world where exists monsters called Kagare that are caused and created by the negative emotions and feelings that humans experience and let out in their daily lives. The existence of Magano is a fact that is known to the general population but they themselves do not have the power to deal with it and instead this duty falls to the exorcist union an organisation formed since ages past to fight the Kagare and keep the war from spilling out into the real world. And the main force of this union is the exorcists themselves who are specially trained personal that have been taught how to use various spells and talismans to which they summon weapons and Armour to use against the Kagare and protect the people.Twin stars’ exorcists main plot line tells the story of two talented exorcists Rokuro and Benio who through an ancient prophesy are destined to meet and marry and them create a child that will become the miko the reincarnation of the founder of the exorcist’s union Abe no seimei who would end the war between the exorcists and the Kagare that had been raging for thousands of years. The development of the bond and relationship that the two develop as they get to know each other as the series goes on forms one of the main elements of the story.Twin star’s exorcist draws heavily upon the traditional duties of an exorcist which is to exorcise evil spirits and merges this with the fantasy spells and talismans that form an important part of Japanese mythology specifically those relating to Shinto priests and then expanded to include the supernatural. I felt that the anime’s subject topic of the combination of traditional exorcism with fantasy spells and talismans and the supernatural threat of the Kagare was an interesting idea. The decision to have this take place in the modern world and not a fantasy world I felt was a good decision as it allowed the studio to modernize the ancient exorcists into a more modern look.Like most modern animes Twin star’s exorcist makes use of one overarching storyline that incorporates a number of sub plot lines within it. A problem that most long running anime series have is that due to the large number of episodes that they have sometimes it’s necessary for them to make use of filler story lines which are story lines that are not part of the main plot but are there to hold and entertain viewers until the main plot is put back in. Many long running animes do this including Bleach, Fairy tail and Naruto. Though Twin Stars exorcist is not as long as any of the ones that were mentioned Twin stars does make use of an anime exclusive story arc that was actually quite interesting unlike fillers for other comparable animes.CharacterRokuroRokuro voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Aldnoah zero and Masamune kun’s revenge fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the main protagonist of the show. A brash and rather headstrong 14-year-old exorcist Rokuro is an orphan who was found by Seigen one of the 12 legendary guardians of the exorcist union and inducted into it when he came of age. Rokuro can be best be described as being impulsive, aggressive and quick to anger and is the kind of person that would always act before he thinks type. Although a capable exorcist despite his young age a personal tragedy that took place in his old dorm that resulted in the deaths of all his friends and left him mentally scarred as a result. In the past Rokuro had vowed to become the best exorcist in Japan and to protect the world against the Kagare but after that incident things changed.Rokuro’s personality changes quite a bit over the series as a result of meeting the series main heroine Benio. In the beginning of the series Rokuro is aggressive, impulsive and quick to anger while at the same time having doubts about his role as an exorcist due to the trauma suffered from the tragic incident in the past. As a result, Rokuro at this point is somewhat reluctant to use his powers. After encountering Benio and after being told of the prophesy that they had both become involved in Rokuro as well as Benio was dismissive of it and indeed his relationship with Benio started off as a bit rocky.However, as the series went on and their bonds deepened Rokuro’s attitude changed as he become more conscious of the feelings of others, more considerate of the friendships and bonds that he has forged with others and more importantly finding the motivation in which he can use to fight for. As a fight type anime, it’s also important that Rokuro’s abilities in combat reflect his development as a character and in like the bond between him and Benio this gets developed well. At first Rokuro only had a limited number of spells and talismans that he can use but as the series goes on he gets access to more powerful abilities and talismans as his bond with Benio and his relationship with others improve. Foremost among this is the resonance abilities which are abilities that only the twin stars can use which uses the deepness of their bonds as its source of power. Overall I felt that Natsuki Hanae did a pretty good job voicing Rokuro and that his character was developed pretty well both in terms of personality and fighting ability.BenioBenio Adashino voiced by veteran seiyuu and actress Megumi Han is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 14-year-old exorcist from the famous Adashino clan that has long provided exorcists to the exorcist’s union Benio is both similar to Rokuro in terms of belief and at the same time markedly different to Rokuro in temperament. Benio is a calm, mature and measured 14-year-old girl from the famous Adashino clan and has a rather serious personality. She takes the life of an exorcist pretty seriously and is actually pretty similar to Rokuro before the events of the dorm affected him. like Rokuro Benio fights to protect the people of the world from the threat of the Kagare and does it with passion and determination. Like Rokuro Benio did not at first believe in the prophesy of the twin star’s exorcist and did not like the idea of being paired with Rokuro as she saw him as being rather brash and not someone that she can get along with easily. However, as the series goes on Benio’s view towards Rokuro changes as though Rokuro can be brash and indeed clueless at times Rokuro had one personality trait that she admires which in this case is his tenacity and his willingness to fight on despite the odds.Like Rokuro Benio also wrestles with a tragic incident in the past that made her into the person that she is today with her origin though no less horrible than Rokuro’s actually giving her the strength to actually become a better person. As with Rokuro Benio’s personality changes as the series go on. In the beginning Benio was a calm, collected and measured individual that had an icy disposition towards others.  While not intentionally distrustful towards other Benio at this point only believed in the power that she had. However, as the series went on Benio become more open and friendly towards others while also becoming more considerate towards the feelings and opinions of others. She also began to place more trust in others.In terms of fighting ability Benio’s combat ability also developed as the series went on becoming more powerful as the series goes on. In contrast to Rokuro whose fighting style is more akin to a boxer in that his styles emphasizes on the use of his fist and direct confrontations Benio’s style is markedly different in that she makes use of a highly acrobatic style that takes advantages of her long legs and uses powerful kicks as her main attacks. Overall I felt that the character of Benio was a pretty well designed character that was given great character development both in terms of personality evolution and improvement in fighting ability. I felt that Megumi Han who I heard for the first time in this time actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Benio.MayuraMayura voiced by veteran seiyuu and singer Yuu Serizawa of Parasyte fame is one of the main support characters of the show. The childhood friend of Rokuro and the daughter of Seigen who is one of the 12 guardians of the exorcist union Mayura is a positive, Cheerful and bubbly person that has a kind and caring personality. As childhood friends Mayura is one of the few people that understand Rokuro’s personality and the turmoil that he wrestles with as a result of his past. As a result of this connection and friendship Mayura has deep feelings for Rokuro that manifested before the series started.As this series is focused on the bond between Rokuro and Benio and the romantic relationship that the two develop Mayura’s feelings towards Rokuro though obvious towards anyone but him is only made apparent to him later on after his feelings for Benio become more apparent. As a result, her feelings are not made a reality and indeed in the series this aspect is used more as a sort of comic relief for Mayura as she uses it as a form of motivation to help support the relationship between Benio and Rokuro.As the daughter of one of the 12 guardians Mayura has large amounts of spell power and after receiving training from both her father and members of the 12 guardians and after inheriting her father’s unique power she becomes quite powerful. Like all characters Mayura’s personality and fighting ability improves as the series goes on with Mayura becoming braver, determined and more willing to put her life on the line to protect others. Her fighting ability while basic at first and comical swiftly gets more powerful as she trains and after gaining her father’s unique power becomes pretty powerful.  In the end, I felt that Mayura was a pretty well designed character that was given good character development and I liked how her combat ability was improved so much over the series. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa did a pretty good job voicing her.YuutoYuuto voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase of elDLIVE fame is the main villain of the series. A calculating, cruel and manipulating person Yuuto was actually Rokuro’s best friend before the events of the dorm tragedy and was the primary instigator of that tragedy. A ambitious person by nature that cares little about friendship, happiness and indeed the feelings of anyone else but himself Yuuto is a supremely smart and devious person that seeks only to gain power and become the ultimate exorcist. In this Yuuto is perhaps the opposite of just about every character that appears in this series as he only cares about himself and the gaining of power and cares little about the people that he affects in his journey to do so.Personality wise Yuuto has two distinct personalities at first but as the series progresses these merge into one overall one that can be best described as scary and deceptive. His first personality that I call his fake nice guy personality is the one that he adapts when he was young and still following the rules. With this personality he is courteous, quiet and intelligent if somewhat detached from other people. This personality’s notable trait is his deceptiveness in that he will use what he learned from others to twist the rewards that they want in order to achieve the ends that he wants and not what they want. The best example of this is the result of the dorm tragedy. Yuuto’s second personality is a development of his first personality that first revealed itself when Rokuro and Benio confronted him for the first time after his first false death. In this personality Yuuto is openly distasteful of both the exorcist order and of Benio and reveals his true nature to both. In this personality Yuuto retains his trademark deviousness but becomes more cruel and manipulative while gaining more cunning and at the same time becoming more arrogant. He is also more open with his desires which in this case is aimed at Rokuro.A notable trait of this personality is that his desire for Rokuro that he sees as being similar to him is obsessive to the point of being downright creepy. The same can be said of his rather warped sense of love as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuuto’s strength increases as the series goes on as this was intended to be both the main obstacle for the twin stars and as a main villain to beat. In the series like his personalities Yuuto has two distinct fighting styles that he uses as the series goes on. The first is him fighting in human form in which he uses more advanced spells and techniques than normal exorcists do while his second and probably his ultimate form makes use of a larger variety of attacks that seem to be a fusion between the attacks used by exorcists and Kagare.Overall I felt that Yuuto was a pretty well designed character and that he served as a great villain for the series. In a way Yuuto can be seen as both Rokuro’s nemesis and a dark mirror version of Rokuro if he had given in to his rage. In terms of character development his two personalities I felt were distinct and interesting with the second arguably the best as it built on the first while also adding in new parts that reflected his nature. All in all, I felt that Ayumu Murase did a great job portraying Yuuto.SeigenSeigen voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of fate stay night and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the show. A powerful exorcist and Rokuro’s former teacher as well as the one that found him Seigen is also a former member of the 12 guardians. A cold, serious and calm person by nature Seigen can be a hard person to get to know and indeed mostly keeps to himself most of the time. However, beneath this hard and unforgiving exterior Seigen actually cares a great deal about his friends, his daughter Mayura and his students as well. It’s always funny when you see Seigen being embarrassed by Mayura who knows what his true personality is like and says out what his feelings are for a matter that he is trying to keep hidden.As a former member of the 12 guardians Seigen is a very capable combatant and even after the events that saw his resignation from that august body Seigen’s combat ability is still way above Rokuro and Benio. I felt that Seigen as a character was a good one as he served as the voice of reason and advice for Rokuro and Benio and uses his experience that he has gained over his career to help them both become strong. All in all I felt that Junichi Suwabe did a great job voicing the character of Seigen.ArimaArima voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Namikawa of Persona 4 fame is one of the main support characters of the series. Arima is the head of the exorcist union and has the official role of head exorcist. As the overall head of such a large and important organisation that is charged with the heavy responsibility of protecting Japan from the threat of the Kagare you would expect that Arima would be an inspirational, serious and honorable person wouldn’t you.For the most part this is true in that while Arima can be inspirational at times and serious when it matters his normal personality is rather different. Arima’s normal personality that he projects when there are no crisis’s is that of a rather laid back person that looks relaxed and lets his subordinates take care of matters for him. He also seems to enjoy using humor to deflect the more serious questions that are raised. However, it is when matters become more serious that Arima’s true personality manifests. In this personality Arima is serious, smart and fast thinker able to come up with many different solutions after hearing the problem. This I felt was a great contrast to his normal personality. As the head exorcist Arima is a powerful exorcist able to fight toe to toe with the most powerful of foes but his notable trait is not that of strength but rather of intelligence and foreknowledge in which he uses to outsmart and outmaneuver his foes. All I all I felt that Arima was a pretty well designed character.12 guardiansThe 12 guardians are both the most powerful exorcists within the exorcist union and the council and advisers for the head Exorcist. Each of the 12 members inherit the familiars that were created by the founder of the exorcists and derive their powers from it. On the council, the name of these familiars is used as their titles. Each of the 12 guardians is geared and specialized towards a certain style of fighting though all are proficient in combating the Kagare. Throughout the series each member of the 12 guardians are introduced but some are featured more than others due to their connection to the cast.The two that were featured the most heavily was Subaru Mitejima who was voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of SAO fame and Shimon Ikaruga that was voiced by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Owari no seraph fame. The purpose of these two characters within the plot was to train Rokuro and Benio in not just improving their physical attacks but also their mentality and their motivations to not just be good exorcists but also become the role that they were both destined to become in which in this case is the Twin star’s exorcist. With the exception of Subaru who know Benio beforehand and who also managed to develop a good working relationship with Rokuro Shimon was probably the one that trained them the hardest. Like many exorcists Shinon did not really believe in the prophesy of the Twin stars and also had a rather low opinion of Rokuro when they first met. This was complicated by the fact that Shinon had a rather difficult personality in that he looked down somewhat on Rokuro. However, as the series went on Rokuro and Shimon’s relationship got somewhat better as both were able to understand each other better and eventually they become friends eventually. In terms of support characters after Mayura Subaru is probably one of my favourite characters as she can be equally serious and at the same time equally humorous as she trains and interacts with Benio and Rokuro. I felt that Miyuki Sawashiro did a pretty good job voicing Subaru and that she probably had fun voicing such a fun character.SaeSae voiced by new seiyuu Hitomi Sasaki is an original character that was created for the exclusive anime story arc and is the main character within her arc and a guest character in the main plot. A mysterious girl that Rokuro and Benio found during one of their incursions into Magano Sae is a young girl that appears to be 6 to 7 years of age. A positive, cheerful and intelligent girl that also seems to have the ability to not enter Magano but also to have the power to protect not just herself but also people around her from attacks by deflecting them. Sae’s endearing trait is arguably her cuteness and how she is able to stay positive in even the most dire of circumstances.As a result, of being the ones that found her Sae regards and see’s Benio and Rokuro as her parents and cheerfully refers to them as Mama and Papa respectively. As a result of the relationship that both Rokuro and Benio establish with Sae from outside appearances it would look like that they are in fact a family and indeed this is what Sae and the pair actually thought as they traveled together during their arc.This aspect of the arc I felt was really well done as it formed an emotional attachment to Sae not just for Rokuro and Benio but also for us as the viewers as well. When the time came for her to vanish at the conclusion of the arc it was quite understandable for both Rokuro and Benio to be in tears as they watched Sae who they had already regarded as their daughter to vanish from their very eyes. That conclusion I felt was well done and was pretty emotional for not just Rokuro and Benio but also for me as well. I felt that Hitomi Sasaki really did a great job voicing the character of Sae.KuranashiKuranashi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuhiko Inoue of Naruto and Naruto shippuden fame is an anime original character that only exists within his own arc. A mysterious Basara and a powerful one at that Kuranashi is different from other Basara in that he is relatively smart and patient and cunning using all of these features to come up with long running and complex plans. Indeed, though his plan was not ultimately his to begin with the complexities of the plan and how it was executed really was a marvel to see as most Basara though powerful in combat have very little in terms of intelligence. In fact, I felt that Kuranashi behaved more like a human than a Kagare. As a Basara Kuranashi is a powerful combatant able to take on normal exorcists easily and even fight the twin stars to a standstill. But it’s in his intelligence that he truly shines. In animes the best villains are usually those that are both powerful in combat and yet have a sharp mind that is able to outsmart his opponents as well. In this Kuranashi fit these criteria perfectly. In his story arc Kuranashi was able to both outfight the twin stars and the 12 guardians in the enactment of his true plan which I was really surprised about. I felt that Kuranashi was a pretty well designed villain in the end and that he was a most capable opponent for the Twin stars in his arc.Arts and animationArts and animation for the show was fine for the most part. The character designs for each of the characters I felt was pretty well done especially Benio and Subaru who looked both pretty and elegant. The designs of the uniforms that the cast wore were also pretty well done. The environmental designs for the environments that cast battle in were also pretty good with some of them being especially nice. Animation for the most part was fine though some episodes seem have lower quality animation that others though this is in the minority. The fight scenes for the series I felt were pretty well done especially in the fights between Yuuto and Rokuro and between Abe and cast near the end.MusicThe series made use of quite a number of opening and ending themes with 4 openings and 7 ending themes being used. But I have to say that my favourite was the second opening theme Re: Call that was sung by idol girl group iRis to which Mayura’s seiyuu Yu Serizawa is a member of and the third ending theme Yadoriboshi. The rest of the openings and ending I felt were also pretty good but the above two were my favourite.Voice actingVoice acting for the show I felt was pretty good with Rokuro’s voice actor and Benio’s seiyuu who are Natsuki Hanae and Megumi Han deserving some praise as I felt that they were able to voice their respective characters pretty well. Mayura’s seiyuu Yu Serizawa and Subaru’s seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro I felt also did a great job voicing their characters and despite being support characters both of their characters were one of my favorites and this is due to the hard work that their seiyuu’s put in.Overall conclusionIn overall I felt that Twin star’s exorcist was a pretty well designed anime that had a great overall story, an interesting and emotional sub story arc, a great cast of characters, a capable voice cast an interesting setting and great music. In terms of story the key point of it is undoubtedly the prophesy that two exorcists from opposite ends of japan would be destined to meet and fall in love and from there create the legendary Miko that would put an end to the age-old war that has been raging between the exorcists and the Kagare. However, for this story to actually work and be interesting the key point here is the bond and the relationship that is established between the two that were chosen. In this I felt that the bond and relationship that Benio and Rokuro developed over the series was well thought out and that the gradual deepening of the feelings that the two had for each other was natural and not too rushed. Unlike the likes of SAO where the romance was too fast I felt that the romance here proceeded at a more natural speed which meant that while it took time for the two to develop it we can at least see them becoming slowly closer with one another. This aspect was someone that liked about the series.The gradual development of their relationship also had the effect of also improving upon their fighting abilities as some of the twin star’s special abilities cannot be used without them forging a strong enough bond first. This helped ensure that the story progressed at the same pace as their bonds were. The sub story arc I felt was pretty well done and designed with Sae being one of the cutest and most endearing character that I seen for a long time. The image of Sae, Benio and Rokuro as a family and the sadness that they felt as they remembered all the happy memories that they had with her after her vanishment was something that I felt was well designed and really had an emotional impact on me. As stated earlier the show I felt had a great cast of characters both main and support that I felt were well designed. The two main characters Rokuro and Benio I felt were well designed and that they had a personality that really made them both stand out and at the same contrast each other. This also had the effect of also enhancing each other which is especially important as they were supposed to be fighting as a team.In terms of villains I felt that both Yuuto and Kuranashi as well as the final villain was well designed and emphasized on not just their strength but also in their intelligence and craftiness. Traditional villains in fight animes like this tend to be ones that were just powerful in terms of strength but less in brainpower and it’s nice that this was different. Voice cast and music as stated were excellent and I felt that the setting that this series was based in was also good. The idea of a parallel world where monsters that are created from the negative human emotions that we generate was an interesting idea. just over two full seasons of 24 episodes each.Twin star’s exorcist is an action/fantasy anime with some supernatural elements thrown into the mix as well and in this is actually quite similar to the likes of Bleach. As a result of this along with the setting and the characters was one of the reasons that drew me to watch it.Story and settingThe main story for Twin star’s exorcists revolves around the adventures of its two main characters Rokuro Enmado and Benio Adashino who are both exorcists whose main job is to protect the world from monsters called Kagare that exist in a parallel world called Magano and exist only to feed on people. To better understand the story a little background information will be needed here. The story for Twin Stars exorcist takes place in modern day Japan much like the age that we currently live in. In this world exists a parallel world where exists monsters called Kagare that are caused and created by the negative emotions and feelings that humans experience and let out in their daily lives. The existence of Magano is a fact that is known to the general population but they themselves do not have the power to deal with it and instead this duty falls to the exorcist union an organisation formed since ages past to fight the Kagare and keep the war from spilling out into the real world. And the main force of this union is the exorcists themselves who are specially trained personal that have been taught how to use various spells and talismans to which they summon weapons and Armour to use against the Kagare and protect the people.Twin stars’ exorcists main plot line tells the story of two talented exorcists Rokuro and Benio who through an ancient prophesy are destined to meet and marry and them create a child that will become the miko the reincarnation of the founder of the exorcist’s union Abe no seimei who would end the war between the exorcists and the Kagare that had been raging for thousands of years. The development of the bond and relationship that the two develop as they get to know each other as the series goes on forms one of the main elements of the story.Twin star’s exorcist draws heavily upon the traditional duties of an exorcist which is to exorcise evil spirits and merges this with the fantasy spells and talismans that form an important part of Japanese mythology specifically those relating to Shinto priests and then expanded to include the supernatural. I felt that the anime’s subject topic of the combination of traditional exorcism with fantasy spells and talismans and the supernatural threat of the Kagare was an interesting idea. The decision to have this take place in the modern world and not a fantasy world I felt was a good decision as it allowed the studio to modernize the ancient exorcists into a more modern look.Like most modern animes Twin star’s exorcist makes use of one overarching storyline that incorporates a number of sub plot lines within it. A problem that most long running anime series have is that due to the large number of episodes that they have sometimes it’s necessary for them to make use of filler story lines which are story lines that are not part of the main plot but are there to hold and entertain viewers until the main plot is put back in. Many long running animes do this including Bleach, Fairy tail and Naruto. Though Twin Stars exorcist is not as long as any of the ones that were mentioned Twin stars does make use of an anime exclusive story arc that was actually quite interesting unlike fillers for other comparable animes.CharacterRokuroRokuro voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Aldnoah zero and Masamune kun’s revenge fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the main protagonist of the show. A brash and rather headstrong 14-year-old exorcist Rokuro is an orphan who was found by Seigen one of the 12 legendary guardians of the exorcist union and inducted into it when he came of age. Rokuro can be best be described as being impulsive, aggressive and quick to anger and is the kind of person that would always act before he thinks type. Although a capable exorcist despite his young age a personal tragedy that took place in his old dorm that resulted in the deaths of all his friends and left him mentally scarred as a result. In the past Rokuro had vowed to become the best exorcist in Japan and to protect the world against the Kagare but after that incident things changed.Rokuro’s personality changes quite a bit over the series as a result of meeting the series main heroine Benio. In the beginning of the series Rokuro is aggressive, impulsive and quick to anger while at the same time having doubts about his role as an exorcist due to the trauma suffered from the tragic incident in the past. As a result, Rokuro at this point is somewhat reluctant to use his powers. After encountering Benio and after being told of the prophesy that they had both become involved in Rokuro as well as Benio was dismissive of it and indeed his relationship with Benio started off as a bit rocky.However, as the series went on and their bonds deepened Rokuro’s attitude changed as he become more conscious of the feelings of others, more considerate of the friendships and bonds that he has forged with others and more importantly finding the motivation in which he can use to fight for. As a fight type anime, it’s also important that Rokuro’s abilities in combat reflect his development as a character and in like the bond between him and Benio this gets developed well. At first Rokuro only had a limited number of spells and talismans that he can use but as the series goes on he gets access to more powerful abilities and talismans as his bond with Benio and his relationship with others improve. Foremost among this is the resonance abilities which are abilities that only the twin stars can use which uses the deepness of their bonds as its source of power. Overall I felt that Natsuki Hanae did a pretty good job voicing Rokuro and that his character was developed pretty well both in terms of personality and fighting ability.BenioBenio Adashino voiced by veteran seiyuu and actress Megumi Han is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 14-year-old exorcist from the famous Adashino clan that has long provided exorcists to the exorcist’s union Benio is both similar to Rokuro in terms of belief and at the same time markedly different to Rokuro in temperament. Benio is a calm, mature and measured 14-year-old girl from the famous Adashino clan and has a rather serious personality. She takes the life of an exorcist pretty seriously and is actually pretty similar to Rokuro before the events of the dorm affected him. like Rokuro Benio fights to protect the people of the world from the threat of the Kagare and does it with passion and determination. Like Rokuro Benio did not at first believe in the prophesy of the twin star’s exorcist and did not like the idea of being paired with Rokuro as she saw him as being rather brash and not someone that she can get along with easily. However, as the series goes on Benio’s view towards Rokuro changes as though Rokuro can be brash and indeed clueless at times Rokuro had one personality trait that she admires which in this case is his tenacity and his willingness to fight on despite the odds.Like Rokuro Benio also wrestles with a tragic incident in the past that made her into the person that she is today with her origin though no less horrible than Rokuro’s actually giving her the strength to actually become a better person. As with Rokuro Benio’s personality changes as the series go on. In the beginning Benio was a calm, collected and measured individual that had an icy disposition towards others.  While not intentionally distrustful towards other Benio at this point only believed in the power that she had. However, as the series went on Benio become more open and friendly towards others while also becoming more considerate towards the feelings and opinions of others. She also began to place more trust in others.In terms of fighting ability Benio’s combat ability also developed as the series went on becoming more powerful as the series goes on. In contrast to Rokuro whose fighting style is more akin to a boxer in that his styles emphasizes on the use of his fist and direct confrontations Benio’s style is markedly different in that she makes use of a highly acrobatic style that takes advantages of her long legs and uses powerful kicks as her main attacks. Overall I felt that the character of Benio was a pretty well designed character that was given great character development both in terms of personality evolution and improvement in fighting ability. I felt that Megumi Han who I heard for the first time in this time actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Benio.MayuraMayura voiced by veteran seiyuu and singer Yuu Serizawa of Parasyte fame is one of the main support characters of the show. The childhood friend of Rokuro and the daughter of Seigen who is one of the 12 guardians of the exorcist union Mayura is a positive, Cheerful and bubbly person that has a kind and caring personality. As childhood friends Mayura is one of the few people that understand Rokuro’s personality and the turmoil that he wrestles with as a result of his past. As a result of this connection and friendship Mayura has deep feelings for Rokuro that manifested before the series started.As this series is focused on the bond between Rokuro and Benio and the romantic relationship that the two develop Mayura’s feelings towards Rokuro though obvious towards anyone but him is only made apparent to him later on after his feelings for Benio become more apparent. As a result, her feelings are not made a reality and indeed in the series this aspect is used more as a sort of comic relief for Mayura as she uses it as a form of motivation to help support the relationship between Benio and Rokuro.As the daughter of one of the 12 guardians Mayura has large amounts of spell power and after receiving training from both her father and members of the 12 guardians and after inheriting her father’s unique power she becomes quite powerful. Like all characters Mayura’s personality and fighting ability improves as the series goes on with Mayura becoming braver, determined and more willing to put her life on the line to protect others. Her fighting ability while basic at first and comical swiftly gets more powerful as she trains and after gaining her father’s unique power becomes pretty powerful.  In the end, I felt that Mayura was a pretty well designed character that was given good character development and I liked how her combat ability was improved so much over the series. I felt that her seiyuu Yu Serizawa did a pretty good job voicing her.YuutoYuuto voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase of elDLIVE fame is the main villain of the series. A calculating, cruel and manipulating person Yuuto was actually Rokuro’s best friend before the events of the dorm tragedy and was the primary instigator of that tragedy. A ambitious person by nature that cares little about friendship, happiness and indeed the feelings of anyone else but himself Yuuto is a supremely smart and devious person that seeks only to gain power and become the ultimate exorcist. In this Yuuto is perhaps the opposite of just about every character that appears in this series as he only cares about himself and the gaining of power and cares little about the people that he affects in his journey to do so.Personality wise Yuuto has two distinct personalities at first but as the series progresses these merge into one overall one that can be best described as scary and deceptive. His first personality that I call his fake nice guy personality is the one that he adapts when he was young and still following the rules. With this personality he is courteous, quiet and intelligent if somewhat detached from other people. This personality’s notable trait is his deceptiveness in that he will use what he learned from others to twist the rewards that they want in order to achieve the ends that he wants and not what they want. The best example of this is the result of the dorm tragedy. Yuuto’s second personality is a development of his first personality that first revealed itself when Rokuro and Benio confronted him for the first time after his first false death. In this personality Yuuto is openly distasteful of both the exorcist order and of Benio and reveals his true nature to both. In this personality Yuuto retains his trademark deviousness but becomes more cruel and manipulative while gaining more cunning and at the same time becoming more arrogant. He is also more open with his desires which in this case is aimed at Rokuro.A notable trait of this personality is that his desire for Rokuro that he sees as being similar to him is obsessive to the point of being downright creepy. The same can be said of his rather warped sense of love as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuuto’s strength increases as the series goes on as this was intended to be both the main obstacle for the twin stars and as a main villain to beat. In the series like his personalities Yuuto has two distinct fighting styles that he uses as the series goes on. The first is him fighting in human form in which he uses more advanced spells and techniques than normal exorcists do while his second and probably his ultimate form makes use of a larger variety of attacks that seem to be a fusion between the attacks used by exorcists and Kagare.Overall I felt that Yuuto was a pretty well designed character and that he served as a great villain for the series. In a way Yuuto can be seen as both Rokuro’s nemesis and a dark mirror version of Rokuro if he had given in to his rage. In terms of character development his two personalities I felt were distinct and interesting with the second arguably the best as it built on the first while also adding in new parts that reflected his nature. All in all, I felt that Ayumu Murase did a great job portraying Yuuto.SeigenSeigen voiced by veteran voice actor Junichi Suwabe of fate stay night and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the show. A powerful exorcist and Rokuro’s former teacher as well as the one that found him Seigen is also a former member of the 12 guardians. A cold, serious and calm person by nature Seigen can be a hard person to get to know and indeed mostly keeps to himself most of the time. However, beneath this hard and unforgiving exterior Seigen actually cares a great deal about his friends, his daughter Mayura and his students as well. It’s always funny when you see Seigen being embarrassed by Mayura who knows what his true personality is like and says out what his feelings are for a matter that he is trying to keep hidden.As a former member of the 12 guardians Seigen is a very capable combatant and even after the events that saw his resignation from that august body Seigen’s combat ability is still way above Rokuro and Benio. I felt that Seigen as a character was a good one as he served as the voice of reason and advice for Rokuro and Benio and uses his experience that he has gained over his career to help them both become strong. All in all I felt that Junichi Suwabe did a great job voicing the character of Seigen.ArimaArima voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Namikawa of Persona 4 fame is one of the main support characters of the series. Arima is the head of the exorcist union and has the official role of head exorcist. As the overall head of such a large and important organisation that is charged with the heavy responsibility of protecting Japan from the threat of the Kagare you would expect that Arima would be an inspirational, serious and honorable person wouldn’t you.For the most part this is true in that while Arima can be inspirational at times and serious when it matters his normal personality is rather different. Arima’s normal personality that he projects when there are no crisis’s is that of a rather laid back person that looks relaxed and lets his subordinates take care of matters for him. He also seems to enjoy using humor to deflect the more serious questions that are raised. However, it is when matters become more serious that Arima’s true personality manifests. In this personality Arima is serious, smart and fast thinker able to come up with many different solutions after hearing the problem. This I felt was a great contrast to his normal personality. As the head exorcist Arima is a powerful exorcist able to fight toe to toe with the most powerful of foes but his notable trait is not that of strength but rather of intelligence and foreknowledge in which he uses to outsmart and outmaneuver his foes. All I all I felt that Arima was a pretty well designed character.12 guardiansThe 12 guardians are both the most powerful exorcists within the exorcist union and the council and advisers for the head Exorcist.

The purpose of these two characters within the plot was to train Rokuro and Benio in not just improving their physical attacks but also their mentality and their motivations to not just be good exorcists but also become the role that they were both destined to become in which in this case is the Twin star’s exorcist. With the exception of Subaru who know Benio beforehand and who also managed to develop a good working relationship with Rokuro Shimon was probably the one that trained them the hardest. Like many exorcists Shinon did not really believe in the prophesy of the Twin stars and also had a rather low opinion of Rokuro when they first met. This was complicated by the fact that Shinon had a rather difficult personality in that he looked down somewhat on Rokuro. However, as the series went on Rokuro and Shimon’s relationship got somewhat better as both were able to understand each other better and eventually they become friends eventually. In terms of support characters after Mayura Subaru is probably one of my favourite characters as she can be equally serious and at the same time equally humorous as she trains and interacts with Benio and Rokuro. I felt that Miyuki Sawashiro did a pretty good job voicing Subaru and that she probably had fun voicing such a fun character.SaeSae voiced by new seiyuu Hitomi Sasaki is an original character that was created for the exclusive anime story arc and is the main character within her arc and a guest character in the main plot. A mysterious girl that Rokuro and Benio found during one of their incursions into Magano Sae is a young girl that appears to be 6 to 7 years of age. A positive, cheerful and intelligent girl that also seems to have the ability to not enter Magano but also to have the power to protect not just herself but also people around her from attacks by deflecting them. Sae’s endearing trait is arguably her cuteness and how she is able to stay positive in even the most dire of circumstances.As a result, of being the ones that found her Sae regards and see’s Benio and Rokuro as her parents and cheerfully refers to them as Mama and Papa respectively. As a result of the relationship that both Rokuro and Benio establish with Sae from outside appearances it would look like that they are in fact a family and indeed this is what Sae and the pair actually thought as they traveled together during their arc.This aspect of the arc I felt was really well done as it formed an emotional attachment to Sae not just for Rokuro and Benio but also for us as the viewers as well. When the time came for her to vanish at the conclusion of the arc it was quite understandable for both Rokuro and Benio to be in tears as they watched Sae who they had already regarded as their daughter to vanish from their very eyes. That conclusion I felt was well done and was pretty emotional for not just Rokuro and Benio but also for me as well. I felt that Hitomi Sasaki really did a great job voicing the character of Sae.KuranashiKuranashi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuhiko Inoue of Naruto and Naruto shippuden fame is an anime original character that only exists within his own arc. A mysterious Basara and a powerful one at that Kuranashi is different from other Basara in that he is relatively smart and patient and cunning using all of these features to come up with long running and complex plans. Indeed, though his plan was not ultimately his to begin with the complexities of the plan and how it was executed really was a marvel to see as most Basara though powerful in combat have very little in terms of intelligence. In fact, I felt that Kuranashi behaved more like a human than a Kagare. As a Basara Kuranashi is a powerful combatant able to take on normal exorcists easily and even fight the twin stars to a standstill. But it’s in his intelligence that he truly shines. In animes the best villains are usually those that are both powerful in combat and yet have a sharp mind that is able to outsmart his opponents as well. In this Kuranashi fit these criteria perfectly. In his story arc Kuranashi was able to both outfight the twin stars and the 12 guardians in the enactment of his true plan which I was really surprised about. I felt that Kuranashi was a pretty well designed villain in the end and that he was a most capable opponent for the Twin stars in his arc.Arts and animationArts and animation for the show was fine for the most part. The character designs for each of the characters I felt was pretty well done especially Benio and Subaru who looked both pretty and elegant. The designs of the uniforms that the cast wore were also pretty well done. The environmental designs for the environments that cast battle in were also pretty good with some of them being especially nice. Animation for the most part was fine though some episodes seem have lower quality animation that others though this is in the minority. The fight scenes for the series I felt were pretty well done especially in the fights between Yuuto and Rokuro and between Abe and cast near the end.MusicThe series made use of quite a number of opening and ending themes with 4 openings and 7 ending themes being used. But I have to say that my favourite was the second opening theme Re: Call that was sung by idol girl group iRis to which Mayura’s seiyuu Yu Serizawa is a member of and the third ending theme Yadoriboshi. The rest of the openings and ending I felt were also pretty good but the above two were my favourite.Voice actingVoice acting for the show I felt was pretty good with Rokuro’s voice actor and Benio’s seiyuu who are Natsuki Hanae and Megumi Han deserving some praise as I felt that they were able to voice their respective characters pretty well. Mayura’s seiyuu Yu Serizawa and Subaru’s seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro I felt also did a great job voicing their characters and despite being support characters both of their characters were one of my favorites and this is due to the hard work that their seiyuu’s put in.Overall conclusionIn overall I felt that Twin star’s exorcist was a pretty well designed anime that had a great overall story, an interesting and emotional sub story arc, a great cast of characters, a capable voice cast an interesting setting and great music. In terms of story the key point of it is undoubtedly the prophesy that two exorcists from opposite ends of japan would be destined to meet and fall in love and from there create the legendary Miko that would put an end to the age-old war that has been raging between the exorcists and the Kagare. However, for this story to actually work and be interesting the key point here is the bond and the relationship that is established between the two that were chosen. In this I felt that the bond and relationship that Benio and Rokuro developed over the series was well thought out and that the gradual deepening of the feelings that the two had for each other was natural and not too rushed. Unlike the likes of SAO where the romance was too fast I felt that the romance here proceeded at a more natural speed which meant that while it took time for the two to develop it we can at least see them becoming slowly closer with one another. This aspect was someone that liked about the series.The gradual development of their relationship also had the effect of also improving upon their fighting abilities as some of the twin star’s special abilities cannot be used without them forging a strong enough bond first. This helped ensure that the story progressed at the same pace as their bonds were. The sub story arc I felt was pretty well done and designed with Sae being one of the cutest and most endearing character that I seen for a long time. The image of Sae, Benio and Rokuro as a family and the sadness that they felt as they remembered all the happy memories that they had with her after her vanishment was something that I felt was well designed and really had an emotional impact on me. As stated earlier the show I felt had a great cast of characters both main and support that I felt were well designed. The two main characters Rokuro and Benio I felt were well designed and that they had a personality that really made them both stand out and at the same contrast each other. This also had the effect of also enhancing each other which is especially important as they were supposed to be fighting as a team.In terms of villains I felt that both Yuuto and Kuranashi as well as the final villain was well designed and emphasized on not just their strength but also in their intelligence and craftiness. Traditional villains in fight animes like this tend to be ones that were just powerful in terms of strength but less in brainpower and it’s nice that this was different. Voice cast and music as stated were excellent and I felt that the setting that this series was based in was also good. The idea of a parallel world where monsters that are created from the negative human emotions that we generate was an interesting idea.', ""I actually kinda feel weird about Twin Star Exorcists. I'm very glad I didn't write a review at around episode 12, because it would be entirely different than now. I'll explain why below.Story - The stroy, while unique in a sense that I haven't personally seen it before, is still pretty vanilla. Excorcists go around exorcising Kegare, teenage girl prodigy moves and meets teenage boy prodigy who doesn't want to be an exorcist anymore. Boy mc likes the Girl mc, and there is another girl who is a side character but is best girl. Very cookie cutter imo. Doesn't mean it's not good though, it's...still a enjoyable story.Art - Like I say in every review I post, I'm not a stickler for art. That being said this just looked a bit weird for me. Not bad, but in a sense out there. Still nice to look at but something iffy moments for sure.Sound - Honestly sounded great to me, but thats because I fins it hard to mess up sounds lmao. OP 1 & 2 are also very nice.Character - Now this is something I was iffy about for around the first 11-12 episodes. I just didn't enjoy the characters and how they played out. Now mind you there probably isn't much of a difference between anything after episode 12, but it just felt like there was. Show also has a girl I really love named Mayura, who is the male mc's childhood friend that also has a crush on him. He obviously just thinks of her as a friend, so you can kinda see the Shounen popping through lmao. Regardless she's a good character and makes things pop a bit.Overall - Now I'll be blunt. I nearly hated the first 12 epsiodes, mainly because it seems like everything was forced. This show has some dark tones to it to give it life, and I just don't think they were applied correctly early on. The episode that I think for sure made my opinion 180 was episode 16 and 17. They do something else dark but it also messes with the male MC through psychology, which had always been a point here, but this was a newer degree. After that, everything became a tad more serious, and that made me love it for some reason.Great show, really improved after the first 10~ episodes. Can't wait to continue watching more. Only actually wrote the review now because it seemed like a good stopping point due to there apparently being a time skip in the next episode. still a enjoyable story.Art - Like I say in every review I post, I'm not a stickler for art.

This show is painstakingly average. It feels as if it is trying its hardest not to be different. It doesn't want to break the mold and try something new. Which is a shame because it starts off pretty interesting.To be honest, this show probably could have been pulled off better if it wasn't for the lackluster animation. In the first episode, it got me pretty hyped up seeing what the show could have been. While the plot instantly comes off as nothing special, the animation...seemed to reflect a livelier side to it.  But the more I watched, the quality dived more and more until it became so noticeable I had to pause it and take a deep breath to appreciate how much the artists screwed up. In the last episode I watched, episode 13,  the main characters who are teenagers are barely bigger than oil barrels in the background. Not only that, the flaming fox spirit who is a recurring character is stagnant. Not moving despite being made of fire of all things.The fights are insanely boring and poorly planned out. You have Rokuro, the main character with an insanely awesome spell that transforms his fist into something that reminds you of a demon or a dragon, only knows how to do one thing. And that's just throw a right punch. There's nothing more than that. Even if it sounds reasonable considering it's on his right arm and he probably doesn't need to know much else, the bigger issue is the animation supporting it. The only variation you see with Rokuro's punches is him throwing a right fist and a close up of his screaming face. The animators don't attempt to make the fight interesting and seemingly gave up in varying the fights or scenes.The sound also seems to lack impact. Several times an old sound clip from older media you've heard before plays. Like a sword clashing or the standard anime explosion. It doesn't feel unique. Sometimes they even feel too quiet, giving what felt like a big punch or a heavy attack the impact of a pillow hitting somebody. Now, this might be a personal nitpick, but the show kind of has a techno themed soundtrack a lot of the time. In one scene where it got emotional and characters are developing and pouring their heart out in front of an enemy monster (Kegare), it played some high tempo techno, which felt very unfitting. This problem seems to be consistent throughout the show. Some may be a fan of it, but knowing when to hold off for certain scenes should be common sense.I wouldn't bother watching this show. If you want something better with a slightly similar concept, go watch Tokyo Ravens. seemed to reflect a livelier side to it.

However, when I write any reviews at all, it\'s all based on my enjoyment of the anime and how it feels connected to me.Whenever, I watch an anime, I do not compare them to their manga counterpart. I view them as a new experience. So, treat my review as a point-of-view from your average anime lover. To me, this is truly a superb romance anime. Do not watch this anime if you are not into slow romantic developments.What really appealed to me about this anime is the generous 50...episodes which most animes are lacking these days. It allows a steadily paced character development between the male and female MC, as well as other side characters.I\'m really glad they didn\'t add in any harem factor into this anime which makes it refreshing. The relationship development between Rokuro and Benio is heartwarming. I love the aspect where they started off hating each other and slowly grew closer from there. Also, not forgetting the character development with other side characters such as Ryougo, Mayura, and Seigen.Towards the ending, it\'s nice for them not to forget some of the earlier characters such as Kamui. Also, I\'m glad they didn\'t turned Abe no Seimei into a villain, and it was explained very nicely that Abe no Seimei had no choice but to cleanse the world using the ""forced happiness"" method as he had placed his hope on humanity for the past 1000 years and humanity only turned out to be worst.In a way, he is not a villain as he gave humanity another chance after Rokuro and Benio convinced him as they showed him that even his own creation, the Ame-no-Mihashira assisted them to stop the cleansing. The winning point for me is the fact that the anime ends with a very solid relationship between the two MCs (episode 49 & 50 in particular). Unlike most anime these days which wraps up with the MC not having the guts to confess to the person he/she likes, which frustrates me the most.It may be true that the story can be predictable or cliche even but I do not see the issue with that as anime/manga these days revolves around the same topic/plots. Sousei no Onmyouji doesn\'t try to reinvent the wheel. Personally, I see it as an anime with the whole story focusing around the male and female MC relationship development. It\'s a romance story which was worth the journey.I am actually rewatching this anime the next day after I was just done with it. It\'s truly an anime which I\'ve enjoyed very much. I would recommend reading the manga too as the plots are totally different. It\'s like reading a whole new story.TL;DR:- Solid and steady relationship/romance build-up between male and female MC.- Refreshing 50 episodes long to allow steadily paced character development.- No love-triangle.- Both MC not airheads, and have the guts to confess.- Side characters with solid background story.- Villains with their own unique personalities and objectives.- Well explained story.- Solid conclusion.

I liked the bonding between Benio and Rokuro, how they had to work hard to understand each other and ultimately work together. I even liked the idea of their arranged marriage. I liked the character designs (more on that in a minute) and most of the character interactions. I liked the action scenes to a point (more on that later). This show worked…For about 20 episodes. Then they introduce the 12 most powerful exorcists alive today, without giving any reason...or explanation of how this kegare problem persists if they’re that damn powerful. And if Rokuro and Benio are more powerful than them, why are they needed? Their character designs are suppose to reflect their uniqueness, but part of the appeal of this show in the beginning was the simplicity of the standard exorcist uniform, and the fact they had the same set of skills. Then they travel to Kyoto to battle basara, but they struggle against some, easily defeat others, and simply can’t/don’t defeat others. Then the final arc comes where once again we have a villain so over powered the writers had to have him choose to not simply kill the heroes because then it’s game over. Also the plot twist at the end is so clichéd and predictable I can’t honestly recommend this show.One thing I do want to mention is this apparently isn’t based on a game, video or otherwise. The star logo upon death of kegare and the screen caps of the techniques used got old fast and annoying; I’d rather they yell them out (which they did too). A bonus point for ""Re:Call"" by i☆Ris. or explanation of how this kegare problem persists if they’re that damn powerful. And if Rokuro and Benio are more powerful than them, why are they needed?

It was recommended as popular on Crunchyroll, however I think we need to understand that 'Popular' does not equal 'good'. Was this show good? This anime at best, was average. No offense to people who actually like this show, but here is why I stopped watching the show.1. Twin Star Exorcists only ran for about 10 volumes of the manga when I started watching the anime. The show was cast to have around 50 episodes. So at some point or another, ideas were eventually going to...run out and the people responsible for creating the anime would have to create a second arc. I started watching the second arc, it was painful. There is something extremely annoying and ridiculous about a villain who introduces herself by playing rock music like shes at a concert. This villain was so weird, I honestly forgot her name at this point. With the serious tone that this show was trying to give off, its a bit hard to understand why you would have a kegare introduce herself to the audience by playing rock music. Its like shes in a pantonmine for crying out loud. I mean this show has funny moments and all, but it tries to be so dark and serious at times, I find it hard to understand where the directors actually wanted to go with the shows mood and tone.2. The inclusion of Kinako was an absolute mistake. Im surprised that I put up with him for about 20 odd episodes. Despite his cute appearance, hes a fucking brat. His attitude put me off most of time, especially whenever he spoke to Rokuro. On top of that, he adds nothing to the story. Kinako is anime exclusive and as far as I can tell, his main purpose is to serve as comic relief. You know like Gimmy and Darry from Gurren Lagann. Except in Gurren Lagaann, Gimmy and Darry actually added to the overarching story during the second act. Kinako is more like a degraded Navi from Ocarina Of Time, but more annoying.3. The story is very simple and so are its characters for the most part. Its not necesarily a bad thing, but when you have seen people like Rokuro and Benio before in different Tv Shows, you dont really seem to care as much. To its credit, Twin Star Exorcists has two interesting characters. Yuto Ijika because he has a personality that I honestly have never seen in a villain before. He shows his maniacal side more often than any other villains Ive seen. He's no Joker or Hannibal Lecter by any means, but he stood out from the rest of the crowd. Seigen was the only other character I liked because.....he reminded me of Levi from Attack On Titan. But when you can only think of two characters that you enjoyed from a show, there is a definite problem somewhere.The music I seem to have an attachment with. Yadoribosi is such a brilliant song to use in the credits and the opening songs used within the first two OPs were absolutley beautiful as well. The sounds of the kegare and all of cartoonish lazer effects work well togetherAs far as the art direction goes, its certainly one of the most colorful and cleaner animes I've seen. Though I feel Assasination Classroom is far superior in style and colour compared to Twin Star. Animation isn't really impressive either, they often recycle most of the same moves in later episodes, so nothing really feels fresh. I don't know, maybe it was to save some money so they would stay on budget.Ok look here's what I will say about Twin Star Exorcists. If you feel like you really want to see this show, then go ahead. But I can only recommend up to the 20th Episode, because after that, it goes off the manga. Yes there is a story after the manga, but its honestly not worth it in my opinion. This sort of show has been done better, years prior this run out and the people responsible for creating the anime would have to create a second arc. I started watching the second arc, it was painful. There is something extremely annoying and ridiculous about a villain who introduces herself by playing rock music like shes at a concert. This villain was so weird, I honestly forgot her name at this point. With the serious tone that this show was trying to give off, its a bit hard to understand why you would have a kegare introduce herself to the audience by playing rock music. Its like shes in a pantonmine for crying out loud. I mean this show has funny moments and all, but it tries to be so dark and serious at times, I find it hard to understand where the directors actually wanted to go with the shows mood and tone.2. The inclusion of Kinako was an absolute mistake. Im surprised that I put up with him for about 20 odd episodes. Despite his cute appearance, hes a fucking brat. His attitude put me off most of time, especially whenever he spoke to Rokuro. On top of that, he adds nothing to the story. Kinako is anime exclusive and as far as I can tell, his main purpose is to serve as comic relief. You know like Gimmy and Darry from Gurren Lagann.

The manga has a rating above 8, so surely the anime must have something to offer, right?Story:Very generic shounen stuff. Hyperactive boy wants to become stronger, is destined to become the greatest, you know the drill. If that was it, it wouldn't even be so bad, after all, a good copy is often better than something creative but bad. This however only makes up 50% of the story. The other half is everybody trying to get the main characters to have sex. It's not even subtle, like they want them to fall in love because they're so cute...together or anything, no. They try to force them to have sex as soon as possible, because they are supposed to make a super exorcist baby. This is portrayed as charming and funny and results in the most forced romance I've ever witnessed.1/10Art:Sousei no Onmyouji looks anything but impressive. The characters look very bland and blocky, so they tried to give them unique features like Rokuros shark teeth. The only thing they really paid attention to was the kegare fights, which look pretty good. Sadly, the kegare all pretty much look the same, they are just huge brown monsters.4/10Sound:I can't say anything bad about the voice acting, all pretty solid. The opening is great, I like that feudal rock style. I also enjoyed the slightly electronic fighting music.8/10Characters:None are very creative, but I wouldn't go so far to call them bland or bad. They do what they are supposed to do, but you shouldn't expect any hidden depths (at least none you don't see coming from miles away). That little fox thingy as well as the boss exorcist were pretty annoying.5/10Enjyoment:I didn't mind that this anime is nothing special, I would have been okay with a generic shounen (which it is). That second plot about the impregnating however disgusted me, so much even that I decided to stop watching. If you can laugh about something like that and if you love shounen anime, this anime might be your cup of tea, but for anybody else, just stay away from it.1/10Overall:3.8/10 together or anything, no.

The development of the story is sluggish and full of honestly boring episodes, and while there are some highlight moments(aka, the big battles), it\'s not rare to see the in-betweens not getting you excited for the next episode.Another flaw in the story is the amount of plot holes and the number of times this show gets you anticipating for nothing. I felt...I either had to wait a dozen or two episodes to finally get questions answered about stuff that changed the plot a ton, and when they did answer these questions the show seemed to be nearing its end.That being said, the ending was pretty strong and left me wanting for more, and the villians were left with good closure except for one, and that one should get a spotlight in a possible season two.Art: 9/10As it\'s a battle shounen, art is generally strong here. And this is no exception; battles are gorgeous, the gfx is beautiful and the important romance scenes are on point(With a certain dance exception)Characters: 7/10The characters in this show are overall pretty solid. I rarely see a main protagonist I actually like, and its hard to pinpoint why I like Rokuro so much; considering he\'s nothing extraordinary for a shounen. I think it\'s his relationships with characters like Sae, Seigan and so that makes him much better.My favorite character is probably Seigan. Seigan is probably one of my favorite characters from any shounen too. His character design shows an unexpected side of him you can connect as the story goes along, rather than what it may seems from the start. His development as a human from the beginning of his journey to his moments with Maurya fighting to protect Narukami. His motives are similar to the rest of the characters but with a compulsion that makes his much more interesting.My least favorite is probably Benio, the main female protagonist. She\'s not a horrible character; but I just don\'t like the way she ended up. She starts up as a badass and ends up as somewhat of a crybaby hanging on to Rokuro, as Rokuro is still standing strong. Despite her ""overcoming"" halfway through the show, it doesn\'t seem to change.Enjoyment: 8/10I enjoyed this show. I was annoyed with the story at times, but the symbolism with ordinary objects and characters(both major and minor characters) and the themes made me think more about the plot and the story.Plus, the OPs. The OPs were all awesome, however the fourth one was probably my favorite. The artwork and animation got you hyped up, the direction brought your attention to spots where you would feel emotional and intruiged, and it brought useful foreshadowing, but it also(annoyingly) brought dumb spoilers.Overall: 8/10Theres not much to say besides this show was awesome to watch. If you can move on from the giant holes in the story and the setup of it, and get to know the characters at the Seika Dorm, the Basara, and the Twelve Guardians, you\'ll fall in love with them(especially maurya) I either had to wait a dozen or two episodes to finally get questions answered about stuff that changed the plot a ton, and when they did answer these questions the show seemed to be nearing its end.That being said, the ending was pretty strong and left me wanting for more, and the villians were left with good closure except for one, and that one should get a spotlight in a possible season two.Art: 9/10As it\'s a battle shounen, art is generally strong here.

I watch anime that have a heavy romance element. Action with other elements mixed in are great, but romance is my main focus when looking for anime. Yes, the story is similar to many other anime. It felt like a mashup of D. Gray Man, Bleach, Naruto and some others. I get that's why people were not happy about the story portion. I loved it though. The relationship between Benio and Rokuro. The familial sub-story with Sae. The constant separations from Benio to protect her. Her desperation to get...back to him. I for one highly recommend the anime and hope they find a way to make a season 2 with them set to become husband and wife while still fighting to balance the world. I loved the story. The art was fantastic. The character development was gradual. And the music was cool. OP 3 was the best. Overall, I hope my review gets anyone new to the series to give it a shot. There are no shortage of below 7 ranked anime out there with a romance element. This is one of the few above that is worth your time.Thanks, Benio and Rokuro for the love. back to him.

The second half is new.By the end of the first part of the filler arc, the story seemed to be just fleshing out stuff that would help explain and wrap up open details from the manga so that they could end solidly.By the 2nd part of the filler arc, the anime just completely went off the rails, having completely changed the order of events and having thrown out whole story elements.By the end of the anime...original content, we have global genocide, eugenics, utopian slavery, the sexual assault of a minor in her sleep (and by proxy, NTR), nihilistic existentialism, and enough foreshadowed fakeouts and twists to make even Shyamalan cringe to death. Well, at least we got some nice use out of Chekov\'s Gun and saw some of the characters get more screen time than they would have gotten otherwise.Over all, I give this show a general 7/10, with some of the elements like animation and original plot occasionally dropping down to six, other elements like sound design and visual cues occasionally reaching eight, and the ending was a solid six. Had they ended it the previous episode, I\'d have given them a 4 for the ending and a 7 over all.Feel free to watch it, but I recommend World Trigger over this show. Very similar, but its a sci-fi setting instead, and the anime original content was handled much better and didn\'t interfere with the plot once the show got back on track. However, the romance element isn\'t really there (although, one might argue that having no romance is better than having a romance that is somewhat mishandled).Other recommendations include:-Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen-Ushio to Tora-Garo: Honoo no KokuinSpecific Issues:1- Animation.The animation never rises above a 7 at its best. Generally, its about 6, but the consistency is really bad, which dampens the impact of the decent and even the nice animation bits, while also making the shitty parts stand out more.2- Characters.This show wants to be a diet Bleach so fucking bad. It somehow manages to have Bleach\'s character development problems with a cast that\'s like a fourth of the size. They absolutely waste some of their ""Captains"", and everything goes to shit in the anime original stuff. I\'ll admit that some of the basara (their Arrancar) were cool and memorable, and the gyaru one kinda grows on you a little if you let her (but she\'s still an annoying git), but they are mostly wasted potential too. The romance is especially fucked in the head, and by the time you get some legit progress, the anime original content starts. What little they keep from the actual manga is completely bastardized. I will admit that the characters are fairly well designed, if a bit generic. They also have simple and stylish color palettes, and that includes the special effects and special move cut ins (for the most part).3- Plot.The first half? Decent, the manga does it better. The anime original half? BURN IT WITH FIRE.  Let me put it this way: if you get to the part where they suddenly add a bunch of new Basara, a loli, and a talking bus, you have gone TOO FAR and IT\'S TIME TO STOP. Save yourself from having whatever enjoyment you\'ve gotten out of the show thus far knocked out of you from forcefully driving past plot holes every fucking episode. Also, fuck the ending. Seriously, FUCK THE ENDING. NO. THAT WAS NOT OKAY! THEY DONE FUCKED IT UP!4- Sound Design.The music is good. It has this really cool japanese aesthetic. Its very aggressive and uses a lot of woodwinds. The first opening is really great, and the second is okay (I personally found it somewhat skippable). Hell, even some of the background OSTs and other tracks are pretty passable. That\'s not the issue. The issue is how stale it gets outside of combat scenes. It gets repetitive, and occasionally grating. The voice acting can occasionally be a little off, too. I wish they\'d \'ve added a few track remixes, or literally anything to freshen up the music. Also, gyaru cringe. I mean, I came to like her character, and that Basara is one of the few elements I ended up liking from the anime only content, but her VA is intentionally grating and speaks in an obnoxious fashion. They literally have her try to sing death metal. Emphasis on try. And yes, its a running gag. Fucking hell.Final Thoughts:You may think I hate this show. I don\'t. It just has some SERIOUS issues. The show shoots itself in the foot repeatedly after the filler arc takes over the narrative. It then tries to pass it all off as intentional and tries to weave in elements from the actual plot to somehow salvage the train wreck at hand, but it doesn\'t work well. The only stuff they somewhat pulled off was Mayura\'s arc, but they don\'t do her justice. Basically, the show would be a solid 7.5 or so without the second half fucking everything up. That being said, the second half does have a few merits (although you really have to try) and the first half is really decent. Seriously, read the manga instead, or only watch the first half of the show.

I made that review when I was Junior in high school, not noticing the problems with the anime at that time I thought it was good. Ever since then I've read the manga and realized that it was actually bad.Twin Star Exorcists (Sousei no Onmyouji) is an anime that was given the anime original route which didn't work very well. Even before the story becomes anime only, a lot was changed from the manga that makes the story worse. They added a character to the beginning that stays with...our main characters until the last episode and he served no purpose other that to drag out the romance between the main characters when in the manga he is a very loyal and somewhat respectable character that isn't introduced until much later in the story. Dialogue that was meant to have meaning behind it was completely taken out and rebranded, they just took out an important moment in the beginning between two characters for no reason. I can't stress enough how badly this anime was done wrong.... Even certain events were shown out of order when they worked better in the order they were in the manga. It just doesn't make any sense but that isn't may main issue with this adaptation.The problem with anime only route:Besides the anime completely messing up the manga content before it becomes anime original, my biggest issue with this is the anime original route they took while making it. In the anime after about 20 episodes or so (I'm just guessing off of memory) the anime turns into 100% anime original content. Events happen that don't matter, characters are introduced that don't matter, manga characters that show up much later are introduced but completely different. I can't really say much without spoiling it, but the anime just becomes horrible. In the manga our two protagonists are separated and both discover more about themselves and their intertwined fate that they are stuck with and have obstacles they must overcome and to eventually meet each other again at a certain location.I know this review went on about the manga a lot, but lets pretend the manga didn't exist and this whole anime was an anime original, it still would be bad. It's a poorly written story after it becomes anime original and that's about half of the episodes. Don't even bother watching this, just read the manga I promise you it's x100 better. I used to really like this anime until I rewatched it then decided to read the manga afterwards and realized how dirty this anime was done, it's in desperate need of a reboot that is manga canon. If you've seen the anime I suggest you start reading the manga but start from chapter 1, there's a lot of information that the anime doesn't go over that will make everything make more sense.(I wish I could give it a 1/10 but there's anime much worse than this)Final Score 4/10 our main characters until the last episode and he served no purpose other that to drag out the romance between the main characters when in the manga he is a very loyal and somewhat respectable character that isn't introduced until much later in the story. Dialogue that was meant to have meaning behind it was completely taken out and rebranded, they just took out an important moment in the beginning between two characters for no reason. I can't stress enough how badly this anime was done wrong.... Even certain events were shown out of order when they worked better in the order they were in the manga. It just doesn't make any sense but that isn't may main issue with this adaptation.The problem with anime only route:Besides the anime completely messing up the manga content before it becomes anime original, my biggest issue with this is the anime original route they took while making it. In the anime after about 20 episodes or so (I'm just guessing off of memory) the anime turns into 100% anime original content. Events happen that don't matter, characters are introduced that don't matter, manga characters that show up much later are introduced but completely different. I can't really say much without spoiling it, but the anime just becomes horrible. In the manga our two protagonists are separated and both discover more about themselves and their intertwined fate that they are stuck with and have obstacles they must overcome and to eventually meet each other again at a certain location.I know this review went on about the manga a lot, but lets pretend the manga didn't exist and this whole anime was an anime original, it still would be bad. It's a poorly written story after it becomes anime original and that's about half of the episodes. Don't even bother watching this, just read the manga I promise you it's x100 better.

I guess its because they are comparing it too much to the manga. Anyways getting right into it, I\'ll just highlight what makes this anime good in my opinion. You can skip to the bottom for a super quick summary.Story: 8Story is super simple, its the same ""secret organization needs to kill a common enemy"" simple stuff that\'s been done a million times. HOWEVER, this anime does what practically no action/romance anime ever does. They make the romance aspect of the anime undeniably linked to the action portion....In order for our heroes to beat strong enemies and get stronger themselves they have to get closer together which I have never seen before. I also like how they take a much light-hearted and comedic approach to its story.Art: 7Art is okay, it uses nice bright colors and the animation is nothing special (they do get in a few impressive scenes in though). I have to give a few extra points though for how they like to highlight their attack names when they say them. They literally pause the anime for a few seconds and display the attack name in its original language (Japanese) which I think is pretty cool, other anime might have done this but this is the first time I\'ve seen it.Sound: 9the SFX is okay and the voice acting seems natural and believable. The reason why I\'m giving sound such a high score is because of its OST. They use dubsteb and electronic pieces for the fight which is absolutely awesome. If you like that kind of genre of music I can\'t recommend it anymore.Character: 7Similar to what appealed to me in the story, the romance is a huge aspect of this anime, and the romance actually goes somewhere here (further than a lot of straight romance anime). Our leads Rokuro and Benio are pretty enjoyable to watch as they both have their own shitty pasts that drive them forward, they compliment each other, supporting each other to get over their tragic pasts. I also like the fact that the male mc, Rokuro, was NOT weak in the beginning of the anime unlike a lot of other shounen action series. The supporting casts all have their own unique place in the story and fill out missing members of our heroes\' live (parents, brothers, etc.)Enjoyment: 8I feel you can have a lot of fun with this anime. Its enjoyable to see Rokuro and Benio interact with each other and the fights are good nicely complimented with its awesome dubsteb and electronic ost.Overall: 8WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH (at least give it a try)- Romance that is deeply tied with its action- Actually having romance- Epic dubstep and electronic ost- Leads who\'s fighting style and personality nicely complimenting each other- A more light hearted and comedic shounen action story In order for our heroes to beat strong enemies and get stronger themselves they have to get closer together which I have never seen before.

In this aspect it is kinda similar to...Steins Gate; if you have watched it you might understand what I mean. But the last few episodes are better than the starting episodes and especially the last two episodes are what you are gonna be watching this anime for. Music is pretty decent and the character development is good, the story does gets predictable and its of your usual exorcist cliche type, still the ending is just too good, which makes up for the clicheness of this anime overall. I recommend this show to any new comers as well as Veterans and I guarantee, you wont be disappointed by this anime.

Something nobody has ever seen before!!!!!!!Don\'t watch this anime.Story: 4/10This Storyline is decent but very unoriginal and all the way throughout I kept referencing it to other animes such as Bleach and Blue exorcist. Although this anime is a rip off of many other animes, with the typical ""I want to get stronger"" theme it was interesting to watch. What got on my nerves however was the whole ""I want to get stronger"" but nobody would train them so In my view it didn\'t look...like they were getting any stronger It just felt like they were being supported by the love of their friends.Art:8/10The art is crisp, nothing extraordinary, but it is greater than most. I enjoyed the fight scenes they were amazing.Sound:8/10I don\'t know what to say, the sound was great I guess. The OST wasn\'t amazing except for the Opening number 3 I think. It was amazing very modern and had an amazing bass, like nothing Id heard before in Anime so I had to give it an 8.Character:8/10All though the story was just a mixture of many mainstream anime\'s out there, the character development was really good, you get an insight into many of the characters background although I would of liked to see a bit less of Rokuro\'s child friends from ages ago and more of Seigen\'s or Mayuras background sigh.Enjoyment:9/10Absolutely loved this anime, and for once loved the anime. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes Shounen, and that whole ""getting stronger"", for 50 episodes I breezed past, and it left me hanging off my chair for most parts. like they were getting any stronger It just felt like they were being supported by the love of their friends.Art:8/10The art is crisp, nothing extraordinary, but it is greater than most.

I do not know what, but something kept me going. It\'s hard to review this anime. On one hand, it has a few great moments, on the other, there are some utterly trash scenes (I nearly dropped it multiple times, it was so infuriating). The biggest problem is not this though, but that it is full of cliché, and overused tropes. The characters are one-dimensional. Some of them are plain annoying. The story and the turning points are predictable.  The fight scenes is full of reused scenes and still images. A lot of filler....Also you can find the most blatant ""will-they-won\'t-they, oh no shit happened again"" love scenes here. And so on the list is quite long.Despite all of this, it has a certain charm. First of all, an acceptable ""power couple"" is the main duo, both of them are strong, and they helping each other to move forward. The story is mainly about them. No matter how annoying their personalities are at first, as the story progresses they grows to the heart. This is due to the fact that they are undergoing some serious character development. Even though their problem-solving ability extends to the point of going head-to-head against the wall even at the end. (Because of this I appriciated the fact that the show put them in their place multiple times, and crushed their ego, but they were stubborn as hell) Also the power of love is strong with them, but I didn\'t mind. I mean literally that\'s their special power. In addition, even though the characters were one-dimensional the relationships between them were well developed, and realistic.The story doesn\'t really have much depth, but there is one thing. This lesson has been told a thousand times (especially in anime), but it is here that it struck me in my head. Is it because there was no other content? I don\'t know. Well, anyway. Everyone has an idea of a ""perfect world"" (utopia), but it is only for us. Every utopia is differ a little bit. In fact, perhaps a perfect world would be even worse than the reality. You cannot really enjoy the happiness without being sad time to time (typical buddhism so far). What\'s new here is (and resonated with my worldview) that real empathy should extend to those who you consider ""enemies"", even if you disagree with them. Sadly very few is capable of doing so.I would like to point out one more thing. The music. I wouldn\'t call it exceptional, but at least not the usual popish unmemorable anime quality, but something unique. Also the soundeffects were on point in general. For example Tenma\'s debut scene with the Butler guys was quite memorable. That sword swing aftereffect was quite amazing, you could feel the overwhelmingly immense power just by hearing it. Even though I\'m pretty sure I heard something similar before.All in all pretty mediocre show, but it is watchable. I\'m not sure, if it is worth your time especially since it\'s 50 episodes.Footnote: There was one character I quite liked, Sizu, if she was on the screen, then there is guaranteed to be some kind unpredictably absurd thing will happen.

That really is the main praise I have for the show: it doesn\'t bait the viewers or (totally) ignore the relationship between the two main characters for long stretches of episodes while making 3+ episode fights.The plot 4/10: well, it had some twists and turns and whatnot, I guess. Mostly just ""and HE was behind it the WHOLE time! It was I!"" type of thing. There is a fair amount of deus ex machina usage in the show, too.  Not much to say here, mediocre.Art 7/10: I actually liked...the art in this quite a bit. I can\'t really put my finger on it, but it\'s decently well-done.Sound 5/10: Nothing stuck out to me, so I call it average.Characters 5/10: Ok, so here\'s my main issue with this show. The ""good guys"" actually have real motivations and lore and such. The main characters\' relationship develops gradually, if not naturally. Cool. That\'s great. Good job. The ""bad guys"" are literally evil for no reason other than ""I want to be stronger and then do some diabolical thing with all of this power, muhahaha."" There\'s literally ONE villain in this entire show that has lore and motives that go beyond surface level, and maybe a couple others with extremely flimsy motives. I literally just binged the show and I already forgot half of who the villains were, because they literally just wanted to be evil.Overall enjoyment I got out of this: 6/10. If you have some, 16.5 hours to spend watching a battle/action shounen but you want to finish it within that timeframe- sure, you could watch this, but there\'s probably a couple better options provided you haven\'t watched them yet.

Benio (Main female protagonist) is a child prodigy. While she is going to Tokyo on train and it is attacked by Kegare. She exorcises them and then falls from  sky on Rokuro (Main Male protagonist). he defeats the Kegare with one shot and is shown to be stronger than her. He doesn't want to be...a Exorcist but they are supposed to be Twin star exorcist according to Arima (head priest). The story follows these two as they overcome challenges and face their tragic past and antagonists from past.I liked the story. The pacing is Great up to time skip (episode 20ish) ,then nearly up to 30 it is slow. And next 10 episodes it picks up the pace and the ending is again fast paced.ART - Animation is sometimes Great and sometimes decent. Nothing groundbreaking or something to complain about. It is GoodSOUND - I am not a sound expert but it is good. No major complainsCHARACTER - The chemistry between Rokuro and Benio is great. I enjoyed the chemistry between them.

It was perfectly paced, and didn't have me bored at any points. I could continue watching without wanting to go do something else. The one thing that does bother me about the story is how it doesn't match up with the manga, or so I've heard (I have not read the manga. I am planning on it.) But, at least for the anime, it's not a boring story.Next, the art. I was pretty disappointed at the...beginning that the art was very simple and you could notice a lot of places where they obviously rushed and it ended up looking weird. But, once I got more into the anime, the animation and the style became so much more bearable, it was rather, pretty. This is certainly not an anime where they ran out of budget near to the end and had to cut some corners. The last few episodes were gorgeous, as a matter of fact. The art gets a 7/10.Next up, we have the sound. I'll make this part quick since I spent so much time on the art part. It's okay, it's not bad but I've heard better. All of the openings were bops, not going to lie, and the soundtrack definitely helped set up the mood for certain scenes. It was better than average, but not the best. 7/10.The characters are a 7/10. The two main characters, Benio and Rokuro, weren't too bad. They were pretty predictable and genetic at first, but then they grew into more developed, and well thought-out characters that I personally connected to. The supporting cast was, not as good as the protagonists, but they weren't too bad either.The enjoyment; 8/10. I enjoyed the heck out of this anime. It took me a little more than a week to watch it because I wanted to know what happened next... It's hard to explain how I enjoyed it, but I do know for sure that I did, and I hope whoever is reading this does, too.The overall score this show gets is an 8/10. I suggest for that if you were to watch this anime, you make it past episode 30 before you judge anything. It's a common mistake on many people's parts. That's when this anime starts to form from a genetic, very average shonen exorcist anime into an anime that is so worth watching 50 episodes for. I hope everyone who gives this anime a shot enjoys it as much as I did. beginning that the art was very simple and you could notice a lot of places where they obviously rushed and it ended up looking weird.

If you're expecting side-splitting comedy, deep thought-provoking introspective or heart-wrenching emotion filled scenarios then sorry but you’re watching the wrong anime.Reviewers are a strange lot largely split into two groups - those who can review objectively (ie. I’m tasting pie so I’m going to compare it to other pies) and those who can’t (ie. why can’t this pie do press-ups and solve world peace). So really.. let’s be fair and compare apples to apples.If you generally enjoy action shounen, then Sousei no...Onmyouji delivers in buckets and will tick all the boxes you expect of a 50-espisode series. Great art and style? Check. Great Opening/Closing music? Check. Great action sequences? Check. Great backstory and plot? Check. Growth and power-up? Check! Great romance subplot? Most definitely Check!It is hard to find fault though clearly every title could be better. After Ep20 it does have a few less-interesting filler episodes (although not unexpected in anime) and there is a somewhat annoying side-character who really would not be missed (thankfully he’s sufficiently relegated to the background to be bearable). However, the payoff in the concluding episodes makes it all very worthwhile.Overall there are few anime that close out quite as completely or as satisfyingly. By the time you finish watching Sousei no Onmyouji, you can safely walk away feeling content it doesn’t *need* a season 2 and that all the major threads are sufficiently concluded.As a final comment – do go read the manga after watching this but do not compare it. The story completely deviates from Ep20 onwards and whilst this anime sticks with the aforementioned genre formula, the manga shifts tone to focus more as a traditional battle shounen title. Both are good but really quite different. Onmyouji delivers in buckets and will tick all the boxes you expect of a 50-espisode series. Great art and style? Check. Great Opening/Closing music? Check. Great action sequences? Check. Great backstory and plot? Check. Growth and power-up? Check! Great romance subplot?

After Ep20 it does have a few less-interesting filler episodes (although not unexpected in anime) and there is a somewhat annoying side-character who really would not be missed (thankfully he’s sufficiently relegated to the background to be bearable). However, the payoff in the concluding episodes makes it all very worthwhile.Overall there are few anime that close out quite as completely or as satisfyingly. By the time you finish watching Sousei no Onmyouji, you can safely walk away feeling content it doesn’t *need* a season 2 and that all the major threads are sufficiently concluded.As a final comment – do go read the manga after watching this but do not compare it. The story completely deviates from Ep20 onwards and whilst this anime sticks with the aforementioned genre formula, the manga shifts tone to focus more as a traditional battle shounen title. Both are good but really quite different."", 'What to say about this anime.Firstly the character development  in the series needed a lot of more attention, to watch all 50 episodes and the main male character does not show much or any growth is very frustrating. The main female character development during the series at least showed improvement.I feel like this series could have been cut from 50 to 24 or less episodes because to hear every episode how weak the main characters are and how they are going to get stronger and get beaten-up again makes me want to break my TV screen.There are some good moments in the series,...namely many plot twist and some true battle scenes but these are mainly done by the 12 guardians.My opinion they could have made a series focus on the 12 guardians as I found there part more entertaining than the two main characters. The series would make for a good pass the time but not one to focus on to much. namely many plot twist and some true battle scenes but these are mainly done by the 12 guardians.My opinion they could have made a series focus on the 12 guardians as I found there part more entertaining than the two main characters.

I would also agree that it is not that great, but it does have its good points.CONTAINS SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!..........STORY6/10I have not read the manga, and I do not want to judge this based on the manga, so I will give an honest review with this one. The story writers seemed like they were struggling, and the anime story severely dragged around the middle episodes. I admit that the story was going well until around episode 22, then it started going all over the place. But in the end, that all-over-the-place story was used as a ""the power of comrades"" excuse in the end. However it wasn\'t as bad as it seemed and it actually made sense because it was backed up with ""plot evidence."" So I let that slide, and I also like how the director played with the audience minds in the very end and showed us some side character development rather than a sudden ""Bleachified"" timeskip ending. All in all I didn\'t really enjoy sitting through weeks of episodes right after the drawn out Sae arc either, but the end brought back what was lacking just a little bit.ART7/10Considering the studio was Pierrot, I was actually expecting some screw-ups, but it looks like they cared more about this anime than they did for Naruto. There is some evidence here and there of obvious budget cuts but it isn\'t all that bad; but it\'s not amazing either. I rather enjoyed watching the ""resonance"" scenes, though; those kept me wanting to see more pretty pink sparkles lolother than that, the animation was relatively consistent throughout the entire anime as opposed to Naruto where you could tell where all the budget cuts were in the episodes where the character shading got shitty. Nothing like that happened in this anime, but sometimes the special effects were botched.SOUND6/10First: music. I enjoyed the soundtrack more than how the sound was edited in the anime. Mikio Endo, the composer, definitely has some potential to go very far in his musical career. ALSO: openings and endings. I really have mixed feelings for these. I disliked all the endings except the first one, really. But I liked 2 out of the 4 openings, opening 1 and 3. Opening 2 was just meh, probably because of the choice of band they used. I also didn\'t particularly feel interested with the ""Naruto-style"" opening 4, it just reminded me too much of easily skip-able Naruto openings with mediocre bands doing their best to get on par with the ""hip"" bands of today. (sorry, Naruto lovers, I do like Naruto too but I dislike the boring openings and endings).Opening 1 was DEFINITELY the best opening of the series, and actually quite possibly one of the best openings I have seen out of the hundreds of anime I have watched, which is fairly surprising. I also really liked opening 3 because of the relaxed but pumping feeling that the song gave off, especially at the part where the characters turned into puppets. (props to Tomohisa Taguchi)Second: sfx and overall audio quality. It seems like the videos\' bitrates were severely low even though the videos were in ""1080p"" HD and you could hear the audio quality waning a bit, distracting for perfectionists, lol. Also, sometimes the soundtrack just drained out the voice actors. It reminded me of ""Yona of the Dawn"" and honestly that was the number one reason why I dropped that anime; because the soundtrack drowned out the actors. It was terrible experience for me lolCHARACTER4/10Meh... that\'s really all I have to say. So what I didn\'t like the most was that both Rokuro and Benio\'s characters were too close to the stereotypical ""hero\'s journey"" heroes. (refer to Natsu and Lucy for stereotypical hero\'s journey characters) Although it seems like the ""main character"" turned into Rokuro Enmado, which made me a little mad that they neglected Benio Adashino since the writers gave her all that potential then threw in a trait that turned her into a lame duck character in 2 minutes. (refer to episode 46) Honestly the story focused mainly on those 2 and whenever side characters\' received attention, there was attention on the WRONG side characters. Don\'t get me wrong, the obnoxious screamy girl (whose name escapes me) in the Heavenly Commanders was actually a decent character but why did we need background on her instead of a more significant character like Simon or the strongest exorcist with the red hair? It made absolutely no sense to me at all right there. However I do like how the Basara were given character backgrounds. Though it just reminded me too much of ""Bleach."" Obvious inspiration.BUTI am not reluctant to say that I enjoy how both Rokuro and Benio\'s characters turned out in the end. I could not clearly see the moment when all seemed lost as well as the ""triumph"".. those were a little unclear. Rokuro went from flirtatious dousche bag in episode 1 to fairly badass and cute in the last few episodes, but that was not enough to patch up the vague missing important character traits like his attitudes towards his friends. All we got was some ""Fairy Tail"" comrade thing, so even the characters with a little bit of development were not the characters that needed it. Also I like how Benio\'s character developed much more-so than Rokuro. She went from complete tsundere in episode 1 to adorably bashful in episode 50. It was remarkable how her character was developed.Now as for the villains... all I really hated was Yuto Ijika and Kuranashi. After what thousand years of planning, Kuranashi is what, defeated by some kid with no real reason for wanting to destroy the world? Total BS asspull ""plot patch."" It was good that they gave him a reason to be jealous of Benio since he wasn\'t her, but it was ridiculous to make him so.. empty. He clearly did not have enough background to make his character appealing. Neither did filler-villain Kuranashi, which really was unnecessary.ENJOYMENT7/10Alright now.. for the reason why I stuck around with this anime. I got caught up around the airing of episode 36. So what was one of the best parts of this anime was the directing! A lot of people noticed that in the comments of various anime websites but were unsure what exactly it was that kept them watching this anime still. I enjoyed the pacing of romantic scenes as well as battles, but the surrounding ""filler"" during the long battles such as other character fights made me bored. Also the story points of Rokuro and Benio constantly failing until the very end to defeat their enemies without being OP was distracting, and made me bored as well. (gg story writers) HOWEVER I fully enjoyed the romance scenes and camera shots. Must just be the shoujo love in me, but every time they got close or blushed or came close to kissing or kissed, I got some butterflies and warm feelings and almost felt what the characters were feeling. Props to Tomohisa Taguchi! But it sucks that he is always paired with bad writers.OVERALL6/10My ratings actually are pretty spread out, but I\'ll give it overall a 6 out of 10. I would not say this anime was mediocre because there was clearly something that kept me watching, and I would say that was thanks to the well done directing by Tomohisa Taguchi, but what ALMOST made me drop it was thanks to Naruhisa Arakawa\'s poor story-telling at the most important parts of the story and dragging of key arcs; and also characters that were unnecessarily given background without it actually being utilized (i.e. that loud heavenly commander girl with the old loli woman). Also poor villain background such as Yuto Ijika and Kuranashi almost made me drop, but luckily Abe no Seimei was an OK villain (probably because he reminded me of Kagura. definitely was inspired by Naruto). All in all, NOT on the top of my ""recommendations"" list if you like anime with a fluid storyline. But I would definitely recommend it still (probably becasue of the fangirl in me) for the music (Mikio Endo), art, and enjoyment.

AT FIRST.Then, the anime somehow managed to take a 180 spin and descend into crap.I was not as disappointed in the anime as some others who were waiting for it since the debut. However, i am saddened by the fact that it actually has the potential to grow into a great anime, but not only did it fail to meet expectations, it somehow spiralled downhill for nearly every episode after its glory. So let's get into the review then.Story:As mentioned above, i loved it. The first arc of the series (15 episodes) was great! It wasn't fantastic of course, but...it delivered on all basis of  a good show. The struggles of an MC with his traumatic past, and the tragedy that befell the female MC and her quest to find a loved one. Not to mention the twist of the plot that leaves audience gaping and wanting more. Everything was there, emotions, mystery, love, struggle, comedy. After the first arc though.... the producers and animators ruined it, RUINED IT. I still can't come to terms on how much of a downward fall it took. For starters, they added near meaningless episodes into the show. Episodes that don't even needed to be there. I get that they wanted those episodes for exposition sake, but it really is NOT. Some episodes were meant to give the audience a better understanding of the characters and sympathise with them, but it was rushed, on top of the emotions and story being FORCED, resulting in a wasted episode. Second, the MC don't even matter anymore! I will elaborate more on that below. Third, where is the story!? After the first arc, the story was near to non-existent. Not only did the first arc end on a cliffhanger (only returning near the last 10 episodes), the second arc starts throwing in random short plot lines just in convenience to the story, making viewers really really bored with the plot. It only get better near the end, but even then, they decided to throw in everything at once, to resolve it in 1/5 of the series. All in all, i really couldn't sense anything good after the first arc, apart from some fight scenes and a tolerable ep 40 to 50.Art:One of the only 2 things that put this show on tolerable level. Even though the story deteriorated, the animation style is something to admire and stays consistent throughout the show. You rarely see an anime with such a unique style that complements each scene and the point they were trying to show correctly. For example: A scratchy blurry background was used to portray flashbacks. Every time a character attacks, an animation of the attack move is shown in vivid colours. This adds so much to aid a show that sometimes has to face bland coloured environment such as Magano.Sound:The other thing that helps the show rise. What's really discerning about the music is not the OP and ED, but the soundtrack. You wouldn't normally associate a hot beat when looking at the words exorcist. But the OST can convince you otherwise, serving to elevate the fight scene to exciting levels.Characters:Now, THIS IS THE MAIN REASON FOR TWIN STAR'S DOWNFALL. There is so much wrong with the characters no paragraph can fully cover it. I'm gonna try. The biggest problem with the character lies in poor handling. Many shows, if not most shows, have a large roster of characters. However, not many of these shows can correctly handle all of them without it going out of control or losing one or two characters to bad development. Sousei no Onmyouji managed to kill all of them. One of the reason the first arc was a big success was because they only had to work with a small roster. Since the second arc however, the show tried to introduce loads of characters and ended up screwing all their character traits, making most of them annoying and hated. They even tried working around the large roster by making every new character possess a distinct personality, e.g loudmouth, cheapskate, happy go lucky and rock singing. In contrast to making them more memorable, it made the characters go full fledged annoying. What's worse is that they even tried enhancing their character background with flimsy flashbacks and lousy relations and connections to one another, hoping to make the characters more lovable. What this actually does is sacrifice the MC screen time for little to no char development for the whole remaining of the show. One char even had no ties to the story at all!!! ABSOLUTELY NONE! And yet the animators dedicated an entire episode for her, just to add in the romance. In the long run, none of the characters made even an impression on the viewer, making the last episode's scramble of emotions moot. I am really disappointed at this lack of care since a lot of the characters are potentially lovable and have good base traits along with stylish fighting skills.Enjoyment: First arc, yeah. After that, no. Maybe a little bit for the endgame.Overall: If you really loved the trailer and want to watch it, then by all means. However, i recommend viewers to only watch the first 15 ep, then skip all the way to episode 34 or 35? (i can't remember). You really aren't missing much. It might even be the saving grace for your love for this anime if you cut off the middle part. it delivered on all basis of  a good show. The struggles of an MC with his traumatic past, and the tragedy that befell the female MC and her quest to find a loved one.

After that, no. Maybe a little bit for the endgame.Overall: If you really loved the trailer and want to watch it, then by all means. However, i recommend viewers to only watch the first 15 ep, then skip all the way to episode 34 or 35? (i can't remember). You really aren't missing much. It might even be the saving grace for your love for this anime if you cut off the middle part."", ""*May Contain spoilers*So first things first, I see this anime gets a lot of hate. It's not that bad that it deserves all the hate it is getting.Story 6/10The story was cliche yes, But it wasn't all that bad, Few jokes here and there. Small amount of romance. Nice fights.Art 7/10The art style is nice, the only 2 things that really tick me off are the eyes trough the hair, and every single attack ''move'' they do, they need to show the name of the move in a game style. All anime long!...Sound 7/10Nothing to interesting here.Character 6/10Your typical high school characters, Kinda slow paced development.Enjoyment 5/10The horrible jokes, The slow character progress and half of the fights are covered in names of there attacks instead of the actual fight itself.Overall 6/10Give it a try i would say if you don't know what to watch, but don't expect to be blown away!

I didn't expect to enjoy it as much! And before anyone comes out and boos me for not having a good taste in anime, I have watched SEVERAL good ones like Hyouka, Noragami, Mob Psycho 100, Boku no Hero Academia, Little Witch Academia, Kill la Kill, that anime with the guy in the pink hair that's psychic and many MANY more. This show is honestly pretty enjoyable.Story:I'd say it's not as gripping as other stories from other animes but, nonetheless I still enjoy it. As to my knowledge, the manga kind of differs from...the anime itself and I think the ending is a lot different too and there are other characters in the manga. The anime itself is about 70% its own story. There's not much of a plot and it's kind of predictable (usual hero and heroine trying to get stronger together bla bla bla). But I'd have to say, the ending did have a plot twist (I won't say much but it got more exciting towards the last few episodes)Art:I like how vivid the artwork is and how the difference between the Megano World where the Kegare lived and the human world differs. The scenes where they fight aren't as good as other shounen series but I'd still give it a good B- for it.Sound:Can't really comment much on this. I like the openings of the series (they have quite a few throughout the show).Character:I personally like the character relationships the best. The male MC gets the most attention for character development while the female MC takes a bit of a back seat somewhere towards the end (I think she took too much of a back seat though).I love the relationship growth between the two of them. Although not listed, it DOES have a romance genre to it. And it's not like other animes where there's a harem or multiple love interest and the guy or girl falls in love WAY too fast. In fact, the growth of the male MC and female MC's relationship is extremely well-paced. I never understood those animes where the girls would fall in love with the guy over just one or two instances (call me a non-romantic but I don't believe in love at first sight). You could see how they eventually started to need each other more and more, despite not liking the other at first. And about 3/4 into the series, they're like the Mum and Dad of the series because they're THAT cute of a couple and everyone just assumes they're already those old couples that's been together since forever (note they don't get together until the end even though they OBVIOUSLY love each other).Enjoyment and overall:I'd say I place this anime in my Top 15. It's not as bad as some people say it is, so just give it a shot.TL:DR; You might like this anime if you're into shounen and romance (i don't know why romance isn't listed since it's basically 70% of the damn story) the anime itself and I think the ending is a lot different too and there are other characters in the manga.

By cutting out a bunch of plot important villains of course! And add in a some random dungeon bosses that serves no purpose at all but just for shits and giggles.

The reason is simple: the development of the story was disappointing. The anime has nothing special, except the relationship between the protagonists Benio and Rokuro, which in fact is something that I had not yet seen in other anime. No more is a shonen like any other, without differentiated elements, with a complex history on the one hand and confused on the other. There is no notable character,...the relationship between Benio and Rokuro is remarkable but neither Benio nor Rokuro are remarkable, characters like they have the hills around and much more interesting. The exploration of the history of the universe of the anime itself and of the characters is flawed, there are several characters placed as powerful but have no relevance as to its history, that is, are strong, just that, neither their stories nor their personalities enchant, in fact no character comes to enchant. Not to mention that it has several characters scrotal and in scrotal costumes and with a way to be well scrotal. As for the development of the history of history is the biggest failure of the anime. For the anime was nothing special, but it is still useful for those who, like me, enjoyed anime of the genre. Not having anything special the anime should do the simple and develop the story in the simplest way possible, which was how I imagined it would be and how it looked like it would be. At the end of the day there were only disappointments left. The episodes passed and Rokuro, who in the early episodes seemed to have absurd potential seemed to weaken or did not seem to evolve as expected. At various times he could not win hollows, ops, kegares, simple. From then on a captain, ops, general to save him and Benio. Benio at first did not seem to be as powerful as Rokuro and it was not, and in the course of history neither Rokuro who seemed to be powerful, proved to be powerful. They were too weak protagonists, how much power, how much personality were reasonable and how much protagonism in history they left to be desired, I never saw an anime in which the protagonists in most moments did not lead the main battles, it was ridiculous. The fight between Benio and Kamui was certain that it would happen that it would be really cool and happened really ... just not. And to finish: neither Benio nor Rokuro nor Benio next to Rokuro were able to beat Yuto in the last battle of the anime and Rokuro was able to stop it. There was no hint that this could happen, because it was the big flaw of the anime: as for the evolution of the protagonists. In the end it was a very bad anime, it was supposed to be good, I would give a grade 1 but it was good a few moments so I thought of giving 2 but then I remembered again the moments that I was excited about the anime and got the fact that I watched all his episodes, even 50 episodes, so I closed with note 3. But in fact I should give a note 0, because all the analysis of the anime I did I would delete all just to say that this anime is a brazen plagiarism of Bleach. Including several elements of the anime, several characters are the same way of Bleach.

Example: Blue Exorcist, Nura Rise of the Yokai Clan.That art is really good and the animation is nothing to sniff at, it is very visual and pleasing to watch, especially when it comes to the fighting sequences.The story also starts off pretty well with introduction to the cast and also the slow progression into their backstory and current characterisations leading to interesting events which you are not confused/lost about. It gives you the sense of feeling for routeing for the characters as you...can understand their struggles and imagine yourself in their shoes.However after hitting around Episode 25, the series started to dull on me. The story just felt ""off"" compared to the previous half and almost felt rushed, characters suddenly know tons of ""Special Moves"" and start throwing them out non-stop as if they are nothing.That wasn\'t the case for the first half and I later learnt that after around Episode 20 the anime series goes into full Filler mode with original content made specifically for the anime only. This explained the weird feeling i felt as you can definitely see the change in Tone and Progression.It is a decent Shonen series however i prefer the first 20 episodes and think i will delve into the manga more instead. In my opinion, they would of been better off at ending after the first half and wait to make a second season that could stay closer to the original manga series.Note: If you do not read manga and only watch anime, you should have a much better time with this series than i did as it is not bad, just nothing special.This would be a 6/10 for me as i feel it just lacks in the second half. can understand their struggles and imagine yourself in their shoes.However after hitting around Episode 25, the series started to dull on me.

Let\'s begin with...==========STORY==========The story was boring, concept was nothing special, overall a big meh and a pack of nails. Mediocre to not be too harsh on it. I liked few moments, but they were overrun by all the cliches and i just can\'t stand cliches when there\'s no decent romance or an objective to accomplish. I won\'t spoil anything but i can say...it was really bad after the 20th episode. The pacing was kinda weird too, starting off quite slowly and then doing a 180 grade turn and rushing from one place to another (people who watched will understand). Overall story isn\'t a good point in this one.==========ART==========I mean it\'s hard to draw anime that\'s for sure, i have all the respect in the world for people who actually do it manually so i may not go so harsh on them. The art was good to look at, with some minor flaws in animations but it kept a fine level, the color scheme was quite wide, and... charismatic so it was easily distinguishable but other from that there was nothing wild.==========SOUND==========Some dubstep here and there, cool openings and overall voice acting was good if not very good really. But people have different tastes so i can\'t say much about it. I appreciate sound to it\'s fullest and if my leg starts moving while i listen to the music in a scene it must be at least catchy or good. Take my word for it and listen to the background, i know almost nothing to little about the shounen tropes as to music so i can\'t really tell you if it was something out of the ordinary or just another cliche. I just simply haven\'t watched so much shounens.==========CHARACTER==========Nope, terrible. Most of them are boring and bland, typical, stereotypical etc. Really bad or rather mediocre and i haven\'t grown to like any of them. And if you say that 26 episodes is much too early to say that and i couldn\'t grow to like them because i haven\'t watched the whole series, you\'re wrong. I grew personally more attached to some characters in mediocre 12episodes long anime series and if i watched whole Sousei no Onmyouji i would probably like them because of guilt, and the time i\'ve spent on them.==========ENJOYMENT==========From the 26 episode demo i\'ve brought out only the romance. And it was good. Which i\'m a big fan of, that\'s where the 7 is from. The rest i give a big 0, cause it\'s just bland bad.==========OVERALL==========Watch first 20 episodes and you\'re done.If you get past the 30 episode mark without killing yourself once you\'re a boi.If you get past the 35 episode mark without killing yourself once, you\'re a big boiIf you watch the whole series without flinching or sighing even once, you\'re a god. it was really bad after the 20th episode.

But after watching the anime, it clearly strayed off the whole original story. Which to me was a great disappointment because what I was hoping to watch was an anime adaptation of the original source. To those who aren't sure whether to watch it or not, I would say don't waste your time on it, because there were sooooo many pointless episodes, side plots, and characters. Especially the relationship between Benio and Rokuro was overly dramatized in...an unecessarry way compared to the manga. I would've been fine if the anime did stray away from the original source, in a better way than the original, or of the same greatness, however, it did not. The art style is definitely amazing, however, that seems to be the only same thing that came from the manga, besides the first couple episodes. Thus, don't waste your time watching it and instead read the manga or light novel. I have personally read the manga and I would give it a 10, as for the light novel, I have not read it yet, thus I do not know whether it is the same as the manga, but so far from what I have read from other reviews, I think they are the same, but don't take my word for it. However, it is most likely the same as the manga and better than the anime. an unecessarry way compared to the manga. I would've been fine if the anime did stray away from the original source, in a better way than the original, or of the same greatness, however, it did not. The art style is definitely amazing, however, that seems to be the only same thing that came from the manga, besides the first couple episodes. Thus, don't waste your time watching it and instead read the manga or light novel. I have personally read the manga and I would give it a 10, as for the light novel, I have not read it yet, thus I do not know whether it is the same as the manga, but so far from what I have read from other reviews, I think they are the same, but don't take my word for it.

Spoilers ahead!)Sousei no Onmyouji contains no shortage of ohagi, a Japanese sweet treat filled with rice and covered in a delectable, bean paste. I’ve never eaten the food myself; what I know of it comes from this show and the quick Google search I did in preparation for writing this anecdote out.However, I have seen all of Sousei no Onmyouji. Which is kind of like a ball of ohagi – if it were spoiled, unappetizing, and missing any semblance of nutritional value.STORYSousei no Onmyouji contains a total of fifty episodes. That number equates to a one-year...run, or, using relevant jargon, a 4-cour show. At approximately twenty-four minutes per episode, that’s twenty whole hours of content. That’s a lot by today’s standards since most projects nowadays only go for 1-cour outings with the uncommon 2-cour stretch thrown in. At twice and-or four times the length of a typical anime, the show has a ton of time to either get things right or get things wrong.Sadly, it lands somewhere hard on the latter side.The anime more or less splits up into seven distinct arcs: the Introductory Arc, the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc, the Sae Arc, the Distraction Arc, the Floating-City Arc, and the Final Arc. These arcs vary in their execution, so it is best to separate them in this fashion before looking at the show in its entirety.First comes the Introductory Arc. True to its name, these initial six episodes introduce the audience to what the tale will focus on. They present the important world-building details like the evil Kegare, the alternate dimension of Megano, and the Twelve Guardians. They establish the tenuous connection between Benio and Rokuro. They setup the Twin Star plot. Standard material that simply gets the show pointing in the right direction from the get-go.The Relationship-Building Arc comes next, and it is arguably the best arc in the series. From episode seven to episode thirteen, Rokuro and Benio not only begin to live together in a mansion gifted to them by head-exorcist Arima but also the two start to build their bond towards something meaningful (if not romantic). Big revelations, like Rokuro’s past and Benio’s indirect connection to him through her twin brother Yuto, come to light. Also, the anime does a nice job of balancing the Kegare battles with the more slice-of-life material (e.g., “Benio Special,” their faux date).This arc also shows the first major signs of problems down the line. To its credit, the concept of Resonance, where Benio and Rokuro connect on a psychological level to dish out extra spirit power, makes for a pretty cool moment. However, introducing a key part to Benio’s past – her parents’ death – and addressing it within the exact same episode mere minutes later does not make for solid writing. Regardless, this arc does enough to boost Sousei no Onmyouji’s appeal.Following a completely unnecessary recap of these first thirteen episodes in episode fourteen (wherein Mayura’s wish to have her feelings reach Rokuro only further buries her chances), the show proceeds to the Yuto Arc. While this arc contains some lighter events, such as Ryougo’s romance with Haruka, it mostly focuses on Kegare Corruption, Yuto’s villainy, and the Twin Stars overcoming their toughest trial yet.Much like the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc has its mixture of both nice and questionable writing decisions. Benio loses her legs, acting as a clever parallel to Rokuro’s lost arm. Better yet, Kamui, the Basara that killed Benio’s parents, creates them for her in a cruel twist of fate. Rokuro’s deceased friends from the Hanatsuki Tragedy then support him in his final duel with Yuto, creating an interesting (and cathartic) moment.On the less-than-ideal writing side, Mayura’s corruption occurs almost instantly after she chooses to back Rokuro’s decision to continue fighting. Reigen (Mayura’s father) somehow doesn’t perish after the buildup and emotions behind his (what should have been) sacrifice. And the whole fight against Yuto amounts to nothing when, after everything that has happened in episode nineteen and episode twenty, he presumably lives (which the show later confirms).Their failure to ever finish the job carries over into the Sae Arc. At this point, Sousei no Onmyouji’s slow decline begins. Most notably, the two-year time skip is ineffective. Despite such a shakeup to the plot, nothing of note changes between Benio and Rokuro, and this period does not affect the narrative to a worthwhile extent. It makes the audience wonder why such a skip was needed in the first place.In this arc, the anime introduces Sae herself, a little girl who cannot listen to anyone and stay put when told to do so. Again, smaller lighthearted asides, like Benio “losing” at rock-paper-scissors and Rokuro in awe of “jewelry,” try to keep that action-and-slice-of-life balance. But the anime’s incessant need to bring in a new Basaras, only for him or her to runaway soon after, overshadows these grounded moments.Episode twenty-four with the “beauty” almost-Basara and episode thirty with Sae’s departing present to her “parents” do make for interesting, even emotional scenes. But Rokuro and Benio’s relationship more or less takes a backseat to the asides, the fights, and the fleeing Basaras. A trade-off that does not pay dividends.Sae’s return to the Ame-no-mihashira marks the end of her arc and starts the Distraction Arc – and more declining. Sousei no Onmyouji continues to ignore Benio and Rokuro’s relationship because (ironically enough) it’s too distracted with letting others take care of the Basaras that popped up from the previous arc. Even when it does finally remember to address their relationship, arguably the most important aspect of the show, the plot conveniently cuts off his confession to her with a literal Earth-shattering quake.Or, even worse, it provides more unneeded recaps in episode thirty-two and, in the same episode, has the two protagonists dancing all happily to Suzu’s heavy-metal song. A moment that goes down as the most bizarre scene in the entire anime.This quake leads into the shortest arc of the lot, the Floating-City Arc. Kuranashi, the big-bad baddie who has been scheming since that time skip (and apparently for thousands of years in total), unleashes his ultimate plan using the hypnotized, miasma-filled lesser exorcists and a ginormous plant-tentacle Kegare. All to capture the Twelve Guardians to steal their power for his own. This arc is rather straightforward in that it involves lots of action and not much else save for a bit of backstory on Seigen. The only truly important development is also one of the most asinine: Yuto revives himself by double-crossing Kuranashi.Yuto’s return pushes Sousei no Onmyouji into the Final Arc and into complete decline. Disregarding the convenience surrounding Arima’s spell usage to escape death, this arc contains a heap of troubles.The whole “joining” angle is weird and uncomfortable, especially since Seimei takes the yang out of Benio’s soul regardless.Benio doesn’t comment on Yuto’s death despite the tension in their relationship and the fact that he is literally her twin brother.The Cataclysm King thread is introduced way too late at this point in the story.Rokuro being inspired by an impromptu dance number from Suzu the Basara forces the audience’s hand to their foreheads.The lose-a-teammate-at-each-junction sequence does not have the emotional weight the anime believes that it does.As a last hail-Mary attempt, the story tries to play with the idea that sin is a necessary evil. That it ultimately spawns love and happiness, making these feelings stronger as a result of the struggle and fortitude to reach them. A reasonable and thoughtful theme. However, when the show tries to say that the Kegare aren’t all evil as an argument, the idea breaks down. Killing Kegare has always been Rokuro, Benio, and everyone else’s goal. Plus, these creatures hunted and attacked humans to begin with. Double plus, the show did not do enough comparing of both sides to warrant such introspection.Due to the large number of episodes, going over the individual arcs in this fashion still did not include some other positives and most certainly left out many more negatives. Nevertheless, this breakdown should illustrate that Sousei no Onmyouji started relatively solid but eventually declined into a problematic mess.What about on an overall scale? Sadly, the mess only gets worse.For example, the show has a huge problem when it comes to the power levels involved. In essence, they have no rhyme or reason half the time. Benio and Rokuro are the Twin Star Exorcists, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc, they almost never seem to defeat their enemies or succeed in battle whatsoever. No matter if they fight on their own or with Resonance, they are weak either against the Basaras or juxtaposed with the Twelve Guardians.In fact, it’s safe to bet that they will lose in some fashion since their lousy dialogue, when they aren’t repeating the same words on strength and determination, jinxes the outcome of their fights. Classic phrases like “We got him for sure this time!” or “Is he defeated?” inevitably mean that, no, they did not in fact defeat their foe. So, on the impossible off chance that they do win, it either feels like a miracle or just doesn’t make sense.The anime also has an odd tonal issue in that the seriousness behind death and danger in their various situations rarely seems to matter. They’ll square off against a smattering of Kegare in basically the underworld to save a bunch of elementary-school kids one instant, and they’ll happily crack jokes while eating ohagi in a restaurant the next. Not to mention that these abnormal atrocities involve Rokuro and Benio when they are young teenagers and occasionally kids themselves, making their ordeals almost too outlandish.Sousei no Onmyouji also has fundamental issues. One such issue takes the form of Rokuro’s arm. Since the only weapon he has at his disposal is essentially a glorified fist, his available actions are way too restrictive. Thus, many of his fights involve lots of repetition since new moves almost never appear. Air Fissure Bullet can take care of smaller enemies, and his combos with Benio provide flashier abilities. But, in general, Rokuro only swinging his right arm unendingly cannot be deemed engaging let alone impressive.Furthermore, the Kegare fought throughout the season don’t often matter. They usually exist as just big blobs or giant animalistic, humanoid creatures that need to be slashed or exploded in nearly the exact same way. I.e., there’s rarely any tactics, strategy, or thought that goes into each skirmish besides “throw moves at them until something works.”Not to mention the lackluster writing throughout the season. Mayura’s semi-not-even love triangle had no place in the narrative when she never tries to earn Rokuro’s attention and the show is literally about him and Benio growing romantically closer. Also, in hindsight, Kegare Corruption no longer remains a talking point or potential threat after the Yuto Arc. Given its efficacy and danger, it makes very little sense for the story to almost never mention this detail again (even if Yuto’s incapacitated state renders such magic irrelevant). Arima’s Burial Ritual on Rokuro’s heart also makes very little sense when it amounts to nothing after the tension built behind such an action.The Miko angle, the arguable driving force behind the show, is the worst. Two-year time skip or no, Benio and Rokuro are way too young to have a baby. But that means that, for fifty episodes worth of content, this plot point remains a carrot on a stick forever. The audience chases after and looks forward to this development, but they never actually get to see anything related to it appear.That carrot will eventually be reached, but not before it rots away. Very much like this anime.ART & ANIMATIONUnfortunately, Sousei no Onmyouji’s art and animation do not allow it to recover much from the continual decline of its story.In the beginning of the season, the anime had at least a competent level of consistency. Benio sprints around everywhere as she fights. Rokuro destroys enemies with a starry explosion. The two engage in spats that span multiple actions and reactions. While nothing jaw-dropping occurs, the anime avoids major hiccups in the visuals presented.However, as early as episode eleven, wherein Benio’s head concaves awkwardly into itself, the anime signals the start of major errors and that it just cannot keep up. Misshapen faces due to incorrect eye placements, janky proportions, and weird expressions. Too much reused animation at times such as during Suzu’s ridiculous heavy-metal performance; lackluster animation in many of the fights and even in the most basic of interactions.A particularly egregious example goes down in episode thirty-six. Mayura talks with Benio as the two girls work to incapacitate the zombified students. When Benio responds, however, the show forgets to move her mouth and face to match her reaction and words for half the frame. So, instead of a regular delivery of her lines, the anime instead treats the audience to a static image of Benio agape a few seconds longer than intended.Yet it can have sparks of something more. The black, grainy sidebars during flashbacks make it easy to visually understand when these depicted events take place due to the old-timey film look. Furthermore, the show includes a cool stylized overlay whenever a character performs a special move. Japanese kanji crash onto the screen, colorful effects abound, and a profile shot of the character about to take action streaks open, giving the whole sequence a “It’s about to go down…” vibe.Background art generally doesn’t stick out, but, when they travel to Magano, that perspective changes. In this opposing reality, the red and brown coloring paints a dark, hellish landscape. The dilapidated buildings and destroyed streets likewise infuse the area with sadness and dread.And while the character designs are usually not impressive (Rokuro’s jagged teeth imply a sense of immaturity, Benio’s purple motif coincides with her princess persona), they can sometimes be a bit intriguing. Tatara’s emoticon face is strange but silly, and Mayura’s Kegare Corruption is wicked with her purple-and-pink hair, orange-and-black eyes, and a flower foundation.Also of note, some of the opening tracks have nice visuals, like the second’s foreshadowing of Benio’s lost legs or the fourth’s ending shot as she stands on her tippy toes to lock lips with Rokuro.It’s the third opening track, though, that turns heads with its decidedly avant-garde visuals. The Twin Stars jostle as the dinner table they sit at rotates. The light-refracting, destiny-driven puppeteering of the two heroes. That one plane which transforms into a bunch of butterflies. The focus on shapes and mirroring.A very interesting set of images indeed – but even they succumb to errors. For, once the anime realizes that the parallel shot between Rokuro and Benio standing side-by-side does not work because Rokuro weirdly shows off his Kegare arm while Benio does not show off her Kegare legs, it instead puts his arm back to normal for each time the track plays afterwards.If even the opening track’s visuals have errors (corrected or not), that should indicate well enough the weakness of the artistry overall.CHARACTERSSousei no Onmyouji contains a huge cast of characters. Much like the story, then, it’s best to break them up into particular categories: the good guys, the bad guys, and the Twin Stars themselves.Starting with the good guys, the Twelve Guardians stand out. Shimon the flame wielder, Subaru the proper, Victorian lady, and Seigen the dreary-eyed grumpy dude notably make more of a name for themselves. Shimon trained under Seigen, Subaru trained Benio (and did her best to change Rokuro and Benio’s relationship for the better), and Seigen looked after both Rokuro and Yuto while also fathering Mayura. Sakura and Miku do receive a small amount of backstory when fighting Moro, and Arima pops up from time to time with silliness and information of his own, but Shimon, Subaru, and Seigen bring the most intrigue with their seriousness, difference, and protection (respectively).In comparison, almost none of the characters from the Seika Dormitory matter – save for Ryougo. Ryougo is like an older brother to Rokuro, playing along with his teasing “servant” claims, looking out for him, believing in him, and wishing only the best for the troubled teen. He isn’t around as much throughout a sizable chunk of the middle portion of the season, but Ryougo’s kindness and maturity make him a very likable guy on top of being a worthwhile person in Rokuro’s life. So, when he falls in love with Haruka and eventually gets married to her (in the last episode no less), he definitely deserves such happiness.As for the extra side characters, Sousei no Onmyouji focuses mostly on Mayura, Sae, and Kinako. Mayura is Rokuro’s childhood friend. She has supported him throughout his entire life, and she befriends Benio to somewhat melt the unfriendly girl’s icy shell. The time skip sees her becoming a full-fledged exorcist, and, during the Floating-City Arc, she even commands her father’s Guardian power when they work together to stall Kuranashi. Her presumed-inevitable romance with Shimon also makes for a nice bit of recompense since her feelings for Rokuro were doomed from the very start.Sae the tree branch and Kinako the familiar also receive attention. Sae has one major role: showcasing the Twin Stars as potential parents. A role she takes on well with her memorization of Benio’s Ohagi Man Song and calling Rokuro “Papa.” Kinako serves Benio and belittles Rokuro, but he also has much more important duties like providing transportation and creating comedic relief here and there. He even gets nearly all of episode thirty-one to himself when his backstory and beginnings with Benio play out.In total, the good guys may not contribute a ton to Sousei no Onmyouji in a critical or impactful sense, but they at least do not take anything away from the show by their inclusion. A sentiment that cannot be said of the bad guys.To put it lightly, the villains of the anime are horrible in their construction. Many of the lesser Basaras miss out on crucial connections to the story in that they show up, leave, and show up once more only to perish in the their second arrival. They can have an inkling of characterization, like Yamato wanting to upstage Kuranashi or Chijiwa (mistakenly) seeking revenge against Benio and Rokuro for his deceased twin brother (killed by Kuranashi). Moreover, they are fodder in the grand scheme of things. But their relevance is way too flimsy for supposed threats.The greater Basaras consist of Kuranashi, Suzu, and Kamui. Kuranashi (initially) becomes the main antagonist after the time skip (in episode twenty) but only indirectly. He does not directly take part in any fights or says anything worthwhile until his duel with Arima (in episode thirty-three). Even then, his motivations are not revealed until later (in episode thirty-eight) where his “just in it for the entertainment” answer is eye-rolling in its lameness. Despite having this “elaborate” plan concocted and executed perfectly over the course of 1000 years, his death (in episode forty-one) leaves him unable to accomplish anything and turns him into a completely uninteresting baddie.Suzu and Kamui aren’t as prevalent as Kuranashi (indirectly or otherwise), but their neutral stances amidst the warring that goes on certainly makes them more interesting. However, they still hurt Sousei no Onmyouji’s overall execution nonetheless. Disregarding Suzu’s off-kilter songs, she conveniently appears whenever or wherever she wants.And Kamui did have potential given his dual connection to Benio for killing her parents and granting her Kegare legs. However, he also has a lame motivation with “just in it to fight strong opponents” and, after episode twenty, he doesn’t reappear until episode forty-nine. As if the anime forgot about him then hurriedly shoved him back in. The kicker, though? His arc is left open-ended come the end of the season, so his reappearance didn’t matter to begin with.Abe no Seimei is not a Basara, but he opposes everyone all the same. He at least has a definitive motive – eradicating all sin to form a serendipitous world of nothing but unending happiness – but his random inclusion, his boring, emotionless personality, and obvious-not-obvious familiar who leads the Twelve Guardians in Arima’s absence fail to make him a worthwhile enemy as well.Suppose one views all these bad guys like the good guys in that many of them are not really that important. This scenario still leaves Yuto who no doubt is important – and who goes down as the worst character in the anime and one of the worst villains in the medium.As a kid, Yuto did not respect his parents for touting ideals without accomplishments of their own. He also hated Benio for always being weak. So, it comes as no surprise that this selfish misanthrope goes off the deep end and forcefully corrupts the children of the Hanatsuki Tragedy into Kegare.Thus, the anime sets Yuto up as a rather vile, hate-worthy character. Most of this information comes from episode nine when Yuto officially appears for the very first time. To which he promptly disappears for eight more episodes, interfering not at all until episode seventeen. It’s not until episode nineteen where he unveils his motivation. That, similar to Kuranashi and Kamui, is way too lame: “just want to be the strongest exorcist.”Credit where credit is due, Yuto is a downright annoying antagonist. But his maniacal, powerful self doesn’t come from a solid foundation but rather loose writing. The “twist” about his birth, how he is an accidental byproduct of Benio’s spiritual conception, comes way too late (in episode forty-six) and as an uncared for heap of exposition.Regardless, he miraculously loses to Rokuro and Benio in episode twenty – and then he does not show up again until episode forty-two. Like Kamui, that’s a long time to go without the main antagonist. Not a peep and barely a mention of him occurs in this twenty-two-episode span, but his final return sees him randomly resting out of nowhere in the Ame-no-mihashira, conveniently beating Kuranashi at his own scheming game, and magically earning omnipotence.Sousei no Onmyouji tries to slightly redeem Yuto’s character when it ramps up his obsession with Rokuro to somewhere beyond just old pals. Moreover, they liken his existence to less of a nemesis and more of a fate-bound catalyst. Yet, when the anime shoehorns in some last-minute backstory about him and Rokuro right before his death, this mistimed and mishandled info reminds the audience of Yuto’s abysmal construction.Combined with the fact that the anime does not go into detail on how Yuto learned the dark art of Kegare Corruption. And that the anime does not explore his past relationships with his parents or Benio. And that the anime does not even explain how or why he wears an eyepatch. It all adds up into one pathetic character, villain, or any other related moniker that can be given to such an asinine cast member.While the good guys and the bad guys have their parts to play in the show, they are not the stars (in more ways than one). That honor goes to the main protagonists: Rokuro and Benio.Before Rokuro and Benio eventually teamed up, they lived separate yet similar lives. Lives whose origins the audience sees through a series flashbacks that span the first twenty episodes. Rokuro was found somewhere in Megano, he survived the Hanatsuki Tragedy instigated by Yuto, and he quit being an exorcist as a result of his inability to save his friends. Benio looked up to her twin brother Yuto, lost her parents right before her eyes to Kamui the Basara in Megano, and she steeled herself to become stronger than ever.So, when these two (eventual) lovebirds first “meet” (quotes because this meeting involves Rokuro jumping off a bridge to catch a falling, unconscious Benio), they exist on opposite sides of the spectrum despite the similarities in their traumatic pasts. They don’t initially know what each one went through, though, meaning Rokuro’s immaturity and Benio’s standoffish personality puts them on an unfriendly basis from the get-go.Not long after, Arima declares Benio and Rokuro the Twin Star Exorcists. Which means that, besides their immense potential as exorcists, they are destined to conceive the Miko, the child who will end the Kegare threat forevermore. Naturally, this inevitably means love, marriage, and bedroom fun.So, the two start to grow closer together. Arima’s free-mansion giveaway and Subaru’s guiding hand spring up events like a missing hairpiece and feeding food to the other at a pancake restaurant. Rokuro’s indirect connection to Benio through Yuto almost destroys their relationship in episode nine, but, thankfully, the truth of the situation comes out, and they become ever closer still in a mutual pact of their own choosing.Their relationship moves forward a major step when they support one another in their first (and only) fight against Kamui. In unison, they perform Resonance, an ability that only the Twin Stars are capable of using to empower their respective halves and in turn permitting more winning opportunities. Afterwards, they are put in their place mentally when they cannot help as intended, they perfect their use of Resonance, and, in the process of “defeating” Yuto, Rokuro upgrades his arm and Benio “upgrades” her legs.At this point, the underlying theme of these characters becomes quite clear: One can go it alone, but a partner makes life much more remarkable. The purposeful relationship between Rokuro and Benio, the importance placed on their union both in the fights and in the future, and even the title of the anime itself (Twin Star Exorcists) point at the idea that a person can accomplish much, much more than they thought possible if he or she relies on another.Arguably, Sousei no Onmyouji takes it one level further with the romance angle, advocating to some degree that love can overcome any of life’s obstacles. Benio and Rokuro are individually strong, but, as their feelings for each other grow, they bolster the other both physically and emotionally. However, the show keeps the base of its theme going with its other characters as well. Mayura and her father Seigen. Ryougo and his wife Haruka. Even on the Basara side with Chijiwa and his counterpart Momochi.In total, the theme itself is not exactly explored. While all these relationships exist, the anime doesn’t spend much time expounding on the importance of such connections with either words or intermittent challenges. Indeed, it places focus more so on the many battles and the must-get-stronger mindset. Nevertheless, such bonds improve their capabilities for the better.Unfortunately, following the time skip, Benio and Rokuro do not evolve their relationship much (if at all). Despite living together and fighting together and doing everything together, almost nothing has happened or changed between the two for two whole years. Even disregarding this fact, the newer characters, the increased amount of unrelated action, and the need to push the plot along get in the way of blossoming their love.As the final thirteen or so episodes roll around, the show finally gets back to their relationship. A love letter to Rokuro makes Benio want to know Rokuro’s feelings about her. And Rokuro, turning down that written confession, thinks more seriously about the topic. While their exchange of love gets interrupted more times than a comedian bombing on stage, a curry conversation here and a hill tumble there bring them slowly and ever-so-close to the next part of their progression.But not before events tear them apart. Benio’s near death at the hands of (a returning) Yuto forces Rokuro to reconsider his relationship with her. Extra information about his past and his role as the Cataclysm King comes forth too, redoubling his rethinking. After much thought, he casts Benio aside in a rather heartbreaking manner. A strange choice given the entire point of the show and their characters specifically is how their bond means more than anything they could do alone.Still, Rokuro wants to keep Benio safe and does not want to tie her down to a Kegare (i.e., himself), so he burdens the troubles and the worries by his lonesome. Once he transforms, and having already realized her feelings for him, Benio makes the extremely difficult decision of sacrificing herself to save Rokuro, knowing that she may never, ever see him again.Yet Benio believes in Rokuro’s perseverance. Included yin-yang parallels aside, Rokuro, now back to normal, steels himself (with the help of Arima, Suzu, Kinako, Mayura, and his other friends) to save Benio from Abe no Seimei’s clutches. While Benio’s hairpin-laser-connector plan seems a little wacky even within the context of the anime, their confession in episode forty-nine more than makes up for it. Rokuro and Benio bicker atop the blossomed Ame-no-mihashira as a major clash between spirit dragons goes on in the background. Their lover’s quarrel leads to him kissing her and her kissing him in a double exchange of emotions that connects them back together in wonderful fashion.Their final Resonance of the season relies less on their relationship and more on the (spiritual) support of the many people they met and interacted with throughout the season, tying back to the characters’ central idea. Thus, they save the world, and the two somewhat embarrass themselves at Ryougo’s wedding. Their sincere speech then gives way to Rokuro gifting Benio a new set of hair clips, matching the same event between the two just before the two-year skip. Only this time, they end it on a kiss, letting the audience understand that these two have and will have each other to make their lives remarkable forevermore.Altogether, Benio and Rokuro are not strong characters. They are not weak characters either. The show simply forgets to expound on them come the middle of the season, preventing their growth beyond a middling level. On top of the passable good guys and the abhorrent bad guys, the execution here just does not end up anywhere favorable.MUSIC & SOUNDSousei no Onmyouji lands everywhere on the execution map when it comes to its music and sound design. For example, the opening tracks go in different directions when compared to one another to add some much-needed diversity.“Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-,” the first OP, uses shamisen for a cultural feel and punctual breaks in the tempo to bring on the intensity. “Re:Call,” the second OP, incorporates a steadier beat and set of vocals, but the song stays around for too many episodes after the narrative’s time skip (if the visuals are any indication) where the body of the plot has already shifted.“sync” (no capital “s”), the third OP, moves between a male and female vocalist as a hip-hop groove with shouts and drops keeps the flow of the piece (coincidentally enough) in sync. And “Kanadeai,” the fourth and final OP, takes on a sentimental, rock ‘n’ roll tone for a more thoughtful song to lead out the season.Overall, these opening tracks are some of the best parts of Sousei no Onmyouji. In comparison, the ending tracks do not contain as much variety since they each aim for a romantic vibe. They also do not reach the same level of intrigue.Nevertheless, they still work within the confines of the show. “Eyes,” the first ED, brings in daintier instrumentals whereas “Yadoriboshi,” the second ED, brings in piano and violin to back its grandiose composition. “Hide and Seek,” the third ED, gets more fun with a faster pace and its volley of triplets, and “Hotarubi” returns to that cultural feel while mixing together subdued and boisterous segments.Elsewhere besides the start and the finale of each episode, the original soundtrack hits highs and lows. Interesting tracks such as the 8-bit-esque and flute-like tunes for its slice-of-life moments help the mood. But the electronic, dubstep pieces, like the one with the distorted monster voices most often played when Kegare appear, do not mesh too well with the setting and the premise and the action at hand.Doubly so for Suzu’s metal performance in episode twenty-two. A song that leaves the audience nothing short of flabbergasted at its inclusion, head-shaking at its corny lyrics and weak vocal delivery.Besides the OST, Sousei no Onmyouji contains a couple of very interesting audio tricks. Most notably, in episode sixteen, when Rokuro and Benio use Resonance consciously for the first time, the anime employs a back-and-forth voiceover with Rokuro only speaking in the right ear and Benio only speaking in the left ear.And, speaking of voice acting, while the performances aren’t the most impressive across the board, Megumi Han as Benio and Natsuki Hanae as Rokuro still deserve props. They scream as fervently and as often as possible throughout each fight and during their different moves. So much so that one hopes they had a few cough drops on hand to stave off injury.ENJOYMENTDespite how much I have written against this anime up to this point, I can’t say that I despise it. “Hate” is too harsh of a word, too. Instead, I simply very strongly dislike most things about the show.My dislike stems from multiple aspects – Yuto chief among them. Seriously. He’s the absolute worst part of the show. I cannot stand him as a character; he’s much too infallible. I am also not fond of Arima. I could do without his “comedy,” and his general worthlessness throughout almost the entire season despite literally being in charge of the Exorcist Union.The action is another large factor. Admittedly, I’m not the biggest fan of action-oriented shows, but what goes on here treads way too far into sameness. Considering how much fighting goes on, I usually found myself disinterested in the proceedings. Along the same lines, the drama involved rarely pulled me in, and the show didn’t have as much of a thematic presence as I would have liked.Glimpses of fun exist within all this mud. Mayura’s silly name-calling insults had me chuckling. Subaru was attractive with her teasing attitude, air of decadence, and fan usage. Ryougo was a pretty cool dude too, for I liked his brotherly persona in relation to Rokuro. And I actually laughed at Tenma demonstrating his almighty powers by yelling at the Dragon Spot to close and Cordelia cursing in English with her robotic voice.Unfortunately, these characters and their qualities cannot always be around, so they do not necessarily wash away the dirt that follows the negatives I have with the show.As for the Twin Stars, I do find Rokuro and Benio (Benio more so) likable to an extent. Rokuro can get a bit righteous at times, but he has his heart in the right place. And Benio’s quiet behavior contrasts with her occasional outbursts of silliness and passion to make her more than meets the eye.However, their romance caught my attention the most. Seeing them struggle to get along when first encountering each other. The hand-holding scenes and signs of affection before the middle portions. Their ultimate confession of love with kisses to boot. I found myself smiling on more than one occasion as their feelings for each other grew.But I still have a gripe: The romance just isn’t around enough. I’m reiterating myself at this point, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc and the Yuto Arc, their bond drowns in a vat of stagnation. Even when the Floating-City Arc resurfaces those lovey-dovey feelings, three separate interruptions prolong what should have been said between the two literal in-universe years prior.Forgiving those scenes, the final stretch still doesn’t prioritize the romance until episode forty-four where Rokuro pushes Benio away to protect her and episode forty-seven where Benio sacrifices herself to bring Rokuro back. I do really like their shared confession, but it also makes me wonder what could have been had their relationship always remained at the forefront.Sousei no Onmyouji delivers a show that hobbles along and crumbles apart the whole way through. Over the course of fifty episodes, the broken storytelling, the inexcusable artistic issues, the weak character writing, the mediocre audio offerings, and the low level of entertainment make for an ohagi overdose that upsets the stomach for much too long and without hardly any tangible benefits.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a narrative replete with problematic individual arcs and a laundry list of overarching issues that decline this tale into a complete messArt & Animation: Bad, the visuals clearly cannot keep up as fewer frames and extra errors steadily emerge, but the world of Megano and some interesting artistic choices inject much-needed flairCharacters: Bad, the good guys pass but lack impact, the bad guys contribute nothing but lameness, Yuto is one of worst villains ever, and both Benio and Rokuro did not receive as much focus as they requiredMusic & Sound: Fine, a diverse set of OPs, an average set of EDs, a mixture of nice and questionable tracks in the OST, a cool back-and-forth technique, and lots of shouting from the VA performances allow the audio to stand at least uprightEnjoyment: Bad, some funny insults, a curse word, and a few likable characters fail to form a worthwhile experience as annoying characters, boring action, and missing romance hamper the projectFinal Score: 2/10 run, or, using relevant jargon, a 4-cour show. At approximately twenty-four minutes per episode, that’s twenty whole hours of content. That’s a lot by today’s standards since most projects nowadays only go for 1-cour outings with the uncommon 2-cour stretch thrown in. At twice and-or four times the length of a typical anime, the show has a ton of time to either get things right or get things wrong.Sadly, it lands somewhere hard on the latter side.The anime more or less splits up into seven distinct arcs: the Introductory Arc, the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc, the Sae Arc, the Distraction Arc, the Floating-City Arc, and the Final Arc. These arcs vary in their execution, so it is best to separate them in this fashion before looking at the show in its entirety.First comes the Introductory Arc. True to its name, these initial six episodes introduce the audience to what the tale will focus on. They present the important world-building details like the evil Kegare, the alternate dimension of Megano, and the Twelve Guardians. They establish the tenuous connection between Benio and Rokuro. They setup the Twin Star plot. Standard material that simply gets the show pointing in the right direction from the get-go.The Relationship-Building Arc comes next, and it is arguably the best arc in the series. From episode seven to episode thirteen, Rokuro and Benio not only begin to live together in a mansion gifted to them by head-exorcist Arima but also the two start to build their bond towards something meaningful (if not romantic). Big revelations, like Rokuro’s past and Benio’s indirect connection to him through her twin brother Yuto, come to light. Also, the anime does a nice job of balancing the Kegare battles with the more slice-of-life material (e.g., “Benio Special,” their faux date).This arc also shows the first major signs of problems down the line. To its credit, the concept of Resonance, where Benio and Rokuro connect on a psychological level to dish out extra spirit power, makes for a pretty cool moment. However, introducing a key part to Benio’s past – her parents’ death – and addressing it within the exact same episode mere minutes later does not make for solid writing. Regardless, this arc does enough to boost Sousei no Onmyouji’s appeal.Following a completely unnecessary recap of these first thirteen episodes in episode fourteen (wherein Mayura’s wish to have her feelings reach Rokuro only further buries her chances), the show proceeds to the Yuto Arc. While this arc contains some lighter events, such as Ryougo’s romance with Haruka, it mostly focuses on Kegare Corruption, Yuto’s villainy, and the Twin Stars overcoming their toughest trial yet.Much like the Relationship-Building Arc, the Yuto Arc has its mixture of both nice and questionable writing decisions. Benio loses her legs, acting as a clever parallel to Rokuro’s lost arm. Better yet, Kamui, the Basara that killed Benio’s parents, creates them for her in a cruel twist of fate. Rokuro’s deceased friends from the Hanatsuki Tragedy then support him in his final duel with Yuto, creating an interesting (and cathartic) moment.On the less-than-ideal writing side, Mayura’s corruption occurs almost instantly after she chooses to back Rokuro’s decision to continue fighting. Reigen (Mayura’s father) somehow doesn’t perish after the buildup and emotions behind his (what should have been) sacrifice. And the whole fight against Yuto amounts to nothing when, after everything that has happened in episode nineteen and episode twenty, he presumably lives (which the show later confirms).Their failure to ever finish the job carries over into the Sae Arc. At this point, Sousei no Onmyouji’s slow decline begins. Most notably, the two-year time skip is ineffective. Despite such a shakeup to the plot, nothing of note changes between Benio and Rokuro, and this period does not affect the narrative to a worthwhile extent. It makes the audience wonder why such a skip was needed in the first place.In this arc, the anime introduces Sae herself, a little girl who cannot listen to anyone and stay put when told to do so. Again, smaller lighthearted asides, like Benio “losing” at rock-paper-scissors and Rokuro in awe of “jewelry,” try to keep that action-and-slice-of-life balance. But the anime’s incessant need to bring in a new Basaras, only for him or her to runaway soon after, overshadows these grounded moments.Episode twenty-four with the “beauty” almost-Basara and episode thirty with Sae’s departing present to her “parents” do make for interesting, even emotional scenes. But Rokuro and Benio’s relationship more or less takes a backseat to the asides, the fights, and the fleeing Basaras. A trade-off that does not pay dividends.Sae’s return to the Ame-no-mihashira marks the end of her arc and starts the Distraction Arc – and more declining. Sousei no Onmyouji continues to ignore Benio and Rokuro’s relationship because (ironically enough) it’s too distracted with letting others take care of the Basaras that popped up from the previous arc. Even when it does finally remember to address their relationship, arguably the most important aspect of the show, the plot conveniently cuts off his confession to her with a literal Earth-shattering quake.Or, even worse, it provides more unneeded recaps in episode thirty-two and, in the same episode, has the two protagonists dancing all happily to Suzu’s heavy-metal song. A moment that goes down as the most bizarre scene in the entire anime.This quake leads into the shortest arc of the lot, the Floating-City Arc. Kuranashi, the big-bad baddie who has been scheming since that time skip (and apparently for thousands of years in total), unleashes his ultimate plan using the hypnotized, miasma-filled lesser exorcists and a ginormous plant-tentacle Kegare. All to capture the Twelve Guardians to steal their power for his own. This arc is rather straightforward in that it involves lots of action and not much else save for a bit of backstory on Seigen. The only truly important development is also one of the most asinine: Yuto revives himself by double-crossing Kuranashi.Yuto’s return pushes Sousei no Onmyouji into the Final Arc and into complete decline. Disregarding the convenience surrounding Arima’s spell usage to escape death, this arc contains a heap of troubles.The whole “joining” angle is weird and uncomfortable, especially since Seimei takes the yang out of Benio’s soul regardless.Benio doesn’t comment on Yuto’s death despite the tension in their relationship and the fact that he is literally her twin brother.The Cataclysm King thread is introduced way too late at this point in the story.Rokuro being inspired by an impromptu dance number from Suzu the Basara forces the audience’s hand to their foreheads.The lose-a-teammate-at-each-junction sequence does not have the emotional weight the anime believes that it does.As a last hail-Mary attempt, the story tries to play with the idea that sin is a necessary evil. That it ultimately spawns love and happiness, making these feelings stronger as a result of the struggle and fortitude to reach them. A reasonable and thoughtful theme. However, when the show tries to say that the Kegare aren’t all evil as an argument, the idea breaks down. Killing Kegare has always been Rokuro, Benio, and everyone else’s goal. Plus, these creatures hunted and attacked humans to begin with. Double plus, the show did not do enough comparing of both sides to warrant such introspection.Due to the large number of episodes, going over the individual arcs in this fashion still did not include some other positives and most certainly left out many more negatives. Nevertheless, this breakdown should illustrate that Sousei no Onmyouji started relatively solid but eventually declined into a problematic mess.What about on an overall scale? Sadly, the mess only gets worse.For example, the show has a huge problem when it comes to the power levels involved. In essence, they have no rhyme or reason half the time. Benio and Rokuro are the Twin Star Exorcists, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc, they almost never seem to defeat their enemies or succeed in battle whatsoever. No matter if they fight on their own or with Resonance, they are weak either against the Basaras or juxtaposed with the Twelve Guardians.In fact, it’s safe to bet that they will lose in some fashion since their lousy dialogue, when they aren’t repeating the same words on strength and determination, jinxes the outcome of their fights. Classic phrases like “We got him for sure this time!” or “Is he defeated?” inevitably mean that, no, they did not in fact defeat their foe. So, on the impossible off chance that they do win, it either feels like a miracle or just doesn’t make sense.The anime also has an odd tonal issue in that the seriousness behind death and danger in their various situations rarely seems to matter. They’ll square off against a smattering of Kegare in basically the underworld to save a bunch of elementary-school kids one instant, and they’ll happily crack jokes while eating ohagi in a restaurant the next. Not to mention that these abnormal atrocities involve Rokuro and Benio when they are young teenagers and occasionally kids themselves, making their ordeals almost too outlandish.Sousei no Onmyouji also has fundamental issues. One such issue takes the form of Rokuro’s arm. Since the only weapon he has at his disposal is essentially a glorified fist, his available actions are way too restrictive. Thus, many of his fights involve lots of repetition since new moves almost never appear. Air Fissure Bullet can take care of smaller enemies, and his combos with Benio provide flashier abilities. But, in general, Rokuro only swinging his right arm unendingly cannot be deemed engaging let alone impressive.Furthermore, the Kegare fought throughout the season don’t often matter. They usually exist as just big blobs or giant animalistic, humanoid creatures that need to be slashed or exploded in nearly the exact same way. I.e., there’s rarely any tactics, strategy, or thought that goes into each skirmish besides “throw moves at them until something works.”Not to mention the lackluster writing throughout the season. Mayura’s semi-not-even love triangle had no place in the narrative when she never tries to earn Rokuro’s attention and the show is literally about him and Benio growing romantically closer. Also, in hindsight, Kegare Corruption no longer remains a talking point or potential threat after the Yuto Arc. Given its efficacy and danger, it makes very little sense for the story to almost never mention this detail again (even if Yuto’s incapacitated state renders such magic irrelevant). Arima’s Burial Ritual on Rokuro’s heart also makes very little sense when it amounts to nothing after the tension built behind such an action.The Miko angle, the arguable driving force behind the show, is the worst. Two-year time skip or no, Benio and Rokuro are way too young to have a baby. But that means that, for fifty episodes worth of content, this plot point remains a carrot on a stick forever. The audience chases after and looks forward to this development, but they never actually get to see anything related to it appear.That carrot will eventually be reached, but not before it rots away. Very much like this anime.ART & ANIMATIONUnfortunately, Sousei no Onmyouji’s art and animation do not allow it to recover much from the continual decline of its story.In the beginning of the season, the anime had at least a competent level of consistency. Benio sprints around everywhere as she fights. Rokuro destroys enemies with a starry explosion. The two engage in spats that span multiple actions and reactions. While nothing jaw-dropping occurs, the anime avoids major hiccups in the visuals presented.However, as early as episode eleven, wherein Benio’s head concaves awkwardly into itself, the anime signals the start of major errors and that it just cannot keep up. Misshapen faces due to incorrect eye placements, janky proportions, and weird expressions. Too much reused animation at times such as during Suzu’s ridiculous heavy-metal performance; lackluster animation in many of the fights and even in the most basic of interactions.A particularly egregious example goes down in episode thirty-six. Mayura talks with Benio as the two girls work to incapacitate the zombified students. When Benio responds, however, the show forgets to move her mouth and face to match her reaction and words for half the frame. So, instead of a regular delivery of her lines, the anime instead treats the audience to a static image of Benio agape a few seconds longer than intended.Yet it can have sparks of something more. The black, grainy sidebars during flashbacks make it easy to visually understand when these depicted events take place due to the old-timey film look. Furthermore, the show includes a cool stylized overlay whenever a character performs a special move. Japanese kanji crash onto the screen, colorful effects abound, and a profile shot of the character about to take action streaks open, giving the whole sequence a “It’s about to go down…” vibe.Background art generally doesn’t stick out, but, when they travel to Magano, that perspective changes. In this opposing reality, the red and brown coloring paints a dark, hellish landscape. The dilapidated buildings and destroyed streets likewise infuse the area with sadness and dread.And while the character designs are usually not impressive (Rokuro’s jagged teeth imply a sense of immaturity, Benio’s purple motif coincides with her princess persona), they can sometimes be a bit intriguing. Tatara’s emoticon face is strange but silly, and Mayura’s Kegare Corruption is wicked with her purple-and-pink hair, orange-and-black eyes, and a flower foundation.Also of note, some of the opening tracks have nice visuals, like the second’s foreshadowing of Benio’s lost legs or the fourth’s ending shot as she stands on her tippy toes to lock lips with Rokuro.It’s the third opening track, though, that turns heads with its decidedly avant-garde visuals. The Twin Stars jostle as the dinner table they sit at rotates. The light-refracting, destiny-driven puppeteering of the two heroes. That one plane which transforms into a bunch of butterflies. The focus on shapes and mirroring.A very interesting set of images indeed – but even they succumb to errors. For, once the anime realizes that the parallel shot between Rokuro and Benio standing side-by-side does not work because Rokuro weirdly shows off his Kegare arm while Benio does not show off her Kegare legs, it instead puts his arm back to normal for each time the track plays afterwards.If even the opening track’s visuals have errors (corrected or not), that should indicate well enough the weakness of the artistry overall.CHARACTERSSousei no Onmyouji contains a huge cast of characters. Much like the story, then, it’s best to break them up into particular categories: the good guys, the bad guys, and the Twin Stars themselves.Starting with the good guys, the Twelve Guardians stand out. Shimon the flame wielder, Subaru the proper, Victorian lady, and Seigen the dreary-eyed grumpy dude notably make more of a name for themselves. Shimon trained under Seigen, Subaru trained Benio (and did her best to change Rokuro and Benio’s relationship for the better), and Seigen looked after both Rokuro and Yuto while also fathering Mayura. Sakura and Miku do receive a small amount of backstory when fighting Moro, and Arima pops up from time to time with silliness and information of his own, but Shimon, Subaru, and Seigen bring the most intrigue with their seriousness, difference, and protection (respectively).In comparison, almost none of the characters from the Seika Dormitory matter – save for Ryougo. Ryougo is like an older brother to Rokuro, playing along with his teasing “servant” claims, looking out for him, believing in him, and wishing only the best for the troubled teen. He isn’t around as much throughout a sizable chunk of the middle portion of the season, but Ryougo’s kindness and maturity make him a very likable guy on top of being a worthwhile person in Rokuro’s life. So, when he falls in love with Haruka and eventually gets married to her (in the last episode no less), he definitely deserves such happiness.As for the extra side characters, Sousei no Onmyouji focuses mostly on Mayura, Sae, and Kinako. Mayura is Rokuro’s childhood friend. She has supported him throughout his entire life, and she befriends Benio to somewhat melt the unfriendly girl’s icy shell. The time skip sees her becoming a full-fledged exorcist, and, during the Floating-City Arc, she even commands her father’s Guardian power when they work together to stall Kuranashi. Her presumed-inevitable romance with Shimon also makes for a nice bit of recompense since her feelings for Rokuro were doomed from the very start.Sae the tree branch and Kinako the familiar also receive attention. Sae has one major role: showcasing the Twin Stars as potential parents. A role she takes on well with her memorization of Benio’s Ohagi Man Song and calling Rokuro “Papa.” Kinako serves Benio and belittles Rokuro, but he also has much more important duties like providing transportation and creating comedic relief here and there. He even gets nearly all of episode thirty-one to himself when his backstory and beginnings with Benio play out.In total, the good guys may not contribute a ton to Sousei no Onmyouji in a critical or impactful sense, but they at least do not take anything away from the show by their inclusion. A sentiment that cannot be said of the bad guys.To put it lightly, the villains of the anime are horrible in their construction. Many of the lesser Basaras miss out on crucial connections to the story in that they show up, leave, and show up once more only to perish in the their second arrival. They can have an inkling of characterization, like Yamato wanting to upstage Kuranashi or Chijiwa (mistakenly) seeking revenge against Benio and Rokuro for his deceased twin brother (killed by Kuranashi). Moreover, they are fodder in the grand scheme of things. But their relevance is way too flimsy for supposed threats.The greater Basaras consist of Kuranashi, Suzu, and Kamui. Kuranashi (initially) becomes the main antagonist after the time skip (in episode twenty) but only indirectly. He does not directly take part in any fights or says anything worthwhile until his duel with Arima (in episode thirty-three). Even then, his motivations are not revealed until later (in episode thirty-eight) where his “just in it for the entertainment” answer is eye-rolling in its lameness. Despite having this “elaborate” plan concocted and executed perfectly over the course of 1000 years, his death (in episode forty-one) leaves him unable to accomplish anything and turns him into a completely uninteresting baddie.Suzu and Kamui aren’t as prevalent as Kuranashi (indirectly or otherwise), but their neutral stances amidst the warring that goes on certainly makes them more interesting. However, they still hurt Sousei no Onmyouji’s overall execution nonetheless. Disregarding Suzu’s off-kilter songs, she conveniently appears whenever or wherever she wants.And Kamui did have potential given his dual connection to Benio for killing her parents and granting her Kegare legs. However, he also has a lame motivation with “just in it to fight strong opponents” and, after episode twenty, he doesn’t reappear until episode forty-nine. As if the anime forgot about him then hurriedly shoved him back in. The kicker, though? His arc is left open-ended come the end of the season, so his reappearance didn’t matter to begin with.Abe no Seimei is not a Basara, but he opposes everyone all the same. He at least has a definitive motive – eradicating all sin to form a serendipitous world of nothing but unending happiness – but his random inclusion, his boring, emotionless personality, and obvious-not-obvious familiar who leads the Twelve Guardians in Arima’s absence fail to make him a worthwhile enemy as well.Suppose one views all these bad guys like the good guys in that many of them are not really that important. This scenario still leaves Yuto who no doubt is important – and who goes down as the worst character in the anime and one of the worst villains in the medium.As a kid, Yuto did not respect his parents for touting ideals without accomplishments of their own. He also hated Benio for always being weak. So, it comes as no surprise that this selfish misanthrope goes off the deep end and forcefully corrupts the children of the Hanatsuki Tragedy into Kegare.Thus, the anime sets Yuto up as a rather vile, hate-worthy character. Most of this information comes from episode nine when Yuto officially appears for the very first time. To which he promptly disappears for eight more episodes, interfering not at all until episode seventeen. It’s not until episode nineteen where he unveils his motivation. That, similar to Kuranashi and Kamui, is way too lame: “just want to be the strongest exorcist.”Credit where credit is due, Yuto is a downright annoying antagonist. But his maniacal, powerful self doesn’t come from a solid foundation but rather loose writing. The “twist” about his birth, how he is an accidental byproduct of Benio’s spiritual conception, comes way too late (in episode forty-six) and as an uncared for heap of exposition.Regardless, he miraculously loses to Rokuro and Benio in episode twenty – and then he does not show up again until episode forty-two. Like Kamui, that’s a long time to go without the main antagonist. Not a peep and barely a mention of him occurs in this twenty-two-episode span, but his final return sees him randomly resting out of nowhere in the Ame-no-mihashira, conveniently beating Kuranashi at his own scheming game, and magically earning omnipotence.Sousei no Onmyouji tries to slightly redeem Yuto’s character when it ramps up his obsession with Rokuro to somewhere beyond just old pals. Moreover, they liken his existence to less of a nemesis and more of a fate-bound catalyst. Yet, when the anime shoehorns in some last-minute backstory about him and Rokuro right before his death, this mistimed and mishandled info reminds the audience of Yuto’s abysmal construction.Combined with the fact that the anime does not go into detail on how Yuto learned the dark art of Kegare Corruption. And that the anime does not explore his past relationships with his parents or Benio. And that the anime does not even explain how or why he wears an eyepatch. It all adds up into one pathetic character, villain, or any other related moniker that can be given to such an asinine cast member.While the good guys and the bad guys have their parts to play in the show, they are not the stars (in more ways than one). That honor goes to the main protagonists: Rokuro and Benio.Before Rokuro and Benio eventually teamed up, they lived separate yet similar lives. Lives whose origins the audience sees through a series flashbacks that span the first twenty episodes. Rokuro was found somewhere in Megano, he survived the Hanatsuki Tragedy instigated by Yuto, and he quit being an exorcist as a result of his inability to save his friends. Benio looked up to her twin brother Yuto, lost her parents right before her eyes to Kamui the Basara in Megano, and she steeled herself to become stronger than ever.So, when these two (eventual) lovebirds first “meet” (quotes because this meeting involves Rokuro jumping off a bridge to catch a falling, unconscious Benio), they exist on opposite sides of the spectrum despite the similarities in their traumatic pasts. They don’t initially know what each one went through, though, meaning Rokuro’s immaturity and Benio’s standoffish personality puts them on an unfriendly basis from the get-go.Not long after, Arima declares Benio and Rokuro the Twin Star Exorcists. Which means that, besides their immense potential as exorcists, they are destined to conceive the Miko, the child who will end the Kegare threat forevermore. Naturally, this inevitably means love, marriage, and bedroom fun.So, the two start to grow closer together. Arima’s free-mansion giveaway and Subaru’s guiding hand spring up events like a missing hairpiece and feeding food to the other at a pancake restaurant. Rokuro’s indirect connection to Benio through Yuto almost destroys their relationship in episode nine, but, thankfully, the truth of the situation comes out, and they become ever closer still in a mutual pact of their own choosing.Their relationship moves forward a major step when they support one another in their first (and only) fight against Kamui. In unison, they perform Resonance, an ability that only the Twin Stars are capable of using to empower their respective halves and in turn permitting more winning opportunities. Afterwards, they are put in their place mentally when they cannot help as intended, they perfect their use of Resonance, and, in the process of “defeating” Yuto, Rokuro upgrades his arm and Benio “upgrades” her legs.At this point, the underlying theme of these characters becomes quite clear: One can go it alone, but a partner makes life much more remarkable. The purposeful relationship between Rokuro and Benio, the importance placed on their union both in the fights and in the future, and even the title of the anime itself (Twin Star Exorcists) point at the idea that a person can accomplish much, much more than they thought possible if he or she relies on another.Arguably, Sousei no Onmyouji takes it one level further with the romance angle, advocating to some degree that love can overcome any of life’s obstacles. Benio and Rokuro are individually strong, but, as their feelings for each other grow, they bolster the other both physically and emotionally. However, the show keeps the base of its theme going with its other characters as well. Mayura and her father Seigen. Ryougo and his wife Haruka. Even on the Basara side with Chijiwa and his counterpart Momochi.In total, the theme itself is not exactly explored. While all these relationships exist, the anime doesn’t spend much time expounding on the importance of such connections with either words or intermittent challenges. Indeed, it places focus more so on the many battles and the must-get-stronger mindset. Nevertheless, such bonds improve their capabilities for the better.Unfortunately, following the time skip, Benio and Rokuro do not evolve their relationship much (if at all). Despite living together and fighting together and doing everything together, almost nothing has happened or changed between the two for two whole years. Even disregarding this fact, the newer characters, the increased amount of unrelated action, and the need to push the plot along get in the way of blossoming their love.As the final thirteen or so episodes roll around, the show finally gets back to their relationship. A love letter to Rokuro makes Benio want to know Rokuro’s feelings about her. And Rokuro, turning down that written confession, thinks more seriously about the topic. While their exchange of love gets interrupted more times than a comedian bombing on stage, a curry conversation here and a hill tumble there bring them slowly and ever-so-close to the next part of their progression.But not before events tear them apart. Benio’s near death at the hands of (a returning) Yuto forces Rokuro to reconsider his relationship with her. Extra information about his past and his role as the Cataclysm King comes forth too, redoubling his rethinking. After much thought, he casts Benio aside in a rather heartbreaking manner. A strange choice given the entire point of the show and their characters specifically is how their bond means more than anything they could do alone.Still, Rokuro wants to keep Benio safe and does not want to tie her down to a Kegare (i.e., himself), so he burdens the troubles and the worries by his lonesome. Once he transforms, and having already realized her feelings for him, Benio makes the extremely difficult decision of sacrificing herself to save Rokuro, knowing that she may never, ever see him again.Yet Benio believes in Rokuro’s perseverance. Included yin-yang parallels aside, Rokuro, now back to normal, steels himself (with the help of Arima, Suzu, Kinako, Mayura, and his other friends) to save Benio from Abe no Seimei’s clutches. While Benio’s hairpin-laser-connector plan seems a little wacky even within the context of the anime, their confession in episode forty-nine more than makes up for it. Rokuro and Benio bicker atop the blossomed Ame-no-mihashira as a major clash between spirit dragons goes on in the background. Their lover’s quarrel leads to him kissing her and her kissing him in a double exchange of emotions that connects them back together in wonderful fashion.Their final Resonance of the season relies less on their relationship and more on the (spiritual) support of the many people they met and interacted with throughout the season, tying back to the characters’ central idea. Thus, they save the world, and the two somewhat embarrass themselves at Ryougo’s wedding. Their sincere speech then gives way to Rokuro gifting Benio a new set of hair clips, matching the same event between the two just before the two-year skip. Only this time, they end it on a kiss, letting the audience understand that these two have and will have each other to make their lives remarkable forevermore.Altogether, Benio and Rokuro are not strong characters. They are not weak characters either. The show simply forgets to expound on them come the middle of the season, preventing their growth beyond a middling level. On top of the passable good guys and the abhorrent bad guys, the execution here just does not end up anywhere favorable.MUSIC & SOUNDSousei no Onmyouji lands everywhere on the execution map when it comes to its music and sound design. For example, the opening tracks go in different directions when compared to one another to add some much-needed diversity.“Valkyrie -Ikusa Otome-,” the first OP, uses shamisen for a cultural feel and punctual breaks in the tempo to bring on the intensity. “Re:Call,” the second OP, incorporates a steadier beat and set of vocals, but the song stays around for too many episodes after the narrative’s time skip (if the visuals are any indication) where the body of the plot has already shifted.“sync” (no capital “s”), the third OP, moves between a male and female vocalist as a hip-hop groove with shouts and drops keeps the flow of the piece (coincidentally enough) in sync. And “Kanadeai,” the fourth and final OP, takes on a sentimental, rock ‘n’ roll tone for a more thoughtful song to lead out the season.Overall, these opening tracks are some of the best parts of Sousei no Onmyouji. In comparison, the ending tracks do not contain as much variety since they each aim for a romantic vibe. They also do not reach the same level of intrigue.Nevertheless, they still work within the confines of the show. “Eyes,” the first ED, brings in daintier instrumentals whereas “Yadoriboshi,” the second ED, brings in piano and violin to back its grandiose composition. “Hide and Seek,” the third ED, gets more fun with a faster pace and its volley of triplets, and “Hotarubi” returns to that cultural feel while mixing together subdued and boisterous segments.Elsewhere besides the start and the finale of each episode, the original soundtrack hits highs and lows. Interesting tracks such as the 8-bit-esque and flute-like tunes for its slice-of-life moments help the mood. But the electronic, dubstep pieces, like the one with the distorted monster voices most often played when Kegare appear, do not mesh too well with the setting and the premise and the action at hand.Doubly so for Suzu’s metal performance in episode twenty-two. A song that leaves the audience nothing short of flabbergasted at its inclusion, head-shaking at its corny lyrics and weak vocal delivery.Besides the OST, Sousei no Onmyouji contains a couple of very interesting audio tricks. Most notably, in episode sixteen, when Rokuro and Benio use Resonance consciously for the first time, the anime employs a back-and-forth voiceover with Rokuro only speaking in the right ear and Benio only speaking in the left ear.And, speaking of voice acting, while the performances aren’t the most impressive across the board, Megumi Han as Benio and Natsuki Hanae as Rokuro still deserve props. They scream as fervently and as often as possible throughout each fight and during their different moves. So much so that one hopes they had a few cough drops on hand to stave off injury.ENJOYMENTDespite how much I have written against this anime up to this point, I can’t say that I despise it. “Hate” is too harsh of a word, too. Instead, I simply very strongly dislike most things about the show.My dislike stems from multiple aspects – Yuto chief among them. Seriously. He’s the absolute worst part of the show. I cannot stand him as a character; he’s much too infallible. I am also not fond of Arima. I could do without his “comedy,” and his general worthlessness throughout almost the entire season despite literally being in charge of the Exorcist Union.The action is another large factor. Admittedly, I’m not the biggest fan of action-oriented shows, but what goes on here treads way too far into sameness. Considering how much fighting goes on, I usually found myself disinterested in the proceedings. Along the same lines, the drama involved rarely pulled me in, and the show didn’t have as much of a thematic presence as I would have liked.Glimpses of fun exist within all this mud. Mayura’s silly name-calling insults had me chuckling. Subaru was attractive with her teasing attitude, air of decadence, and fan usage. Ryougo was a pretty cool dude too, for I liked his brotherly persona in relation to Rokuro. And I actually laughed at Tenma demonstrating his almighty powers by yelling at the Dragon Spot to close and Cordelia cursing in English with her robotic voice.Unfortunately, these characters and their qualities cannot always be around, so they do not necessarily wash away the dirt that follows the negatives I have with the show.As for the Twin Stars, I do find Rokuro and Benio (Benio more so) likable to an extent. Rokuro can get a bit righteous at times, but he has his heart in the right place. And Benio’s quiet behavior contrasts with her occasional outbursts of silliness and passion to make her more than meets the eye.However, their romance caught my attention the most. Seeing them struggle to get along when first encountering each other. The hand-holding scenes and signs of affection before the middle portions. Their ultimate confession of love with kisses to boot. I found myself smiling on more than one occasion as their feelings for each other grew.But I still have a gripe: The romance just isn’t around enough. I’m reiterating myself at this point, but, after the Relationship-Building Arc and the Yuto Arc, their bond drowns in a vat of stagnation. Even when the Floating-City Arc resurfaces those lovey-dovey feelings, three separate interruptions prolong what should have been said between the two literal in-universe years prior.Forgiving those scenes, the final stretch still doesn’t prioritize the romance until episode forty-four where Rokuro pushes Benio away to protect her and episode forty-seven where Benio sacrifices herself to bring Rokuro back. I do really like their shared confession, but it also makes me wonder what could have been had their relationship always remained at the forefront.Sousei no Onmyouji delivers a show that hobbles along and crumbles apart the whole way through. Over the course of fifty episodes, the broken storytelling, the inexcusable artistic issues, the weak character writing, the mediocre audio offerings, and the low level of entertainment make for an ohagi overdose that upsets the stomach for much too long and without hardly any tangible benefits.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a narrative replete with problematic individual arcs and a laundry list of overarching issues that decline this tale into a complete messArt & Animation: Bad, the visuals clearly cannot keep up as fewer frames and extra errors steadily emerge, but the world of Megano and some interesting artistic choices inject much-needed flairCharacters: Bad, the good guys pass but lack impact, the bad guys contribute nothing but lameness, Yuto is one of worst villains ever, and both Benio and Rokuro did not receive as much focus as they requiredMusic & Sound: Fine, a diverse set of OPs, an average set of EDs, a mixture of nice and questionable tracks in the OST, a cool back-and-forth technique, and lots of shouting from the VA performances allow the audio to stand at least uprightEnjoyment: Bad, some funny insults, a curse word, and a few likable characters fail to form a worthwhile experience as annoying characters, boring action, and missing romance hamper the projectFinal Score: 2/10', 'Overall Rating: 6/10Story: Protagonist has special power that he uses to destroy monsters. Said special power is a double edged sword and can hurt him and his allies. The story as far as I\'ve seen is nothing special. It\'s not particularly interesting but is okay for burning time if you have a lot to spend.Art: Mediocre. Characters seem too 2 dimensional. I\'m aware that we are watching through a screen but would it kill them to make the characters not look like cardboard cut outs?Sound: Not repulsive but not great either. Background music was lame. Fight music was good. Opening song was not particularly great.Character:...MC has deep scars that he has to overcome. Female protagonist seems to want to stand as his equal which is better than most animes now-a-days. The story progression so far indicates that there will be some small amount of character growth. The reason this gets a Fair is that the background characters are have little individual personality of their own. Its easy to lump the MCs roomates together as ""roomates"".Enjoyment: Traditional ecchi humor combined with other comedic moments and regular fight scenes makes me give this somewhat enjoyable.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------#Little prior note.I had rather conflicted feelings regarding this Anime on every category.✦StoryFirst of all. It\'s a bit ""different"" from the usual battle shounens. We still get all the shounen tropes but rather blatant, sometimes stupefied and modernized.Whilst story is rather well wrapped up and put together. Has plenty of ""f u"" moments in a form of ""plot twists"" or ""reveals"". Story is pushed onward and developed. But at the same time I feel that most of the things were just intentionally created in a way...that somehow uses all the shounen tropes but seriously dumbs them up. As well I felt that too many plot points were simply created to screw with the viewer and kill the buzz.Another thing I didn\'t really enjoy is how ""modernized"" it felt. Although I love onmyouji type of magic or spell circles or runes.. I were rather disappointed in this one. I remember seeing episode 1 when it aired few years ago. I were rather ""oh yeah.. this seems like my type of Anime"", but now that I watched it I simply felt underwhelmed. Although spirit magic was used, and in unique way of having combo power. (twin stars) it still felt rather ""bland"". All the weird awakenings, power ups, reveals and so on as well felt very weak. They didn\'t give that ""punch"" that this sort of Anime should deliver.And another thing I disliked is rather puppeteered together couple. The whole premise feels as arrange marriage. Hence another story element of this Anime. Romance, which was surprisingly enjoyable by the end. It has some sweet moments and a very heartwarming smile. Although even by the end of the series I still don\'t ship the main couple, it was nevertheless fairly enjoyable and sweet love story.To sum it up. Once again, story is a tad more different, unique and rather nicely put together throughout the whole experience. BUT, aside it not hitting my likes/tastes, it still felt rather blatant and dull and modernized in a not a particularly good ways. As well it suffers some plot point ""screw you"" the viewer and very, VERY oddly explained and uncovered story aspect moments.✦Art  & SoundArt & Animation was colorful, had style, some cool character designs and variations. But some rather derp and odd faces and facial expressions. Most fights were pleasant to look at and even though it had really weird and random bland powerups and such, they were still pretty nice.Music... It was good? I guess. I noticed every soundtrack there, which means it\'s rather present there. But at the same time for the most part I weren\'t sure I like the soundtrack or not. Some gave off really weird feeling and odd. Not that much of a positive viewpoint though. Also for sure it was rather ""modern"" styled, which again. Not sure I personally liked as much. Openings and Endings were solid enough.✦CharacterFirst the good. Development, progression was rather nice.Now the not so good. Again, rather obvious stereotypes with modern touch to them. Which is simply not a pleasant mix. Not fan of ""modernity"", got enough of that in western media. Anyhow, we get plenty of characters, some really interesting ones, some useless ones, some annoying ones. Also plenty of couples and ships to ship. But I still like Mayura (female support) the most and ship her with Rokuro. (male lead)Benio (the female lead) did annoy me at the start rather fair bit. And even by the end I weren\'t particularly her fan, but I grew to like her. I did like a lot when she spoke with soothing voice and her real smiles.Anyhow, fair enough. Plenty of issues and taste mismatches. But in the end, it\'s acceptable.✦Enjoyment & OverallSome aspects I forgot to mention and can\'t be bothered to. But to sum it up. It\'s ""modernized"" battle shounen romance that seriously lacks a punch and has rarther a lot of ""oddity"" to it in more of a negative spotlight. that somehow uses all the shounen tropes but seriously dumbs them up.

TWIN STAR EXORCIST was another cliche anime with random bullshit of a story.Story-4/10So basically A person planned everything for thousands of years but was manipulated by 16 years old boy, but that boy itself was an unnecessary existence, and all this was a part of another person plan who was planning everything for thousands of years. Yeah well I don't know should I have been excited or disappointed by such storywriting. Also the story has a lots of twists and turns which do not...have any explanation whatsoever.At time at Conclusion i felt that this was some fake ripoff of Naruto. The protagonist basically has a kurama mode going on at some places. Then there is some dude who is trying to wipe the World with some kind of tree, seems Familiar?Art-7/10The only thing I liked about the anime was its Art. It highlights some moments bcuz of its bright colour.Overall 5 /10The only reason I am giving this a 5 is bcuz of the Art TBH. have any explanation whatsoever.At time at Conclusion i felt that this was some fake ripoff of Naruto.

It goes from watching two people that are struggling with their own past traumas work to overcome them to reach their goals to ""We will win with the power of love and friendship"". The first 20 or so episodes were dark and gritty with emotionally charged fights that were amplified by the characters. Most of the characters that fought...all had their own reasons and will to fight and had to go through the process of bolstering their resolve through encounters with an antagonist that was able to challenge said resolve. Speaking of antagonist encounters, the first major villain introduced at around episode 9 was so close to being the perfect conniving, manipulative little rat. He worked so well to get in the mind of Rokuro and Benio to slowly crush their will to fight. Where they failed was giving him actual motivation for his actions beyond wanting power for the sake of having it. They explain why he\'s so evil near the end of the show but it was essentially saying ""he is evil because he has to be evil"" which genuinely made me laugh out loud the first time I heard it. It\'s a shame because any time he was in the presence of the two MCs, there was always an epic fight with immense emotional weight backing it. Each fight kept building this emotional weight until it reached it\'s first apex, and it as at this point that you could almost pinpoint the exact moment the show started to go downhill. During this fight, Rokuro ended up transforming into a new form which gave him the upper hand in the fight and won. This transformation was the first peek into what the rest of the show was going to be like and it ruined it. The show suddenly went from being visceral and relatively grounded to exploring the concept of universal balance and the nature of existence. From this point on the show started slowly descending into unintelligible gibberish and removed all ability to feel anything for any of the plot points for the rest of the show. It started with the transformation, then rifts in reality, then the origin of the boundary between life and death, then the world as we know it being reset. The show basically ended up doing in 50 episodes what Naruto took to do in 500. At this point the show had essentially devolved into that clip of Fouseytube going through a manic episode in public except over the course of several months.Art 7/10The art in this show can be quite good at times but loses steam really early on. You can tell that at a certain point the artists just gave up trying and started reusing animations that they used from the first 10 episodes. The first time you see a character perform a special attack is really cool. Everything goes monochromatic and there\'s a special animation to show the name of the attack, but then they use that same animation again for a different move, and they reuse the animation literally every single time the character uses said attack. It starts to come across as lazy and uninspired and looks like an episode of Power Rangers. Other than that, there\'s nothing else I can really say about the animation quality; it\'s fine I guess just not very memorable.Sound 7/10Much like the art in this show, the sound design and music can be good at times but quickly becomes lazy and repetitive. They use the same sound effects for each special attack and it gets tired really fast.Character 7.5/10I give this section an additional half point because of what it could have been and the potential that was there. Every character in this show has the foundations to be an incredible and interesting one if they had just fleshed them out beyond what was necessary for them to be serviceable characters. Rokuro has the personality quirks and backstory to make him a very interesting anti-hero. A character with commendable strength of will and a kind soul buried underneath unrelenting trauma and an impulsive and emotional heart is one that\'s practically begging to be put in that role. The first main villain has everything he needs to be the perfect foil to Rokuro except for a compelling reason to be that villain. Further on in the show, the characters devolve into nothing more than existing for the sake of the power of friendship.Enjoyment 8/10Again, had the show gone in a different direction near the end I might have enjoyed it much more than I did. I was still entertained all the way to the end but I just felt that it had deviated too far from what I loved so much about it in the beginning. The show isn\'t actually boring just very ""It was cool"" and nothing else.Overall 7/10I feel like I just don\'t really have that strong of an opinion on this show one way or another. I used to feel somewhat conflicted with how the show was handled but the more I thought about it the less I cared for it. If you\'re looking for a fun show to watch or just really like the theme then I say go for it. It isn\'t a complete waste of time nor is it the best thing ever made; it\'s just a fun show with some interesting enough characters that make you want to see what happens. However, I do think the beginning of the show carries it pretty much all the way to the end. all had their own reasons and will to fight and had to go through the process of bolstering their resolve through encounters with an antagonist that was able to challenge said resolve.

Further on in the show, the characters devolve into nothing more than existing for the sake of the power of friendship.Enjoyment 8/10Again, had the show gone in a different direction near the end I might have enjoyed it much more than I did. I was still entertained all the way to the end but I just felt that it had deviated too far from what I loved so much about it in the beginning. The show isn\'t actually boring just very ""It was cool"" and nothing else.Overall 7/10I feel like I just don\'t really have that strong of an opinion on this show one way or another. I used to feel somewhat conflicted with how the show was handled but the more I thought about it the less I cared for it. If you\'re looking for a fun show to watch or just really like the theme then I say go for it. It isn\'t a complete waste of time nor is it the best thing ever made; it\'s just a fun show with some interesting enough characters that make you want to see what happens. However, I do think the beginning of the show carries it pretty much all the way to the end.', 'I actually enjoyed the show in a capacity of taking it for what it was, a shounen action ""romance"" anime that, if I\'m honest, didn\'t fill me with hope at first time of finding it.Still, really happy i gave it a chance for it is pleasant and above all, easy watching. Characters motivations, both hero and villain, are at the same time easy and hard to understand, which makes it easy to empathize with,while at the same time, keeping you hooked and awaiting the next turn and twist.Action-wise, the fight scenes are kinda choppy and there really no fluidity except for the ""major"" battles, and...even those fall a bit short of the standards for a modern action show. On the plus though, there\'s very little talking during these fights and you normally get a clear winner 6/10.Romance-wise, its what you expect from the label, nothing really happens, but there\'s a natural progression in which you truly feel there\'s an evolution in the way the couple progresses through the story, individually and regarding each other. For some this will be too little and others will find it reasonable,I found myself liking it for the most part 7/10.Be warned however, it\'s not perfect. Plot has some major (imo) holes, particularly near the end and A LOT of convenience (which is to be expected when not following the source). The romance is what you expect really, a lot of ""implied"" and blushing but nothing ""concrete"" until the very end.In conclusion, if you\'re looking for a masterpiece 10/10 this ain\'t it, however if you\'re looking for solid, easy, entertaining watch then this is the show for you.Major No: Benio\'s VA\'s performance/script was a major no for me, felt really forced and at times like she had a speech impediment/slow thinking.Major Yes: Ijiika Yuto, is just a huge yes, from the character to the script, to the performance, everything is absolutely perfect.Overall, barely 7/10. Mainly due to the musical act. You\'ll understand. even those fall a bit short of the standards for a modern action show.

Really enjoyable. 8/10Episode 20-30: Filler??? 5/10Episode 30-50: Obito absorbs all the Bijūs except the 8- and 9-tails, but gets swallowed by Black Zetsu before he can really do anything.

This special was EXTREMELY special, and featured all Zakenna, Uzainaa, Kowainaa, and Hoshinaa come together as one MEGA MONSTER, a shadow that wants to simply envelop everything in darkness! (generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I I haven\'t given it a 10/10 because of everyone\'s complaint: It lacks a bit of individual interaction between the characters (and characters interaction is the main reason of this movie). But I really liked the dynamics between them. It\'s not just them simply becoming friends, there are different styles. I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue. I don\'t think...this is a negative point, it\'s just the role Pretty Cure 5 were assigned. Then we have Max Heart squad, which I felt they\'re the overappreciated, but this time in fights. Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue. In other squads, the leaders kinda overshadowed the rest of the members (Luminous was the most overshadowed of all). The fights were freaking good, the animation was fluid and pretty powerful. The hits were charged full of force and triggered devastating reactions.

But this isn\'t even the biggest problem, the problem is the story itself.It is amazing how this movie contradicts itself in a matter of minutes. The villain\'s goal is to make everything be one thing, and then he starts, only he never really absorbs the powers he needs for this, even with many opportunities (nothing convenient, right?). Now comes the ultimate contradiction: The villain spends the...entire movie saying that everything must become one thing, and the characters rebut by saying no, because each person has their own feelings, and guess what? Yes, in the end they use the powers they get for another convenience and speak that their powers and their feelings are one. WTF????? The whole movie is passing a supposed message that each one is each one, and in the end the characters themselves say that their feelings are the same? For them it may become one, but the villain can\'t do the same just for being the villain, right? It\'s amazing how things contradict themselves just for the ""sake of it"".The only thing that saves this movie are the action scenes. entire movie saying that everything must become one thing, and the characters rebut by saying no, because each person has their own feelings, and guess what?

This special was EXTREMELY special, and featured all Zakenna, Uzainaa, Kowainaa, and Hoshinaa come together as one MEGA MONSTER, a shadow that wants to simply envelop everything in darkness! (generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

(generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue.

Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue.

They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD!

This special was EXTREMELY special, and featured all Zakenna, Uzainaa, Kowainaa, and Hoshinaa come together as one MEGA MONSTER, a shadow that wants to simply envelop everything in darkness! (generic villains work when they\'re essentially made to be destroyed by the Cures every week, so it\'s fine). All the fairies had a meeting in the Palmier Kingdom about the dangerous unnamed shadow thing, which has been appearing and attacking all of the groups of Precures and absorbing their attacks, then leaving. They also put a different set of mascots with each set of characters (for...instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc). This was a great way to set this up, and ended up with Chiffon being left alone holding a Miracle Light and everyone was afraid she got absorbed. Eventually the shadow thing makes the entire sky turn black and EVERY CURE meets up downtown at the central areaIt\'s SOOO badass when they have their theme songs play as they kick ass to their own monsters from their seasons, and we get to really see the differences in combat here: Black and White rely on pure physical power almost exclusively and Hikari uses hope and light, Saki and Mai have these ""forcefield"" powers in the series (they have unnamed magic abilities, like the ability to charge up and blast themselves into the sky or make a magic shield to lessen an impact), Yes 5 relies on weaponry AND physical-based magic (Sapphire Arrow, Prism Chain, Shooting Star, etc) and Fresh does more of a Dance Dance Revolution game than a fight XD everything is amazingly choreographed and all of the characters pop right off the screen, none overshadowing another one. They\'re all just as entertaining, and they all combine of the greatest power ups ever seen: Extreme Luminario, Twin Stream Splash, and Rainbow Rose Explosion combined with a new attack from Fresh that looks like a TRIPLE BLAST AT ONCE that I haven\'t seen in the series yet, and the monster is destroyed. Before long the movie has ended not overstaying its welcome and we get lots of credit shots of all the Cures bondingIt was amazing to see Yes 5 try to find the Tako Cafe, while Saki and Mai visit Nuts House and Nagisa goes to Pan Paka Pan to try the chocolate cornets XDDDD and we get a group photo of everyone, mascots included, as the final credit scene, all smashed into a huge photo XDDDD! In case you couldn\'t tell I think I\'m loving All Stars this is easily the best part of the series and this one gets a solid 9/10! instance, Saki and Mai met Coco and Nuts, and Yes 5 met Lulun, etc).

I I haven\'t given it a 10/10 because of everyone\'s complaint: It lacks a bit of individual interaction between the characters (and characters interaction is the main reason of this movie). But I really liked the dynamics between them. It\'s not just them simply becoming friends, there are different styles. I kinda got the vibes that Pretty Cure 5 are the most appreciated (by very very few). Maybe it has something to do with them being the biggest squad, but I felt like Nozomi led a very bit the dialogue. I don\'t think...this is a negative point, it\'s just the role Pretty Cure 5 were assigned. Then we have Max Heart squad, which I felt they\'re the overappreciated, but this time in fights. Splash Star squad hasn\'t been given a special treat in my opinion, they were just part of the nostalgic element along with Pretty Cure Max Heart. And Fresh Pretty Cure were like the newbies, I really loved this. They were the ones that fell in dispair, that were trapped inside Fusion, that were been saved by the rest. Specially in these three moments: the first one, when they were amazed by the appearance of the rest of the squads surrounded by light; the second one, when Peach thanked the rest for saving them and they all kinda ""pamper"" by convincing them that Fresh squad saved themselves, that they didn\'t need help. I think Fresh Pretty Cure were the most happy of all for getting to know the rest of Pretty Cure, like the newbies in a high school admiring Seniors. What\'s more, every Fresh Pretty Cure was given a considerable important part of the dialogue. In other squads, the leaders kinda overshadowed the rest of the members (Luminous was the most overshadowed of all). The fights were freaking good, the animation was fluid and pretty powerful. The hits were charged full of force and triggered devastating reactions. I really loved this movie, but I wished individual interactions appear more. this is a negative point, it\'s just the role Pretty Cure 5 were assigned.

But this isn\'t even the biggest problem, the problem is the story itself.It is amazing how this movie contradicts itself in a matter of minutes. The villain\'s goal is to make everything be one thing, and then he starts, only he never really absorbs the powers he needs for this, even with many opportunities (nothing convenient, right?). Now comes the ultimate contradiction: The villain spends the...entire movie saying that everything must become one thing, and the characters rebut by saying no, because each person has their own feelings, and guess what? Yes, in the end they use the powers they get for another convenience and speak that their powers and their feelings are one. WTF????? The whole movie is passing a supposed message that each one is each one, and in the end the characters themselves say that their feelings are the same? For them it may become one, but the villain can\'t do the same just for being the villain, right? It\'s amazing how things contradict themselves just for the ""sake of it"".The only thing that saves this movie are the action scenes. entire movie saying that everything must become one thing, and the characters rebut by saying no, because each person has their own feelings, and guess what?
