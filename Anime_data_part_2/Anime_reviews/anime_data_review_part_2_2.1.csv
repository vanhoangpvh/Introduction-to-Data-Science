Yama no Susume Third Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35672/Yama_no_Susume_Third_Season,"[""We had to wait 4 years for a third season of Yama no Susume and the big question is of course if the series is still as good as the previous seasons and if it still has the same charm?StoryThe story in the third season focuses mostly on the relationship between Hinata and Aoi which was already the case in the previous seasons too and one of my favorite aspects of the anime. Something that has less presence in this season is actual mountain climbing because they focus more on the slice of life elements and they even dedicate whole episodes to it which...isn't directly bad because we get nice character developments through it in this season especially between Aoi and Hinata.ArtOne of the things I always liked in Yama no Susume were the background arts and I have to say that the third season sadly doesn't look as good as the previous seasons and especially the characters look in some episodes really minimalistic drawn and even kinda low quality at some points.The Art in S3 is the weakest part of the anime, but even if I say that the anime still looks better than most other Anime this season so it's not such a big thing it's just sad that it isn't as good as in the other seasons.SoundThere are some openings that always give me a smile and which I just don't want to skip and the opening of Yama no Susume S3 is one of them it's a perfect way to get into the episode. The episode themselves have the same OST as we already got in previous season and it's of course still fitting. The ending is pretty nice, but I like the opening more.CharacterLike I already mentioned earlier this season focuses mostly on Aoi and Hinata and gives them trough multiple episodes really good character development, but what about the other characters? We get to see the other characters and they all get their moments to shine which I really liked because one thing I was scared of at the start of the season was that they won't give the other characters their moments because it first seemed like they will only give Aoi and Hinata moments and forget about the others.Enjoyment/OverallI really enjoyed this season of Yama no Susume and even though the anime has a loss in quality compared with the previous seasons it gives me still the same feeling I got from the previous seasons and it's a comfortable watch, but one can clearly tell that this season is mostly fanservice for people that wanted to see the characters one more time animated.Overall the Anime is a 9/10 for me and I can recommend it to everyone who likes the previous seasons. isn't directly bad because we get nice character developments through it in this season especially between Aoi and Hinata.ArtOne of the things I always liked in Yama no Susume were the background arts and I have to say that the third season sadly doesn't look as good as the previous seasons and especially the characters look in some episodes really minimalistic drawn and even kinda low quality at some points.The Art in S3 is the weakest part of the anime, but even if I say that the anime still looks better than most other Anime this season so it's not such a big thing it's just sad that it isn't as good as in the other seasons.SoundThere are some openings that always give me a smile and which I just don't want to skip and the opening of Yama no Susume S3 is one of them it's a perfect way to get into the episode.

It's more relatable for me as each and every episode reminds me of the friendship I have with my best friend, the fun we have together, the jealousy and frustration that we have sometimes when we can't seem to find time to hang out with each other, and the problems we face which we share to each other. And YNS S3, it's just that. Less hiking on Yamas and more emphasis on personal relationships. Between Aoi and Hinata(of course cos they're the MCs) and between their friends....So w/o further ado, leggo start the ofc review!P.S. This is gonna be quite a personal review so yea.Story: Well I already gave a short summary of what YNS S3 is about. Sure there's episodes where they go hiking together, but 80% of the anime focuses on the deep friendship which Aoi and Hinata have with each other. What really attached me to this season of YNS is what I said earlier, the fun times and problems which Aoi and Hinata faced. It was extremely relatable towards the ending when both Aoi and Hinata seemed to just missed each other every time they wanna hang out with each other. Quite a mirror to my real life right now, with my friends in NS or are too busy, especially my best friend. Now that I look back at time, I do miss the times when me and my best friend could hang out with each other everyday after school, 4 years ago. So I can totally understand Hinata's feelings. That feeling of not being able to hang out with your best friend. I also like the fact that the anime tries to involve Honoka more in this season. And we could definitively see Honoka hanging out with ze gang(Aoi, Hinata, Kokona and Kaede) more this season. Granted, this season may not have been the most relaxing one due to the fact that it focuses on relationships more, but it was a very relatable season, at least for me.Rating: 9.5/10Animation: Kindof a hit and miss for this category. I like the fact that the producers try to make the scenery as realistic as possible, but when it comes to the faces, wow, I didn't like the way the animated some of the scenes. Felt cheap. At the same time of course the facial expressions were priceless most of the time.Rating: 7.8/10Music/Sound: As usual using the VAs to sing both the opening and endings song, me like. The soundtrack just makes me relax whenever it plays(and makes me think of going to Japan :v).Rating: 8.3/10Characters: For this review I don't have much to say about the characters, because we already know their personalities and character from past season. So for this section I just want to focus on Aoi and mostly Hinata. So as we know in past seasons, Aoi is kind and friendly, but she's also.... kinda.... idk she worries too much. During the last episode when she wanted to get a present for Hinata she just overthought what she was gonna get. Oh and add to that her constant thoughts of Hinata making fun of her..., yes that's very funny xD.As for Hinata, this is the first time we see her being a little bit insecure about her friendship with Aoi which i can't blame her for that since she and Aoi seemed to be always missing out on each other for a few episodes. Ah yes her stubbornness is also a trait of her that is funny but also can be rather annoying. So.... I guess that's it for characters?Rating: 8.7/10Overall, this has gotta be my most relatable anime this season, because it reminds me so much of the relationship I have with my best friend and it is these kindof animes which I really love. I really do hope that they'll make an S4 because we havent seen Aoi conquer Mount Fuji yet.Overall rating: 8.8/10 So w/o further ado, leggo start the ofc review!P.S.

It does not manage to reach the heights of the supremely well-done Season Two, but still manages to be an enjoyable slice-of-life.Story and Character (7/10): The story is largely episodic and follows a similar structure to previous seasons, but has a rather different tone and focus. While Seasons 1 and 2 focused largely on hiking with some minor character development on the side, Season 3 switches these and focuses more on character interactions. Some...episodes involve Aoi overcoming personal struggles, while many others reveal how she and Hinata question their friendship and worry about what they think of each other. These events do provide some interesting developments and are occasionally heartwarming, but the drama can get irritating at times and the relative lack of hiking compared to S1 and S2 was disappointing. I would have liked to see a better balance between these elements, as was found in Season Two.Without spoiling anything, it is worth noting that the story does not fully conclude at the end, instead leaving itself open for future seasons. This is unfortunate, but considering the show’s length, it is not unexpected.The cast of supporting characters was serviceable but mostly pushed to the side. Kokona and Kaede both return relatively unchanged, but Kokona did not make any major contributions to the story and Kaede in particular was notably absent for a large majority of the series. However, Honoka (who was introduced in Season Two) did have a good presence in several episodes.Art and Sound (7/10): There isn’t much to discuss here. Backgrounds and scenery are still very pretty and well-drawn, but character design is much simpler than in previous seasons. Faces are sometimes only illustrated with simple lines and dots from a distance, which is noticeably low-quality.The soundtrack isn’t very memorable aside from the opening and closing, which are both catchy and a pleasure to listen to. I especially liked “Chiheisen Stride”, the opening.Overall (7): Yama no Susume: Season 3 was an enjoyable but decidedly different series when compared to the seasons before it. Its relative lack of climbing, unfinished story, and inclusion of drama make it a weaker overall piece, but for those who enjoyed previous seasons, it is still worth a watch. episodes involve Aoi overcoming personal struggles, while many others reveal how she and Hinata question their friendship and worry about what they think of each other.

Honoka Kurosaki voiced by Nao Touyama also gets this, at first being a character introduced in the second season and befriends Aoi, she goes along with Aoi in several trips to mountains in the process. The only character within the main cast who got shafted in this season was Kaede Saitou voiced by Yoko Hikasa as Kaede has exams thus is trapped in an endless cycle of studying and little mountain climbing thus her lessen screentime though she appears with Hinata more often than not, which is shame as LA wanted to see more of Kaede. With this you can kinda see the entire ""Aoi and Hinata separation"" through the rest of the cast and the major conflict of the entire third season\'s buildup.8Bit, once again helms the animation and really it\'s what you expect from them with gorgeous backgrounding with moe character designs, really LA doesn\'t need to go too deep into animation, if you\'ve seen the past 2 seasons then this is a given. Praise easily going to the beautiful backgrounding...Voice work, well the entire cast is back and with Honoka getting more screentime, means Nao Touyama gets more too, BUT LA won\'t get LA\'s bias come into play...MVP\'s goes to Yuka Iguchi as Aoi and Kana Asumi as Hinata, it\'s a no brainer here.Yama no Susume\'s 3rd Season gives us something new in terms of character development from Aoi and HInata, Aoi as she becomes much more open through mountain climbing, Hinata as becomes more isolated and away from Aoi giving Hinata internal problems concerning their relationship and by all means, as a result they grows their relaitonship even more oddly enough.Yama no Susume\'s 3rd Season is about mountain climbing, but this season shows that it\'s much more than that and as cheesy as LA will say it but this fits into Aoi and Hinata\'s relationship this season and Yama no Susume as a whole and that is of the tried and true ""the power of friendship"" and Yama no Susume\'s 3rd Season encapsulates it in variety of spectrum all under the hobby of mountain climbing.This was the little anime short that could and it STILL good even after 3 seasons... new friends while Hinata gets more isolated due to her conflicting schedules with Aoi, now this is something of a focal point that comes into play but it gets dealt with and resolved rather well and both Aoi and Hinata reconcile, but the entire drama between Aoi and Hinata isn\'t spiteful in anyways more like misunderstandings and assumptions that lead to what it became, as both Aoi and Hinata are developing their relationship but apart and this tribulation grows their relationship even more.Nevertheless, Yama no Susume\'s 3rd Season still looks at mountaineering in the typical Yama no Susume flavours of giving us tidbits about mountaineering and the such from equipment to finding new Japanese mountains to climb but really the ""drama"" concerning Aoi and Hinata helped with this season as both first and second season was essentially a slice of life comedy with mountain climbing, the 3rd Season brought something new to the table and dealt with it rather well.Now since Aoi and Hinata are the focal point of this season, what about the rest of the cast?, well Kokona tags along with Aoi as she\'s probably the most freely open character this season and she probably has the most screentime outside of Aoi and Hinata.

Fuji since the protagonist trained herself for a year to take back what is left behind last season. but it seems that it becomes more on the drama between 2 childhood friends rather than the mountain climbing. Although the Mt. Climbing scenes are filled with beautiful scenery, I just expected more climbing rather than the drama. I'm kinda disappointed in this season since they focus more on drama  as I said.both Art and the sound are used perfectly...letting us into the scenes, the scenery and to the drama.I hope that they make another season that focuses more on the redemption of the protagonist to climb the peak of Mt. Fuji, but it seems that it might not happen this year. letting us into the scenes, the scenery and to the drama.I hope that they make another season that focuses more on the redemption of the protagonist to climb the peak of Mt. Fuji, but it seems that it might not happen this year."", 'One step forward, just like the prospective mountain climbers that make up the troupe of Yama no Susume. Though there was a distinct lack of a defined plot compared to the last season, the runtime was better spent on very pointed character moments which had a real purpose to gluing the narrative together.By far the best aspect of this season was the contrast between Aoi and Honoka, who are both different types of introverts. This show has been praised for its treatment of that personality type, and this season you begin to see exactly how they react to different situations. Getting to know Honoka -...though she may seem distant - is a real delight and introduces a new side of the ""making memories"" mission of this story. Her particular obsessions make the dynamics of some of the characters feel fresh again and show off a side of introversion that\'s usually played for laughs in a very good light.In general this season was far more aimless than the other two parts. In fact it wouldn\'t be wrong to say that the story took a rather significant downturn, but the moments it facilitates are worth breaking the team off into individual pieces for. Kaede is mostly written out of most of the major events, though it seems to be more of a consequence of her own actions rather than the writer needing to get her out of the way. In that way, the show strikes a rather naturalistic tone which honestly feels a bit refreshing. The emotional climaxes continue to be rather understated yet still carry a certain power with them which goes with the continued focus on realistic scenery.Compared to the prior season, there does seem to be a decrease in scale and splendor in season 3. Many of the landscapes feel a bit condensed, though that does seemed to have allowed for a greater focus on detail. Seeing all of the named landmarks that the group encounters on their path and derive some kind of meaning from them is worth focusing in a bit more. That does mean it\'s less about scenery splendor, though that still exists.On paper I think Yama no Susume Season 3 is a bit of a downgrade from Season 2, but I overall had a better time. It flowed nicer, even with some big moments of seeming meaninglessness. It also didn\'t leave off on a damp note like the previous season. Overall, it instilled me with more confidence to keep watching, and happy that there is a longer term goal in mind. though she may seem distant - is a real delight and introduces a new side of the ""making memories"" mission of this story.

Uma Musume: Pretty Derby Season 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53526/Uma_Musume__Pretty_Derby_Season_3,"['Umamusume is back and as per usual, the focus has shifted to two side characters turned season protagonists, this time on Kitasan Black and Satono Diamond. As much as I liked the first two seasons of this anime, it’s unfortunate for me to say that this season is weakest and that’s mainly due to how these two characters are handled. In previous seasons, the heart of the series would come from the dynamic between the two main characters, whether that be how they are as friends or as rivals. I’d say that there are around two instances each this season where both Kitasan Black and...Satono Diamond do any of these things, and at first I thought that maybe this is done intentionally to flesh out the internal struggles for both characters, but that isn’t exactly the case here. Kitasan is the only one whose character arc is compelling, which isn’t a good thing when compared to past seasons where both protagonists as well as even the side characters are given a lot of depth that can at least make us care about the hardships they face. This season doesn’t have its equivalent Rice Shower arc, that being a subplot that shifts focus to a seemingly unimportant side character but ends up with a pretty sad plotline. Satono Diamond is given a very brief personal struggle that gets resolved almost immediately, that being her desire to race overseas. That subplot felt like a much watered down version of Silent Suzuka’s in Season 1 since they have very similar goals, however Suzuka’s actually had stakes involved, something not present here for Diamond or almost any other character besides Kitasan.As for Kitasan’s storyline, hers just doesn’t hit as hard as other main characters from previous seasons. See, both Special Week’s and Tokai Teio’s arcs had a set starting motivation that naturally evolves into a more refined goal by the end of the season. Although Kitasan Black’s arc in this season might be similar like in other seasons, the issue here is that she never had a set goal in mind other than “be the best”. I guess that’s something, but we already had that in the last two seasons. Another aspect (or lack thereof) that I found disappointing is that in Season 2, both Kitasan and Diamond are set up as massive fans of both Tokai Teio and Mejiro McQueen respectively, and I was hoping that this season would build on top of that and have those two be major mentor figures for the main characters here, but we don’t get any of that. Yes, this season does have a few scenes where Teio gives Kitasan some pep talks, but those are not only sparse, but they don’t play on Teio’s own experiences from last season. I do think that the last few episodes of this season were good to send off Kitasan’s character, and I also think that this season as whole still hits all the emotional beats it was aiming for, but I feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities to build on top of what we got last season. Satono Diamond do any of these things, and at first I thought that maybe this is done intentionally to flesh out the internal struggles for both characters, but that isn’t exactly the case here.

Likewise it is not a copy of either nor did it break new grounds for the franchise as a whole. It never quite reached either the peak of what its predecessors but retained the spirit of what made the show special, and while with notable changes in its some aspects in regards to direction, there wasn't that much satisfaction story-wise.The show focuses on a new...cast of members of Uma Musume or horsegirls Kitasan Black and Satono Diamond, both of which were about elementary kids from last season but now in their teenage years as they entered the campus. Yeah, the world-building wasn't really that strong in the first place but damn... puberty is such a level-up here. The protagonists from prior seasons, Special Week and Silence Suzuka (s1) and Tokai Teio and Mejiro McQueen(s2) are now side characters, an understandable shift from a director's standpoint but still a point of contention for us audience.Lemme bitch a bit here. I love the series but there's something I have to speak about.While I think s2 was superior, the way it downplayed the previous protagonist's victory has always felt underwhelming and the concept of speed was kinda wonky. Special Week and Silence Suzuka had godlike speed in the first season and seeing their achievements not even mentioned later on annoyed me like a piece of rice stuck on the molar for days. Here, it follows suit as the new batch of Uma Musume were told in-universe to be stronger and much more capable that even s2's protagonists which were literally on the verge of life and death during their powerups. I know this train of thought becomes irrelevant on s3's final episodes but the show needs to find a sweet spot to keep the new protagonists interesting while keeping the past victories of the protagonists relevant and lasting. Because damn, Special Week deserves better, man.Kitasan Black, while I thought to be generic and uninteresting at first grew on me because of some of her interactions but I find myself without much tension during her races because it was already confirmed she is strong asf and that there wasn't that much at stake this time. On the other hand, the deuteragonist, her friend Satono Diamond was a lot more dynamic with a strong storyline. I kid you not, episodes that featured Satono Diamond were probably one my favorites in the series. Kitasan managed to redeem her initial blandness in the last few episodes but never quite matched Satono Diamond's. Funnily, while I praise Satono Diamond's storyline, her arc somehow ended flat while Kitasan's spiked up. Deliberate? Who knows. Either way, the storylines were sadly not as interconnected as I hoped it would be.S3's side characters were built up to be just as fierce as S2's fantastic ones based on the OP but somehow, we're fooled because not only were we blueballed, they just didn't have a place in the main story. Reading about Uma Musume revealed that the show were actually based on real life events and that the races were actual loose recreations of canon history. Maybe the writers just did not have the material to work the side characters in to the story or maybe something else but it just felt flat and aside from Nice Nature and surprisingly, the spectators, the narrative was tightly set to Kitasan Black's career for better or worse.  In general, the show subverted a lot of my expectations and most of them, Im not really fond of. So much build up for some moments but just were either dropped or ignored entirely. Some moments of supposed glory were not given enough time to marinate, and some headscratching decisions as to why some of the show's notable concepts were held out until the end.Overall Negatives:-Ending was not as satisfying as its predecessors-Disjointed storylines-Only one Winning Live the whole show wtf(it was amazing but still...)-Some characters just became the focus so suddenly and some became almost non-existentNow to the positives:-Kitasan Black's arc peaked in the last few episodes with her predicament-Final races were hype-Protagonists loses as much as they win so it keeps the audience guessing-The show managed to make me appreciate and love Special Week again, with her scene-stealing bits and overall, a better depiction that what season 2 made her to be-The animation was still gorgeous and some of the final races have very special camera angles and tension-filled atmosphere with its music and tasteful shots. Probably some of the best running animations in anime.-More Gold Ship-Probably the best OP and ED in the seriesThis is a sports show that kept me entertained consistently and this season, I find myself so whiny because it changes a good bit of what I have gotten used to. It is a step to keep things fresh probably and hence I lay here somewhat accepting what I had. Among the seasons, this one probably has the lowest rewatch value for me and it serves inspiration to people, which is the spirit of a good sports anime. S3 is a good sports anime but just does not have the best of Uma Musume. Don't get me wrong; this does not mean the franchise has declined nor on a plateau. The season probably just is a different kind of different, like how a sweaty hand makes playing the guitar different. Sure the notes were right, but the feel and comfort was just not there.Overall, it is worth watching, enjoyable on its own right but personally, not as cohesive nor as intense as the prior seasons.7/10 it is. cast of members of Uma Musume or horsegirls Kitasan Black and Satono Diamond, both of which were about elementary kids from last season but now in their teenage years as they entered the campus. Yeah, the world-building wasn't really that strong in the first place but damn... puberty is such a level-up here. The protagonists from prior seasons, Special Week and Silence Suzuka (s1) and Tokai Teio and Mejiro McQueen(s2) are now side characters, an understandable shift from a director's standpoint but still a point of contention for us audience.Lemme bitch a bit here. I love the series but there's something I have to speak about.While I think s2 was superior, the way it downplayed the previous protagonist's victory has always felt underwhelming and the concept of speed was kinda wonky. Special Week and Silence Suzuka had godlike speed in the first season and seeing their achievements not even mentioned later on annoyed me like a piece of rice stuck on the molar for days. Here, it follows suit as the new batch of Uma Musume were told in-universe to be stronger and much more capable that even s2's protagonists which were literally on the verge of life and death during their powerups. I know this train of thought becomes irrelevant on s3's final episodes but the show needs to find a sweet spot to keep the new protagonists interesting while keeping the past victories of the protagonists relevant and lasting. Because damn, Special Week deserves better, man.Kitasan Black, while I thought to be generic and uninteresting at first grew on me because of some of her interactions but I find myself without much tension during her races because it was already confirmed she is strong asf and that there wasn't that much at stake this time. On the other hand, the deuteragonist, her friend Satono Diamond was a lot more dynamic with a strong storyline. I kid you not, episodes that featured Satono Diamond were probably one my favorites in the series. Kitasan managed to redeem her initial blandness in the last few episodes but never quite matched Satono Diamond's. Funnily, while I praise Satono Diamond's storyline, her arc somehow ended flat while Kitasan's spiked up. Deliberate? Who knows.

Kita was very disrespectful (ep 5 when she said who!?)2. Kita got upset every episode and why was it nicenature that took care of her?3. Kita had no goals in the races. She simply wanted to win which didn't make the story any interesting4. Other character had no screen time. Duramente and Sounds of Earth literally sings in the opening and they both were not significant at all5. There was no build up through the story like season 2. It had no drama of what a miracle is.6. This reason was biggest for me....In season 2, kita begged her to run even after so many injuries because teiou was her hero. But now she is quitting to run just because she isnt doing that well??7. she isnt a hero for anyone at all. she didnt achieve that goal of being a hero. She was still winning many races so it was very awkward that she peaked outI have cried i the past Uma Musume series but this one did not make me passion or emotional at all. I dont reccomend this because season 2 was a masterpiece and this will just disappoint you. In season 2, kita begged her to run even after so many injuries because teiou was her hero.

And I have to say, I\'m happy I did. But I will limit myself to analyzing just the third season:The new protagonist, Kitasan, is extremely charismatic, and it warms the heart to see the affection she has for the ordinary people in her life, she\'s always willing to help, in a scenario as competitive as racing in which everyone is seeking to be the very best for the most different reasons (promises, expectations linked to the family name, wanting to be like their...idol), Kita\'s ultimate motivation is to put a smile on the faces of everyone, giving every single person in the hippodrome the best show, which is as valid a motivation as any other. The season makes use of the well-constructed cast of previous seasons, allowing the new characters time to develop their relationships, motivations, and goals (Cheval Grand\'s quest for her first G1 victory, and the weight of the expectations crumbling over the girls from the Satono family with their ""curse"" were amazing side plots), as well as giving more screen time to characters who barely had focus in previous seasons, in particular the character\'s Nice Nature and Golden Ship who both took the position of seniors in which the protagonist can confide her fears and doubts (which was a nice touch since the protagonist can\'t show her weak side to her idol Tokai Teiou). I must admit that I shed tears in the final race of Kitasan, her last race in the Twinkle series proved to be a clash against herself and the limitations of her body with the sole purpose of realizing her dream of putting the biggest smile on the face of everyone who supported her, another great thing at the end of the season was witnessing the impact that the girl who ""didn\'t want to dominate the world"" had on all those who sought stardom/the top, in her simplicity and humility she elevated everyone in her generation to go further. Overall, this is by far my favorite season of this series that keeps getting better with each new work. idol), Kita\'s ultimate motivation is to put a smile on the faces of everyone, giving every single person in the hippodrome the best show, which is as valid a motivation as any other.

Overall, this is by far my favorite season of this series that keeps getting better with each new work.', 'Uma Musume: Pretty Derby - 3 seasons\' worth of Uma Musume content with a change of studio production in-between...what could go wrong? Well, this season.It\'s been 5.5 years since Uma Musume: Pretty Derby graced the small screen, giving us our first impression of CyGames\'s biggest IP in Japan (next to Princess Connect! Re:Dive a.k.a PriConne) and the anime equivalent to the live-action horse races, showcasing the rich history of Japan\'s most iconic horses, covering their rise to fame and their eventual downfall away from the spotlight. Since then, we have already had 3 seasons of the anime (Spring 2018, Winter 2021, and this Fall), 2...short series (Summer 2020\'s Umayon and Fall 2022\'s Umayuru), last year\'s Road to the Top ONA series, and a buttload of new manga series based on different characters, to boot. But out of all of these different showings, there\'s got to be a Black Sheep in the series, and it\'s very unfortunate that I have to say that Season 3 here is the worst of the lot.Despite Season 1 all those years ago with director Kei Oikawa\'s staff team and Studio Kai coming into Season 2 to help things out with the production, the story plot has literally stayed the same, which shouldn\'t really be a bad thing to fans of the mobage and the anime-onlies...right? Sure, you had Special Week and Silence Suzuka for Season 1, which served as a good jumping start to the anime, then Season 2 with Tokai Teio and Mejiro McQueen, which is Season 1 but 10 times better due to the character developments that get you invested very deeply in both main horse girls, which raises the bar for potential future seasons to come. And then Season 3 appeared after almost yet another 3-year gap...and its central characters are nowhere near the brilliance and remembrance that were its predecessor season, or even Season 1, for that matter.For reference, up until then, all horse girls are based off their real-life horse counterparts to anchor the story, and from what I can tell, the main horse girls of Kitasan Black and Satono Diamond are exactly just that, though somehow, somewhere in the process, it felt like their story elements together were too short to even make up a 13-episode series, so the producers and scriptwriters (some of whom like Shingo Nagai and Tetsuya Kobari were brought back from the Road to the Top ONA) decided to wing this season to the best of their abilities. You have Kitasan Black, who wants to follow in Tokai Teio\'s footsteps, and Satono Diamond, of whom the Satono ""curse"" deemed that none of its family members were able to secure G1 wins. I understand the story in this season that can be crafted for the latter, but for the former, it seems like someone is getting lazy trying to rehash the ""tried-and-true"" formula that made Tokai Teio a standout character in Season 2. Not all horse girls (and their real-life counterparts) have the same history and treatment (though sometimes they do sound the same), and in this case, you can tell that Kitasan Black is supposed to be the next generation leap forward as compared to Tokai Teio\'s, but the scriptwriting of her character just doesn\'t echo it like so, and instead, in my opinion, is an exaggerating version of Tokai Teio that is a ticking time bomb, until she becomes a frail horse girl with no redemption whatsoever, despite all the cheers and encouragement from Team Spica and its members who have done the same before her. Also, the other rivals in both girls\' generations, like Duramente and Cheval Grand, I really find the former\'s story very intriguing, and it actually reminded me similarly to Gold Ship\'s plight, but it started and ended like a typical script with little to no motivation at all. As for the latter, they really want to make Cheval Grand\'s ""win and lose"" story mould together alongside the two main horse girls, but I just don\'t care for her that much.In context, when we look back at Season 2, both Tokai Teio and Mejiro McQueen\'s backstories were so great that it makes us the audience very focused and engrossed on their melodrama, and even the racing action on the racecourses feels like they have substantial weight to them as a sign of improvement in how far they\'d come in their sacrificial journey to push beyond their limits and achieve their very best. That to think that this was all in the span of the same 13-episode series that, in my opinion at the time, I\'m worried that the production committee needs an extra oomph of time to deliver what was then one of the most spectacular races in Uma Musume\'s anime, period, and by the grace of the anime gods, they delivered in a very tight deadline to fulfill and cement the (at the time) sequel\'s legacy as a great follow-up to its premiere season. Season 3 here, however, has none of that.If the story doesn\'t do you any favours for what\'s about to come for Season 3, then both the production and music will help deteriorate your watching experience. Studio Kai has done magnificently for Season 2 that\'s 3 years prior, and with the same 3-year gap, you would think that they\'ll be able to keep their consistency after a break this long. I\'m sad to say that this is not the case here, as the animation has slipped to a downgrade (with the obvious tinges focusing on the race action), and while it doesn\'t look as bad as Season 2, you can tell that it is visibly less refined in an effort to save up on production costs, which is otherwise a mitigating factor concerning the anime overall.The music is by far the worst aspect of Season 3. I was actually okay that the producers left the Winning Stage idol portion for the finale episodes since character development is the absolute priority for Season 2, something that had existed since Season 1 (again, to give anime-onlies an idea of what the mobage is all about in anime form). And Season 3 is the sum of the marriage of the worst decisions ever made, with an OST that is just as upbeat as the series is. But if anything, remembrance is not the keyword here.Some will say that Season 3 is just as good as Season 2, if not a touch downward, which I can agree to an extent. But as it stands, Season 3 is a mere carbon copy of Season 2 with new characters that doesn\'t fire up the horse grooves as much as it could have. Better luck next time if there is a Season 4 in the future, though I will not count on betting in a horse race for improvements across the racecourse.Such a missed opportunity for any kind of potential. And such is the case in the world of Uma Musume: Pretty Derby (at least for the anime), where it\'s more an Ugly Duckling, than a beautiful Swan song. short series (Summer 2020\'s Umayon and Fall 2022\'s Umayuru), last year\'s Road to the Top ONA series, and a buttload of new manga series based on different characters, to boot.

To give some context, the Brave series was a Japanese-only old school mainstream franchise which was once produced by Sunrise, made from the remnants of the failed marketing of Transformers (yes, that Michael Bay movie franchise) in Japan, which didn\'t really resonate all that much with its people. Instead, at the time, the toy company Takara (now Takara Tomy) and Sunrise decided to develop a new franchise, which would spawn new toy lines and a soon-astounding anime series, with the common theme being ""Bravery"", the interaction between the robot ""Brave"", who has a heart and the boy who enters its heart and bears the will of the mecha, the union of the robots, and other unique themes. There is also no direct relationship between each series in terms of world view or time, so therefore, almost all the works are different to each other in terms of themes and motif. Bear in mind that the Brave series would go on to inspire and spawn big-name franchises like Gundam with Sunrise at the helm from the 1980s to today.So then, where does the legendary director Masami Oobari stand in all of this? First of all, he\'s actually more known as the mecha and character designer, who\'s worked on shows like Ashi Production\'s 1983-1984 Special Armored Battalion Dorvack, the Japanese translation of Transformers (outsourced by Toei Animation to them sometimes), and Studio Pierrot\'s 1984-1985 Star Musketeer Bismarck as an animation director, with the big break at the age of 19 when he got his first major break of landing the role of mecha designer on the same studio (Ashi Production)\'s 1985 Dancougar – Super Beast Machine God series. His signature mech designs basically carried his name throughout the mid-1980s and onwards from said Dancougar series to the various Brave series: Sunrise\'s 1991 series The Brave of Sun Fighbird, 1994 series The Brave Police J-Decker, and the most recent up to that point, Gonzo\'s 2002 to 2004 Gravion serie, which he personally created and directed the series alongside renowned mecha designer Kunio Okawara, the FIRST man in the Japanese industry to be credited as one. So, for mecha fans all around the world who are well-acquainted with the Masari Oobari name, it shouldn\'t really come as a surprise...or is it?When you put Masami Oobari and the spiritual Brave successor in the hands of Cygames (the company who brought you Granblue Fantasy and Princess Connect! Re:Dive to name a few), the surprises don\'t stop there. Even the Teaser PV released was as vague as it would get for everyone both suspecting and unsuspecting that we would be getting a new mecha project series, and just about the only clue would be the way that the title is stylized in the old-school Brave series logo of all things. But this original show does one thing and one thing only: be the biggest liar that it has ever been. Cygames has always been the company to do unorthodox things, and when the main PV dropped nearer to the anime\'s release, it was NOTHING of the sort, leaving people to think that it\'s a Real Robot show. The kicker comes when Episode 1 dropped, it BLEW up the entire social internet commentary that the show IS indeed the old-fashioned Super Robot show that Masari Oobari has been known for.At this point, you\'re probably wondering: ""Is this it, is this all it is?"", to which I say from the point of Cygames and Masami Oobari: ""Do you think that our collaboration together on this original show will be as predictable as it is?"" The bait-and-switch will continue, right after this.The two brothers fated for each other, Isami and Lewis Smith, parallel as they may be, they both have different ambitions as fellow military mech pilots, trying to name a name for themselves. But all of this changes when Bravern comes out of nowhere to defend the humans from the Deathdrives, and for every attack he does, he has to shout his name in the most jovial manner. The kicker is that after he saves the humans, he only acknowledges Isami and warrants him to become his pilot. Suddenly, you\'re being bamboozled again: this is NOT just a Super Robot, but a Super REAL Robot! The thing is, Isami is a rather reserved man who wants to deal as much damage as possible, at the cusp of as less casualties as possible, and even the most minute of the Death Stranding vibes will force him into turmoil. On the other hand, Lewis Smith embodies the fight of any typical loyal American citizen, and wants to offer himself in exchange for Isami to pilot Bravern, which he gets rejected, saying that the fusion between human and robot will be unstable...NOT knowing that his nightmares with Bravern will become a pivotal point in the series to come.Bravern himself has a fair few enemies of the Deathdrives, the one closest would have to be Superbia, the Super Robot who has been dealt by his hands and wants a re-match against him to prove supremacy. I did mention earlier that in every beating heart of the Brave, there is an entity who bears that will, and in Superbia\'s case, comes across a mysterious alien girl who only knows the words ""Ga-ga-pi!"" whom Lewis had the rather unfortunate way of getting to know her. With the help of Isami and the military\'s help, the young girl is deduced for not just her constant child-like annoyance, but her real intentions as Lulu, for which every Super Robot as a ""Lulu"" to pilot them. That alone, makes the Brave connection between mecha and pilot even more of an importance when it comes to the overarching unpredictable plot, which will keep you pumped from start to finish. Also, like every other old-school mecha series, you\'d be unwise to NOT pair attacks while calling out your name, each and EVERY time, and Bravern does this to great effect.When it comes to the production, you know that when Cygames are given free rein to do whatever they want to do, they REALLY mean every single nitpick of the word, especially when it\'s with someone like Masari Oobari. I have long since awaited their in-house studio CygamesPictures\'s next work with this show, based on the fact that\'s proven with the anime adaptation of one of my favourite mobage games of all time: Princess Connect! Re:Dive. Anyone that has watched the series will know the bombastic, nonsense nature of the show with balls-to-the-wall striking action and beautiful animation to boot, and Brave Bang Bravern! is exactly just that and more, just splendid.Old-school mecha fans, ARISE, for your old-school opening song is dutifully respected, beautifully composed and well-crafted as a love letter to a whole genre. The feeling of anticipation when you hear Bravern\'s VA Kenichi Suzumura, the titular mech just singing his own song out with brilliance and gusto, singing ""Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang, BBRRRRAAAAAVVVVEEERRRRNNNNN!!!"", along with the inclusion of the SFX, which IS essential to any old-school mecha show to get its full unadulterated vibes. Bravern\'s OP is a banger of a song that is both the epitome of a sing-along karaoke song, and legitimately one of (if not) the best and memorable OP songs of the season. Think about how Bravern would feel if he found out that you skipped his theme song!?For the ED, it\'s a whole lot of close-up interactions between the VAs of Isami and Lewis, but I heavily implore you that the emotionally musical song is part of the entire story plot in and of itself, with the fact that ""Is it gay to be shirtless in the rain with your homie while you both sing about your intense feelings for each other as you delicately hold hands? YES."" The inherent gay-ness is on full display, but there\'s meaning to it and not done without reason.If you had told me that I was going to get a honest-to-good old school mecha anime in 2024, I would have thought you were INSANE. But this is THE reality, and I have nothing but praises for both Cygames and Masami Oobari in unironically creating one of the best underrated and ignored/underestimated surprise shows of the Winter 2024 season, WITHOUT A DOUBT. Literally NO ONE saw this coming, and for all its worth, I\'m glad that I got to experience a childhood that I never had with the Brave series, now with its spiritual successor, thanks to Masami Oobari. Also, Crunchyroll, you may have goofed up almost missing this show out by a week, but you\'ve redeemed yourself to let everyone watch this magnificent show about gay men expressing their feelings for one another, be it by mecha or just pure human interaction.If you\'re intending to watch the masterpiece that is Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern a.k.a Brave Bang Bravern!, it\'s one of those anime that works best if you just jump into it with as little foreknowledge as possible. And if you do, I promise you with my 2 hands that this show will be one hell of an unforgettable ride: a literate Abridged take of the Mecha genre.""Are we ready to rock? Ga-ga-pi!Welcome to the Super Robot franchise, my friends, time to expand your catalogue with Hard Work, the Power of Friendship, and BRAVERY!""Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang, BBRRRRAAAAAVVVVEEERRRRNNNNN!!!"" *Explosion SFX* that will have you constantly be duped, bamboozled, bait-and-switched, especially for fans of this VERY specific theme in all of the history of its genre: Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern a.k.a Brave Bang Bravern!, in collaboration with Cygames and produced by their in-house studio, and directed by the man, not the myth, but THE legend himself: Masami Oobari. The good ol\' fashioned Super Robot show is NOT dead yet, and it makes a triumphant return into relevancy! Who, if not ANYONE, saw this coming, if any AT ALL!?""When I was a kid, I wanted to be a hero. What I really wanted to be...was a Titanostrider pilot."" This is the life calling of the man who belonged in the US Marine Corps\'s 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force: 2nd Lieutentant Lewis Smith. He is part of a joint AD-RIMPAC military exercise between the Americans and Japanese, of which he meets a close buddy that will fight alongside him for the rest of the series: 2nd Lieutentant Isami Ao of Japan\'s Ground Self-Defense Forces\'s Special Armoured Group. The two brothers who are working together, are met by fate...because out of nowhere, mysterious enemies start invading their military ground in Oahu, Hawaii, and causing everyone to burst into panic mode. You see, the normal Real Robots that both forces have, are the standard Titanostrider a.k.a TS robots, mechs that are only good from invasions to exercises in say, reconnaissance missions and the like. And these mysterious enemies? They\'re Deathdrives, Super Robots who rely on the power of humans to pilot them. And why do they know this? Because there is only one entity that knows this, and it\'s their biggest ally ever *cue Isami\'s ""Where is that music coming from!?"" Pikachu moment*: Bravern, the Superhero Robot who will be their salvation to defeating the Deathdrives.It\'s incredibly creative how this show has managed to hook, line and sinker everyone by being secretive until its eventual reveal. To give some context, the Brave series was a Japanese-only old school mainstream franchise which was once produced by Sunrise, made from the remnants of the failed marketing of Transformers (yes, that Michael Bay movie franchise) in Japan, which didn\'t really resonate all that much with its people. Instead, at the time, the toy company Takara (now Takara Tomy) and Sunrise decided to develop a new franchise, which would spawn new toy lines and a soon-astounding anime series, with the common theme being ""Bravery"", the interaction between the robot ""Brave"", who has a heart and the boy who enters its heart and bears the will of the mecha, the union of the robots, and other unique themes. There is also no direct relationship between each series in terms of world view or time, so therefore, almost all the works are different to each other in terms of themes and motif.

I found myself loving this one for a variety of reasons, but first, I’ve got to talk about that premise:Top Gun with aliens invading a la Independence Day but giant robot Kamina from Gurren Lagann comes to save the day.That sounds like a mess, and while it kind of is, this is a show that revels in the mess. It leans in hard as the robot Bravern diagetically blasts his theme music from its cockpit (projecting his opening animation background behind him like a boss), proclaims that his pilot Isami is its soul mate,...and proceeds to devastate Death Drive alien robots (all of whom have personalities that are some variation of absurd in the best way) with abandon. It helps that Isami and many of the characters in this series are very unlike those in Gurren Lagann – they have no idea what the fuck is going on and they (aside from Lewis Smith) are not anime protagonists by nature. A small touch I love: they don’t wait for an opponent to monologue or have a problem using their full power from the get-go. The series does not let you get fully comfortable with its premise, either, as Bravern and gang face down an array of increasingly ridiculous robot foes. The number of ways this series goes sideways consistently surprises and delights.And oh man, is this show homoerotic as all hell. Those Top Gun feels come through in spades in the early parts of this series, but when that ED kicks on (easily one of the best EDs of the season), it rocks the house with two shirtless bros singing their feelings. There are so many moments where Isami and Lewis or Isami and Bravern are just having the best bro moments or, in some cases, going quite a bit further. These are some of my favorite relationships of the season, whether they’re just being bros or something more.As for the narrative, it does have direction and momentum to it, though it’s probably the most basic aspect of the series… if you can call it that. The crazy anime nonsense is on full display in some of these episodes, some of which feels over the top even for the more bombastic series. And yes, it gets dour in places, though the series never stays in the doldrums too long. Hell, even when things seem at their darkest, the only solution is to fire on all cylinders and become the impossible source of light in the darkness.Yes, this series was absolutely fine being as absurd as it could be as it kept going, and that’s as it should be. We needed some Spirit Bomb/color change/power-of-friendship/multi-fusion nonsense, and anyone who says differently just doesn't appreciate good fun. Like with similar series, it would have been pretty easy from the start to guess how this one would end, but I'd be shocked if anyone could guess what kind of wild ride it would take to get there.

Impeccable action with intense thrill and emotional desperation, Rated R extremely, EXTREMELY hilarious comedy, and... steamy romance? Such chaotic energy, but with wonderful delivery- one of the best 3 first episodes among all genre of anime that I've ever watched for sure! 10/10]Bang Brave Bang Bravern is looking up to be one of the most iconic anime of all time, for sure. From every aspect possible, it is so well-made, despite having so much potential still.Among all of its qualities, what stands out to me the most is the drawing, for sure! The expressions, the shading, everything sets up the mood...for each scenes SO well that viewers can't help but get invested in the story and in everything that's going on. It's the base of the intense emotions that I felt while watching these first episodes. Ambition, sadness, desperation, confusion, shock, trauma, relaxedness, ease, even just smug- they're only among the emotions that are conveyed SO well making viewers truly fall deep down into its world and its story! Oh, and the characters are sexily well-drawn, if that's what you're into...Built upon said fantastic foundation is of course the storyline with just the perfect amount of dynamics and jumps between different moods (and genre even, I'd say) cultivating such wonderful balance that persists throughout the episodes. The worldbuilding seems awesome, but since it's still only the first 3 episodes, not much is elaborated or explained, only enough for a human to take in as they are.. attacked, as the synopsis says, and it is definitely adequate. Relating to that, the flow of the story truly makes a lot of sense realistically (in the standard of fictional anime, of course) and it just describes how on fire the writing is so far.The characters also *seem* like they all have unique personalities and backgrounds but this aspect is what I'd consider the biggest 'potential' that this anime has yet to fulfill. They aren't delved deep enough yet, but we'll see how they're done in future episodes, and according to that, it could be the anime's biggest weakness or it can ascend the quality further.More about the visual and the graphics, it's top notch, honestly, with beautiful non-action scenes and VERY dynamic action scenes. The detail is no joke, and I assure you there is no scene that gets let down so far. The background, the people, the robots, the weapons, the attacks, and, I have said this in previous paragraphs, the facial expressions, the body language- everything's SO well drawn.In conclusion, there is no reason to not give this show a chance and to not invest your whole being into the story because it does not disappoint (so far).

This is a show about a 9m tall robot who is madly in love with his pilot. Which is amazing. Bravern revels in the absurdity of its own premise, taking full advantage of it at every opportunity. If there's anything to criticize about this show, it's the fact that it can feel cramped because the creators were (self-admittedly) trying to cram as much into 12 episodes as humanly possible. It's an easy flaw to forgive because it's just a sign of the passion that...went into creating this masterpiece.I think that some might be disappointed that this isn't strictly a show about giant robots. Don't be mistaken, it's definitely a show about giant robots. But it's also a story about a love that transcends time and space. You might be surprised, but it's impossible to make it through all 12 episodes without acknowledging that the fulcrum of the show is the explicitly romantic relationship between its two main male characters.While their relationship is frequently a source of humor, the jokes never feel meanspirited even once. It's treated with sincerity from start to finish. It was a truly refreshing watch in that regard.I think that it's best to go into Bravern without knowing anything. Its twists and turns are half of the fun. However, it definitely tries to fool you into thinking that it's JUST a serious military drama at first, which it isn't. Don't be fooled by the main keyart filled with beautiful women, either. They're in the show, but their screentime is miniscule compared to the male leads.This is a great show to watch twice.

Don't be mistaken, it's definitely a show about giant robots. But it's also a story about a love that transcends time and space. You might be surprised, but it's impossible to make it through all 12 episodes without acknowledging that the fulcrum of the show is the explicitly romantic relationship between its two main male characters.While their relationship is frequently a source of humor, the jokes never feel meanspirited even once. It's treated with sincerity from start to finish. It was a truly refreshing watch in that regard.I think that it's best to go into Bravern without knowing anything. Its twists and turns are half of the fun. However, it definitely tries to fool you into thinking that it's JUST a serious military drama at first, which it isn't. Don't be fooled by the main keyart filled with beautiful women, either. They're in the show, but their screentime is miniscule compared to the male leads.This is a great show to watch twice.

Sit back and enjoy how much this title seems to indulge the goofiness of itself and anime as a genre. There is little I can say the other reviews haven't pointed...out in the terms of content, so I'll wrap it up with a single sentence - Top gun meets mecha while subtle homoerotic tones shift into full on gay tension, and boy oh boy is every second of it a treat for every one of your senses.At the time of writing this, it only just wrapped up, but God I hope this one becomes a cult classic. It's like nothing I've ever seen in anime, and chances are something like this will never be made again. Much like its title implies, the creators decided to gather their courage, and man did they wrap this up with a bang. Even if it turns out not to be your cup of tea, you'll be able to appreciate it all, from story and characters to sound and animation, because it shows: everything in here was made with love. out in the terms of content, so I'll wrap it up with a single sentence - Top gun meets mecha while subtle homoerotic tones shift into full on gay tension, and boy oh boy is every second of it a treat for every one of your senses.At the time of writing this, it only just wrapped up, but God I hope this one becomes a cult classic.

They are the masters of the first episode twist and have a knack of keeping you hooked and engaged till the very end. Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern is no different. Despite knowing Obari would be taking the helm for this, I too was shocked and thoroughly pleased that my real robot show gave way to a singing super robot show. A gay singing super robot show at that! (Whether or not it is yaoibait or genuine yaoi will be debated till the end of time).However, as with most Cygames originals, you come to expect two things: A single-cour runtime, and...a rushed ending. I do wish they still do originals like they used to where two cours gives the show enough room to breath and expand on the world, the characters, and so much more. The final episode of Bravern felt like watching 5 episodes straight in a row, despite the pacing of prior episodes being paced normally to the point you\'d expect a surprise second cour announcement (there wasn\'t).As a consequence of this I do feel a lot of the character development is rushed. I love Smith, Bravern, and Lulu, but I\'ve never really warmed up to Isami. Again, I feel like having more episodes to flesh him out would have been better, since all you get in the show is him being stuck in a rut for the majority of it only to go through a whole season\'s worth of character development right at the very end. The side characters were cute (including the most ""Literally Me"" self insert I have ever seen in a show in the form of Miyu), but they do not amount to much apart from contributing to the comedic scenes in this.That\'s one major strength of the show (and other Cygames Originals). The comedy is superb in this, from the timing, to the execution of the lines, to the direction, just everything is done as well as it can get. Even The Marginal Service, for how mediocre it was, had some stellar moments to it at times. However, this comes at a cost of having a paper thin plot to work around with. What starts out as a ""Save The World"" type deal just turns into some time travel plot with no warning, and the whole ""Save the World"" aspect is just dumped when you realize most of the show just takes place in Hawaii to begin with. That\'s not counting the final asspull of a finale.I may sound a little harsh in this, but believe me when I say it is the most enjoyable show this season by a decent margin. Every episode just seems to one up each other and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. I\'m not a fujo but the fujo-pandering is really good up until the very end. Honestly, what is it with shows like these having so much homoerotic undertones (in not only the show itself, but also the merch) only to not commit at the very end. I just personally hate stuff like that (*cough*Nanoha*cough*WfM*Alice Gear Aegis*), and so that\'s one point docked from my score.But if you\'re looking for a good time, and want to relieve what it means to hold bravery in your own heart, and you\'ve already rewatched TTGL for the 15th time, you can\'t go wrong with Bravern.8/10 a rushed ending.

It's hard to describe what the story actually is about without spoiling anything or being somewhat misleading.  Just know that...it tries damn hard at being both serious and completely nuts at the same time.  A few tweaks to the script could change the tone drastically in either direction.Bravern is definitely in my top 5 for the year so far.

Perfect use of mecha tropes in a totally different way and expanding the genre.[7] Lulu is cute but weird. Good to have a plot to follow now, but it could get bizarre w...the nationalism. The characters are super interesting tho, nothing shakes that yet.[7] It's just too fun. I worry for Lulu's VA's voice tho, screaming like that.[7] They manage to build and destroy tension super easy, making both the military and comedy parts be awesome w great characters to boot. The many distinctly colored and designed human mechas are weird tho.[8] Robot waterboarding, new mechas, a further solidifying of the goals and new allies. Pure anime greatness.[8] Truly surprising, i didn't see this coming at all. Manages to start of funny, be super threatening and end tragic meanwhile setting some stuff for the next missions and the operation of the robots. The idea of them doing everything in search of a glorious death is fascinating for villains.[9] Mecha anime can be so corny, but if you allow it into your heart the emotions you feel will be unparalleled. ABSOLUTE CINEMA![8] Awesome emotional resolution for Smith's death & Superbia's conflict, also great to have Lulu taking agency & becoming  real character. The sequence w Lulu & Superbia bonding was a lot of fun, but a lil weird considering the circumstances.[8] We truly are in meta modern times, the way they can play w our emotions flipping between doing things ironically and unironically but still reaching pretty close to the peaks of both poles. The gag villain had a great design & a funny gimmick, the fight was cool and funny & the end hit, again.[9] The thing i watch anime for. Not afraid to be weird, it embraces the true emotions and gives us something to laugh at and root for simultaneously, hitting just the right spots.Aggregate Score: 7.84The OP and ED are phenomenal, the way they play with your expectations are amazing and all the references (of which i could only get a very limited number of myself, have to get a more extensive mecha scholarship) always made me smile and like it even more, to the point that i believe it would be a disservice to the show and staff tho make anything lower than a 7/10 the nationalism.

Go watch it now.Like a hot piece of meat off the grill, the more you stare at it before digging in the worse it gets. Do yourself a favor, watch an episode or two and then come back if you still want to see others\' opinions.Trust me, you\'ll thank me later.Or you\'ll need bleach for your eyes. Same difference but clearly this show wasn\'t your cup of tea if you couldn\'t handle what is essentially pure MANLINESS distilled into anime form.Only weak men, and women, can\'t handle the pure unadulterated love and passion shared by two men and a robot....So if you are weak, you should probably not watch this show and instead go watch some isekai harem fantasy show to fill your scrawny-armed needs.From this point onward, only those who also believe anime needs to start having nipples drawn on men being a common practice are allowed to continue reading my (rant) review.No exceptions.Now why is Bravern a good show? Everything, literally everything. If you grew up watching shows and anime from the 90s and early 2000s, this show feels like a throwback to those days. But now with homoeroticism and Zoomer-Humor. Main characters shout special attack names, friendship and love solves all problems, and the opening has sound effects twice as loud as the song playing underneath. Every aspect of the show shouts ""We love anime and giant robots"" and I cannot properly put into words how awesome the show feels because of it. The whole staff knew exactly the kind of show they wanted to make and what fans of anime and 90s weeb culture as a whole loved and pander to your every expectation.Even the attention to detail is there. For example, the show starts in Hawaii, and when the characters are ordering a beer, they actually order an honest to god real-life Hawaiian Beer with the logo ambiguosly slapped on. That scene encompasses the entire vibe of the show, which is it\'s made for adults, and the more you know and pay attention the more you\'ll enjoy it.Characters and interactions can be a bit one note and simple, and side characters are side characters. But let\'s be honest the show is called Bang Bravern Bang, you aren\'t watching to see what happens to miss Air Controller in an AWACS with 2min of total screen time. You\'re watching for the big explosions, giant robots, and big explosions. And that is all you really need to care about from this show. Though you can tell there is nuance to the world and side characters that isn\'t being fleshed out as big homo robot with his own theme song is more entertaining. Personally I think this is a fine choice since the show keeps it simple and refines that simplicity to a high quality.For recommending this one, absolutely--- if you don\'t mind having people question what the hell you are watching. This is such an underrated gemstone of a show that I almost hope it remains small and niche to preserve the fanbase.

It initially presents as though it\'s going to have real-robot tone, but then swerves hard into classic Super Robot territory and makes it gay, and that\'s an A+ in my book. The humor, while a little crude, is hilarious. The drama had me tearing up at a couple points. If you\'re already a fan of mecha, and aren\'t afraid of a good, humorous time, you will love this show.Frankly the show defies description. It plays a lot of the usual ""super robot"" tropes pretty straight a lot of the time, what with evil aliens,...combining the hearts of sentient robot and pilot (except this time with a lot of innuendo), etc. What it does with those tropes is give us a show that is filled to the brim (eheh) with raw (heh) emotion. Not once does the show act self-aware of how bizarre it gets, or bashes itself over the situations that occur. It\'s a show with a robot who is gay for the pilot, and it knows that, and embraces it fully. The plot is tightly woven, and the show manages to do a lot in its 12 episodes. I will be awaiting the Bandai Bravern Model kit. combining the hearts of sentient robot and pilot (except this time with a lot of innuendo), etc. What it does with those tropes is give us a show that is filled to the brim (eheh) with raw (heh) emotion.

The humor, by the way, relies mostly on homoerotic jokes, so if you don\'t think gay men = funny,...there might not be much in there for you. Personally, I did laugh at some of the double entendres (lots of uses of the word ""ride""), although, now that the shows is over, I feel mostly foolish and disappointed in what amounts to lots of queerbaiting.In terms of story and characters, there\'s some good to be found in the relationships of the main trio (no one else matters at all, if we\'re being honest) and how they interact and care for each other. Other than that, the narrative is pretty bare bones.As for the animation, it\'s slick and pleasing to the eye. The fights are colorful, which gives you some level of distraction from the fact that you don\'t really care about what happens to the people in it.

Bang Bravern became a MEME because of the scene in the anime ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THEME SONG!?"" cause people to laugh at that it was a good theme song. As for the Ending song  by Ryōta Suzuki and Yōhei Azakami the song Sōen no Shōzō was cheese on top of the cake funny.OverallI really don\'t hate the Super Gay Giant Robot Bravern its a interesting character had some great moments in the Anime. The problem is LGBTQ2+ won\'t accept this as representation and pretend it doesn\'t exist. It\'s not a perfect anime with a perfect story. I can\'t help but laugh at this anime for its funny moments. It\'s a nice attempt to being a Franchise, I don\'t think it will stick with Steven Universe fans base just because the Anime has a Gay Giant Robot doesn\'t mean it\'s going to be a hit with everyone. This anime was a bit boring to be honest it could of done better if it had a good set up for a story.

Now imagine that, in addition to the usual Bay staples (explosions, lots of military vehicles, Christian references, oversexualization of female characters), this movie is light-hearted, self-referential, and intensely homoerotic. Such is Bang Bravern, the first TV anime directed by legendary animator Masami Obari in over a decade.Without a doubt, Bravern is one of the better seasonal anime in recent memory -- probably the best one since Reconguista in G from a decade ago. However, like a lot of the better seasonal anime, Bravern\'s story is more suited to a...1-2 hour OVA, which is evident in the sheer amount of filler in the anime. There are episodes where slideshow animation abounds and a lot of meaningless conversation is had. Filler character interactions don\'t have to be a bad thing, but in Bravern, they are, and that\'s because the characters are neither pleasant nor complex. An attempt was clearly made to make the characters seem complex to engage more ""mature"" audiences, which means that the characters all fall into basic anime tropes -- Smith is a Gary Stu, Isami is a self-insert, all the female characters are moe, and the Deathdrives\' personalities are over-the-top and centred around one trait. The most fleshed-out, likeable characters are Bravern and Superbia, but their interactions are too few to support the show.The story of Bravern is very silly -- Earth is being invaded by alien robots who love death, and the last hope of humanity is another alien robot who loves being a hero. It\'s the type of pulpy silly that could have worked in a 90s OVA, and it still works here. However, the story is certainly not remarkable enough to justify sitting through all the filler and otherwise grating moments in this anime. The anime is not even nice to look at. The 2D animation is eye-burning and feels like cheap plastic. In addition, all the mecha animation is done in CG, which is especially egregious since Masami Obari is one of the few animators able to direct hand-drawn mecha animation in the current anime industry. The mecha designs, save for Bravern, Superbia, Cupiridas, and a few of the military mecha, tend to feel overdesigned, uninspired, and thrown-together, as if they were designed by an AI. The only thing that makes this anime stand out are its explicitly male homoerotic moments, which are notable for being in a mainstream sci-fi/mecha anime and for involving masculine, muscular men rather than the typical yaoi soft bois who look no different from actual women.Overall, Bravern is a typical disposable seasonal anime, with nothing to make it particularly notable except its particular brand of homoeroticism. One would be better served watching an actual Yuusha series since they have everything Bravern lacks -- good animation, engrossing stories, and likeable characters/character interactions. However, if you want to watch a gay sci-fi anime that\'s non-pornographic, Bravern will serve you well. 1-2 hour OVA, which is evident in the sheer amount of filler in the anime.

Tonikaku Kawaii 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50307/Tonikaku_Kawaii_2nd_Season,"[""What is your definition of insanity?Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change…The first season of tonikawa did manage to shake up the anime fandom quite a bit gone were the days of waiting for three seasons for the couples to actually become a thing , we had them marry right from the get go! and to top it all off we got decent character writing , good progression, almost diabetes inducing cute and sweet scenes, and an actual mystery brewing in the background about tsukasa and her origins.But in season 2?Amusement park episode , hot springs...episode and A sauna episode?How the mighty have fallen.Problem is season 2s of most romance animes is usually about developing the characters and helping them get closer with their relationship , here however since their relationship is already at the best it ever could be xD it feels like an advert to marry someone in japan for half the season.Plot (5/10)The first season had better pacing and fluffy moments than the second one , the second one usually went for the tropey date event episodes with a slight twist here and there. The mystery of season one was completely forgotten till we were 8 episodes in. problem with date event episodes is that it does not feel that special anymore because there are no developments left to be made (they already married bro xD) and the characters of tsukasa and nasa have hit a ceiling on interesting conversation and most of it just flows with tuskasa being shy and nasa adoring his wife or either nasa looking like a cool dependable multipurpose guy or tsukasa looking like a classy newlywed wife. The wedding dress arc is what in my opinion saved the plot from being outright trope garbage and did give a glimpse of being as strong as the first season with a beautiful and fun dialogue , good amount of characters and a good bit of exposition on some of the mystical aspects.Characters (7/10)The characters of tsukasa and nasa are actually a good fit for each other , a classy and elegant wife who is loving and has a pretty cute side and a mentally and educationally strong husband who is actually a ditzy idiot at times and is surprisingly easy to dupe. This relationship is frankly one that is easy to see even IRL and hence adds a lot of adorable points in my opinion to this duo. The side characters were not very well used in the first part of the season with most of it being date solo so we did miss their POV and development quite a bit since the wedding arc was also about the main duo. There is a hidden secondary couple whose journey was pretty lovely as well , this was a good writing gimmick since we can no longer feel butterflies in our stomach on an already married couple on a date so having a new focus and more than that having the main duo help them nudge it there while reminiscing of their own ordeal was a good cycle to see .Art and animation (5/10)Very , very basic looking art with little to no animation gimmicks applied to the same. Background art is usually pretty generic and dull with standard hot springs or adventure park art backgrounds present with little to no emphasis on anything other than the main or side characters. The animation is also not too great. The real couple moments are also just out of the fact moment with a bit of red added to the face to show blushing xD? Animation is usually not a highlight and any scene has mostly walking animation or camera panning at best , some may have a bit of movement but its linear. The Op and ED dont have that great of art but have a bit more animation than the general package.Sound and VA (6/10)VA was just okay nothing of note or nothing to critique about either. The OP has a good song with it which has a good nostalgic feeling since its quite clearly inspired or a continuation of the season 1 op. ED is nothing too great IMO.This is a weaker continuation of the first season , it's more slice of life in the first half with no clear sense of direction and weak repetitive comedy , but if you like cute vanilla romance with no drama this is still one of the best picks. I'd be hard pressed to recommend to anyone who did not enjoy season1 Though and those who loved season1 or can manage a few episode of goalless slice of life then this may be a good time since it does get satisfactory towards the end. episode and A sauna episode?How the mighty have fallen.Problem is season 2s of most romance animes is usually about developing the characters and helping them get closer with their relationship , here however since their relationship is already at the best it ever could be xD it feels like an advert to marry someone in japan for half the season.Plot (5/10)The first season had better pacing and fluffy moments than the second one , the second one usually went for the tropey date event episodes with a slight twist here and there.

The show’s purpose is very clear and it doesn’t deviate from it. You know exactly what you are going to get and the question becomes a matter of whether you want it or not.Plot [6/10]: Each episode has its own plot whether that be playing video games or going camping. Honestly speaking, it’s kind of impressive that tonikawa manages to maintain its popularity with literally 0 plot. It’s not even as if they are stringing episodes together to create arcs of any sort. The conflict/main event introduced at the beginning of...the episode is 100% of the time, resolved at the end of the episode. It’s really just focused on creating “cute” couple moments between Nasa and Tsukasa, the main attraction of the series. I want to add that the show’s comedy is decent. Sometimes it's cringe because Nasa and Tsukasa act so unrealistic which each other, i.e. whenever Tsukasa acts bashfully towards indulging Nasa’s requests to be intimate. She acts embarrassed but never says no to him lmao. However, they manage to stay creative enough in the comedy department that the show isn’t a bad watch, because if it weren’t for the comedy, the show would be unwatchable, even for romance lovers.Characters: [7/10]: I mean really the same as last season, in the sense that there isn’t really any character development, but I’ll say that there is a large variety of characters this season, both new and old, that elevates the show and keeps them watchable. This includes his old teacher, Tsukasa’s caretaker, Kaname’s friend, and Nasa’s high school friend. Even if it’s the same old Nasa and Tsukasa, even if they annoy you by being repetitive/unrealistic, it’s hard to hate them. If you watched season one, it was probably for them after all, like I said, you know what you are getting with tonikawa: sugar-sweet romance.Animation/Art [7/10]: The art is really well done in certain moments whenever they want to create cool scenery for Nasa and Tsukasa, like a bath scene or night sky. The art is easy on the eye in my opinion. It’s a more chibi style but it fits the “cute” theme of the series. The animation is good enough, maybe a little choppy but does the job for a romance/slice–of–life. The sound effects and comedic effects were good too.Soundtrack/Voice Acting [6/10]: The comedic nature of the series really means the voice actors don’t have much to do, it’s pretty much the same throughout, with little variation unless you are Nasa or Tsukasa. Kaname has some decent moments here but it's pretty average. I wish tonikawa would do more in the soundtrack department, it’s kinda stale with the same lighthearted soundtrack. Overall, pretty average here, the opening is good for the first few seconds then turns into some EDM song that sounds terrible smh.Conclusion: I think it’s a fun watch as a rom-com fan. Just because the show is nothing to write home about doesn’t mean it’s not good. I think that Tonikawa is an average rom-com, but without the drama, harems, and triangles. It really gives off slice-of-life vibes. The whole Nasa and Tsukasa are a new couple thing does wear off but you have to keep in mind that they got married as teenagers and are a new couple. Their lack of intimacy is unrealistic and becomes boring because they are already married, there really isn’t any room for further development. The side cast is decent enough and makes up for Nasa and Tsukasa’s faults for the most part, even though they get well over half of the screen time every episode. As mentioned previously, Tonikawa has one job: sugar-sweet romance, and if you want a cute and heartwarming watch, and enjoyed Season One, Tonikawa: Season Two gets the job done. the episode is 100% of the time, resolved at the end of the episode.

Fly Me to the Moon was a masterpiece work then and is STILL a masterpiece work now.Hot on the heels of studio Seven Arcs and director Ikehata Hiroshi\'s adequate showing back in Fall 2020 for its premiere season, Tonikawa is back for the much-awaited sequel, progressing the relationship of the married couple of Nasa Yuzaki and Tsukasa, along with the memorable side...characters of the Arisugawa sisters Kaname and Aya, as well as Chitose and her band of maids.But there is one person that anchors this sequel in an influential way that exposes part of the mystery of the series: the old grandma of Tokiko Tsukuyomi, Tsukasa and Chitose\'s legal guardian. If you can recall, Tokiko only briefly shows up at the start of the Yuzaki\'s marriage life in Season 1, revealing herself to the married couple, but seemingly like an annoyance or thought, since all that the couple needed was her stamped name on the legal binding marriage document to acknowledge the marriage. The relationship between wife and guardian was iffy back then, since we didn\'t know how deep the connection between both characters would turn out to be. And now, with Season 2, the worrisomeness of Tokiko is justified by the fact that she knows that Tsukasa is some sort of celestial being, someone who would transcend time and the universe. But Nasa would still be the one and the same gigachad you know from Season 1, that love is stronger than the universe, and belief is his heart of the matter when it comes to Tsukasa.Otherwise, there is not much difference when it comes to comparisons between both seasons, with the same staff team from the prequel now helming the sequel in the same unchanging fashion. Although the OST got a refresh for the sequel, I\'ve gotta admit that I take back what I said about Season 1\'s OP being a banger, it\'s that for sure, but to me, it\'s alright. I actually prefer Season 2\'s OP a lot more due to its down-to-Earth vibes with Tsukasa\'s VA, now paired with the music collab that\'s done with Neko Hacker, which is a more palatable song. The ED...I\'ll take it or leave it, since my feelings of the manga-to-anime conversion are a bit more grounded now as compared to the ""fan bias"" lashing out back in Fall 2020.At the end of the day, it\'s still Tonikawa at the heart of it all, and it remains one of the best rom-coms of the modern era, whether you\'ve picked up the manga since Season 1\'s end or are awaiting the arrival of the sequel 2+ years later. I have enjoyed the manga once through and have surpassed the anime\'s stopping point, though the adaptation has gotten a \'tad better this time.Still, check out the anime adaptations first before going back to the manga, the expressions are much better the second time around. characters of the Arisugawa sisters Kaname and Aya, as well as Chitose and her band of maids.But there is one person that anchors this sequel in an influential way that exposes part of the mystery of the series: the old grandma of Tokiko Tsukuyomi, Tsukasa and Chitose\'s legal guardian.

Nothing has been missing, and things are being added, so no reason to complain as of now. More to look forward to. takes place in episode 3.

The most important of these questions are undoubtedly ""Why do people get married?"" and ""What\'s the point of having a wedding?""The anime has creatively explained this to us through the Yuzaki couple. This season has...given many clues about Tsukasa\'s past compared to the first season.(4)Characters: In addition to the familiar Yuzaki couple, 5-odd side characters were added this season (Ginga, Taniguchi, Tokiko, Yanagi, Kyuuma) the most important of these characters is undoubtedly Tokiko. Although Tokiko is the oldest character (Not to mention Tsukasa) seen in anime (at the age of 89) From what we can see from the flashbacks, she is smaller than Tsukasa.There are positive changes in Nasa this season that will come to our main characters. Although he was now less ashamed, he also took care of his wife properly. Of course, even if we don\'t see ""whoohoo"" this season, there is still hope. Finally, the thing we should mention in this category is undoubtedly Tsukasa, the star of this anime. Although he did not develop much in anime, he was already perfect.

This review aims to highlight the strengths and overall experience of the second season.One of the standout aspects of Tonikaku Kawaii Season 2 is the consistent portrayal of the endearing relationship between Nasa and Tsukasa.

It's definitely worth watching."", ""TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You Season 2 continues the journey between Nasa and Tsukasa and while there is certainly some magic still to be found between our newly wed couple, there series really doesn't mix up the formula enough to make this rom-com enough of an easy recommendation.  I'll assume you've seen season 1 for the purposes of this review - the SNS and Uniform episodes are nice to watch, but aren't required.Story & Characters: The second season starts us off with our couple needing a place to stay after their little place burns down.  Their journey takes us to the Arisugawa's...bathhouse, where they own a backhouse for Nasa and Tsukasa to stay in.  The series mostly starts out great because it's still fun and a lot of snide remarks towards their privacy are easily found.  It's mostly enjoyable and an easy way to get back into the mood that Tonikawa seeks to take on.Nasa and Tsukasa still take up the bulk of the plot, unsurprisingly, and are mostly unchanged from the first season.  That, however, is a problem in itself - neither go through any meaningful character development.  They discuss their future together and take steps to be make sure their life is the way they want, but there's very little in the way of conflict or even minor problems arising, making them somewhat bland for the season's duration.  Kaname and Aya are also mostly unchanged, though with them sharing the premises with our main couple now, it's easier to slide in more jokes with them and it usually works out in a humourous way.Ginga Onimaru is a new addition to the series and he comes off as more over-the-top than I felt was really necessary.  He brings a different tone to the series, but aside a few moments, he's mostly forgettable.  Kyuuma also appears in a few episodes, but I fail to see how she adds much to the series at all.  Nasa's old teacher Naoko Yanagi I actually welcomed because she somewhat mirrors how nervous Nasa was early on in season 1.  Tokiko is a relative of Tsukasa's.  I feel like her point is to move the plot along, especially with regards to Tsukasa's past, but this fails because we really aren't left with any backstory that was sorely missing in season one for our main wife.  It could very well lead to something later though.This season certainly doesn't lack for a quick laugh every now and then because there are a few amusing and great moments to be found still.  I wouldn't say dramatic, but certain situations kind of just resolve themselves in weird ways, which was probably this series' greatest strength.The biggest issue with season two is it really just feels like the same thing over and over again.  Sure, our characters go to different places during the course of the series, but it all feels far too similar.  Season 1 excelled in different situations with some surprising outcomes, but the entire duration of the season is a bunch of dates.  While they aren't terrible on their own, there just isn't any attempt to either mix it up, or develop any of our characters.  It just feels kind of thrown together.  This is especially disappointing because we basically know that something's different about Tsukasa, but we don't have a clue as to what.  (Story: 5/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: Tonikawa isn't really the best looking series, but I'd also argue that it doesn't really need to.  It looks solid enough that you'll get the idea of what they're going for and even if it looks a little flat at times, it was never near offensive.  I haven't really seen anything that Seven Arcs has put out aside this series, but they seem to be solid enough.  (6/10)Sound: I'm not entirely sure why people love the OP from the first season so much, but it never appealed to me - this season's didn't either.  Both it and the ED were fine, but nothing special.  The OST feels like it's mostly unchanged and was also kind of just there.  VO talent from the first season returns, leading with Zach Aguilar (Nasa) and Lauren Landa (Tsukasa), both of which were solid.  Erika Harlacher-Stone returns as Aya as was likely the best of the cast.  Newcomers Kimberley Anne Campbell (Kyuuma) and Suzie Yeung (Naoko) were also strong here.  I couldn't find a confirmed listing, but it does sound like Cindy Robinson voices Tokiko - she's always strong in those roles.  (8/10)Overall: TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You Season 2 was fine overall, but it really doesn't push any boundaries and doesn't attempt to make us worry about our couple.  I'll likely check out the four-episode sequel that was announced, but this series seriously needs some more character development and differing plot lines in order to keep appealing to me.

It is balanced chaos.I think the characters and relationships in the show are some of the best written that I have seen in romance anime to date.The problem with the series is the plot and how it develops from mid-season 2 onwards. The plot of the whole series hinges on a big mystery regarding ""Who is the main girl and why did she marry the main guy?""The answer to this core question is implied (until it is confirmed in the manga, hence...my spoiler tag), but these implications are far more heavily emphasized starting in the middle of the second season. The problem is that the answer to question is such a core part of the series that you cannot separate the characters from the plot if you dislike the direction.Knowing the answer and the ""giant white lie"" behind it paints the entire series (anime and manga) in a completely different and irrevocable light, not all of which is good. In fact, the more you think about it, the more incredibly messed up it gets. In some ways, the twist is more drastic than the one in ""Your Lie in April"" but you aren\'t given the insight a lie exists from the title until it is too late.As someone who gets very invested in characters, I cannot in good conscience recommend this series, especially from season 2 onwards.

In fact, the more you think about it, the more incredibly messed up it gets. In some ways, the twist is more drastic than the one in ""Your Lie in April"" but you aren\'t given the insight a lie exists from the title until it is too late.As someone who gets very invested in characters, I cannot in good conscience recommend this series, especially from season 2 onwards. If you prize character relationships above all else or you hate being lied to as the watcher, you may feel betrayed by this show.', ""Didn't live up to the second season level I had hoped for but was laid back and nice to watch.After enjoying the first season back in 2020 it quickly impacted me with its slice of life couples romantic comedy, followed by nice art style  and lead characters. It pretty much made itself out to be the perfect anime of a married couple.This season however did expand the setting and amount of characters but at the same time slowed down with the flow of the plot almost feeling like nothing was happening, especially when they both ended up stalking Nasa's old teacher which was just...boring in all truthfulness.It was still nice to see these two just live a happy marriage while living together and just enjoying eachother like a normal married couple with just moments here and there which shows Japan why they need to populate and the perks of doing so.With this in mind not too much change from the previous season with only a slight drop in quality in terms of plot, which isn't much of a big deal to me but I do hope season three doesn't take too long even if it probably is the season they wrap up the anime or could do a fourth season which just depends on the author and how many ideas he has left as this season was a bit bland with what happened in comparison to the previous season.So if you've watched the first season then just keep in mind that this season is a bit more laid back in comparison. boring in all truthfulness.It was still nice to see these two just live a happy marriage while living together and just enjoying eachother like a normal married couple with just moments here and there which shows Japan why they need to populate and the perks of doing so.With this in mind not too much change from the previous season with only a slight drop in quality in terms of plot, which isn't much of a big deal to me but I do hope season three doesn't take too long even if it probably is the season they wrap up the anime or could do a fourth season which just depends on the author and how many ideas he has left as this season was a bit bland with what happened in comparison to the previous season.So if you've watched the first season then just keep in mind that this season is a bit more laid back in comparison."", ""Kind of the same song and dance as season 1 in most ways. The story had slightly more depth at times than season 1, and one of the side characters actually has some depth. However, the intro wasn't as good. So overall if you liked season 1, you'll like this season too. It's still cute and enjoyable, but just not that impressive. To reiterate what I wrote for season 1: Animation is fairly average, no flash, but some decent looking backgrounds from time to time. Characters have fairly little detail though. Characters, while likeable, have very little depth. Story is mostly basic, there are some...small twists, but just not often enough to really add much to the show. Pacing is slow, but bearable most of the time. The soundtrack is good. Really my main complaint with this show after two seasons is there is not really much substance to sink my teeth into, which means I really don't have any desire to rewatch this series even though it was fairly enjoyable the first time through. 5.55/10 small twists, but just not often enough to really add much to the show.

Though, I honestly think that the story progression is somewhat slow this Season and it tends to repeat some elements already present in Season 1. With that being said, it is not a terrible sequel, I just hope that they delve deeper to Tsukasa's background and her past relationships before getting married to Nasa, considering all that teaser that they put in the Opening of the Anime. I don't dislike this sequel altogether, I just hope that they unravel the mystery that shrouds Tsukasa' character.

If you are hoping for a bigger development in the story, with Tsukasa’s background being explored, or even a development in romance, you’re in the wrong place.The anime shows a few more characters, forgetting others, for example, Nasa’s parents in the way, and that’s all. The protagonists don’t go further in their married couple lives and still getting embarrassed when something “spicier” happens. Even Nasa’s teacher, who is a single woman in her first appearance in this season and is at the end of the season...hanging out with another teacher.The answers for Tsukasa being such resistance and being able to save Nasa in the beginning of the series didn’t show up, just a lot of flashbacks.There are no scenes or soundtrack to detach, just the opening is a good music to hear.

And i have added a spoiler warning though there is nothing to spoilexcept manga.First of all, i would like to adress those people who are saying that there is no definite development. Those who require development, rest assured there will definitely be development and the story has an end.In most normal romance animes there is a protagonist and a girl and they show us the tensions between them before the anime reaches to a point when the protagonist confesses.Tonikaku Kawaii shows us the aftermath. What actually happens...after a confession happens.In my opinion it is unique in that matter. It shows us the early struggles of being a couple and how they interact with each other. Though the ages are not right to be married (in my opinion) the anime is excellent neverthelss. Another aspect i like is how agressive Nasa-kun is. Often times the mc is very conservative and will not act rashly however you can always excpect Nasa-kun to be the man.Tsukasa is an ..... interesting character but this is not a review of the characters but of the anime. You are reading this review to find out whether or not i should watch this anime.Yes : This anime is a slice of life, romance anime. This could have been much better if Tsukasa was not so mysterious but i think that it does not matter that much. If you are the type of person who just wants to laugh and give courage to the mc. This is the anime for you.No : There are not many reasons why one should not watch this anime . A very important reason is development . I loved the first season so much i read the entire manga ( a whopping 233 ch ) and the development will only begin from season 3. So if u love development then i would not recommend it. If u cringe at jokes then dont watch this.Conclusion : This is a very good anime . I am biased since i am a manga reader but would defenitely recommend this.

Usually, the main characters are gradually becoming closer, developing sympathy towards each other and only then reveal their true feelings, but here the duo not only confesses each other at the beginning but straight up gets married. So Nasa and Tsukasa are getting used to live together under one roof. One thing I liked about the first season was a linear structure of the story. Every time something had been happening that helped to maintain the dynamic. There is nothing significant happening in in the second season. Most of the episodes are romance/slice...of life, sometimes based on fetishes like kissing or bathing. The same staff was in the OVAs but it was expected because OVAs always focus on fanservice. The sequel is still tight-lipped about some potential plot twists, and keeping in mind that it has been teased since the first season, it more and more seems to be anticlimactic, but we will see.The chemistry between the protagonists continues to please. There is nothing outstanding, but it feels fresh after all romcoms to see people whose conversations don't narrow down to misunderstanding and goofiness. Contrarily, the side characters are exactly like this. Speaking of them, the already introduced side characters are getting more exposition, which adds some depth to them, as well as the new characters are being introduced. The comedy aspect hasn't changed since the prequel as far as I remember. Personally, there are some good jokes here and there, but it is mostly vanilla anime humor.The visual and animation aren't the top tier judging by the entire anime spectrum, but in terms of romcom they are pretty good. The OP maybe doesn't slap as hard as the first one, but I glad it kept the same style of the song by the use of elements of rap and dubstep. On the other hand, the ED and ost don't try to stand out aside from one track using bass guitar.I wouldn't say this season is a step-up in the series, it's probably even a minute step-down. Especially bearing in mind that the first half feels deficient offering nothing but fluffiness. I doubt it will manage to draw the attention of new people, but if you like the first season, there are no reasons to skip this one. of life, sometimes based on fetishes like kissing or bathing.

Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1002/Top_wo_Nerae_2_Diebuster,"['Many people will know the name of Hideaki Anno, in particular because of Neon Genesis Evangelion. His directorial debut though, was an OVA called Top wo Nerae (known as Gunbuster in the West), and whilst NGE has many, many advocates, I will admit to being one of the few who consider his debut work to be superior in almost every aspect. That said, I approached the sequel, Diebuster, with a degree of trepidation, in particular because the directorial reins had been handed over to Tsurumaki Kazuya, who also directed FLCL, NGE: Death & Rebirth, and the first two installments of the NGE remakes.To say...I was surprised by the end result would be an understatement.Top wo Nerae 2 takes a bit of getting used to, especially for fans of the original series. The style, plot and scripting are very different to the original OVA, however the feel of the show is remarkably similar to it\'s predecessor. Part of this is because the story is set around ten years prior to the final moments of Gunbuster, at the very end of the 12,000 year period. Humanity is still at war with the  ""space monsters"", but they are more able to cope now thanks to the efforts of the Fraternity, which is made up of teenaged pilots who possess ""supernatural"" powers (known as ""Topless""), and their Buster machines.The story begins with Nono, a clumsy girl living on Mars who dreams of being a space pilot. She runs away from home to follow her dream, only to find that reality is very different. Through a chance encounter she meets a Topless called Lal\'C Melk Mark, and is completely bowled over by the experience. She follows Lal\'C into space, ultimately to meet her destiny.In all honesty, the plot is actually the weakest part of the whole OVA. Although the story is well paced and the scripting is tight but flowing, there are some obvious homages to Gunbuster which, all told, the show could really have done without. That\'s not to say that all the references are bad, especially as this is set within Gunbuster\'s timeframe. It simply means that the show is too reliant on knowledge of the original OVA at times, and would have been better served by trying to be more original on occasion.The biggest problem though, is that the director and the writers have tried to cover this by making Nono a fan of Nonoriri, the girl who saved the Solar System thousands of years ago. This attempt at deus ex machina didn\'t sit too well as it gave a certain falseness to the characters thoughts, feelings and actions at times, especially on the occasions that mirrored occurences from the original OVA.However, while the story may have it\'s problems, it is actually enjoyable for the most part, and it\'s to the credit of the writers that a number of flaws can be forgiven (not all though, more on that in a bit).One area where the show does excel is in it\'s animation. Gainax have, once again, produced some stunning work in terms of character movements and set piece action sequences, and it\'s fair to say that in this department Diebuster is actually better than Gunbuster. The character designs, created by Sadamoto Yoshiyuki (who was also the character designer for FLCL), are very good on the whole, although they are, at times, a tad cartoonish. The backgrounds, especially the renderings of space and it\'s wonders, are very well done, and some of the visual effects used in the show are truly inspired.The OVA does fall down though, in it\'s usage of nudity. Where the original series also had a degree of nudity, it\'s usage was minimal at best (aside from the bath scene), with the most prominent example being Noriko\'s famous shirt ripping moment in the final episode. Diebuster, on the other hand, seems to take any excuse to show the fans some skin, and whilst there are times when this mimics the first series, there are far too many occasions where it serves no purpose other than to please the fans. I\'m all for pleasing the fans, but Tsurumaki and Gainax should have tried to do this in a different way instead of choosing to be ""cheap"".Diebuster is very good in terms of it\'s sound effects, not simply in their usage, but also because of their timing. The sound department has paid a great a deal of attention to matching specific effects to the on-screen action, and whilst there are times when the sound is a veritable cacophony, closer examination will reveal that each individual effect stems from an individual action, item, character, etc. In truth, Diebuster is one of the few anime that is worth watching with surround sound to truly appreciate the quality of the effects.In terms of music, the show has a generally martial tone to the various thematic pieces, however these are offset by some mellow tracks that work well with the more relaxed moments. The show has a certain feeling of continuity because of the music used throughout the series, some of which is taken directly from Gunbuster, while others have the same feel. The ending theme in the final episode is very much in keeping with that of the original series, and given that both OVAs finish at the same point in time this, like many of the other tracks, is well used and choregraphed.Once again though, Diebuster is let down by something simple, in this case, the OP and ED. Where the ED from Gunbuster was a pretty staid ditty about love, the OP had a ""get up and go"" feeling to it that was reflective of the whole OVA. Diebuster, on the other hand, has two J-Pop tracks for it\'s OP and ED, both of which don\'t really reflect any aspect of the show, and seem to have been chosen to make the OVA more ""trendy"".That said, the voice acting was very good throughout the show. Fukui Yukari\'s Nono possessed a bubbly personality that was tempered with determination, while Sakamoto Maaya\'s Lal\'C has an aloof, and slightly disgruntled air about her. In terms of acting ability, the cast is truly excellent, and while there are occasions when they do ham up their roles a little, this is very much in keeping with the ""excessive"" feel of the OVA (more on that in a bit).As for the characters themselves, they are the second weak point for Diebuster. Nono, in terms of the story, possesses no real motivations other than to be a space pilot. While she is most definitely an enjoyable character, she doesn\'t actually develop in any real way, as much of her drive and conviction remains the same even after her memory returns. Much of the development in the show actually happens on the part of Lal\'C, especially in the way her thinking changes to reflect that of Nono.Unfortunately, the show has a number of recurring characters who really get little to no development, and whilst it\'s true that this is only a 6 part OVA, if all the development was only supposed to occur on the part of the main characters, then the director should have focused on this instead of making lame attempts to round out other characters, a case in point being the furore involving Tycho and Buster machine Quatre-Vingt-Dix. The time could have been better used to round out the story instead, and it\'s ironic that while Diebuster hasn\'t done this, Gunbuster actually did.To many it may seem as though I don\'t like Diebuster, especially as I\'m an advocate of the original OVA, however nothing couldbe further from the truth. I found Diebuster to be very good, however not in the same way as Gunbuster. The reason for this lies solely on the shoulders of several people, including the director and character designer. Like many directors, Tsurumaki has tried, and in some measure succeeded, to stamp his mark on the series proper, and his influence, along with that of certain other staff members, is readily apparent throughout the anime, so much so in fact, that there are occasions when Diebuster resembles FLCL or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann more than it does Gunbuster.This is not a bad thing though, as it does give the OVA a different feel to the original, but therein lies the problem as well. Where FLCL and TTGL have an excessive, over-the-top atmosphere that is prevalent in Diebuster, the original Gunbuster opted for a quiet heroism that was truly touching, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the final episodes of both OVAs. The final scenes in Gunbuster are quiet, with an emphasis on personal sacrifice - the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few being the most appropriate sentiment. Diebuster, on the other hand, opts for a much flashier ending, with lots of noise and action, and to be honest, very little emotional impact. In truth, Nono\'s transformation scene and what follows is actually far more memorable than the ending itself, which says a lot about the actual scripting of the show.The problem, at least for me, is simply this: the entire series is supposed to be about how far humanity will go in order to survive. Given that fact, the method chosen to combat the ""space monster"" in the final epsiode doesn\'t equate with the core of the story, especially as there are other planets in the Solar System that would have been more suitable. That particular method was an attempt at mimicking the usage of Buster machine #3 in the first OVA which, unfortunately, doesn\'t have the same effect, mainly because the element of personal sacrifice for the greater good is missing.It may sound strange to say this now, but Tsurumaki et al could have easily channeled their collective creativity into creating a show that not only captured the spirit of Gunbuster, but also encapsulated the style of FLCL and TTGL, and, in all honesty, a show like that already exists - Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still. That said, Diebuster is surprisingly honest in a number of ways, the main one being the fact that it makes no excuses for it\'s numerous homages to the original OVA. While there may be those who think that using so many references is simply a method of capturing fans of the original anime, this method gives the entire show a feeling of continuity that is so often missingfrom sequels.On the whole Diebuster is a great addition to the franchise, and while it has it\'s flaws, it\'s definitely a worthy successor to Gunbuster. While the story and characters may not be as good as the original OVA, Diebuster has a style and flair of it\'s own that elevates the show to a whole new level.I wouldn\'t say that it\'s truly equal to Gunbuster, but it comes very, very, close. I was surprised by the end result would be an understatement.Top wo Nerae 2 takes a bit of getting used to, especially for fans of the original series. The style, plot and scripting are very different to the original OVA, however the feel of the show is remarkably similar to it\'s predecessor.

Diebuster, on the other hand, opts for a much flashier ending, with lots of noise and action, and to be honest, very little emotional impact. In truth, Nono\'s transformation scene and what follows is actually far more memorable than the ending itself, which says a lot about the actual scripting of the show.The problem, at least for me, is simply this: the entire series is supposed to be about how far humanity will go in order to survive. Given that fact, the method chosen to combat the ""space monster"" in the final epsiode doesn\'t equate with the core of the story, especially as there are other planets in the Solar System that would have been more suitable. That particular method was an attempt at mimicking the usage of Buster machine #3 in the first OVA which, unfortunately, doesn\'t have the same effect, mainly because the element of personal sacrifice for the greater good is missing.It may sound strange to say this now, but Tsurumaki et al could have easily channeled their collective creativity into creating a show that not only captured the spirit of Gunbuster, but also encapsulated the style of FLCL and TTGL, and, in all honesty, a show like that already exists - Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still. That said, Diebuster is surprisingly honest in a number of ways, the main one being the fact that it makes no excuses for it\'s numerous homages to the original OVA. While there may be those who think that using so many references is simply a method of capturing fans of the original anime, this method gives the entire show a feeling of continuity that is so often missingfrom sequels.On the whole Diebuster is a great addition to the franchise, and while it has it\'s flaws, it\'s definitely a worthy successor to Gunbuster. While the story and characters may not be as good as the original OVA, Diebuster has a style and flair of it\'s own that elevates the show to a whole new level.I wouldn\'t say that it\'s truly equal to Gunbuster, but it comes very, very, close.', 'It is important to note that this is a continuation, and as such, will be reviewed under the assumption one has seen the prequel.Lets get down to it. Top wo Nerae! 2, alsno known as Diebuster is the indirect sequel to Top wo Nerae/Gunbuster. I enjoyed this short OVA substantially because of its presentation.PlotThe story follows a girl called Nono who wishes to be a ""Topless,"" which is basically an ace mech pilot to put it simply. Instead of dragging the story out with pointless episodes and scenes you often see in 26+ shows, Diebuster goes straight to the point and sticks with it....Most of the scenes show multiple different conflicts (whether they are big or small) which are tied together with the main plot quite nicely. Pacing is great, but since it\'s so short you might forget some of the smaller details as the series goes on.Visual/PersonalityThis anime brought with it a wide variety of moods and atmosphere simply due to its visual direction. In terms of overall quality, Diebuster falls by today\'s standards however considering its age, the key animations were memorable to say the least. The fights were all very fluid, everything in the scene seemed like it was flowing together. Usually, emotion is hard to convey, however Diebuster was able to successfully convey those emotions through its visuals. Not only that, but character design was excellent, they managed to turn a basic style suit into each character\'s individual style, and personality wise, none of them (at least to me) seemed to follow the stereotypical route.SoundDiebuster had a good OST when it comes to sound. The BGM\'s were nice and, all though not Gurren Lagann-type memorable, they stood up there with some of the good ones. The voice acting was pretty good too (see emotions being memorable). Some might argue Nono\'s voice was annoying, but I liked it. Even the enemy grunts/noises, those were superb, for grunts and noises anyway heh. Everything that had a distinct sound keep that sound though, for example beams sound like beams or explosions sound like explosions, but when tied with Diebuster\'s BGM, it sounded better. Lets not forget the OP and ED, both of which totally owned face. Groovin\' Magic stands to be one of the best songs, at least in my opinion, to match this series (plus it was done by Round Table feat. Nino, who are one of my favorites). ACKO\'s Hoshikuzu Namida is a catchy single as well, pair it together with the slideshow ending, it\'s perfect.EnjoymentThe reason I enjoyed this so much is because of the memorable scenes and the similarity between the original. Gainax seemed to keep the trend of hotblooded epicness going after they finished Diebuster with Gurren Lagann, which doesn\'t relate to Top wo Nerae at all, but they all share the same principles. If you are a fan of mecha, shounen, or anything of that sort, I\'m am confident Diebuster will give you some enjoyment.OverallAll in all, I give Diebuster, rather Top wo Nerae! 2, a solid 9 out of 10. I have to admit, those seeking to watch this typically already know what they are getting into. A story about believing in yourself and overcoming difficulties and struggles; these things are common to us all.

They tend to be put under more scrutiny than their predecessors, as they not only have to deal with standing tall as installments in their own right, but they need to provide merit as a sequel to a product that never needed one. The trickiest prospect involved is the anniversary sequel, as that is where you’re most likely to enact the gambit. Some projects of this nature can pay off in a way that respects the original and becomes its own product, perhaps even...succeeding it in the process. However, not everyone can do a Turn A Gundam, and instead, some make Diebuster.Put it simply, it fails both ways. As a series, it features mediocre at best and largely uninteresting characters, half-assed power-up moments, and tons of convoluted and barely explained sci-fi superpower bullshit & worldbuilding. When the highlight in terms of memorable character moments was a rape attempt, you know you’ve fucked up. As a sequel, Diebuster’s almost insulting. The writers made a completely different type of show -a mediocre one at that- a sequel to Gunbuster. It would be like making Aldnoah.Zero the sequel to Macross. As such, everything about the already poorly-crafted and convoluted world-building (galaxy building?) is brimming with incompatibility.Buster machines are now biomechanical machines that can only be piloted by people with some hereditary superpower gene rather than robots that take skill for any able-bodied person in general to pilot. They each come with different powers including the ability to freeze space creatures in space with quantum temperatures, and controlling and turning other ships into creatures to use during battle via psychic powers or something akin to that. They have colonized entirely new planets with futuristic military technology, yet transportation technology and all things not inherently related to war against space creatures has yet to advance beyond 2004 —the year this OVA first aired— until the finale outright contradicts that. The finale also proves that it takes place during a specific portion of the original’s finale, as if to self-destruct while getting its idol caught in the explosion. Additionally, whereas Gunbuster used real, hard science for its science fiction, Diebuster uses pseudoscience superpower nonsense. This and more serve as only a taste of how incompatible (for lack of a better word) the world-building is, and why crafting a coherent world is always important. Otherwise, we get two pieces that just cannot fit.There’s also the fact that the mere existence of the events in Die, even discounting the monumentally awful finale, ultimately sully the finale of the original Gunbuster. Not only did that show end phenomenally, but it did so in a way in which no real sequel could be warranted. Gunbuster ended so conclusively that to continue would be to retroactively take back part of the point of the finale. This isn’t even touching on the world-building. This show really should have been its own thing. It would have been a mediocre at best show, but better a mediocre separate celebration installment than a show that accidentally knocks over its predecessor’s grave, especially when said predecessor became one of the two foundational anime of its studio. However, it would probably require heavy rewrites towards the end in particular. After all, the more it goes on, the worse it gets, peaking in its concluding episodes in terms of sheer atrocity, as the show stops caring almost entirely and ends up outright nullifying the ending of the original, at least canonically.To cover the positive —read: superficial— aspects of this asteroid, the music is better than last time, and the visuals are still mostly well-crafted. Even with the awful mech designs excessive amounts of usually terrible CGI, the show’s visuals are worthwhile. The character designs are fine enough -particularly that of Nono- and the action animation is smooth, kinetic, and kept track of extremely well...as long as the characters aren’t running. It may not hold up compared to the immaculately detailed and stylized predecessor of yore, but disregarding that leaves you with visuals that were on par with that best at the time, at least animation-wise. The sense of scale is quite large, to add on top of that. Lastly, the music is honestly a tad superior than the original, at least when it isn’t remixing tracks. The OP and ED themes are ok and the background music is serviceable, though that is all I can praise.Ultimately, the more this show goes on, the more horrible a sequel it becomes. As if it wouldn’t be a bad enough show on its own, it just had to throw a classic series under the bus in a drunken attempt at paying homage and joining a franchise. Barring the prospect of bastardizing a returning cast, Diebuster commits every sin a sequel can commit -including ones I never thought were possible- and ends up shattering itself into pieces upon its obnoxious attempts at trying to send-up and one-up. On its own, it's a mediocre turned bad show too ambitious for its own good. As a sequel, it is so...so much worse. Way to go Gainax, producing the worst thing in your mainline repertoire to celebrate 20 years! succeeding it in the process.

To my surprise, on the first scnenes, it appears to be totally different or not correlated to the 1st series.Then, like the 1st series, it began popping aliens, space and kinda different mechas? Different you say? Yes, the Top wo Nerae 2! mechas look much more like the EVAs than the 1st series mechas. But on the first chapters you note that this 2nd series battles are much MORE OVERPOWERED than the 1st series.With you think that Dragon Ball Z is...overpowered, think again, Diebuster 2 is the winner.Overall, the anime has interesting art, looking like FLCL (it is the same director), the songs are great, and the action is intense like the 1st season.But the good thing you will find in the end, i will not say, because it is a spoiler, but it will make you happy. overpowered, think again, Diebuster 2 is the winner.Overall, the anime has interesting art, looking like FLCL (it is the same director), the songs are great, and the action is intense like the 1st season.But the good thing you will find in the end, i will not say, because it is a spoiler, but it will make you happy.', ""This is simply the best OVA, and perhaps series ever produced.  Basically an alternate telling of Gunbuster, but as a parallel of sorts.  The original series, from the 1980's, didn't get too much recognition until Gainax really hit mainstream with Neon Genesis Evangelion.Diebuster, from the director of FLCL, takes a lot from that series as far as animation style, and improves upon it greatly.  The six episode OVA has some of the best art and animation and just does an incredible job overall. "", 'Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster is a hard anime to review. Basically because it is hard to analyse it without comparing it to its prequel. However: that isn\'t wrong, considering it IS a sequel and it does connect with the original OVA. Furthermore, it tries to conclude with various references to Gunbuster so rather it would be futile to look at it as a stand alone work and it couldn\'t be appreciated without the comparison either.Having said that - the story of Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster isn\'t sublime. For one, it lets go of the realistic, more scientifically organized orientation that the first OVA...set and picks up a rather far fetched fictional approach. That is mainly a neg as a sequel. Pushing technology ahead is one thing, but just coming up with ideas that seem to be written at a drinking party doesn\'t suit the anime as a sequel. Gunbuster set the universe as a futuristic approach to our present universe where technology had advanced, not a magical realm of superhuman races. That also reduced the attribute of tension that was prevalent in Gunbuster and brought the possibility of doing \'magical\' stuff that doesn\'t suit the plot line of mankinds survival.Secondly, there were plot holes. There were ideas poorly connected - there were ideas that spawned out of nowhere as if the story was not thought out properly in the start and at times there was no good transition from one event to another. And furthermore, small internal plots and politics that was added, brought little appeal to the show - they seemed like excuses to make the plot deep with a lot of stuff going on. This further gave little room for the main characters to interact and give off a more \'emotional\' show that would have saved it some face. And just to add - the plot gave too much a feel of ""Outlaw Star"". The Serpentine Sisters seem like the Mcdougall brothers. The ending fight seems similar and there is a more of the \'chi\'/power concept making it look like an Outlaw Star universe.As a standalone plot, it would save more face - we would have to accept that it is a universe with certain abilities and fictional elements however it still doesn\'t deliver. There are still many more negatives like plot ones mentioned above - even as a standalone anime, it lacks a very good unique or well executed plot.Now it may be my personal choice but the extremely vibrant, and girlish outlook of the characters didn\'t appeal to me. That however is a comment due to the comparison with Gunbuster; if we overlook that I did like the art in general, the fluidity, the backgrounds and color schemes. I would still say I find more appeal to the art style and execution of the original but picking on Diebuster at this point will be a very biased approach.The characters were another weak thing about the show - Nono lacks much personality integrity - much like Luffy. And that doesn\'t sit well. Her wish from the start, her affiliation with ""Onee-Sama"" and her philosophy changes further down the show are lacking in several ways. Lal\'c seems to be more well defined, more well crafted but that is only in comparison to Nono. Otherwise she also develops either too quickly, or conveniently for the plot. This is of course comparing to WELL developed characters. The rest of the characters don\'t require much attention - most were added for \'plot details\' and \'politics\' that was again lacking because either it didn\'t get too much time to develop or it seemed too cliched to appeal. More like a poorly developed cliche which makes it have little to no appeal.So in the end did I enjoy watching the OVA? No. To fans of the original, watching this is a huge disappointment.

Nonoriri is a normal girl""Diebuster, or Gunbuster 2 or Top No Nare 2! or simply Aim for the Top 2! is one of the best attempts that GAINAX has ever made to create a short yet heart blasting show that makes you fall in love with it from the very first minute of the first episode. Not many can achieve it. Somehow, Gainax can.The story features a robot-girl Nono who, of all things in the world, wants to become a space pilot the most. In order to do so she follows one of the top fighters - Lark, who pilots Dex Neuf -...artificial Buster machine no 19. That\'s a very short summary of this anime. Why short? Because this is just a core to the whole story which, while not being very complex, sucks you in with no quarter till the final minutes of the show.This is something uncanny for 6-ep shows which tend to rush things and focus mainly on the development of one character - usually the protagonist. This series instead develops several different stories on different levels. Some are relevant to Nono\'s main plot and some are there just to make the series more memorable. That\'s a very good development in my opinion. We learn background stories for both Lark and Nono, as well as Chico, Casio and other current or ex buster pilots. The story gets more intriguing when you learn that what the main protagonists have been fighting so far... isn\'t their real enemy... (much like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Gurren brigade fighting beastmen, if you know what I mean).This is show is all about... overdoing things... So we do get some ecchi parts, we do get some slick and smooth animation of gigantic grotesque mechas fighting computer animated aliens in outer space and futuristic and unreal space stations, colonies, planets with the core only (this one looks particularly staggering!) and oversized weapons that can even move planets and warp in a second throughout the whole milky way... If I was to judge I would say that TTGL is solely based on this anime. Good thing or bad, you pick...In all this epicness the series does not stump on some serious moments and drama. When we are to laugh the show is funny and obscure, but when the time comes to keep your mouth shut and watch the events - you know it right away. God bless Gainax for differentiating these two aspects. FLCL failed here all the way around.The series itself, much like TTGL and Evangelion is a story of coming of age, growing up, becoming adult or however you want to call it. It may be cliche these days, when most shows do that, but then again nowhere else will you be able to feel the tension so close and hard as in Aim for the Top 2! It\'s omnipotent, you can practically touch it... On one hand we get to see and know Lark who seems to be a little too mature for her age. To contrast that we have Nono who, on the other hand, is as carefree as she can get while being older than Lark. Things quickly change, as the truth about Nono\'s past is revealed, and although she keeps her characteristic features till the very end, she matures very quickly to stand firm as a final defender to the humanity. This accounts for splendid characters and very good plot construction.It gets even better as we move on to the video and audio aspect. The series is dated back in 2003 but since it\'s an OVA the animation quality is simply outstanding. Not once did I got distracted by even average quality of the drawings or cgi. The same goes for catchy and memorable soundtrack which fits perfectly to the events on screen. Sure, you do see some exaggerated space combat here, with beams firing, hundreds of enemies dead in a single shot and planet throwing (we all love TTGL, right? :D ) but it\'s all explained. Shhh, don\'t mention the fact that the explanations are a bit... vague :).So to sum it up. If you liked EVA, FLCL and you\'re akin of space series - Aim for the Top 2! is for you. If you didn\'t... well watch it either way. You won\'t be disappointed, simply because behind the huge cloud of exaggeration and epicness lies a very good plot and fabulous characters... artificial Buster machine no 19.

I would say that it was a prequel to Gurren Lagann in ways such as style and philosophy (I mean just look at Nono).Over all, this was a more fun show to watch compared to gunbuster and its art was definitely prettier. Also, the director of this show is about 50 million times superior to Anno, as Anno cannot direct his way out of a paper bag. ', 'If you desire to watch this in any way, you MUST, yes MUST watch Gunbuster first. Diebuster simply will NOT be as enjoyable or as good of a work if the viewer does not have previous experience with Gunbuster. Hence, I\'m going to write this review as if the viewer has already viewed the previous OVA (though I won\'t spoil anything from Gunbuster)All at once, Diebuster is a sequel, a tribute, a homage, and a celebration. It\'s obviously a sequel to Gunbuster, but keep in mind that this OVA was animated for the 20th anniversary of Gainax. Hence, it is extremely self-referential in many ways;...it is a tribute to the original Gunbuster, it contains homages to previous Gainax works like Evangelion and FLCL, and it is a celebration of everything Gainax stands for.Upon first glance, Diebuster (or Top wo Nerae! 2, but that\'s just awkward to type) is a sequel in name only. The OVA shares a director with FLCL; the art and animation is obviously more akin to FLCL\'s stylized visuals than Gunbuster\'s more realistic take. There is much, much more light-hearted humor thanks to our new protagonist Nono being the cute, ditzy type. You never really get the sense that the two OVAs take place in the same universe until late into the first episode.Character development is still top-notch, but that largely comes from being very self-referential. Nono and Lal\'C\'s relationship share the same sort of dynamic as Noriko\'s and Amano\'s, a deliberate move driven home with Nono\'s addressing of Lal\'C as ""Onee-sama"". The new protagonists undergo the same sort of problems and interactions as the olds ones, but it never feels rehashed or retreaded. Make no mistake, these are different characters. Some of the minor characters get much screentime as well. For instance, there is an entire episode devoted to Tycho, a relatively minor character.In an improvement over Gunbuster, Diebuster\'s plot is very present. Yet, it never feels like it\'s intruding upon any other areas like character. This is where Diebuster really differentiates itself from Gunbuster; if Gunbuster had a better plot it would distract from the amazing character development that OVA had. Summarizing the plot would be major spoilers but without saying too much, by the fourth episode you will have absolutely no doubt that Diebuster is a true sequel and takes place in the same universe as the original OVA.Animation and sound are top notch; just what you would expect from modern Gainax. In yet another homage, much of the orchestral score uses motifs from the Gunbuster score. This really helps in establishing the legtimacy of the sequel. As mentioned above, the art is radically different from Gunbuster, but it\'s not limited to the art; it also extends to the designs as well. This is very jarring at first, especially if you watch it right after viewing Gunbuster. This is even more noticable when certain elements from Gunbuster return; those elements are drawn in the retro 80s style and really stick out. All for the better though, it makes them that much more powerful dramatically.Many questions that the viewer may have are answered sufficiently well by the fifth episode. However, much like the original, the viewer is not fully satisfied until they\'ve finished the final episode. The plot wraps up very nicely, and by this time, you feel that Diebuster has done a good job with unifiying old and new. But then it gets better. I will not describe the scenes, but you will know them when you see it. All I\'m going to say is that it involves shirt ripping. I also won\'t describe the ending. It really needs to be seen completely unspoiled as it is incredibly important. I will say this: the ending is the one thing that completely unifies Gunbuster and Diebuster into the single, cohesive work.As such, this is why my review scores were so high. I will reiterate what I said at the beginning; Diebuster MUST be seen after Gunbuster. This wasn\'t so much a review of Diebuster, but the second half of Top wo Nerae!. It complements the first half, it ""recompletes"" it so to speak. Rather paradoxically however, it is still unique enough to stand differentiate itself and be regarded as it\'s own story. Many elements make it unique despite being so closely intertwined with Gunbuster. Those unique elements worked so well, Gainax went and revisted them three years later as a full length series. The result was a little something called Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I think that speaks volumes.If you\'ve seen Gunbuster, what are you waiting for? I\'ve been lavishing praise upon it for the past several paragraphs. If you\'re a mecha, or even just any sort of anime fan, do yourself a favor and watch these two works. You will laugh, you will cry.Most importantly, you will be given a reminder as to why you love anime. it is a tribute to the original Gunbuster, it contains homages to previous Gainax works like Evangelion and FLCL, and it is a celebration of everything Gainax stands for.Upon first glance, Diebuster (or Top wo Nerae! 2, but that\'s just awkward to type) is a sequel in name only.

You will laugh, you will cry.Most importantly, you will be given a reminder as to why you love anime.', 'There are, perhaps, 3 reasons why this is my Favourite Anime. And one why it nearly isn\'t...Firstly, and most importantly, I simply Love the style of it. The Animation is, in my opinion awesome. Ever watched Tengen Toppa or FLCL? Its Gainax at its best, doing those wonderful super-deformed animations that manages to maintain a very high quality of animation. Its not realistic in any sense of the word, but you still find yourself watching it and finding it so easy to understand.Secondly, the story is a follow on to the original Gunbuster. Which, for me, somewhat set the bar for many Mecha Animes. But...more importantly, it isn\'t really a Sequel. It doesn\'t finish off the plot of Gunbuster; Gunbuster doesn\'t need finishing, it had a pretty definitive end. What it does is proves to us that Noriko really DID save the human race.Finally, despite being a ""Sequel"", its story is wonderful and, importantly, stands entirely on its own. You can watch Diebuster without ever hearing of Gunbuster, and you\'ll still love it. The connections between the series aren\'t even openly obvious until the third episode, but if you look their there from the start.But there is that one, single, Down point T mentioned. My only regret for Diebuster is, strangely enough, the ending. I can\'t say exactly what because of Spoilers, but to me its almost MORE depressing than the almost-ending of Gunbuster. At least they Do get home, together. But Lark and Nono...Gah, Spoilers. Watch it and form your own opinions. more importantly, it isn\'t really a Sequel.

At least that's what Diebuster taught me. With TTGL every background and every space is finely tuned to emphasize the actions of the characters, kind of a variation of the Shaft (at least the non stop-mo stuff) style except that its louder and more wild than stylized. The backgrounds in TTGL are always abstract, action lines, explosions and a focus on movement than space. Kill La Kill takes this to an even greater extreme by layering even more Western animation style comic transformations with all the huge letters filling the screen, emphasizing the presence of the characters and...their attacks over delineating a space. The current equivalent would be like comparing Fury Road to an old John Ford or a Western by one of the masters, where in one the desert is subservient to the spectacle (except in some parts of course) where in the other its all about the Desert in all its splendor swallowing the tiny riders while they exchange shootouts with wayward Indians and Bandits. Diebuster is the old Western.The main character of Diebuster, contrary to what people believe, is neither Lal'C nor Nono, but Space itself. The multiplicity of worlds that the character's inhabit, and the otherworldly denizens within that overwhelms the concept of human and what it means to create a civilization in an excess of empty matter.It also happens to be a story about a friendship between two girls, but that's another thing. It's kind of the Gainax ability (at least with Tsurumaki and Anno) to make the small struggles of everyday humans reflect the state of the whole cosmos. But that's one of the secret great things about animation, that the worlds crafted are wholly subjective, and thus they HAVE to reflect psychology because its our definition of what makes a world rather than an actual world. Old cinema theorists used to talk about how the objective eye of the camera was aimed at capturing the beauty and naturalism of the world, and maybe a film like Boyhood is our greatest testament to that in current times, but Animation is wholly opposed to that sensibility, and with CGI being so prevalent, movies are turning away from that as well to an idea of pure image (whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is the subject of tons of conversations between various philosophers of media and postmodernity. Can we still live while we continuously reject the Real at every instance? Or maybe its an inherent human thing to warp, restructure and be contrary to Nature).The bad thing is that no one has ever really conceived of what it means to step outside the cinematic notions of time and space and to have a work of art that lies wholly beyond the space in front of the camera. The greatest animators are harvesters of this sensibility, from Miyazaki to Satoshi Kon to the Gainaxers and the Shaft personnel. Makoto Shinkai even, who, despite being called a realistic artist, edges what is Real to an extreme that somehow pushes past it. Madoka Movie 3 is the farthest I have seen someone go in this attempt at pure Animation, at least outside of strange non-mainstream experimental film stuff. Sakuga, the art of creating motion through Key Animation, is a skill practiced solely at harnessing this sensibility. TTGL will add fury to the lines and thickness to the brush so as to create faces that burn out of the screen and actions that explode into the frame, while keeping all other aspects pretty streamlined.But while all that is theory, we're here to talk about Tsurumaki and his craft. Sarah Horrocks, a comic book reviewer, talked about how Tsutomu Nihei's greatest strength in Knights of Sidonia was his ability to capture the pure silence of Space, changing his sensibility wholly from his previous cyber-bio-punk actiony works. Tsurumaki knows all of that, the gracefulness of it that has been reflected in great films like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Interstellar. But he also has a plethora of tricks up his sleeve to vary the tempo with high octane space battles, using all of the old missile circus style explosions and tricks. He uses CGI when necessary, and not it an alienating way, but to depict mass and weight. He can draw close quartered distilled emotional spaces like those out of Evangelion no problem as well. From small inhabited spaces to large encroaching Space itself. And he also has a kind of Pinky-Film exploitative sexual sensibility that pushes normal fanservice into a kind of high level pop-camp-aesthetic. This is not the degraded erotic fanservice that punctuates so many shoddily made harem shows, but the type of thing that emphasizes curvature and body-motion and sometimes straight out bare-faced Faster Pussycat Kill Kill Kill clothes-tearing brazen stuff that reflects an underground sensibility that so characterizes Gainax's subversive values in every way (then again Anno came up with all that in the original Gunbuster, so this is just an evolution of that).The thing is that the original Gunbuster was beautiful at moments, with its noir-space-opera purple shadows and it’s cynical war plot that sort of resembled Joe Halderman’s The Forever War except while trying to stick in all the anime stuff about Truth and Heart and all that. All of it though was really jarring with the melodrama and characterization that Anno hadn’t fine-tuned yet, until it would explode into the oppressive atmosphere of Evangelion. Diebuster really shoves it right out the window by being willing to take the blazing Shounen values all the way while also respecting character and atmosphere. It even pushes the science from the pop-science of time-dilation and all that new quantum physics that was becoming in-vogue at the era, to science that probably completely doesn’t make sense in any way but sounds completely out there. Episode 3 is more or less perfect. And Tsurumaki being a guy that doesn’t care too much about exposition, as compared to Gunbuster at least, at least makes it so that exposition is being carried out with visual stimulation, and uses visual storytelling for the most part.But really Diebuster is about imbibing the world. It’s a vision the same way Blade Runner was a vision, or that Madoka was a vision, or that Akira was a vision. A large large larger than life vision that seems to want to destroy Reality in every way and shows us that if escapism was this all-encompassing, then it’s completely okay to stake your entire life in a small cramped up apartment making stuff like this one particle at a time over copious copious drawing boards. A work to show that really who the hell needs anything that Life has to offer when our Dreams are so gallant? And you’d pay your whole soul fending off cockroaches and dirty walls and meagre salaries and horrible real life shit just to capture that sort of thing for ephemeral seconds on screen. their attacks over delineating a space.

From spiders, darkness and the unknown to more everyday occurrences like violence, death, and the constant threat of insectoid invaders from outer space.  But there’s one fear that people often overlook, and it’s one that can completely consume your life...  The fear of absolute solitude.  Not having a past, not having a future, just being alone, with nobody to look out for you but yourself.  For some people, this wouldn’t be so bad...  After all, as it’s been said, there’s...no feeling freer than having nothing left to lose.  But to Nono, a spunky girl surviving by the skin of her teeth on the planet Mars, there’s nothing cool or ideal about it.  Having spent an unknown and potentially unfathomable amount of years living on her own, travelling the expansive red desert without a home to go back to, without any memories to tell her who she is, or any future to look forward to, the only comfort she has in the middle of the night is her head full of dreams, and her ambition to one day become a famous pilot and save humanity from the insidious alien threat!However, like most people in modern day times, she’s only able to live out her dreams through fantasy while working a dead-end job for wages that she can just barely survive off of.  Working in a diner that’s populated mainly by truckers and washed-up space pilots, her dreams of outer space adventures are the only thing saving her from the looming threat of assault from her patrons.  Thankfully, when that threat becomes fully realized, so does her dream!  An ace mecha pilot from the elite interstellar military known as Fraternity, who is ironically female, crash lands right in the middle of the diner, saving her(whether intentionally or not) and unknowingly offering her the once-in-a-lifetime chance to hitch a ride into space and live out her dreams!  Well, that’s what she wants to do, but there’s a catch;  The pilots of Fraternity are called Topless, not because they’re shameless exhibitionists, but because they have some sort of ESP power, so it’s like there’s no lid on their minds to hold in their powers.  Yeah, that’s stretching it, but hey YOU try to explain why they’re called that.  Nono, who is revealed to be a robot, doesn’t have this ability, but as it turns out, she might just have potential far exceeding those who can.In 2004, Studio Gainax released two anime to commemorate their 20 year anniversary;  One of them was This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, a full-length TV series that massively disappointed, and Aim for the Top Diebuster, the sequel to their debut OVA Aim for the Top Gunbuster, and it only takes a cursory glance at both shows to figure out which one got the most attention from the production team.  This Ugly was going to be an easy, dumb title full of nudity, so they didn’t need to waste too much money to make it successful...  Diebuster, however, was going to be a sequel to a 20 year old anime that had a massive army of loyal and highly protective fans behind it, was much more of a risk, and in light of this, the amount of money they poured into this title is immediately apparent upon the first few minutes of the first episode.  I haven’t seen every single Studio Gainax anime...  Give it a few more years, I definitely will be able to brag about this at some point...  but from what I’ve seen, Diebuster is by far the best looking anime I’ve ever seen from them.  Yes, that includes Evangelion, at least by a little.To be fair, at least in terms of it’s characters, Diebuster is on the more cartoony side of the scale.  Honestly, they look more like Fooly Cooly characters than Gunbuster characters, which I guess is just the look the company was pushing back then.  It’s a huge step away from Gunbuster, but I think there are a few reasons it’s worth forgiving.  First of all, the most colorful and cartoony character IS the sunny, happy-go-lucky robot girl, which allows the distinction to make a small bit of sense.  Everyone else, even those with alternate skin and hair color options, look far more down to earth, and the few who don’t are given so little screen time it doesn’t really matter.  Second, the outdated character designs of 1984 wouldn’t mesh at all with the beautifully drawn and exquisitely detailed backgrounds they’d be placed in.  Before the first appearance of the show’s title in the first episode, I was already on Facebook gushing about how gorgeous it looked.  I don’t think there’s a single shot in Diebuster that I wouldn’t want to watch on loop so I could fantasize about living in it, save for maybe the scarier war scenes.There are so many layers on screen at any given time that you almost don’t know where to look...  The characters aren’t always in the foreground, because sometimes that space will be reserved for lens flares, or a small cross section of whatever they happen  standing in front of.  After that, depending on the environment, the remaining layers can be used to show an entire world of activity in the background of outer space, or the crushing loneliness of an open plain.  It’s not impossible for an anime to look as alive and immersive as Diebuster does, but it is rare, and I want to think this is the only time Gainax has ever pulled it off.  The use of lighting also helps, seeing how once we leave Mars in episode 1, the bulk of what we see from there on is shrouded in shadow, which perfectly complements the bright and bouncy Nono, who’s childish antics and outgoing personality are quite literally designed to shine in the darkness, both in terms of the artwork and in terms of the bleak tone of the story.  The immersive background also helps distract you during those rare moments when the animation maybe isn’t as fluid as it  is elsewhere, which is already a sparse problem.The CG is also used to perfection here, and it pops up frequently, in all sorts of background and foreground layers.  You’re not just going to be impressed by the fleets of ships that the Fraternity owns, you’re going to be impressed by vast expanses of space they’re existing in.  I’ve praised several anime in the past for having beautiful looking paintings represent space, but in diebuster, space is ever moving and ever evolving like an organism all it’s own.  In shots that combine layers of CG with layers of traditional animation, it looks freaking unbelievable.  The same can be said for weather effects and the way they visually affect the characters on-screen, as well as lazers, light beams and any other special effects the script may call for.  You could almost call this a spiritual predecessor to Gurren Lagann, if it didn’t also surpass that series.  Characters, whether in action or idling between missions, are animated perfectly, with a wide and very graceful range of motion, capped off by fully expressive and photogenic faces.  Gainax has never been the best company when it came to managing budget issues, so for Diebuster, I’m going to assume they didn’t HAVE any budget issues, and whether or not that’s the case, it worked out amazingly for them.While Kohei Tanaka is not a name you’d generally hear associated with Gainax...  Honestly, he’s much more well known to the One Piece crowd, although I’m a much bigger fan of his work on Bastard...  He did compose the score for two of Gainax’s projects, those being both Gunbuster and it’s sequel, Diebuster.  This is probably why there are so many Gunbuster songs that wound up being reused in Diebuster, and in some surprizingly smart and subtle ways.  I wasn’t a huge fan of the first season’s OST, but the tunes that are shared by both shows are used much better this time around.  Tanaka is generally known for his grand, sweeping ballads, but he’s also known for using rock and roll and electric tracks in order to rack up the intensity of a fight scene.  Honestly, though, the music in this show isn’t exactly memorable...  You won’t be humming along to any of it’s tracks on the way to work...  But they work splendidly in the moment, and you will enjoy them when you’re watching the show.The opening, Groovin'’ Magic, is far more memorable, and I challenge you not to get it stuck in your head.  It’s received some criticism on two different fronts, with one saying that it’s just a piece of Jpop fluff, and the other saying it’s just a mish-mash of clips from the show.  To the second I say, have you never watched a Gainax show before?  They do that all the time.  Most of Gainax’s anime properties have openings that use original animation to bookend long slots of random out-of-context clips.  Diebuster does this too, and while the original animation basically consists of silhouetted characters walking, it’s still a lot of fun to watch.  The song has a sort of light, funky sixties pop feel to it, which was a great choice considering what kind of person the main character is...  Nono is an idealistic dreamer, a sunny flower child who brings ideals of pacifism and humane priorities to a war zone full of cynics and jaded veterans, challenging the way they think.  this is very much her theme song, but that’s not to say the ending theme doesn’t also resonate with her.  It does, but it runs a little deeper, to the darker feelings she keeps hidden from everyone, as well as her firm resolve to put on a smile for their sake.  It’s a great soundtrack overall, and a huge improvement over that of the first season.Actually, as it turns out, improvements upon the first show can be found all over the place in this one.  Now, I originally thought Gunbuster was okay, a good show overall, if not problematic in a lot of areas.  It’s characters were weakened by it’s insistence on setting aside time it didn’t have to spare for the sake of explaining things we didn't need to know, showing us things we didn’t need to see, and exploring several dead end plot points that wound up adding nothing to the important areas of the story.  As a result, thing got overcomplicated, and we sacrificed any depth the main characters or the badly explained one-note villains could have had in exchange for footnotes like dolphins with helmets were connected to the development of extrasensory perception.  It probably wasn’t fair of me to blast it for being outdone by a later series, particularly in the area of developing it’s main character, but I stand by my belief that newer anime can be both superior products and useful comparative tools to older anime, and since Gainax already improved upon several elements of their inaugural series through Evangelion, they had a golden opportunity to seal the deal with their 20th anniversary piece.There really aren’t very many ways to connect Diebuster to Gunbuster as a canon sequel, although they apparently exist in the same universe with a massive time gap in-between, so it works a lot better to consider this series as a reimagining of an older concept.  And yes, Diebuster features a vast improvement in terms of narrative and execution.  On the surface, it’s story is very simple.  It follows an innocent and untainted main character getting the opportunity to live out her dreams, struggling, and ultimately becoming more than the sum of her parts through unexpected and unorthodox means, while changing the people around her in the process.  There are little to no deviations from her journey, and the fact that it’s her journey above all else is never in question.  Everything that happens in the series is either related directly to her, or directly related to the Fraternity group and surrounding characters in ways that will affect her down the line  By using this much tighter sense of focus, Gainax is able to explain the plot and setting to us through her, as we learn what she learned, while at the same time getting us invested in her story.  With Nono performing this role, there’s little to no need for exposition, although Gainax still crowbars it in with their subtitles.Unfortunately, Diebuster isn’t so much an improvement as it is the exact opposite of Gunbuster in terms of strengths and weaknesses.  Whereas Gunbuster spent a lot of time telling you very little, Diebuster sounds way too little time telling us way too much.  There wasn’t very much happening in Gunbuster that was very important, which made it feel a little boring, but there’s way too much important shit going on in Diebuster, making it feel way too overwhelming and confusing at times.  To be fair, this doesn’t actually start happening until episode 4, as I think everything was paced really nicely up until that point.  Past episode 4, however, the story and plot become extremely difficult to follow, with important revelations being dropped like hot potatoes, new characters being introduced just to be killed off after mere seconds worth of collective screentime, which is apparently supposed to feel tragic, but I had to watch episode 4 three times just to catch what that tragedy even was, let alone why all the remaining Topless were lying in hospital beds with protective headgear on.  It made sense when I was finally able to wrap my head around it, and the scenario I’d been missing was even written better than I thought, but that still doesn’t excuse such shoddy pacing.But that’s all fine, because the characters get appropriate time devoted to their arcs and individual developmental journeys.  Well, I say that, but just because time’s being devoted to them doesn’t mean what we’re being shown is going to hold up.  As much as I loved her, and she is an incredibly fun and likeable character, Nono is kind of a Mary-Sue.  There’s some subtle depth to her, when you compare her lonely past on Mars to her refusal to compromise her principals in Fraternity, but most of the time it barely resonates with her character in any meaningful way, and after spending half the series as an upbeat Lego brick, her transformation into Jesus happens on a dime.  She’s too perfect, she’s always right, and when you get right down to it, she’s...  well, she’s Robin Williams.  I shouldn’t be too upset about that, as her perfect nature was an integral part of episode 3, which was so perfect it made me cry, but that wasn’t her episode...  It was the episode of another pilot named Tycho Science(real name, not joking), who’s backstory and resolution are without question the most memorable thing about this story.  And she doesn’t even manage to make an impact beyond that episode.Which leaves the final main character, L’Arc Mellik Mai, who is probably the best one in terms of development.  She starts out the series as a battle-hardened, no-nonsense warrior, the top of her class and the undisputed lord of the kill count.  Meeting Nono gradually warms her heart and forces her to open up over time, resulting in her becoming more expressive as well as a few other spoilers.  But I honestly can’t help but feel that she got a bit too much screen time.  for a relationship between two characters to feel strong, it has to become strained at some point so it can mend and become stronger than before, which does happen in Diebuster between her and Nono...  In what has to be the worst way possible.  I’m going to spoil this, so skip to the next paragraph if you really don’t want to know how this all falls apart.  Basically, she catches a pilot she has a thing for attempting to rape Nono, and her first words are “Why not me?”  Which...  I just...  no.  She turns her back on both of them, because how DARE he try to rape another, and how dare she BE that other, and oh dear God I’m going to vomit.I know I spent a lot of space talking about Diebuster’s flaws, but it really is a fun show.  Much like the first season, a lot of it’s best qualities can be found in it’s space battles, and in this season, none of them ever feel wasted or pointless.  We know what the goal of every fight is, we know what’s at stake, and when the enemy suddenly becomes unimaginably strong, we know how and why it happened.  There’s a sense of progression on both sides, with the humans discovering new technology, and the bugs becoming immeasurably powerful just when we think we’re about to overcome them, even though what they are and why they want to kill us still hasn’t been established.  There’s a lot less fanservice than in the first season, as instead of bathing scenes forced in for no reason, everything that happens in this series...  nudity included...  Serves a strict narrative purpose, whether it’s Nono being cleaned after being rescued from Mars or characters contemplating their issues while alone in the bath, and even then, everything’s shot tastefully...  Not to censor, but at the same time, not to exploit.  Even the early shot of Nono ripping off the chest of her shirt was meant to be an homage to the first season, which Diebuster does clearly have a lot of respect for, even if it doesn’t look like it at times.Aim for the Top: Diebuster! is available from Eastern Star Studios, which...  Like a star...  Is a bright spot in an expansive empty space of no fucking releases.  This DVD set came out stateside nine years after the series came out proper, and after only three years since, it’s so far out of print that you can’t actually get it on Amazon.  It’s cheap enough on Ebay, as I got my copy for about twenty-five dollars, but yeah, I have no idea why it’s been so sparsely released.  An anime film, Gunbuster vs. Diebuster, is much easier to find, as it was released more recently.  A single volume manga that ran in the magazine Dragon Age Pure is not available stateside.So, how does Studio Gainax’s 20th anniversary OVA series hold up?  Well, considering their other offering was a collaboration with Madhouse that brought little other than pretentious ramblings and barrels of bare boobies to the table, I’d say this one turned out rather nicely.  It has surprisingly little to do with the original Gunbuster aside from some terminology and the visual of a robot running on a treadmill...  I’d nitpick, but considering that she also eats, sleeps and has a heart, sure, why not...  It actually feels a lot more like a few other Gainax properties.  I already made the comparison to FLCL, in regard to it’s colorful and cartoony character designs and over-all artistic aesthetic, but it also incorporates a lot of Evangeleon, especially in the way that the pilots interact with each other.  Oddly enough, though, it kind of also feels a lot like Gurren Lagann, which wouldn’t come out until three years later.  I won’t go too specific, but it even ends with the imagery of a drill!  So yeah, it works way better as a representation of what Gainax was between the late nineties and the mid-oughts than it does as a direct sequel.  Much like Gunbuster, it has a lot of problems, but over-all, it’s a pretty fun experience.  I give Diebuster a 6/10. no feeling freer than having nothing left to lose.  But to Nono, a spunky girl surviving by the skin of her teeth on the planet Mars, there’s nothing cool or ideal about it.  Having spent an unknown and potentially unfathomable amount of years living on her own, travelling the expansive red desert without a home to go back to, without any memories to tell her who she is, or any future to look forward to, the only comfort she has in the middle of the night is her head full of dreams, and her ambition to one day become a famous pilot and save humanity from the insidious alien threat!However, like most people in modern day times, she’s only able to live out her dreams through fantasy while working a dead-end job for wages that she can just barely survive off of.  Working in a diner that’s populated mainly by truckers and washed-up space pilots, her dreams of outer space adventures are the only thing saving her from the looming threat of assault from her patrons.  Thankfully, when that threat becomes fully realized, so does her dream!  An ace mecha pilot from the elite interstellar military known as Fraternity, who is ironically female, crash lands right in the middle of the diner, saving her(whether intentionally or not) and unknowingly offering her the once-in-a-lifetime chance to hitch a ride into space and live out her dreams!  Well, that’s what she wants to do, but there’s a catch;  The pilots of Fraternity are called Topless, not because they’re shameless exhibitionists, but because they have some sort of ESP power, so it’s like there’s no lid on their minds to hold in their powers.  Yeah, that’s stretching it, but hey YOU try to explain why they’re called that.  Nono, who is revealed to be a robot, doesn’t have this ability, but as it turns out, she might just have potential far exceeding those who can.In 2004, Studio Gainax released two anime to commemorate their 20 year anniversary;  One of them was This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, a full-length TV series that massively disappointed, and Aim for the Top Diebuster, the sequel to their debut OVA Aim for the Top Gunbuster, and it only takes a cursory glance at both shows to figure out which one got the most attention from the production team.  This Ugly was going to be an easy, dumb title full of nudity, so they didn’t need to waste too much money to make it successful...  Diebuster, however, was going to be a sequel to a 20 year old anime that had a massive army of loyal and highly protective fans behind it, was much more of a risk, and in light of this, the amount of money they poured into this title is immediately apparent upon the first few minutes of the first episode.  I haven’t seen every single Studio Gainax anime...  Give it a few more years, I definitely will be able to brag about this at some point...  but from what I’ve seen, Diebuster is by far the best looking anime I’ve ever seen from them.  Yes, that includes Evangelion, at least by a little.To be fair, at least in terms of it’s characters, Diebuster is on the more cartoony side of the scale.  Honestly, they look more like Fooly Cooly characters than Gunbuster characters, which I guess is just the look the company was pushing back then.  It’s a huge step away from Gunbuster, but I think there are a few reasons it’s worth forgiving.  First of all, the most colorful and cartoony character IS the sunny, happy-go-lucky robot girl, which allows the distinction to make a small bit of sense.  Everyone else, even those with alternate skin and hair color options, look far more down to earth, and the few who don’t are given so little screen time it doesn’t really matter.  Second, the outdated character designs of 1984 wouldn’t mesh at all with the beautifully drawn and exquisitely detailed backgrounds they’d be placed in.  Before the first appearance of the show’s title in the first episode, I was already on Facebook gushing about how gorgeous it looked.  I don’t think there’s a single shot in Diebuster that I wouldn’t want to watch on loop so I could fantasize about living in it, save for maybe the scarier war scenes.There are so many layers on screen at any given time that you almost don’t know where to look...  The characters aren’t always in the foreground, because sometimes that space will be reserved for lens flares, or a small cross section of whatever they happen  standing in front of.  After that, depending on the environment, the remaining layers can be used to show an entire world of activity in the background of outer space, or the crushing loneliness of an open plain.  It’s not impossible for an anime to look as alive and immersive as Diebuster does, but it is rare, and I want to think this is the only time Gainax has ever pulled it off.  The use of lighting also helps, seeing how once we leave Mars in episode 1, the bulk of what we see from there on is shrouded in shadow, which perfectly complements the bright and bouncy Nono, who’s childish antics and outgoing personality are quite literally designed to shine in the darkness, both in terms of the artwork and in terms of the bleak tone of the story.  The immersive background also helps distract you during those rare moments when the animation maybe isn’t as fluid as it  is elsewhere, which is already a sparse problem.The CG is also used to perfection here, and it pops up frequently, in all sorts of background and foreground layers.  You’re not just going to be impressed by the fleets of ships that the Fraternity owns, you’re going to be impressed by vast expanses of space they’re existing in.  I’ve praised several anime in the past for having beautiful looking paintings represent space, but in diebuster, space is ever moving and ever evolving like an organism all it’s own.  In shots that combine layers of CG with layers of traditional animation, it looks freaking unbelievable.  The same can be said for weather effects and the way they visually affect the characters on-screen, as well as lazers, light beams and any other special effects the script may call for.  You could almost call this a spiritual predecessor to Gurren Lagann, if it didn’t also surpass that series.  Characters, whether in action or idling between missions, are animated perfectly, with a wide and very graceful range of motion, capped off by fully expressive and photogenic faces.  Gainax has never been the best company when it came to managing budget issues, so for Diebuster, I’m going to assume they didn’t HAVE any budget issues, and whether or not that’s the case, it worked out amazingly for them.While Kohei Tanaka is not a name you’d generally hear associated with Gainax...  Honestly, he’s much more well known to the One Piece crowd, although I’m a much bigger fan of his work on Bastard...  He did compose the score for two of Gainax’s projects, those being both Gunbuster and it’s sequel, Diebuster.  This is probably why there are so many Gunbuster songs that wound up being reused in Diebuster, and in some surprizingly smart and subtle ways.  I wasn’t a huge fan of the first season’s OST, but the tunes that are shared by both shows are used much better this time around.  Tanaka is generally known for his grand, sweeping ballads, but he’s also known for using rock and roll and electric tracks in order to rack up the intensity of a fight scene.  Honestly, though, the music in this show isn’t exactly memorable...  You won’t be humming along to any of it’s tracks on the way to work...  But they work splendidly in the moment, and you will enjoy them when you’re watching the show.The opening, Groovin'’ Magic, is far more memorable, and I challenge you not to get it stuck in your head.  It’s received some criticism on two different fronts, with one saying that it’s just a piece of Jpop fluff, and the other saying it’s just a mish-mash of clips from the show.  To the second I say, have you never watched a Gainax show before?  They do that all the time.  Most of Gainax’s anime properties have openings that use original animation to bookend long slots of random out-of-context clips.  Diebuster does this too, and while the original animation basically consists of silhouetted characters walking, it’s still a lot of fun to watch.  The song has a sort of light, funky sixties pop feel to it, which was a great choice considering what kind of person the main character is...  Nono is an idealistic dreamer, a sunny flower child who brings ideals of pacifism and humane priorities to a war zone full of cynics and jaded veterans, challenging the way they think.  this is very much her theme song, but that’s not to say the ending theme doesn’t also resonate with her.  It does, but it runs a little deeper, to the darker feelings she keeps hidden from everyone, as well as her firm resolve to put on a smile for their sake.  It’s a great soundtrack overall, and a huge improvement over that of the first season.Actually, as it turns out, improvements upon the first show can be found all over the place in this one.  Now, I originally thought Gunbuster was okay, a good show overall, if not problematic in a lot of areas.  It’s characters were weakened by it’s insistence on setting aside time it didn’t have to spare for the sake of explaining things we didn't need to know, showing us things we didn’t need to see, and exploring several dead end plot points that wound up adding nothing to the important areas of the story.  As a result, thing got overcomplicated, and we sacrificed any depth the main characters or the badly explained one-note villains could have had in exchange for footnotes like dolphins with helmets were connected to the development of extrasensory perception.  It probably wasn’t fair of me to blast it for being outdone by a later series, particularly in the area of developing it’s main character, but I stand by my belief that newer anime can be both superior products and useful comparative tools to older anime, and since Gainax already improved upon several elements of their inaugural series through Evangelion, they had a golden opportunity to seal the deal with their 20th anniversary piece.There really aren’t very many ways to connect Diebuster to Gunbuster as a canon sequel, although they apparently exist in the same universe with a massive time gap in-between, so it works a lot better to consider this series as a reimagining of an older concept.  And yes, Diebuster features a vast improvement in terms of narrative and execution.  On the surface, it’s story is very simple.  It follows an innocent and untainted main character getting the opportunity to live out her dreams, struggling, and ultimately becoming more than the sum of her parts through unexpected and unorthodox means, while changing the people around her in the process.  There are little to no deviations from her journey, and the fact that it’s her journey above all else is never in question.  Everything that happens in the series is either related directly to her, or directly related to the Fraternity group and surrounding characters in ways that will affect her down the line  By using this much tighter sense of focus, Gainax is able to explain the plot and setting to us through her, as we learn what she learned, while at the same time getting us invested in her story.  With Nono performing this role, there’s little to no need for exposition, although Gainax still crowbars it in with their subtitles.Unfortunately, Diebuster isn’t so much an improvement as it is the exact opposite of Gunbuster in terms of strengths and weaknesses.  Whereas Gunbuster spent a lot of time telling you very little, Diebuster sounds way too little time telling us way too much.  There wasn’t very much happening in Gunbuster that was very important, which made it feel a little boring, but there’s way too much important shit going on in Diebuster, making it feel way too overwhelming and confusing at times.  To be fair, this doesn’t actually start happening until episode 4, as I think everything was paced really nicely up until that point.  Past episode 4, however, the story and plot become extremely difficult to follow, with important revelations being dropped like hot potatoes, new characters being introduced just to be killed off after mere seconds worth of collective screentime, which is apparently supposed to feel tragic, but I had to watch episode 4 three times just to catch what that tragedy even was, let alone why all the remaining Topless were lying in hospital beds with protective headgear on.  It made sense when I was finally able to wrap my head around it, and the scenario I’d been missing was even written better than I thought, but that still doesn’t excuse such shoddy pacing.But that’s all fine, because the characters get appropriate time devoted to their arcs and individual developmental journeys.  Well, I say that, but just because time’s being devoted to them doesn’t mean what we’re being shown is going to hold up.  As much as I loved her, and she is an incredibly fun and likeable character, Nono is kind of a Mary-Sue.  There’s some subtle depth to her, when you compare her lonely past on Mars to her refusal to compromise her principals in Fraternity, but most of the time it barely resonates with her character in any meaningful way, and after spending half the series as an upbeat Lego brick, her transformation into Jesus happens on a dime.  She’s too perfect, she’s always right, and when you get right down to it, she’s...  well, she’s Robin Williams.  I shouldn’t be too upset about that, as her perfect nature was an integral part of episode 3, which was so perfect it made me cry, but that wasn’t her episode...  It was the episode of another pilot named Tycho Science(real name, not joking), who’s backstory and resolution are without question the most memorable thing about this story.  And she doesn’t even manage to make an impact beyond that episode.Which leaves the final main character, L’Arc Mellik Mai, who is probably the best one in terms of development.  She starts out the series as a battle-hardened, no-nonsense warrior, the top of her class and the undisputed lord of the kill count.  Meeting Nono gradually warms her heart and forces her to open up over time, resulting in her becoming more expressive as well as a few other spoilers.

I’d nitpick, but considering that she also eats, sleeps and has a heart, sure, why not...  It actually feels a lot more like a few other Gainax properties.

Much like Gunbuster, it has a lot of problems, but over-all, it’s a pretty fun experience.  I give Diebuster a 6/10."", 'Long story short: Another series with amazing animation, action, and visual design tainted by Gainax being Gainax. This series would be a solid 8 or even a 9, but the bare-bones plot, mostly forgettable characters, absurd plethora of fanservice and uncomfortable exploitation of the female lead leave a sour taste in your mouth. Otherwise this could have been the best thing Gainax ever did. In some ways it\'s much better than Gunbuster but in others even more frustrating.--------------Story: As I said, it\'s pretty bare plot. Nono wants to become a space pilot because her hero was one. She meets Lal\'C, a ""Topless"" who has a...psychic connection to a Buster Machine, and immediately forms a bond with her for reasons that are somewhat lost on me. The rest of the series is mainly a bunch of teenagers who are mankind\'s only hope fighting Space Monsters in giant robots, combined with a lot of subplots and scenes that feel like nonsequiturs because they go nowhere. There\'s a pretty interesting plot twist in Episode 4 that they could have based the entire story around, but they don\'t really do anything with it, and the resolution of Nono\'s character arc is both a huge Deus Ex Machina and a pretty forced reference to the original series.However, there is one intensely uncomfortable scene in Episode 5 which, after all of the shenanigans that came before, nearly breaks the camel\'s back in regards to the plot, and yet it\'s completely dropped after a few minutes. It bears mentioning because it\'s completely unnecessary, much like Coach\'s treatment of Onee-sama in Gunbuster Episode 5, but somehow even worse in terms of how it\'s handled. 6/10Art: My god, my god, this is peak Gainax animation. Gunbuster was a great looking series for its time that also had major budget issues near the end - not to mention that the last two episodes of that series were completely unplanned at the beginning. By contrast Gainax pulled out all the stops for Diebuster. I\'ve seen some people complain about the piloting outfits and how the FLCL-esque art design is less appealing to them than Gainax\'s other series, but I really like it because despite how goofy it looks it adds some visual character that Gunbuster lacked. And even compared to End of Evangelion the animation is unparalleled to the rest of Gainax\'s work. If there is a single saving grace to this series, it is the animation quality and the action sequences. 9/10Sound: The best part of the sound design in Diebuster is definitely the soundtrack, as well as the OP and ED. Both the OP and ED are really enjoyable and add an upbeat tone to the series that it really needs to keep from being bogged down in melodrama. I\'ve seen some critique of those compared to Gunbuster but I enjoy the funky 2000s J-Pop tone more than the 80s cheese of Gunbuster, as fun as it is. The orchestral score is also very good, if somewhat unmemorable compared to other Gainax scores. The references they make in the score to that of Gunbuster are also a lot more subtle and feel a lot less pandering than many of the more direct references they make in other ways. 8/10Character: Everything else aside, this is probably the weakest aspect of the series. Nono is... somehow even more one-dimensional than Noriko. She\'s constantly upbeat and peppy, and so absent-minded and dumb most of the time that you seriously question whether she has the mental capacity of a child, which is entirely possible considering what we find out about her at the end of the first episode. What makes that uncomfortable is how *constantly* sexualized and ogled Nono is because she\'s admittedly really physically attractive, despite her simple-mindedness. Through the first few episodes she\'s treated as both the buttmonkey for slapstick gags and also a walking sex object who is constantly ogled by both the camera and her male teammates. I\'ll come back to this in the ""Enjoyment"" section, but the fanservice and her sexualization in general constantly pull you out from the enjoyment of the series. Not to mention her sudden character development in Episode 4 is jarring and her total change in personality doesn\'t seem to make any logical sense. With Noriko you can follow her character development, and Simon in TTGL is, for all his annoyance as a character early on, developed quite well. Nono by contrast does not have a ""middle"" to her development - only a ""beginning"" and ""end.""Lal\'C is an OK character in the sense that she probably should have had a lot more focus and even been the MC since Nono really turns out to be more of a plot device than anything. We don\'t know too much about her and her development is basically becoming more confident in herself and more independent, and also growing closer to Nono for some reason that\'s not really developed enough. Her relationship with Nicola is also barely touched on and doesn\'t quite fit with the rest of her character development, especially when you consider *that scene* in Episode 5 where she not only reveals how obsessed she apparently has been with Nicola, but also how warped her relationship with Nono is. It doesn\'t fit in at all and it\'s really uncomfortable.The rest of the characters get at most a single episode of development - Tycho gets a very, very NGE-esque Episode 3 to cover her backstory and dislike of Nono, which is resolved at the end. She never gets any significant character moments after that. Nicola doesn\'t even get that - he gets like two scenes early in the series, and then that horrifying scene in Episode 5 which makes him utterly unredeemable and is not earned because we barely know the guy, not that it would fix that part at all. Gunbuster spent even less time on its side characters but that wasn\'t too big of a deal because they essentially did not matter. Here they really want you to care about the whole cast and they don\'t develop the two leads enough to make up for the poor characterization of the side characters. 5/10Enjoyment: Let\'s get this out of the way - once again, the action is incredible and gorgeous. That\'s kind of a given for a Gainax mecha series but imo the action here is even better than the best parts of Gurren Lagann. All of the high ratings on this series are essentially all due to this.However, the fanservice and sexual content in general is handled about as clumsily as any Gainax series, including their ecchi series. I want to briefly discuss this because a lot of people will say ""YOU JUST HATE FANSERVICE"" and that\'s not true in the sense that 9 times out of 10, it does not bother me much. But it\'s worth comparing the way Diebuster handles sexual content compared to three other somewhat related works: Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise; Gunbuster; and Kill la Kill.In Gunbuster, as alluded to before, the fanservice is there, but it\'s almost comedic and relegated to scenes like those in the shared bath, aside from the famous moment at the end which is not really necessary but not really that bad. For the most part, you can laugh at it. Kill la Kill was created by many Gainax veterans who worked on Diebuster too, but the sexual content is directly part of the story and themes, and again, is so ludicrous that it passes beyond fanservice into comedy and almost satire.In Diebuster, the first few episodes are filled with almost *constant* ogling of Nono from both the camera and the male characters. It\'s even more awkward because Nono is so oblivious that again, it almost feels like she has the maturity of a kid. It\'s so ridiculously unnecessary that it feels like they weren\'t confidant that younger otaku who didn\'t grow up with Gunbuster would enjoy this series without copious reminders that tits and asses exist. Even Lal\'C is not exempt because right at the *climax of the series* there is a brief scene which is completely unnecessary yet apparently warrants full nudity.If you want T&A in your mecha show - make it about that! Why does it need to be sprinkled in everywhere, yet they try to ignore that it\'s there? And again, there\'s that scene in Episode 5 which is just the worst example of Gainax inserting intensely uncomfortable scenes which are not necessary at all and are completely glossed over after a few minutes. There\'s a similar scene all the way in their first major work, Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise, which in some ways is worse because you\'re supposed to feel bad FOR THE GUY because ""oh gee wiz I sure feel bad for doing that,"" and yet at least Gainax doesn\'t try to ignore that it happened. In Diebuster it involves a character we barely know and aside from the intensely uncomfortable reaction Lal\'C has, it basically affects nothing else in the story aside creating a rift between Nono and Lal\'C.I spend so much time on this because it\'s so common of a problem in classic Gainax works and yet if it\'s not ignored by their fans, it\'s dismissed as a problem at all. Without those aspects this series would be one long joyride, but with it you are constantly pulled out from fully enjoying what\'s going on. 7/10Overall: I fluctuate between a 6 and a 7 on this one because it\'s got some incredible aspects that are marred by: really sloppy execution of the story and character elements around the action; somewhat forced callbacks to Gunbuster that don\'t really come from anywhere; and the weird, exploitative fanservice treatment of Nono in particular and to a lesser extent Lal\'C. I\'m rather glad that the last few years of the Gainax glory days were led by Imaishi and the team that would create Studio Trigger because it seems they had a much, much better handle on how to manage these aspects than Anno and previous Gainax creative leads had. 7/10 psychic connection to a Buster Machine, and immediately forms a bond with her for reasons that are somewhat lost on me. The rest of the series is mainly a bunch of teenagers who are mankind\'s only hope fighting Space Monsters in giant robots, combined with a lot of subplots and scenes that feel like nonsequiturs because they go nowhere. There\'s a pretty interesting plot twist in Episode 4 that they could have based the entire story around, but they don\'t really do anything with it, and the resolution of Nono\'s character arc is both a huge Deus Ex Machina and a pretty forced reference to the original series.However, there is one intensely uncomfortable scene in Episode 5 which, after all of the shenanigans that came before, nearly breaks the camel\'s back in regards to the plot, and yet it\'s completely dropped after a few minutes. It bears mentioning because it\'s completely unnecessary, much like Coach\'s treatment of Onee-sama in Gunbuster Episode 5, but somehow even worse in terms of how it\'s handled. 6/10Art: My god, my god, this is peak Gainax animation. Gunbuster was a great looking series for its time that also had major budget issues near the end - not to mention that the last two episodes of that series were completely unplanned at the beginning. By contrast Gainax pulled out all the stops for Diebuster. I\'ve seen some people complain about the piloting outfits and how the FLCL-esque art design is less appealing to them than Gainax\'s other series, but I really like it because despite how goofy it looks it adds some visual character that Gunbuster lacked. And even compared to End of Evangelion the animation is unparalleled to the rest of Gainax\'s work. If there is a single saving grace to this series, it is the animation quality and the action sequences. 9/10Sound: The best part of the sound design in Diebuster is definitely the soundtrack, as well as the OP and ED. Both the OP and ED are really enjoyable and add an upbeat tone to the series that it really needs to keep from being bogged down in melodrama. I\'ve seen some critique of those compared to Gunbuster but I enjoy the funky 2000s J-Pop tone more than the 80s cheese of Gunbuster, as fun as it is. The orchestral score is also very good, if somewhat unmemorable compared to other Gainax scores. The references they make in the score to that of Gunbuster are also a lot more subtle and feel a lot less pandering than many of the more direct references they make in other ways. 8/10Character: Everything else aside, this is probably the weakest aspect of the series. Nono is... somehow even more one-dimensional than Noriko. She\'s constantly upbeat and peppy, and so absent-minded and dumb most of the time that you seriously question whether she has the mental capacity of a child, which is entirely possible considering what we find out about her at the end of the first episode. What makes that uncomfortable is how *constantly* sexualized and ogled Nono is because she\'s admittedly really physically attractive, despite her simple-mindedness. Through the first few episodes she\'s treated as both the buttmonkey for slapstick gags and also a walking sex object who is constantly ogled by both the camera and her male teammates. I\'ll come back to this in the ""Enjoyment"" section, but the fanservice and her sexualization in general constantly pull you out from the enjoyment of the series. Not to mention her sudden character development in Episode 4 is jarring and her total change in personality doesn\'t seem to make any logical sense. With Noriko you can follow her character development, and Simon in TTGL is, for all his annoyance as a character early on, developed quite well. Nono by contrast does not have a ""middle"" to her development - only a ""beginning"" and ""end.""Lal\'C is an OK character in the sense that she probably should have had a lot more focus and even been the MC since Nono really turns out to be more of a plot device than anything. We don\'t know too much about her and her development is basically becoming more confident in herself and more independent, and also growing closer to Nono for some reason that\'s not really developed enough. Her relationship with Nicola is also barely touched on and doesn\'t quite fit with the rest of her character development, especially when you consider *that scene* in Episode 5 where she not only reveals how obsessed she apparently has been with Nicola, but also how warped her relationship with Nono is. It doesn\'t fit in at all and it\'s really uncomfortable.The rest of the characters get at most a single episode of development - Tycho gets a very, very NGE-esque Episode 3 to cover her backstory and dislike of Nono, which is resolved at the end. She never gets any significant character moments after that. Nicola doesn\'t even get that - he gets like two scenes early in the series, and then that horrifying scene in Episode 5 which makes him utterly unredeemable and is not earned because we barely know the guy, not that it would fix that part at all. Gunbuster spent even less time on its side characters but that wasn\'t too big of a deal because they essentially did not matter. Here they really want you to care about the whole cast and they don\'t develop the two leads enough to make up for the poor characterization of the side characters. 5/10Enjoyment: Let\'s get this out of the way - once again, the action is incredible and gorgeous. That\'s kind of a given for a Gainax mecha series but imo the action here is even better than the best parts of Gurren Lagann. All of the high ratings on this series are essentially all due to this.However, the fanservice and sexual content in general is handled about as clumsily as any Gainax series, including their ecchi series. I want to briefly discuss this because a lot of people will say ""YOU JUST HATE FANSERVICE"" and that\'s not true in the sense that 9 times out of 10, it does not bother me much. But it\'s worth comparing the way Diebuster handles sexual content compared to three other somewhat related works: Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise; Gunbuster; and Kill la Kill.In Gunbuster, as alluded to before, the fanservice is there, but it\'s almost comedic and relegated to scenes like those in the shared bath, aside from the famous moment at the end which is not really necessary but not really that bad. For the most part, you can laugh at it. Kill la Kill was created by many Gainax veterans who worked on Diebuster too, but the sexual content is directly part of the story and themes, and again, is so ludicrous that it passes beyond fanservice into comedy and almost satire.In Diebuster, the first few episodes are filled with almost *constant* ogling of Nono from both the camera and the male characters. It\'s even more awkward because Nono is so oblivious that again, it almost feels like she has the maturity of a kid. It\'s so ridiculously unnecessary that it feels like they weren\'t confidant that younger otaku who didn\'t grow up with Gunbuster would enjoy this series without copious reminders that tits and asses exist. Even Lal\'C is not exempt because right at the *climax of the series* there is a brief scene which is completely unnecessary yet apparently warrants full nudity.If you want T&A in your mecha show - make it about that! Why does it need to be sprinkled in everywhere, yet they try to ignore that it\'s there? And again, there\'s that scene in Episode 5 which is just the worst example of Gainax inserting intensely uncomfortable scenes which are not necessary at all and are completely glossed over after a few minutes. There\'s a similar scene all the way in their first major work, Royal Space Force: Wings of Honneamise, which in some ways is worse because you\'re supposed to feel bad FOR THE GUY because ""oh gee wiz I sure feel bad for doing that,"" and yet at least Gainax doesn\'t try to ignore that it happened.

GAINAX plots are notorious for being indecipherable, and unsurprisingly, this show's plot is overly elliptical in its pacing, pun intended. It does have a cohesive plot once you do some brainstorming, but like I said, there's hardly time for most viewers to weigh in to connect the dots. I found myself pausing time again to grasp what was happening.I feel like there's always an effort on part of GAINAX loyalists...to read too far into the studio's plots -- like they do so for EVA and FLCL. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love EVA, and I really enjoyed FLCL. However, it was admitted that Evangelion used religious symbolism just to merely look cool, and yet there are a number of folks who insist it has substantial philosophical depth. EVA does have philosophical depth, but its depth belongs in its characters rather than obscure lore.Likewise, The best aspects of Gunbuster 2 are the characters and their internal struggles and ambitions. The animation is also top-tier for its time and has a strong FLCL flare. to read too far into the studio's plots -- like they do so for EVA and FLCL. Don't get me wrong.

It\'s one of my favorite anime ever. Going into Diebuster, I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but right from the beginning, something seemed off. I wanted to enjoy this series, but it just didn\'t appeal to me at all. This series has practically nothing to do with Gunbuster. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this series\' story goes directly against the themes of Gunbuster. The only connections to Gunbuster for a majority of the series are just shallow references to the original.""Hey, remember in episode 2 of Gunbuster when...there was a gratuitous bath scene? Well here\'s a gratuitous bath scene in episode 2!""""Hey, remember when Noriko said \'Onee-sama\' in Gunbuster? Well Nono does that too!""I wouldn\'t even be that bothered by this if not for the fact that this show is so disconnected from the original series that it doesn\'t even feel like it takes place in the same universe. It feels like these gratuitous references were just attempts to remind people that ""yes, this is a sequel"". Diebuster just feels like some random unrelated show that had Gunbuster references plastered onto it.Consider this. Gunbuster is a show about a normal girl who saves the world and everyone she loves through hard work, perseverance, bravery, and sacrifice. Diebuster is a show about a robot who was built to save the world and is able to do so because she was built to do so. Doesn\'t that completely go against what the original series is all about? The reason Nono is able to save the day in the end isn\'t because of hard work and determination, it\'s because she just happens to be a buster machine. But then again, the story is so hard to follow that maybe I\'m just completely misunderstanding everything.The animation and visuals in this show are extremely good, mirroring the original series\' impressive polish and surpassing it, but the story that these visuals are applied to is just not good, and as a sequel, it\'s even worse. Gunbuster was exciting and emotional, but I didn\'t care about any of the characters in Diebuster, except maybe Lal\'c. Nono is annoying and none of the other characters really get enough screen time for me to know or care about them. The only things about this show that I can commend are the animation and visual style, which might even be good enough to justify watching the series just to look at them if you\'re into animation and visual art, but if you\'re looking for a good story or a good sequel to Gunbuster, this isn\'t it. there was a gratuitous bath scene?

In this age of unnecessary sequels that capitalize on the original for the sake of nostalgia-baiting its fanbase, Diebuster 2 is both an oasis in the desert and a masterclass in how to do a sequel right.So many people say that Diebuster can't beat the original and I agree. It doesn't beat it. It embraces it. It elevates it. It champions it. And that's why I personally think Diebuster is one of the best anime sequels out there. It succeeds precisely because the original was already so amazing. To say that one is better...than the other is simply doing both a disservice.To elaborate, Diebuster expertly expands on the mythos of the original series while being 100% respectful to the original material. The older characters don't need any more development because their stories are already finished! So many sequel projects fail to realize this simple fact. No, we don't need Noriko to suddenly become all angsty. Why risk altering fans' perceptions of a character that is already well-loved and well-established? Instead, Diebuster is able to please fans by keeping the same tone and feel while remaining fresh by embracing new characters and ideas.Speaking of ideas, Diebuster does take its time with the reveals. However, once the pieces start falling into place, no Gunbuster fan will be able to resist grinning from ear to ear. Diebuster is not only logically consistent with the original series, everything makes perfect sense once everything is revealed.Now, let's talk about that ending. That ending is one of the most brilliant endings in anime sequel history. Suffice to say that it encapsulates everything good about this series I've mentioned thus far in one simple scene.All in all, Diebuster is a phenomenal sequel anime. While I'd say that your ability to enjoy it fully is predicated on having seen and enjoyed the original series, it doesn't contain blatant yet esoteric fanservice for the express purpose of preying on fans' collective nostalgia.

Indeed, it was produced as a 15th anniversary project for that series. Expect spoilers for Gunbuster - you should watch that first (it\'s better, anyway) - as well as minor spoilers for Diebuster itself.Story (4/10): Set about a decade before the last scene of episode 6 of Gunbuster (and thus some 12,000 years after episode 1), Diebuster follows a robot with a profound connection to a character from Gunbuster (if you\'ve seen that, you will know immediately who this is); more on...this in the Characters section. The long and short of it is that it\'s not great. Diebuster fails at one of the guiding principles of storytelling - show, don\'t tell. I\'d wager a good 30% of screentime is devoted to exposition, and you still can\'t tell what\'s going on. Not an Evangelion-style ""this is too deep for me"" confusion, mind, but a ""no, really, what the hell is happening?"".Many of the story beats are nods to Gunbuster, but rather than provoking a response of ""Oh, I remember that from the original! Cool!"", it only serves to draw attention to the fact that all of those story beats are better-explored in the series\' older sibling. This is perhaps Diebuster\'s greatest flaw: it cannot escape from the shadow of its own ""onee-sama"". Gone is the hard sci-fi; the somber exploration of the effects of temporal relativity and time dilation, the detailed shots of the various engines, lasers, and mechanisms. In their place is a superhero story, stripped of any ingenuity, and playing fast-and-loose with the laws of physics (this isn\'t a bad thing - I love Gurren Lagann for this very reason - but it doesn\'t scream ""Gunbuster""). I feel like it would have been better as a standalone OVA series - I spent much of my time trying and failing to connect the relevancy of events in Diebuster to those in Gunbuster.Art (8/10): It\'s Gainax. Diebuster is a feast for the eyes, especially with regards to its action scenes. Other than the design of the space monsters (the late-80s Giger-esque style works much better than the early 2000s pastel) and the character designs (bland and uninspired), I think it can safely be said that this is the only area of improvement over the 1988 series.Sound (5/10): This movie came out in 2003, sandwiched between FLCL (2000) and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (2007), two series renowned for their memorable, catchy, and enjoyable soundtracks. Diebuster gives you generic ominous drum pieces and heroic orchestral music. In other words, it fails to take any risks with its sound design, and the music fails to meet the hype of the art.Character (3/10): As far as personalities go, none of the characters in Diebuster have a lasting impact, instead reflecting the same archetypes you\'d find in any early 2000s anime. When compared to the likes of Kamina, Haruko, or Shinji, they have all the depth of the paper they were drawn on. Hell, they fail to pass muster even when compared to the tropey, one-note characters in Gunbuster or the *background characters* in Gurren Lagann. There\'s just nothing there. People complain that Gunbuster\'s lead is whiny, or poorly fleshed-out. But I raise you this: I was able to immediately connect with her, follow along with her struggles and triumphs, and remember these things after the show was over. The same cannot be said for Nono or Lal\'c.As mentioned in the Art section, the characters are dressed in uninspired costumes in various shades of pastel. I think this works in FLCL - it gives a sense of stagnancy that is central to the idea of ""nothing interesting ever happening in this town"". It does not work here.Enjoyment (4/10): This is, as of the time of writing, the only Gainax or Studio Trigger production I have seriously considered dropping halfway through. I can say with a good degree of confidence that if you a) enjoy either studio\'s work and b) appreciate mecha anime, you will be better served by watching literally any of their other works in the genre - Gunbuster included.Overall (6/10): Ignore that the above scores average to 5, please and thank you. I can\'t recommend this show. If you\'re itching for more Gunbuster, I recommend Space Battleship Yamato, its spin-off Space Pirate Captain Harlock, or Gundam (any of them, really).

Watch Gunbuster instead.Kidding.Diebuster is a very average mecha anime, at least in my eyes. Let's start with the good....The art has some very good moments, especially in the later episodes, though character designs fall a little flat for me.Sound is fine- nothing is especially memorable, and the OP and ending are... fine?When we get to character and plot, that's where things start to fall apart for me. Plot-wise, this does not feel like a sequel to Gunbuster. So much has changed over the past TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS, yet in fact almost nothing is different. People still speak the same language, eat the same food, pilot very similar robots... for a sequel to a show that spent a large amount of time focused on hard science like time dilation, to see so little change is a little jarring.Diebuster seems a lot more like a proto-Gurren Lagann than a sequel to the hard-sciencey Gunbuster, and, while that's not a bad thing (given how good I consider TTGL), it still strikes me as odd. Me and the friend I watched this with spent a lot of time trying to figure out how Diebuster was connected to Gunbuster (spoilers, it's almost entirely DISconnected), rather than enjoying the plot for its own merits.That said, the plot still made some sense, and led to some epic scenes. The same cannot be said about the characters.Our main—Nono—is a bland, ditzy, dumb, blonde. She has very little development (at least that I saw), until the last two episodes.Our other main—Lal'c—is somehow even less likeable. Stoic, cold, good pilot... that's about all the character traits I can remember.Supporting cast-wise, we have some sparse pickings. None of them are especially memorable, barring Tycho (because of her name), and Nicolas, who only is memorable because he literally is an attempted rapist... and nobody cares, given how he's in military command a few months later.Final thoughts: don't watch Diebuster if you're looking for more Gunbuster, and most everything in Diebuster (Hard Work & Guts!, characters, fights, plot), is done better in TTGL. And if not, than in NGE or Gunbuster.Story: 3Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 4Overall: 6(disregard how that averages to a 5 thanks) The art has some very good moments, especially in the later episodes, though character designs fall a little flat for me.Sound is fine- nothing is especially memorable, and the OP and ending are... fine?When we get to character and plot, that's where things start to fall apart for me.

She has very little development (at least that I saw), until the last two episodes.Our other main—Lal'c—is somehow even less likeable. Stoic, cold, good pilot... that's about all the character traits I can remember.Supporting cast-wise, we have some sparse pickings. None of them are especially memorable, barring Tycho (because of her name), and Nicolas, who only is memorable because he literally is an attempted rapist... and nobody cares, given how he's in military command a few months later.Final thoughts: don't watch Diebuster if you're looking for more Gunbuster, and most everything in Diebuster (Hard Work & Guts!, characters, fights, plot), is done better in TTGL. And if not, than in NGE or Gunbuster.Story: 3Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 4Overall: 6(disregard how that averages to a 5 thanks)"", 'Diebuster serves as a sequel to Gainax’s classic mecha series, Gunbuster, that is set thousands of years following the events of Gunbuster. Focused on a seemingly clutzy teenage girl named Nono, she aspires to become a space pilot and comes to idolize Lal’C Mellk Mal, a girl around Nono’s age who is the pilot of the Buster Machine mecha known as Dix-Neuf. Lal’C is part of the Fraternity, a group of teen mecha pilots called Topless who each have their own Buster Machines used to combat a mysterious space monster threatening humanity’s expansion into space. As Nono interacts with Lal’C and the Fraternity, she comes...to realize some truths about herself that make her realize she isn’t an ordinary girl.Suppose one thing I should get out of the way with covering Diebuster is the many nods it makes to Gunbuster. Without spoiling too much of Diebuster’s developments, Nono and Lal’C’s characters and their relationship parallel those of Noriko and Kazumi from the original series, while also sporting the same type of mecha to combat the alien threats that threaten Earth. Both titles also carry similar themes and storytelling elements involving coming-of-age and sacrifice in regards to the main conflict of their respective titles.The results of these Gunbuster nods do have their pros and cons throughout Diebuster. On the one hand, the character dynamics with Nono and Lal’C play out differently from Noriko and Kazumi’s to give the former’s relationship some more uniqueness and create some differing developments with their characters. Plus, there’s a good deal of spectacle in seeing the mecha action as Buster Machines to combat the alien enemy with the fights being nicely animated and having a good deal of visual detail depicted. Nono’s character serves as a fun homage of sorts to old-school mecha anime in Diebuster’s second half when she takes on a more active role to combat the aliens.Spectacle aside though, Diebuster does have some major issues when it comes to areas of its storytelling. It attempts to have a larger scale to its plot compared to Gunbuster, though this falls flat in a number of areas. The series attempts to dabble into developments befalling a couple of Lal’C’s fellow Topless, but their developments aren’t as engaging to see develop compared to Lal’C and Nono. There are a decent number of plot elements that Diebuster doesn’t dabble too deeply into such as Nono’s origins before being found and why humanity seems prejudiced against the Topless. The second half of the series also becomes a bit hard to follow with the scientific jargon discussed with the alien threat and the rather ambiguous fate of one major character when the conflict is resolved. In short, Diebuster’s storytelling didn’t feel as cohesive compared to Gunbuster as it seemed to be doing a bit too much at a number of points within its 6-episode runtime.If you can look past Diebuster’s storytelling issues, it still retains the over-the-top spectacle of mecha action and charming character chemistry of its two female leads found from Gunbuster. Mecha fans just wanting to see this for the action spectacle and Gainax’s signature fan service should still get a treat out of Diebuster in spite of its faults. to realize some truths about herself that make her realize she isn’t an ordinary girl.Suppose one thing I should get out of the way with covering Diebuster is the many nods it makes to Gunbuster.

I\'ve been meaning to watch Diebuster for awhile but it wasn\'t until this year\'s Anime Watching Challenge on My Anime List in which I gave myself the chance to watch this show, and I\'m really glad that I did.To give out my thoughts semi-orderly I guess I\'ll go by the ratings I gave for it by category, first off the Story. WOW, there was a lot of twists, around episodes 3 and 4 it started to feel a little formulaic but by episode 5 that DEFINITELY was  not...the case. The beginning of Diebuster was pretty interesting too helping create a bit more of a gritty atmosphere with Nono being the outlier in the whole galaxy. Though it\'s really easy to tell just by the synopsis on Diebuster and by my previous sentence this show is very much a science fiction anime. I think this is one of my favorite specifically science fiction anime too. Though that maybe more because of the wonderful ending instead of the first episode. I really do not like the sleazy, perverted, old dude archetype. Just seeing there antics is hard for me as a girl too watch because of weird it is.The Art of the show very much show\'s off the current style of the time this was created that being 2003. Very much more "" moe "" and cute in design for all the characters in the show or at least it shows somewhat through all the designs, a lot more rounded shapes instead of pointed shapes in the character design. That is expect for the Buster Machines and the Antagonists. They show a lot more pointed shapes but there is somewhat of unifying theme due to the environment being so rugged and futuristic.I can\'t really accurately gauge how good the soundtrack of Diebuster is because that\'s not my expertise but I do know that the tracks correctly allowed the viewer to be sucked into the scene plus the opening and ending themes of Diebuster is really good in my opinion my favorite being the opening theme Groovin\' Magic and the main reason to why I wanted to watch Diebuster in the first place.The main characters and supporting cast are incredibly well fleshed out and the only scene that was kind of sexual and showed the development of a character was what Nicola tried to do to Nono, ( which I will not further discuss but I thought it showed his fall from grace beautifully ). Onto Nono she really is the perfect main character for Diebuster, her cheery attitude along with her hardwork and guts help contrast her from her environment while also being a positive influence on characters such as Lal\'c and Tycho. I also loved the role switch between Nono and Lal\'c during episode 5 and 6 while Nono kept that amount of respect for Lal\'c throughout the whole ordeal. Lal\'c character arc has to be one of the best in the anime though, she starts off sort of arrogant being the top of her game but at the end thanks to Nono and her circumstances she becomes a more level-headed person and learns that she is more than her powers.Overall I would recommend this to any anime fan but with warnings about a lot of breasts and some crude humor at the beginning. the case.

There is great care and detail in drawing and giving life to the cities, mechs, and characters in this ova series. From the rural countryside where the story starts and Nono\'s first exposure to the city drawn with such expertise that it is sure to stimulate the imagination.But Diebuster is not just pretty to look at, no, it has an over the top scale of mecha battling that is...rarely seen elsewhere. The animation is A++ From the first fight from Lal\'c to the (literally) planetary scale battles that take place later in the series. The detail and time given to the characters is key to the feeling of depth and massive scale. And this to some degree, could be predicted, as literally the best artists Gainax has to offer were the contributers.The sound and musical score match the feeling of the battles well. The silence inbetween gives a serious vibe that was carried in the original Gunbuster (which Diebuster shares many simalarities with and has limited story connection with). The way the sound and music are handled help to contribute to the dramatic depth that the series was aiming for as a sequel to Gunbuster.The story and character relations are where most are going to have a caveat if they do have one. The story sometimes just seems like it is there to carry the great battles and incredible art and animation. However, I would argue that the main characters Nono and Lal\'c make an emotionally compelling pair. One of my favorite quotes in anime references their relationship and it goes:""I Nono was a true fool, whether you have a buster machine or not is irrelevant,those who think things like ""If I only had a buster machine can never reach the true Top! That\'s because true power resides inside those who believe in themselves until the very end. Surely a true Buster Machine pilot, a real Nono-Riri, has a Buster Machine inside their heart!""This strikes me not just for the conviction to her counterpart, but as a statement that has been made over and over in mecha anime and many other genres of anime, but has never been delivered so powerfully with such force (you have to understand Nono is also beating the crap out of something that not even the top elite can touch at this moment) which is a theme that is built on thoughout the series, if the ordinary Nono can reach the same heights or exceed the elite, which, I may conjecture, gave influence to Gurren Lagaan and Trigger\'s Kill la Kill.There are a few warnings I might give. The pacing is slower then a number of anime and takes a more serious sci-fi tone (much like its predecessor).I am somewhat partial to animation and art when I watch my anime, which this animation excels in, but it does not slack in other categories, it holds those strong enough so you can truly enjoy both as a synergistic product like it was meant to be. I recommend Diebuster to any anime fan new or old, who can handle only a small amount of incongruent fan service (again, more of a nod to what it is based from), and if you haven\'t seen it, I would immediately add it to your list. rarely seen elsewhere.

Yes it\'s still a space/mecha anime like it\'s predecessor but it got an different feel to it. The first half of the show have some goofiness to it and will feel a little more comedic and after a great plot twist the show take a more serious turn leading to a good conclusion.Like it\'s predecessor friendship is a big part of the driving force behind the characters leading them to the actions that move the story up.Characters (9/10):The MC is a...lovable klutz that is easy to like. Her actions despite being goofy on the outside actually Stems from deep emotions she was one of the main reasons i liked the show.Characters in general were really well made. Less simple minded that Gunbuster characters, show alot of emotions and despite being a short show you get a good understanding of what kind of character they are. good growth throughout the show for most charactersArt and Animation (9/10):Lovely simple and colorful art that gives you the corect vibe about the show and helps you get immersed. Character design was also pretty good, you can tell what kind of character you have just by looking at them. Mecha designs were amazing and unique and are one of the main good points about the show imoThe show had amazing animations as well. Movement looked fluid and there were no weird animation. Fights looked intense and lively.Music & VA (8/10):A really good OST. Each moment had a good sound track to go with it and help set the moodOP and ED both had that ""uplifting beat"" feel to them, not the most amazing but still some good tunesThe Voice Acting was pretty good, suited the characters and carried out the emotions wellNo annoying sounding characters as well.Effectiveness (8/10):Liking the character was a main factor in liking the show and having a not so serious feel at the beginning also helps in drawing you in. Combine that with some good animation solid action and you get a good package of entertainmentEven if you didn\'t watch Gunbuster you can still watch this on it\'s own and get the full experienceOverall (9/10):Diebuster was a great show with a good set of characters some good actions and quite a good plot twist. It kept me entertained the entire timeIf Gunbuster was the spiritual predecessor to NGE like so many on the Internet claim then Diebuster is certainly the spiritual predecessor to Gurren Lagann lovable klutz that is easy to like.

Well… Yes, but not without it’s drawbacks. I noticed while watching Diebuster, that my enjoyment was a LOT higher than when I watched Gunbuster. I soon realized that this was because the visuals were are a lot better and not as grating to watch. However, if you take away Diebuster’s improved animation, that’s the main thing it has. Even while I was watching Diebuster I still had questions, and found that much of the plot direction was confusing as hell. Only reason I didn’t object much was the fact the animation made...the Mecha battles so much more pleasing to watch. For starters, Gunbuster stressed how in space, time moves differently, but in Diebuster that concept is almost never addressed except for the end but that can wait. As per usual, the fact we need kids to pilot a robot to save the universe is, ONCE AGAIN, never addressed. Honestly, it is no secret I like Diebuster way more than Gunbuster, but I have a good reason. I would describe Gunbuster as the precursor to the trainwreck that became Evangelion. While Diebuster, would be the precursor to the glory that is Gurren Lagann! Diebuster was just better in my opinion, they made their main protagonist into a kamen rider meets Master Asia from the Gundam series(look it up). Yes some points in the story became flat out ridiculous, but they were ridiculous in a good way like Gurren Lagann! Unlike Gunbuster, which was ridiculously similar to Evangelion and don’t get me started on that hot mess. Diebuster’s characters were more engaging, but I still feel like on Nono and Lal’C were really running the show. I did find it to be a nice homage to Gunbuster at the end where Lal’C used the same outfit Noriko used. However, I feel like the ending where it is hinted that Noriko and Amano are coming back after their 1,000 year hiatus, again no one ever explained the time lapse in space but who cares. All and all, Diebuster made me hopeful that if there is a Gunbuster 3, it can still be further improved and the third might be a winner.

Just like GunBuster before it, this show embodies many of the qualities that made their respective eras of anime so unique and recognizable and turns them up to 11, making for an exceptionally enjoyable show if you’re into that kind of stuff.Boasting the now iconic style of modern Gainax, DieBuster’s world is angular, stylish, energetic, and most importantly fun. The protagonist that is Nono exudes exactly the kind of charming stupidity you’d expect from the “lovable clutz”-stereotype, and she absolutely carries the show...alongside its audiovisual presentation. And while I can’t say much about the rest of the cast of characters, their designs are kind of neat at least, much like all of the machines featured in the show, be that mechas, spaceships, etc…If there’s one major thing that DieBuster lacks when compared to its predecessor, I think most would agree that it’d be the sometimes genuinely emotional moments. I’m not saying that it doesn’t try with scenes like this (oh it tries alright), but for me, they just don’t land. While I’m sure that some of the few who actually watched this show will disagree with me, the complete lack of groundedness, which most of the time is the show’s biggest strength, also renders me unable to get emotionally invested. It’s not impossible, but it’s goddamn hard to make stories like these and still have the audience take them seriously.

Especially if its anime as most if it is anyway made from another source like Manga or book.One might say the easier understanding storytelling is something lost, but for me a good show has a core story...that will entertain everyone.

Why, you ask? because like it happened with the godawful, unnecessary movie they made out of Trigun ten years after the classic 90\'s series was ended, my instinct prevented me to watch this completely unnecessary sequel to a pretty good and influential series (except the sixth episode that is, totally unwatchable unless you\'re into formerly depressed Otakus who believe themselves ""profound"" and ""intelligent"" because they employ totally empty religious and non-religious words in a black-and-white, badly-drawn artsy-farty dreck) because I thought this was going...to be an awful experience.

She can be a little annoying in the latter part of the show but it\'s okay.

The original Gunbuster, while it could be a little silly at times, had overall a rather serious military tone which totally disappears in the sequel with silly robots, silly hats, even more broken physic.

Worst of all the world-building one of the aspects where the original wasn\'t all that bad is here ridiculous, basically, every deus ex machina now works thanks to magic instead of techno bs but aside from that nothing has really changed in 12000 years.Also one of my let down with the original was that it ends when it was becoming interesting aka when it would have shown how humanity as developed and how the MC legend has developed... well now I know that I would have preferred to never know.And maybe the biggest drawback: it doesn’t take itself seriously which means that unlike the original it\'s not even funny.So to conclude Die buster is bad, don\'t waste your time.

But as we all know how we perceive shows now and how we perceive shows as a child are completely different. So how is this childhood classic seen from a supposedly more critical individual?As you first start the movie you are immediately hit with the nostalgic Digimon theme song: “Digimon, Digital monsters, Digimon are the champions!”, a dangerously catchy tune that will have you humming it for ages afterwards. For a twenty-minute movie not much else can be said about sound except if you watch the English dub, they surprise the viewer by using some well known...upbeat American songs.This is supposed to be a prequel to the anime series. Being such a short film you can’t expect to know who all the characters are or what the main bulk of the story is unless you are familiar with the show. Having said that it does deliver the premise quite well at the beginning of this film with the simple sentences: “Did you know that there are two worlds? Our world and the digital world.” From that you immediately thrown into the Digimon world and all its glory. This particular story only follows two of our ‘Digidestined’; Hikari and her elder brother Tai, just normal children in an otherwise normal city.

For viewers who are yet to discover the Digiworld this is a good introduction to the real show --  Digimon: Digital monsters, which is set four years after the events of this film. Digimon Adventure has genuinely been an enjoyable movie; childhood favourite or not - as it delivers reasonable voice acting without sounding childishly lame; sophisticated execution for a show primarily aimed for children and decent animation for an anime from 1999. If you have 20 minutes to spare check it out -- either to remember the Digimon days or to embark on Digimon days to come.As they say in the theme song: “Digimon, Digital monsters, Digimon are the champions!”And they’re not lying. upbeat American songs.This is supposed to be a prequel to the anime series.

However, when one thinks of Digimon, when they're not comparing it to Pokémon and claiming it's a rip-off, they think of the first two seasons, particularly the first with the original eight children and their Digimon. They also may remember the movie, which Saban Entertainment tried and failed to piece together three separate movies into one and make them related to one-another (even though they had a reason for why, but it's not justifiable). The Digimon...Adventure movie is one of the more well-remembered ones next to “Our War Game”, and it helps that it's the first to be seen—and the first before the main series started. It serves as a prologue to the television series, although American audiences didn't get to see it until the movie was released in the fall of 2000.(This review will go back and forth between the sub and the dub, and will seem to be slightly biased as I prefer one over the other, and yet for a better reason than “It's nostalgic”.)Story (7): A young Tai Kamiya (Taichi Yagami) wakes up in the middle of the night to find his sister, Kari Kamiya (Hikari Yagami) in their father's office staring at the computer where an egg comes out of it. It hatches the next morning into a cute black creature that doesn't trust them at first, but warms up to them, getting the strength to grow into a pink creature with long ears named Koromon, and later that night into a large dinosaur-like creature that goes unnamed (although it is Agumon). It escapes with Kari into Odaiba where it causes slight havoc before a larger egg appears in the sky and hatches a large parrot (also unnamed, but is known as Parrotmon). What happens lays the foundation of their fate as DigiDestineds years later.As it's a 20-minute-long prologue, not much story can be told, and yet it works well as a prologue. Its job was to introduce the characters to the audience and get them familiar with the little rules laid out from the start—even though, unfortunately, those rules change somewhat in the TV series, but it's nothing major. It can stand on its own, though it's hard to tell if it really can stand on its own after having seen the TV series before seeing the prologue.Art/Animation (9): There's really not much to say about this part. Directed by Mamoru Hosoda, his touch in the art and animation department is everywhere in this 20-minute film. Colors are muted, the animation is very fluid despite the flat appearance due to lack of shading, and the detail ranges from minimalistic to out-right gorgeous. It's more realistic-looking and has better care to it than the TV show itself, save for one episode, and it shows in both the character and monster designs, and in the monster behavior.Sound (6 for sub, 8 for dub): I'm pretty sure Toshiko Fujita and Kae Araki are talented voice actresses and were good choices for Tai and Kari. However, I found them okay in this film, and I don't know if it's because of the script or because they're just voicing young children. Compared to the dub, the script's fairly simplistic with the characters. Joshua Seth and Lara Jill Miller were more passionate with their characters, even when attempting to sound like young children (with various results). The script in the dub had more dialogue than in the sub as well as more humor due to Saban being known for dubbing Digimon as a gag dub. Even in scenes where the characters aren't talking dialogue is added, but it's usually more for a quick joke and gives a more light-hearted feel throughout, even though in tense scenes it remains tense.The sound-effects were also more emphasized in the dub than in the sub, particularly with Kari's whistle, which I personally feel was a good decision they made as the whistle in the sub was too quiet for my tastes, personally. (This is probably justified if the whistle's more of a toy, but some parts of the whistle blowing I didn't like—but that's my own personal problem.) The soundtrack is TERRIBLY limited in the sub to one song, “Bolero”, until the credits, and that I feel is the worst part of the movie. The dub may have used rock songs during the movie, and even used the Digimon theme song by the end, but the music was at least more appropriate for the scenes. I personally don't find Parrotmon descending from the sky ominous when “Bolero” is playing. They tried to do a reprise of “Bolero” when Greymon and Parrotmon were fighting, but because it's still “Bolero”, it's distracting. Playing the Digimon theme song in the dub was more effective in giving the impression the fight's cool and action-packed.Characters (7 for sub, 8 for dub): The characters in the prologue are young and fairly simple, and thus their personalities somewhat change and further develop by the time they age about four-to-five years. The Tai we all know is not yet a leader, he's just being a big brother to his baby sister, and Kari has a sense of curiosity. The other characters appear at the end, but they're more like background characters at this point. The dub takes it slightly further by having the characters act somewhat the same as they did in the TV series, with Tai snarking and cracking jokes throughout.Koromon is an interesting case. While I can't speak for the original, the dub implies the Koromon in the TV series is the same as in the prologue, and yet their personalities are entirely different especially when he Digivolves. However, while this Koromon was indeed a different Digimon, it just happens to be the same Digimon Tai wound up with. Considering it was supposed to be a one-shot at first, it shows, and it causes a slight snarl in whether-or-not Koromon had indeed met Tai and Kari prior to them entering the Digital World. Even so in both versions, Koromon is friendly to Tai and Kari after warming up, he's just happier and more chatty in the dub. The dub goes further with Koromon by having him speaking slightly as Agumon and Greymon, yet gruff and almost primitive even though in the original, he only roars and growls to emphasize how animalistic he is, but still has some intelligence. Even Parrotmon speaks in the dub, yet is silent in the original.Enjoyment (7 for sub, 10 for dub): I will be honest that while I liked seeing the scenes that the dub had cut out, because of the dialogue, some lack of sound-effects, and the terrible use of soundtrack, I found the sub a bore, if not hard, to watch. The dub may unfortunately be overlooked as a whole because it's part of the terribly-put together Digimon movie, but as its own separate entry, it is better dubbed and more fun to watch. Kari's narration may take away from it, but when easily-ignored, the dialogue isn't bad. It's your typical Saban's gag dub script, and I feel the cheesiness works. But it's all based on personal taste, as some people don't like the gag dub approach and feel it's a terrible dub, while others like the gag dub and can go back and forth as to whether it was a good dub or not.So take your pick as to what you want to watch. It's good either way, the differences are just vastly noticeable and varies from person to person. I personally will continue to watch the dub even though I won't easily forget the cut scenes and will quietly muse how the dub would've handled those scenes if Saban had been allowed to keep it uncut.

However, I found them okay in this film, and I don't know if it's because of the script or because they're just voicing young children. Compared to the dub, the script's fairly simplistic with the characters. Joshua Seth and Lara Jill Miller were more passionate with their characters, even when attempting to sound like young children (with various results). The script in the dub had more dialogue than in the sub as well as more humor due to Saban being known for dubbing Digimon as a gag dub. Even in scenes where the characters aren't talking dialogue is added, but it's usually more for a quick joke and gives a more light-hearted feel throughout, even though in tense scenes it remains tense.The sound-effects were also more emphasized in the dub than in the sub, particularly with Kari's whistle, which I personally feel was a good decision they made as the whistle in the sub was too quiet for my tastes, personally. (This is probably justified if the whistle's more of a toy, but some parts of the whistle blowing I didn't like—but that's my own personal problem.) The soundtrack is TERRIBLY limited in the sub to one song, “Bolero”, until the credits, and that I feel is the worst part of the movie. The dub may have used rock songs during the movie, and even used the Digimon theme song by the end, but the music was at least more appropriate for the scenes. I personally don't find Parrotmon descending from the sky ominous when “Bolero” is playing. They tried to do a reprise of “Bolero” when Greymon and Parrotmon were fighting, but because it's still “Bolero”, it's distracting. Playing the Digimon theme song in the dub was more effective in giving the impression the fight's cool and action-packed.Characters (7 for sub, 8 for dub): The characters in the prologue are young and fairly simple, and thus their personalities somewhat change and further develop by the time they age about four-to-five years. The Tai we all know is not yet a leader, he's just being a big brother to his baby sister, and Kari has a sense of curiosity. The other characters appear at the end, but they're more like background characters at this point. The dub takes it slightly further by having the characters act somewhat the same as they did in the TV series, with Tai snarking and cracking jokes throughout.Koromon is an interesting case. While I can't speak for the original, the dub implies the Koromon in the TV series is the same as in the prologue, and yet their personalities are entirely different especially when he Digivolves. However, while this Koromon was indeed a different Digimon, it just happens to be the same Digimon Tai wound up with. Considering it was supposed to be a one-shot at first, it shows, and it causes a slight snarl in whether-or-not Koromon had indeed met Tai and Kari prior to them entering the Digital World. Even so in both versions, Koromon is friendly to Tai and Kari after warming up, he's just happier and more chatty in the dub. The dub goes further with Koromon by having him speaking slightly as Agumon and Greymon, yet gruff and almost primitive even though in the original, he only roars and growls to emphasize how animalistic he is, but still has some intelligence. Even Parrotmon speaks in the dub, yet is silent in the original.Enjoyment (7 for sub, 10 for dub): I will be honest that while I liked seeing the scenes that the dub had cut out, because of the dialogue, some lack of sound-effects, and the terrible use of soundtrack, I found the sub a bore, if not hard, to watch. The dub may unfortunately be overlooked as a whole because it's part of the terribly-put together Digimon movie, but as its own separate entry, it is better dubbed and more fun to watch. Kari's narration may take away from it, but when easily-ignored, the dialogue isn't bad. It's your typical Saban's gag dub script, and I feel the cheesiness works. But it's all based on personal taste, as some people don't like the gag dub approach and feel it's a terrible dub, while others like the gag dub and can go back and forth as to whether it was a good dub or not.So take your pick as to what you want to watch. It's good either way, the differences are just vastly noticeable and varies from person to person. I personally will continue to watch the dub even though I won't easily forget the cut scenes and will quietly muse how the dub would've handled those scenes if Saban had been allowed to keep it uncut."", ""I think a lot of people are mistakenly confusing Digimon Adventure The Movie and Digimon Adventure Movie in this site.

This was Hosoda's first work, and maybe with Bokura no War Game, the movies where he got well known around japan.

This one is a prequel to the original series, Digimon Adventure, and as such it has to be compared only to what the achievements of that season are, and we watch with some certain affection towards the characters, but you know what? This short film is made in a way that I can see it being meaningful to first timers; there\'s something in the siblings relationship that is enough to be moving even...if you didn\'t watch Digimon Adventure. In just 20 minutes we get to know how Taichi and Hikari first encountered with the Digital monsters, and it is as well written as the anime series is and it\'s also really well developed.Story: 10/10The prequel is consistent with the information we are given in the Digimon Adventure series. The plot is pretty straight forward: two siblings had a fateful meeting with a digital monster. They bond and eventually the digimon has to departure after facing an enemy. Being that simple how it could score a perfect 10? Well, this is meant to be simple, but being so doesn\'t mean it has to be bad, because as far as the pacing go, it is so well managed that the 20 minutes doesn\'t stretch too long or fall short, instead every single sequence is so detailed, smartly shaped and amusingly told, so every minute feels worthy of our time. The key to storytelling is pacing: bad pacing leads to boredom and frustration, but this is not the case. It\'s easy to smile quite often while watching this simple story and so the enjoyment is quite high, not to mention towards the end it becomes quite poignant, why that is? The answer is character work.Character: 10/10Those who watched the Digimon series already have developed some kind of affection (or not) towards Taichi and Hikari, and in this prequel their characters show us something impressive: they are the same, but at the same time they are different. Both of them are 4 years younger, and so all the development we\'ve seen in Adventure hasn\'t taken place, but we still can see glimpses of each other’s main characteristics, just like Hikari\'s compassion and Taichi\'s courage, but Taichi doesn\'t accept what\'s going on as fast as he did in Adventure, which shows us that he still has to grow up to be the character that we know he became, and that\'s quite rich, enough to draw you a smile.The strongest aspect of the film to first timers will probably be how poignant is Tachi\'s and Hikari\'s relationship. Taichi is a protective brother while Hikari is mostly careless, and quite interested in understanding and bonding with the digimon that appeared in their house, and as the film progress by the end we get a moving scene in which, as Hikari runs out of breathe, Taichi cheers their digimon in her place; sure, Taichi also grew kind of fond of him, but I had no doubt that he mostly did it for Hikari, and as such it was a really well executed scene that is enough to make you feel warm, and that is what Digimon Adventure is all about.Art: 7/10My only complaint would be that the art is lacking, it is visually different from the anime series and that can be bothersome to all time fans, but it is just a minor complain in what has been an otherwise fantastic short film-Sound: 9/10As much as I love Ravel, it gets a little repetitive as the minutes run by, but that is just a minor flaw, the music and soundtracks are usually spot on and are as good as in the anime. Also, the use of ""Butterfly perfect version"" at the end when the credits roll is just perfect.I\'m happy I got to see this movie, even though I already kind a knew what happened it was still great to see it detailed and get the chance to look so closely into these beloved characters past. If you loved Digimon Adventure, I\'m almost sure you will love it. If not... well, you wouldn\'t be searching for a Digimon movie at all, right?Overall: 46/50= 9.2 --> 9 score if you didn\'t watch Digimon Adventure.

This short film only has 1 orchestrated song and its so out of place with the atmosphere of the film it completely ruined the experience (for me at least), i guess it was sorta of what Watanabe, Cheru was going for but it still did not...go well with the film. The music was also way to loud in comparison with the movie thus being even more distracting.

It's amazing and every frame moves fluently. You mostly focus on Taichi and his little sister Hikari but you also see the young future DigiDestined from the original and season two.

Together, they must fight to save both worlds from a powerful villain.Now, while the concept of Digimon is certainly intriguing, the movie itself is a bit...lackluster. The animation is dated, the plot is predictable, and the characters are fairly one-dimensional. It's not terrible by any means, but it's definitely not a masterpiece either.Well, isn't this just a jolly good anime with its charming digital creatures and courageous protagonists? I mean, sure, it may be a bit dated and predictable, but who cares when you have a bunch of talking animals fighting evil, am I right?Overall, I'd give this movie a 6/10.

All I can do is discuss how it stands by itself. The answer is, not very well.Digimon Adventure doesn't have a story so much as it has characters wandering aimlessly from one thing to the next. It starts with an egg coming out of a computer and hatching into a little black thing. It rolls around with an annoying toddler and her twit of an older brother before becoming a pink blob with rabbit ears and can suddenly talk for some reason. It then...bounces around aimlessly for a while. Then it becomes a little T-rex and, thankfully, loses the ability to talk. It goes on a short rampage before being attacked by a giant parakeet. It becomes a much larger T-rex and the two continue their battle. The battle isn't even interesting. It's pretty much just the T-rex getting knocked down, staying down for a while and then getting up to finally settle things with a single attack. Why doesn't this qualify as a story? Because there's no reason for the shift from bouncing around obnoxiously to going on a rampage. Nor is there an over-arching plot.The characters are very one-dimensional. You have two annoying children, the thing that hatches from the computer egg and the parents who are largely absent. Aside from that there are only background characters. The characters have no complexity and none of them are likable.The art is much worse in the film than it is in the series. The biggest problem is that the visuals are just really boring.The voice work is deliberately over-acted and annoying. The music is as bland as the visuals. Then there's the issue with the toddler blowing a whistle incessantly which becomes really annoying very quickly.The yuri factor is a 1/10.The only two female characters are a toddler and her mother and they certainly don't share any les-yay nor should they.My final rating for Digimon Adventure is 2/10. There's really no reason to watch it. I can't imagine that it adds anything to the Digimon series. What isn't annoying is just tedious. bounces around aimlessly for a while.

Although the remake keeps many of the same story beats as the original, there are also numerous major changes. Some of these I liked. For example, the fate of a prominent secondary antagonist, Medusa, was a notable loose end in the original film. Here, she gets much more screentime and actual closure to her role in the story.In addition, this movie...alters the scene where the heroes first confront the main villain. In the original version of the story, they uncloak themselves in front of the villain for no explained reason, whereas here, he sees through their disguise first, which seems like a much more logical sequence of events.However, there are other changes that I felt less positive about. In the original, the main characters had to travel by flying carpet for a week to reach the demons\' planet. The remake, on the other hand, adds an earlier scene in which they are able to access the planet instantaneously using Doraemon\'s Anywhere Door, and yet when the protagonists need to take another trip there, they instead use the flying carpet! (Previous Doraemon stories have established that the Anywhere Door does not work when it lacks a pre-programmed map to the destination, as would likely be the case for interstellar travel in a parallel magical universe. It\'s thus understandable that it was not used to reach the demon planet in the original film.)The remake removes most of the ""adventurous"" part of the heroes\' journey on the demon planet in the original, during which they faced a series of hostile environments and dangerous creatures with the help of Doraemon\'s gadgets. Sequences like that are often some of the most fun parts of Doraemon movies, so I think it\'s a shame that this one was cut. (This also makes it ironic that the remake is still titled the ""Great Adventure into the Underworld"".) Partly as a result of that, Gian\'s time in the spotlight is lost in this version, given that him driving off the sea monster was part of the adventure sequence in the original. Not only that, but his role in finishing off the main villain is instead given to Nobita here.Although the remake still contains plenty of action, the overall tone feels more comedic. In a way, this is reflected by the movie poster: just look at how much brighter it looks than the original! (Note as well how Dorami is prominently featured here, whereas her involvement with the original plot came as more of a surprise.) On top of that, this movie surprisingly made all the ""jokes"" about Nobita exposing Shizuka\'s underwear even worse than the original, down to showing the other boys (including Doraemon, who keep in mind is meant to be a child-caring robot) eagerly watching when they happen! Out of all the questionable things that Shizuka is subjected to in the franchise, having Doraemon express any kind of perverted interest in her might be the most horrid. It\'s not even a consistent part of his character, and besides, it was not in the original version of this story. There was absolutely no reason for it to be here.On its own, this probably isn\'t a bad film, but it has its fair share of issues and I much prefer the overall atmosphere of the original, which is one of my favorite Doraemon movies. alters the scene where the heroes first confront the main villain.

There was absolutely no reason for it to be here.On its own, this probably isn\'t a bad film, but it has its fair share of issues and I much prefer the overall atmosphere of the original, which is one of my favorite Doraemon movies.']"
Doraemon Movie 07: Nobita to Tetsujin Heidan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2665/Doraemon_Movie_07__Nobita_to_Tetsujin_Heidan,"[""I remember watching this when I was 7. Nostalgia hit Me like a truck when I rewatched it. The Ending for sure was both Emotional and Nostalgic. It doesn't matter if the movie isn't that good, I will still give it a 10 for making me Happy and for the sake of my Childhood.It's been very long since the last time I saw this but I still recall most of the scenes and also that nostalgic song at the End and throughout the Movie. If you used to watch Doraemon as a kid then you would've already watched this movies many times by Now. I...highly recommend this Movie to Anyone who is interested in Gundam, Mecha and Sad things because these factors are seen throughout the movie.I therefore end my review here,Thank You. highly recommend this Movie to Anyone who is interested in Gundam, Mecha and Sad things because these factors are seen throughout the movie.I therefore end my review here,Thank You."", 'My overall take: Not without flaws, but remembered as one of the most emotional Doraemon movies for good reason.Ah yes, the one where a handful of kids and their robot babysitter fight an unwinnable battle against alien war machines that want to enslave humanity. This film is known as one of the most emotionally charged Doraemon movies, and it certainly lives up to its reputation. The heroes\' increasing desperation against the overwhelming numbers of the robot army, the robot spy Riruru\'s change in perspective and eventual decision to sacrifice herself to end the war, and Shizuka\'s reaction to the latter are all pretty effective emotional...beats.This is a very strong entry in the franchise, though it does have some flaws. Probably the most obvious to me is the contrived way in which Shizuka gets drawn into the main plot. About halfway through the movie, the main characters (sans Shizuka) decide they need to enter a mirror dimension. To do so, they require a sufficiently large, still reflective surface to act as a portal, so Nobita gets the brilliant idea to use... Shizuka\'s bathtub for this purpose. Hold on a second—you could have used your own damn bathtub, Nobita! What\'s more, he chooses not to inform Shizuka about this ""for her protection""... but if there\'s anything well known about Shizuka\'s character, it\'s that taking baths is one of her favorite hobbies. Naturally, she discovers the portal while the others are away, goes through it, and nearly meets her end at the hands of killer robots that are trapped on the other side. Well done, Nobita.Given that the ending involves the robot army being wiped from existence through the alteration of history, it has been pointed out that the main characters shouldn\'t retain any memory of the events of this movie. This is a clear example where the emotional resonance of the story is intended to take precedence over strict logic, however, so it\'s not something that damages my enjoyment of the film very much. beats.This is a very strong entry in the franchise, though it does have some flaws.

Dragon Ball Z Movie 12: Fukkatsu no Fusion!! Gokuu to Vegeta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/905/Dragon_Ball_Z_Movie_12__Fukkatsu_no_Fusion_Gokuu_to_Vegeta,"[""When it comes to the Dragonball films in general they usually follow something different. instead of the canon material that the series containsIt instead mixes certain content from the series themselves but only to present a different setting that usually is not always direct from the series.So therefore, Do not go into watching them expecting anything that great of a premise in the first place since its not meant to do so, except just take them as special added content for its standard viewing alone.So on to the 12th Dragon Ball Z Movie and I totally loved it!!This surprised me because I didn't have that...much expectations of it and yet as soon as I started watching it, It starts to go with the action and comedy formula right of the bat and it works so well for this film.The action is fun, You get your silly slapstick moments of the characters, some bizarre real life character references like hitler in this like wtf xD, as well as fusion from the series.The animation looks brilliant for a mid 90s movie along with its fights as well which was pretty memorable in terms of how epic it looks.The voice acting was fine on both in English and Japanese, Though I like more of the soundtracks from the english version since Gogeta and Janemba's theme sounds really cool.The villain here Janemba who doesn't have any personality what so ever is this manifestation of evil negative energy similar to majin buu in terms of having a primal like personality starting his form as this giant oversized child like thingy than shortly enough into this sinister looking demon which I have to admit the design of it looks brilliant.Janemba also possesses a pretty incredible ability of materialising and manipulating space and anything over the dimensions of space itself making him capable of transforming the universe in its entirety into his image which includes the Other World where goku is fighting pikkon.These effects causes the other world and their overseers including the checking station to falter in this dimension making the villains escape from their confinement.Not only that but the magic of the dragonballs are also effected by this as well.The movie's main plot is mainly about goku, vegeta and the others trying to stop the powerful janemba and his powers over the dimensions that pulls in some of these entertaining moments out really well.The only thing I wished to have seen more of was janemba effecting other parts of the universe and for the other villains though only minor, to be a little more involved in the movie to at least make the film a little more longer but other than that, this movie was fun and enjoyable and Gogeta totally rocks!!Its probably my favourite dragonball film so far ;) much expectations of it and yet as soon as I started watching it, It starts to go with the action and comedy

amazing for the year it was released in, the characters were all well animated and the scenery was packed with colour and detail.Sound 8/10 The music in this movie...was really good especially

Picon and guests appearances from old villains such as Freeza himself.Enjoyment 9/10 this movie is one of the finer movies of the DBZ collection it has a little bit of everything and the fight scenes were just the best with Goku and Vegeta facing an opponent with abilities they've never seen before.Overall 8/10 This is a really good movie and also has a lot of humour in there as well from Mr Satan himself all the way through to the return of Hitler. With old bad guys appearing from the dead that are no longer a match for the Z fighters and an all new enemy that is the strongest they have ever faced, this is one enjoyable watch. was really good especially throughout the fight scenes it added  epicness to the fights.Characters 8/10 By far one of the best things in this movie with a new bad ass looking bad guy Jenemba, Goku and Vegetas fusion Gogeta, Picon and guests appearances from old villains such as Freeza himself.Enjoyment 9/10 this movie is one of the finer movies of the DBZ collection it has a little bit of everything and the fight scenes were just the best with Goku and Vegeta facing an opponent with abilities they've never seen before.Overall 8/10 This is a really good movie and also has a lot of humour in there as well from Mr Satan himself all the way through to the return of Hitler.

Gokuu to Vegeta"" is undoubtedly my favorite movie of this whole franchise. I just liked it very much.The story, despite being simple, manages to present very interesting topics. The fact that to go to hell you have to ""purify"" the soul and remove all negative feelings is something that, at the very least, can give possibilities and be something quite curious, because the evil of all enemies who defeated Goku before is stored in that...place. The film took advantage of its very little used scenario (beyond, hell) to propose interesting things.The way in which this whole issue of the beyond is presented is done in a good way (adding everything implemented in the anime / manga), so the story is not searched or forced, because the whole incident occurred by simple carelessness which cost very expensive, in general it seemed a simple story, but very effective.The characters in the movie are many, but very few end up importing; what happens on earth is entirely secondary and feels without emotion. Goku and Vegeta remain the same (which is to be expected), but in the middle of the battle against Super Janemba, Vegeta accepts that Super Janemba is a very strong enemy for him, coming to mourn the frustration (Vegeta very rarely does this , he is very proud) and agrees to merge with Goku. His first fusion fails miserably due to an error of Vegeta, but despite that Vegeta continued to accept that the fusion is his only salvation, showing that he can come to reconsider his chances of winning a fight (I repeat, Vegeta rarely does this) , so it has an acceptable ""evolution"" for the duration of the movie.Goku is the same as always, loves the fights (so much that he even wanted to continue battling against Paikuhan despite the rumble caused by Janemba), Goku never comes to hate Janemba or thinks arrogantly against him, Goku is just as always, what does not get to emphasize its evolution or things of that nature. What stands out of Goku in this fight is his battle against Janemba, since Goku faced off against the most unpredictable enemy of all (Goku even goes so far as to say that Janemba or Super Janemba has been the strongest enemy against which he has fought ), Goku\'s surprise at seeing Janemba\'s attacks and how he plans to defeat him was something good and quite exciting.Paikuhan is a rather minor character in the film, his only important activity was discovering Janemba\'s weakness, but that does not mean he can be devalued or belittled, Paikuhan is someone with an ""air"" or very chivalrous personality, so it\'s funny see him insult the crystals that Janemba did. Apart from that, the other thing he did was to make a very short battle against Janemba, so in combat it is quite disappointing (although he won time for Goku and Vegeta to merge). Paikuhan in general is quite deceocionante by its very short battle and because I spend most of the movie with the crystals of Janemba.Janemba, on the other hand, is an enemy that arises from a very ingenious idea, the badness made person (literally) and Janemba is not at all an untapped enemy, her silly and childish personality in its first form passes to a personality much more serious and that emits terror, their movements are very varied to be a Dragon Ball character where most of the times are limited to throwing waves of energy, does not emit decent dialogues (only says Janemba), but is a very well used enemy and thought.The atmosphere of the movie is very good, hell was turned into a very eccentric place (more than it already is), full of crystals that seem sweet, that complements very well the personality of the fat Janemba, an excellent scenario.The film also has a soundtrack very much in line with what was presented on the scene, the most remarkable being the one that sounds when Goku confronts Janemba, transmitting a feeling of madness and mystery. Another soundtrack that is very much in tune with the moment is when Goku and Vegeta transform into Gogeta to defeat Super Janemba, an epic music.A movie that I think is very good from Dragon Ball, feels the frenetic and crazy of the combats in this movie, the fusion does not feel gimmicky or something that is convenient (since the fusion was implemented before the movie, besides the first fusion failed), a very enjoyable movie if you are looking for something that is ""style on substance"", but without leaving the ""substance"" obsolete. place.

Now it's time to delve into the franchise once more with a look at the twelfth Dragonball Z movie, Fusion Reborn. Will it be on the level of the fourteenth movie or is this one of the weak Dragonball Z films?Story:Our story opens after the Buu saga with an afterlife tournament where Goku faces off against Paikuhan, in spite of the fact that Goku was resurrected by the old Kaio during the Buu saga and the fact that the grand Kaio decided that the prize for the afterlife...tournament needed to be withheld for a while so he could get back in shape. Unsurprisingly, this is a Dragonball Z movie that doesn't fit in with the continuity, which is an issue with a lot of them. Moving on, King Yama is busy judging souls while the oni in charge of monitoring the soul cleansing equipment goofs off. This results in an accident which causes the evil to burst out and transform the young oni into Janemba, a being of pure evil that seals Yama's palace, enabling the souls of the dead to break free and roam around on Earth. The tournament is postponed so that Goku and Paikuhan can investigate.To be fair, the concept behind this isn't a bad one. The idea of the dead wreaking havoc could have been very interesting. But this is DBZ so it's used as an excuse for action sequences and that's pretty much it. To be fair, that's pretty much to be expected from the franchise and it's what people are going to be watching the film for. That's why the biggest problem is the final fight itself. It is really anti-climactic. You get some good buildup for it, but the fight itself ends in about thirty seconds. Mr. Satan fought Cell longer than Gogeta fights Janemba. On the positive side, the film does have some funny moments and some stupidly awesome bits, including Trunks and Goten fighting undead nazis.Characters:The film focuses primarily on the saiyajin and half saiyajin characters. Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks and Goten. Videl also plays a somewhat significant role. None of them really develop in any substantial way over the course of the film, but you do get a good sense of their personalities, which is fair enough given that the film isn't even an hour long. Then we have our villain, Janemba. He's basically like Majin Buu right down to starting as an obese man-child and transforming into a meaner, more heavily muscled form. It's like the Frieza and Cooler thing where a film just makes a weaker copy of a villain from the main series.Art:The artwork and animation are pretty decent. The biggest issue is that the action sequences are kind of weak in this one. Given how much the franchise relies on those, that's pretty bad. I will give the film credit for having some really interesting backgrounds during its tour of hell.Sound:The entire vocal cast delivers decent performances. There's some exaggeration, but no more than the usual given the franchise's tendency to have dudes screaming to get stronger. The music is pretty good.Ho-yay:There isn't any homo-eroticism in this movie.Final Thoughts:Dragonball Z: Fusion Reborn is an action movie with some good ideas and funny moments, but that suffers from weak action and a boring antagonist. It isn't a bad movie, nor is it one of the worst DBZ films for what it is, but there are a lot of better Dragonball Z films out there. This one is just kind of dull. My final rating for it is going to be a 5/10. Tomorrow I'll take a look at Spirited Away. tournament needed to be withheld for a while so he could get back in shape.

Tomorrow I'll take a look at Spirited Away."", 'Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn is one of the best movies the franchise has to offer and I shall elaborate my statement in the following.1. StoryFusion Reborn\'s story is nothing to write home about. It is by no means a ""bad"" story for a Dragon Ball movie, but it is obvious that it was not the main focus of the movie, or at least not the parts that don\'t feature the two protagonists. It is definitely no Dragon Ball Super: Broly in terms of story, but it suffices for the movie\'s premise.2. ArtDespite my wish to give this category a solid 10, there is one...minor thing that has bugged me in my multiple watching-sessions. The movie adds very thick borderlines on the non-protagonist characters which really are off-putting. Other than that, most of the movie looks like how you would expect a Dragon Ball Z movie to look like, and I personally think that it looks better than the show at some points.3. SoundThe sound design and soundtrack of Fusion Reborn surpass at least the Funimation Dub of the original show. Near the end of the movie the punches and kicks sound like explosions and it really adds a lot to it. The English dub made a good effort in terms of the soundtrack, but it is fair to say that the Japanese dub has the better soundtrack overall.4. CharacterThe characters in the movie aren\'t as fleshed out as in the show, but fairly well written for a Dragon Ball Z movie. The most interesting character in the movie is the main villain, because of their uniqueness as a Dragon Ball villain. I felt like it was a refreshing change from ""super bad villain that wants to destroy Goku because of reasons"" types of villains that were featured in previous movies.5. EnjoymentWhile this is mostly subjective, I only have warm feelings whenever I rewatch Fusion Reborn. It definitely is a highly enjoyable movie, especially as a fan of the franchise. Though most of the enjoyment stems from the fight of the main protagonists and the main villain, the side characters have their fun moments as well.Overall:Fusion Reborn is a solid 9 in my book, because it really comes to show what a Dragon Ball movie can be if the people involved really put in effort. With enjoyable characters, good music and mostly good art, I cannot recommend this movie enough to all Dragon Ball fans. People that are new to the franchise will also get a lot of enjoyment out of the movie, but I recommend to watch more of the show or perhaps even other movies beforehand. minor thing that has bugged me in my multiple watching-sessions.

Gokuu to Vegeta aka. Fusion Reborn is a movie where the death return to life after an accident happened in hell creating a monster known as Janemba. It is up to Goku, Vegeta and Paikuhan (or Pikkon in American) to stop Janemba from destroying the balance of the circle of life pretty much.The movie does a good job in showing the chaos Janemba's existence has to both the afterlife and the living world as the viewers will be able to see both what is going on in these different locations.While Goku, Paikuhan and Vegeta deal with Janemba...while Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Videl do their best to deal with the revived villains amounts which is Frieza. The movie also uses two artstyles for the serious and non serious moments but not necessary for comedic scenes. There are references to famous movies or historical events that get parodied which some countries won't be able to see because of censorships like the infamous dictator scene being removed from the German dub.Speaking of artstyle, the visuals and animations are even holding up today and are the best looking Dragon Ball visuals up to date. Animators took full advantage of the tools they had making Janemba's abilities especially the teleportation a visual spectacle. It is alongside Wrath the Dragon and Path to Power without the doubt the best looking Dragon Ball film.There is a good reason why this alongside Wrath of the Dragon are the only Dragon Ball movies from the original run that had a worldwide theatrical release.As the name of the movie suggests, the selling point is Goku and Vegeta fusing to Gogeta being the first time these two merge to stop a common enemy. And the build up to that moment was done beautifully.We see more about Vegeta's inferiority complex and the hate of the idea to fuse with his rival. And it might even rival Vegeta's development throughout the Boo Saga.While on the topic of Boo Saga, this movie can't fit to the main story timeline and can be seen as a sidestory where the good guys defeated Boo with Goku and Vegeta remaining death.Janemba is a villain that resembles Boo a lot but is created out of pure evil. He starts off as a fatso and later becomes a muscular demonic lizard thingy after one of the creepiest transformation scenes ever. His abilities are also very unique to him but it feels like there are also too much powers of Boo added for no reason like arm extension. But the main appeal obviously is altering objects and teleportation. Not only can he teleport himself but can also create teleportation portals which he cleverly uses to attack opponents without physically appearing or sending back attacks aimed at him. Meaning he can use his abilities as offensive and defensive tools.But personality wise he is inferior to Kid Boo after he turned evil. Since he can't speak, most of his emotions are expressed by emoting with his body. He is also the only character in the series that uses a physical weapon after the Frieza Saga and makes it being dangerous believable as something like a Sword for Future Trunks didn't enhance his fighting abilities and was just visually pleasing.Comedy in this movie is also great as jokes some which had build up in this movie or from the show being viewed. It would be hard to explain some of them without spoiling it. But they aren't the only ones.The environment is another thing notable for the movie as viewers of the anime have had seen hell, but now that Janemba appeared viewers can witness how Janemba's existence altered it. Combining the flying multi-colored giant jelly beans created by Janemba and the unusual color scheme of hell creates one of  the most surreal landscapes in the franchise. Simply put, changing an already explored location into a brand knew one.Like always there are some criticism. Of all the villains from the show that returned, only one fights and gets defeated in an underwhelming way. I think you can guess who is it. Someone who just won't stop returning. Pretty much wasting the potential of old villains getting a second chance to get what they want and taking advantage of the secondary cast better like Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien, Chaotzu and Krilllin to beat someone like Bojack, Turles or Lord Slug. Instead most of the living world scenes are wasted for historical jokes and Goten and Trunks.As with most DBZ movie villains who are similar to the current story arc villain that came out around the time, Janemba is basically similar to Boo. While he has some unique abilities and a killer design, he just feels like a watered down version of the last DBZ villain. Both start out fat and at the runtime of the Boo Saga the latest form when this movie came out was Super Boo and Janemba's final form has a similar body structure. And as a character, he is shallow after his transformation who had a childlike innocent personality. And there is the question why he is as strong as he is. Another problem is the transformation from big to small is that in regards to Boo who is made out of magic and bubble gum substance, Janemba's transformation that happens in a similar matter seems unrealistic because it doesn't have a believable excuse like Boo. It also makes it less believable that Janemba can extend his arms, an ability it didn't even need. One other issue is neglect of Paikuhan as a character. While he did appear to help out, most of the time he was just trying to free Enma or King Yama, only appearing to buy time for the fusion briefly. So he was wasted as a character for most of the film.Overall Fusion Reborn is a good movie still well remembered and the movie that made Gogeta the character everyone loves. This movie has the debut of Super Saiyan 3 and might be the best use of the transformation in the franchise. Even the transformation scene of Super Saiyan 3 surpasses the one in the Boo Saga version from the anime version taking advantage of how the environment shifts as well as the tone from the battle from fun to serious. So if you like more development for Vegeta, love fusion especially Gogeta and wants some good Super Saiyan 3 action, you owe yourself to watch Fusion Reborn. while Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Videl do their best to deal with the revived villains amounts which is Frieza. The movie also uses two artstyles for the serious and non serious moments but not necessary for comedic scenes. There are references to famous movies or historical events that get parodied which some countries won't be able to see because of censorships like the infamous dictator scene being removed from the German dub.Speaking of artstyle, the visuals and animations are even holding up today and are the best looking Dragon Ball visuals up to date. Animators took full advantage of the tools they had making Janemba's abilities especially the teleportation a visual spectacle. It is alongside Wrath the Dragon and Path to Power without the doubt the best looking Dragon Ball film.There is a good reason why this alongside Wrath of the Dragon are the only Dragon Ball movies from the original run that had a worldwide theatrical release.As the name of the movie suggests, the selling point is Goku and Vegeta fusing to Gogeta being the first time these two merge to stop a common enemy. And the build up to that moment was done beautifully.We see more about Vegeta's inferiority complex and the hate of the idea to fuse with his rival. And it might even rival Vegeta's development throughout the Boo Saga.While on the topic of Boo Saga, this movie can't fit to the main story timeline and can be seen as a sidestory where the good guys defeated Boo with Goku and Vegeta remaining death.Janemba is a villain that resembles Boo a lot but is created out of pure evil. He starts off as a fatso and later becomes a muscular demonic lizard thingy after one of the creepiest transformation scenes ever. His abilities are also very unique to him but it feels like there are also too much powers of Boo added for no reason like arm extension. But the main appeal obviously is altering objects and teleportation. Not only can he teleport himself but can also create teleportation portals which he cleverly uses to attack opponents without physically appearing or sending back attacks aimed at him. Meaning he can use his abilities as offensive and defensive tools.But personality wise he is inferior to Kid Boo after he turned evil. Since he can't speak, most of his emotions are expressed by emoting with his body. He is also the only character in the series that uses a physical weapon after the Frieza Saga and makes it being dangerous believable as something like a Sword for Future Trunks didn't enhance his fighting abilities and was just visually pleasing.Comedy in this movie is also great as jokes some which had build up in this movie or from the show being viewed. It would be hard to explain some of them without spoiling it. But they aren't the only ones.The environment is another thing notable for the movie as viewers of the anime have had seen hell, but now that Janemba appeared viewers can witness how Janemba's existence altered it. Combining the flying multi-colored giant jelly beans created by Janemba and the unusual color scheme of hell creates one of  the most surreal landscapes in the franchise. Simply put, changing an already explored location into a brand knew one.Like always there are some criticism. Of all the villains from the show that returned, only one fights and gets defeated in an underwhelming way. I think you can guess who is it. Someone who just won't stop returning. Pretty much wasting the potential of old villains getting a second chance to get what they want and taking advantage of the secondary cast better like Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien, Chaotzu and Krilllin to beat someone like Bojack, Turles or Lord Slug. Instead most of the living world scenes are wasted for historical jokes and Goten and Trunks.As with most DBZ movie villains who are similar to the current story arc villain that came out around the time, Janemba is basically similar to Boo. While he has some unique abilities and a killer design, he just feels like a watered down version of the last DBZ villain. Both start out fat and at the runtime of the Boo Saga the latest form when this movie came out was Super Boo and Janemba's final form has a similar body structure. And as a character, he is shallow after his transformation who had a childlike innocent personality. And there is the question why he is as strong as he is.

The fighting is good in and is also the biggest part of the movie.They also made everybody so that you can see how strong everybody is, for exemple that Gohan is stronger than ever before in the series and how badass Goku and Vegeta are. The effects used by the powerup to ssj3 are a little stupid that the film goes to negative color but its fairly done and the ending...well...the bad guy dies and Goku and Vegeta say goodbye in a really gay way... the bad guy dies and Goku and Vegeta say goodbye in a really gay way..."", ""The Dragon Ball Z movies had become the living definition of money grabbers after the 7th movie. Many non fans would actually argue even before that. The movies were severely lacking in creativity and imagination, to where the writers found themselves either resorting to gimmicks or just playing copy and paste with stories. Therefore, I remember coming into this expecting the same thing, which was why I put it off for way over a year after its US release date. When I finally gave it a look; I was surprised with the solid effort as it did manage to work well with its key elements;...the action, plot, and even the comedy held my attention to actually consider this a good movie.The plot follows the same pattern as any DBZ movie; a threat shows up that could destroy the world or even the entire universe, and Goku must face this threat. This time around the culprit of mischief is a mutated being by the name of Janemba whom is completely responsible for the living and dead to collide. Goku engages him in battle which leads to quickly being pushed to his limits. I guess this movie will only be about as great or bad to you all depending on how well DBZ comedy and action jells with you.The movie constantly flips between Goku's battle and his sons battle with the undead. The latter is completely comedy motivated all the way down to the visuals and it does work at times. I actually laughed during Frieza's return, plus the parody on Hitler down to some of his dialog, where he even admits that he should be recruiting these super strong blond guys. It's rare to find a DBZ movie where the comedy can make you do something other than groan. However, it's the serious fighting that will grab everyone's attention. It contains the usual Super Saiyan gimmicks plus Vegeta makes a very predictable appearance. The fighting is fun to watch, but again, the comedy has moments where it shines here as well concerning the Fusion technique.Although I enjoyed the movie; I will admit that some of the scenes drag and I doubt this is due to multiple watches. I always felt this way about this movie, and even at 48 minutes I wanted it to end. The villain Janemba is the living definition of cookie-cutter, completely lacking any type of personality which is something that had been plaguing the DBZ movies for a very long time, probably after the Return of Cooler. All he does is just grunt and laugh, and that really isn't cool.The visuals are much better here than in the TV series. The animation is a lot more crisp and vibrant. Although there is a heavy re-use of cels during some combat, there are moments of sharp blows and some type of action choreography. I liked the backgrounds this time too. The Other World where Goku and Janemba battle in has some pretty cool details, such as a rectangular shaped blood pond just floating in mid-air, and a forest made from sharp metallic needles. There are other elements indicating they are fighting in a different world, which is a good change of pace from the usual mountain and vegetation like areas. There is also a second, more manga like style during the comedic living and dead conflict. The designs at times are more cartoony with a darker outline here. I thought it was fine for the most part, but I probably wouldn't have been able to tolerate that had the movie been longer.The voice acting for the English dub which is the only one I can tolerate, is fine for the most part except at times the dialog can feel awkward, as if the cast are just creating plot holes or something. It just sometimes feels strange. In any case, the usual Funimation suspects show up for the party, with Chris Sabat delivering a solid performance as usual playing Vegeta. Plus I will always admire Kara Edwards range playing both Goten and Videl. I would have never noticed it was the same person if not for the credits. The BGM rock score works well with the action, but don't come into this expecting Cooler's Revenge or Broly: Legendary Super Saiyan.Fusion Reborn is among the better DBZ titles. It actually tries to be a better movie and succeeds. Plus it can probably rope in new fans despite it not really fitting into main continuity. It appears to be taking place at some point during the Fusion Saga, but this is hard to buy into. In any case, if you're a fan of DBZ than check this out. If you're new and heavily interested in DBZ, I recommend starting with the TV series first season, then the Dead Zone movie only if possible. Others with no interest or knowledge, there is far better anime out there to invest your time in.Highs: Clean visuals, action and comedy that has good momentsLows: Has its weaker moments too, plus a cookie-cutter baddie the action, plot, and even the comedy held my attention to actually consider this a good movie.The plot follows the same pattern as any DBZ movie; a threat shows up that could destroy the world or even the entire universe, and Goku must face this threat.

With light and goofy bits mixed in with a wonderful array of great action choreography and artwork, this bizarre premise of a film had me laughing and cheering throughout the whole thing.Also Hitler was in it along with some interesting Gas Attacks, so that was fun as hell. It got kind of a bit slow in the middle with Veku, but I had a great time! I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. 7/10,would watch again!#ChrisAyersBestEnglishFreeza "", 'I\'d rather die than merge with you Kakarotto! But Vegeta, you are already dead. Why can\'t we have this bright Goku in Super?This movie is interesting, it is the 1st movie I had to rewatch in order to do this review. I have so many mixed feelings, If I were to describe this movie in one word, it would be: Cool! If I were to rate this movie purely out of enjoyment and cool factor, then it is 8/10 easily.Anyway let\'s move onto the review. Dragon Ball Z Movie: Fusion Reborn is a non canon movie, that means events within this movie doesn\'t appear in...manga.Because I am so divided on this movie, I am gonna split this movie into 2 halfs and I am gonna talk about those halfs and say, what I like and dislike.\\\\spoiler alert//0:00 - 25:00We start at the other world tournament grounds, where Kaios are having an argument between each other about the strongest contestant. Goku and Paikuhan meets in the final and when it\'s about to get interesting comes cut and we suddenly are in King\'s Yemma/Enma place.Comment: I am not a fan of this decision, it\'s nice to have our main cast doing something, but this cut has literally made this small intro pointless and waste of time.After watching King doing his job for a while, we see an evil spirit laundering machine with a devil boy that serves as a plot device. Basically, because of his lack of attention and laziness spirit machine gets destroyed and evil spirits devour boy, turning him into Janemba.Comment: It\'s kinda meh plot device to be honest.Dead arises! Gohan, Videl with Goten and kid Trunks are called to fight. After Gohan and Videl defeat some random zombies, Frieza appears with an army. Fight does last exactly one blow from Gohan and Frieza is defeated and his army retreat and this is the last time we see Gohan and Videl until the end. Mister Satan makes small cameo beating down zombies. Meanwhile Goten with Trunks are about to face an ultimate Dragon Ball villain known for his villainous action through the series and it is ...... not Cell, it\'s fucking Adolf.Comment: Who though this was a good idea? I mean I like Adolf (in satiric sense!!!), but he has nothing to do with Dragon Ball series. Quick idea: Why weren\'t Red Ribbon army there, it would have made way more sense than Adolf.Goku confronts Janemba! 1st form Janemba persona is lazy copy of Majin Buu and if you disliked or hated Buu, then this villain won\'t be to your tastes likely. Luckily, his attacks and abilities are more interesting than Buu, so that\'s a nice plus. Meanwhile Paikuhan begins his own verbal fight with a barrier.Comment: Fight are okay, it would have been great if there weren\'t an idiot shouting his name every ten seconds. Anyway I don\'t really have any problem with this part. Shame for Paikuhan though, well at least he didn\'t end up like Gohan.25:00 - The endGoku fights final form Janemba! After Goku lands a solid blow, Janemba turns to his final form and all I can say is: cool! This form is absolutely cool, his abilities are cool, he\'s just so cool, but he\'s kinda Jiren the Gay (DevilArtemis Cell vs. Jiren part 2 reference). Janemba is extremely powerful, but he doesn\'t say a word. He\'s just a powerhouse, that sometimes screams or laughs with evil tone. The main difference between Janemba and Jiren are theirs abilities, while Janemba has unique and interesting abilities, Jiren has insane strength, just because.Comment: From visual and enjoyment view, this is a very good fight, Janemba has a lot of unique abilities that makes the fighting scene look fresh even with 291 DBZ episodes.Kids are fighting Nazi army! This is the reason, why we won\'t see any Gohan until the end and it is not worth it. Just to clarify, I am not someone, who hates nazis. I don\'t rate movie differently just because something politically controversial appears on the screen. Even though satiric, nazis has nothing to do with Dragon Ball series, Red Ribbon does, so what about excluding something completely alien to the series and instead add an evil organization, that was crushed by kid Goku in DB 1986?Comment: Not much else to add, really.Wild Vegeta appears! He tries to fight Janemba, because prince of all saiyans and get his ass kicked, after he ends up in mountains of needles and after some convincing, he agrees to do Fusion with Goku.Comment: It\'s okay. I don\'t really have anything to comment here, but...Instant Transmission to a place without living being? Just before Janemba bombards the mountain, Goku and Vegeta escape with IT to a cube without living being. This is deus ex machina. Instant transmission follows rules: You need to sense someone\'s ki to teleport to the place, so how did they escape?Finally Fuuuu... Are you joking me, they fucking failed? Are you telling me that the two elite saiyans, who knows each other for many years, who fought against themselves and beside each other cannot do this transformation on 1st try. Kids were funny, they are kids and you expect that they don\'t have required discipline to do it on a 1st try, but Goku and Vegeta? This scene exists to prolong this movie and to give us a cheap laugh and I am not fan of that.Gogeta vs Janemba! It\'s a quick work, Janemba doesn\'t stand a chance and Gogeta does (my No.1 favorite) finishing move, then we get some ""romantic"" farewell between  Goku and Vegeta and the end.Before I finally end this review, there are some really annoying points about this movie:1, Timelines: Vegeta is in the other (dead) world, but if this is between Majin Vegeta and final Genki Dama, then why does world looks so peaceful and Gohan, kids and everyone seems in such a normal manners prior to dead rising? The only mention of Buu is, when Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 and says only Buu seen it before. This movie does terrible job to place itself into DBZ timeline in this aspect.2, Where is Piccolo, Kuririn, Android 18, where is Buu? It is never explained, where was either our gang or Buu at this time. Piccolo cannot be absorbed, because Goten and Trunks would have been absorbed as well and stoned Piccolo doesn\'t make any sense either, because Vegeta would have been still alive.Summary: This is all I wanted to say. I like this movie, I really do and as much as I would like to ignore all the negatives, I cannot.Dragon Ball Z Movie: Fusion Reborn earns the strongest 6,99/10, meaning 6/10. I was and I am still divided about the rating, my opinion just flips back and forth between 6 and 7. Maybe I will revisit Fusion Reborn in future and redo the review.

I was and I am still divided about the rating, my opinion just flips back and forth between 6 and 7. Maybe I will revisit Fusion Reborn in future and redo the review. Until that time comes, take care and thank you for reading my review.', ""Let’s get straight to the point, this is without a doubt the most overrated original DBZ movie by a long shot. Even on my 4th watch, I fail to understand why people consider this the greatest Dragon Ball anything when it's just another boring story with admittedly good looking animation (at points). The only reason anyone likes this movie is because of one scene at the very end that barely lasts 3 minutes of screen time.STORYFusion Reborn has a pretty strong setup and introduction (as most of these Z movies tend to have). After the defeat of Majin Buu (presumably in a timeline where Goku...was not brought back to life by the Elder Kaioshin) a second Otherworld Tournament is taking place. Now I really enjoy the Otherworld, I think it’s Toriyama’s most visually striking and creative locations, (certainly more so than rocky wastelands or grassy plains!), and I find Paikuhan to be a pretty well done anime original character. As the fight between Goku and Paikuhan gets underway, we get an ominous voiceover telling of a great danger that will soon arise at the Otherworld Check-In station, followed by the 2nd Z opening We Gotta Power (a welcome addition, it is a great OP)After the short break, we are reintroduced to Lord Enma and the primary function of the Otherworld, to sort the good and evil spirits who pass through. If you watched DBZ, you should be familiar with how Otherworld works, but for those who don’t, what you really need to know for this story is that all evil souls are sent to Hell, where their souls are cleansed and reincarnated into the living world. In Hell we see this soul cleaner in action, holding a glass tank for all the “evil ki” to be dumped into (basically nuclear waste). A teenage demon operating as the tank clerk isn’t paying attention when suddenly the tank housing all of this evil ki clogs the machine and causes not just it, but all the other tanks to burst, releasing all the stored evil into Otherworld. The demon begins to transmogrify into a being called Janemba, which I guess is supposed to be a conglomeration of all the evil ki in Otherworld.Janemba’s distortion of the living world and the Otherworld is the primary conflict of the movie, and unfortunately this is where the interesting part ends. From here we get the typical Dragon Ball Z action that many know and love. Later in the film we see Freeza, as well as many of the movie villains, begin to attack Earth, and Gohan (as the Great Saiyaman) goes to stop them. This could’ve been a pretty interesting rematch, but unlike in DBS, Freeza was not able to train, and gets one shot by a Super Saiyan Gohan. There’s a lot of other weird antics we get to see on Earth, like Goten and Trunks fighting Hitler, but as outlandish and absurd as it is I can’t say I’m a fan.CHARACTERSAlright, starting off with the man of the hour Goku. Goku is Goku. There’s not really much to add, he’s pretty much the same as he’s always been. Goku trying to figure out how to fight fat Janemba was pretty fun to watch. That’s all I really have to sayPaikuhan: Earlier I praised Paikuhan as a well done anime original character, but unfortunately he doesn’t do much in this movie. I suppose he does figure out the primary weakness of the evil ki barriers (I just call them the jellybeans) floating around, as well as Janemba itself, being…shouting insults at it? It’s a silly concept that could really only fit in the world of Dragon Ball. At the end of the movie Pikkon tells Goku and Vegeta that he’ll hold off Janemba while they undergo fusion, but then proceeds to get absolutely washed by Janemba IMMEDIATELY, so that was pretty funny I guess.Vegeta: Oh boy Vegeta. Where to begin? I said at the beginning that this movie presumably takes place AFTER the Buu Saga ended. Why is this important? At the end of the Buu Saga, Vegeta has arguably his biggest character moment in the series in admitting that Goku is indeed number one, and from there we can assume that he starts to push his ego aside when it comes to a threat like Janemba. Well for those of you who think Super regressed Vegeta’s character, I point you to this movie. Vegeta is so goddamn insufferable it's honestly surprising. He insists that HE and HE ALONE will be the one to defeat that weakling Janemba WITHOUT the help of that clown Kakarrot, and outright REFUSES to do Fusion (even though he agreed to use the Potara before this movie happened). When he gets taken out by one of Janemba’s attacks, he whines that “even in the Next World I’m still inferior to Kakarrot.” This is honestly the worst depiction of Vegeta in the series to me, arguably worse than in the Tournament of Power.Janemba: Conceptually, Janemba isn’t bad at all. I’m one of the few people who doesn’t absolutely hate the Buu Saga, so I’m all for this force of nature kind of villain.

Moving on to…ANIMATIONI have to admit, this movie has some really good animation, especially Super Saiyan 3 Goku vs Janemba. There’s a reason that clip is one of the 2 things people post to tell you how good this movie is!! Seriously though, not just Fusion Reborn, but all the Z movies have moments that are really well animated. No complaints from me.SOUNDNot bad at all, typical of what you would expect from Dragon Ball performances. The soundtrack was pretty good but nothing super memorable.CONCLUSIONDragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn is a film with a strong premise and terrible execution. It relies on its good animation and cool moments to make up for an otherwise underwhelming story. Not the worst of the Z movies, but it’s certainly not the masterpiece that fans will try to say it is. was not brought back to life by the Elder Kaioshin) a second Otherworld Tournament is taking place. Now I really enjoy the Otherworld, I think it’s Toriyama’s most visually striking and creative locations, (certainly more so than rocky wastelands or grassy plains!), and I find Paikuhan to be a pretty well done anime original character. As the fight between Goku and Paikuhan gets underway, we get an ominous voiceover telling of a great danger that will soon arise at the Otherworld Check-In station, followed by the 2nd Z opening We Gotta Power (a welcome addition, it is a great OP)After the short break, we are reintroduced to Lord Enma and the primary function of the Otherworld, to sort the good and evil spirits who pass through. If you watched DBZ, you should be familiar with how Otherworld works, but for those who don’t, what you really need to know for this story is that all evil souls are sent to Hell, where their souls are cleansed and reincarnated into the living world. In Hell we see this soul cleaner in action, holding a glass tank for all the “evil ki” to be dumped into (basically nuclear waste). A teenage demon operating as the tank clerk isn’t paying attention when suddenly the tank housing all of this evil ki clogs the machine and causes not just it, but all the other tanks to burst, releasing all the stored evil into Otherworld. The demon begins to transmogrify into a being called Janemba, which I guess is supposed to be a conglomeration of all the evil ki in Otherworld.Janemba’s distortion of the living world and the Otherworld is the primary conflict of the movie, and unfortunately this is where the interesting part ends. From here we get the typical Dragon Ball Z action that many know and love. Later in the film we see Freeza, as well as many of the movie villains, begin to attack Earth, and Gohan (as the Great Saiyaman) goes to stop them. This could’ve been a pretty interesting rematch, but unlike in DBS, Freeza was not able to train, and gets one shot by a Super Saiyan Gohan. There’s a lot of other weird antics we get to see on Earth, like Goten and Trunks fighting Hitler, but as outlandish and absurd as it is I can’t say I’m a fan.CHARACTERSAlright, starting off with the man of the hour Goku. Goku is Goku. There’s not really much to add, he’s pretty much the same as he’s always been. Goku trying to figure out how to fight fat Janemba was pretty fun to watch. That’s all I really have to sayPaikuhan: Earlier I praised Paikuhan as a well done anime original character, but unfortunately he doesn’t do much in this movie. I suppose he does figure out the primary weakness of the evil ki barriers (I just call them the jellybeans) floating around, as well as Janemba itself, being…shouting insults at it? It’s a silly concept that could really only fit in the world of Dragon Ball. At the end of the movie Pikkon tells Goku and Vegeta that he’ll hold off Janemba while they undergo fusion, but then proceeds to get absolutely washed by Janemba IMMEDIATELY, so that was pretty funny I guess.Vegeta: Oh boy Vegeta. Where to begin? I said at the beginning that this movie presumably takes place AFTER the Buu Saga ended. Why is this important? At the end of the Buu Saga, Vegeta has arguably his biggest character moment in the series in admitting that Goku is indeed number one, and from there we can assume that he starts to push his ego aside when it comes to a threat like Janemba. Well for those of you who think Super regressed Vegeta’s character, I point you to this movie. Vegeta is so goddamn insufferable it's honestly surprising. He insists that HE and HE ALONE will be the one to defeat that weakling Janemba WITHOUT the help of that clown Kakarrot, and outright REFUSES to do Fusion (even though he agreed to use the Potara before this movie happened). When he gets taken out by one of Janemba’s attacks, he whines that “even in the Next World I’m still inferior to Kakarrot.” This is honestly the worst depiction of Vegeta in the series to me, arguably worse than in the Tournament of Power.Janemba: Conceptually, Janemba isn’t bad at all. I’m one of the few people who doesn’t absolutely hate the Buu Saga, so I’m all for this force of nature kind of villain. He has a shit ton of cool abilities and tricks up his sleeve that keep the fight scenes pretty engaging, one of the few things I liked about this movie.The other characters don’t really have enough screen time for me to make any meaningful comments on them.

I happened to catch this one and it's probably the only Dragon Ball Z movie I've actually seen all the way through up to this point not counting abridged versions. So it gets  a review.I think the story of DBZ movies fall squarely into that anime movie non-canon territory of barely having any relation to the show it's about, but that's fine for a show that barely has a plot to begin with. The Legacy of Goku 3 game on GBA actually managed...to fit the story of the movie into the plot somewhat. You just have to ignore a lot of sequence of events and do some head cannon to make it work. That was actually where I was familiar with the story such as it is. I had watched my brother play those games way back when and now I was seeing the movie it was based on on TV and that's probably why I tuned in for the whole thing.But yeah the story is basically there's a new strong guy, go fight him. Like the rest of Dragon Ball. Doesn't really need to be more complicated but they mix it up a bit by adding a new fusion to the mix. The fusion is a slightly different named rehash of Vegetto but it was still cool. The fight scenes themselves were cool. The villain was cool. It was all very cool.But when the best thing you have to say for a show is that it was cool it probably didn't have much of an impact otherwise. I'm all for it on one level but when you think about what makes a show really great or stand the test of time it isn't just cool fight scenes. So 7 out of 10 it has a little something for everyone. to fit the story of the movie into the plot somewhat.

The concept of how the villain comes about is interesting, but ultimately it's not a very interesting character outside of the design. The best part of the movie is the environment the character creates, and the weird otherworldly powers. The fighting is okay, and it's good to see SS3 actually be used for a while.There's not much to the villain as a character, and at some point toward the end some of the comedy felt forced and went on too long, it would've been better without it. I also think the bit with hitler went on too long...and wasn't very interesting to begin with. If they needed filler fights on the side, there were much more interesting things they could've done that would've made more sense than infinite tanks. The end of the fight is anticlimactic, but the end of the movie is good. Overall I'd say it's okay, with some high points. It's worth giving a try. and wasn't very interesting to begin with.

The best one by a really wide margin. It's utterly silly stuff, but it doesn't attempt to take itself seriously like some of the worse movies in this extremely long series. This is classic comedy-action stuff that early Dragon Ball was famous for, just with the ridiculous over-the-top powers that all the characters have at this point in the series.It's a tough battle between this and Bio-Broly for my favorite so far. On one hand, Bio-Broly has a more cohesive, interesting story, while Fusion Reborn is fairly stitched together and has a villain so paper-thin that he...literally doesn't speak or have a motive. On the other hand, that villain is also the best villain the Dragon Ball movies have had yet-- possibly the coolest in the entire series, aside from Picccolo and maybe Frieza. The dude has reality-warping powers and uses a sword and it's friggin' awesome. After trudging through the banality of the Buu Saga in the TV show for a couple weeks, I am so glad to have gotten to find a villain that's actually fun to watch.The fight animation is pretty incredible, which is typical for these movies. However, for some unexplained reason, while the stuff in Hell is really well-animated with gorgeous art direction, the stuff on Earth is given a completely different style, with the characters all getting thick outlines and much worse animation quality, as if it were made for the TV series and then pasted into the movie all of a sudden. I kind of like the art style in these silly scenes, especially when they're fighting friggin' Hitler, but it doesn't mesh well.If you want to encapsulate Dragon Ball Z all in one movie, Fusion Reborn is probably it. It's wacky, fast-paced, nearly-plotless, super pretty, and has a sense of style you won't find anywhere else. I wouldn't suggest watching this without any prior knowledge, but you can probably go in not having seen the show in decades and still come out with a smile on your face. literally doesn't speak or have a motive.

I wanted to watch this after seeing the goku vs janemba clip on YouTube. I thought the whole movie would be like that but no, this movie is unfunny, stupid and childish. I love dbz, I love some of the movies. But this was terrible. It feels like the target audience is 3 year old. I'm genuinely surprised most dbz fans love this movie because to me it was insultingly stupid. But then again anime fans aren't exactly known for liking high quality.

""Fusion Reborn"", being one of the last ones as far as I can tell, manages to hit a new low.I must have missed something in one of the earlier Dragon Ball Z movies that I didn\'t watch, for in this one, all the characters from the old generation such as Goku and Vegeta appear to be dead.

White Album 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2,"['Music Room 2. It\'s the most unassuming of the three that populate Houjou High. Music Room 3 in the building across has the benefit of being bigger and newer, and the adjacent Music Room 1\'s been sectioned for everyone save those enlisted in the musical curriculum. Nevertheless, it\'s where Haruki Kitahara spends his time practicing “White Album” by Yuki Morikawa on his guitar. And out of nowhere, from the adjacent room, from the rooftop, a sound has him spellbound. A piano so soothing, a voice so transfixing, plays, sings to the song\'s melody. And here is where the story of White Album 2 takes off,...where he has to know who.An adaptation of a Leaf and Aquaplus visual novel White Album 2: Introductory Chapter, White Album 2 itself was produced by Satelight, directed by relative dark horse Masaomi Ando, and scripted by Fumiaki Maruto, who was also the original scenario writer for the source material. A qualification before going any further is that outside sharing the same universe, using the same name, and borrowing  a few of the same songs, this show is completely unrelated to its predecessor, White Album. Do not expect the same characters or story from then, which I\'ve heard from general consensus is less than favorable, to be present here.Another qualification since this particular plot device\'s the bane of a number of viewers: this show is driven under the auspices of a love triangle. Feel free to refrain from watching if you absolutely can\'t stand them. This love triangle, however, does something somewhat different from the usual one male, two female dynamic. Haruki Kitahara, Setsuna Ogiso, and Kazusa Touma are friends. The best of friends. Friends of the dearest kind. The viewer\'s left with rather maddening issues, monogamy withstanding. How can the guy pursue one girl and avoid hurting the other? How can one girl pursue the guy and leave the other unscathed? How can we all remain close? Each main character wants to have their cake and eat it too, yet the show makes the reality clear: You can\'t. The heart wants what it wants when it\'s found it, despite any one party\'s attempts toward the contrary, and to deny it that when it\'s within grasp, combined with each character\'s own baggage, is tantamount to torture, agony of the most existential kind.The agony\'s even more poignant when they\'re written as more than just fictional characters. For the female leads, it wouldn\'t be incorrect to group them under a certain personality, a certain archetype, the warm, popular school idol and the cold, aloof musical prodigy. And yet, they\'re more than that, never relegated to the distinction of mere stereotypes. They may be extroverts or introverts, but no one girl\'s one absolute. No one girl\'s simply the life of the party, just as no one girl\'s simply a shut-in. Neither is unconditionally anti-social, and both are, by their own past experiences, insecure. Loneliness is an issue for all, manifesting as much in a crowded class as in an empty room. Not one girl is perfect, their masks, their mischief, their indecisiveness, cowardice, impulsiveness, selfishness... they all show, despite themselves and their counterintuitive efforts to preserve the status quo. More than just characters, they\'re people, female, adolescent, and flawed through and through. And for the male lead? Outside of his sex, he\'s no exception, especially towards the second half.If what you seek out of this show is your idealistic conception of what a romance should entail, then read well: that\'s not going to happen here. The ordeals are messy, frustrating, not because they\'re emotionally manipulative, but because they\'re real, because the characters, being who they are, are complex, conflicted, and real themselves. It\'s what would happen in this unextractable web of complexities and contradictions of “I wills,” “I won\'ts,” and “It hurts,” where cutting one thread leads to the mangling of another.Then there are those little touches, subtle, never exaggerated, that give these characters sincerity as well as charm. Overly sweetened coffee black, for instance, to match my craving for black milk tea in the morning for every morning.And the show exploits these touches and others, subtleties of all kinds and layers, scattered, embedded, and incorporated into the narrative to outstanding degrees. Barring the first episode, this show\'s direction and script is all about subtly, about inference, of “show” and not simply “tell.” Where the camera pans, zooms, cuts, and lingers. When the facades of facial expressions slip into distress and recover to overcompensate, the eyes, the lips, the bangs. The deliberate tones in lighting, or the selective shades of lack thereof, complemented by the beautiful looking set pieces. The conversations, highly nuanced, roundabout, indirect, and, when it\'s called for, blistering. The use of flashbacks before the show\'s start, combined with the retracing of new and carefully omitted ground within past scenes at the most heart-wrenching of moments, the foreshadowing, and even the character of the character designs and clothes. Barring Episode 1, with masterful strokes of minimalist direction, interwoven seamlessly and purposefully with the music, whether bgm or insert, no one direction is ever oversold. They perfectly illustrate the personalities and emotional states of the cast at any given moment, whether they are bubbling underneath the surface or blasting corkscrew out of it. The best part, and perhaps the most refreshing part, is that it takes its time to do all of this, so that every form of direction feels natural.The last of three qualifications, this show has a sex scene, one without shots of anything particularly precious, but it\'s easy to infer what\'s happening. That being said, it\'s completely within taste, substantially enhances the narrative, and subscribes to a rather waning view that sex is emotional consummation rather than just physical titillation. Also, adolescent intercourse does happen in the real world, and I personally congratulate the staff for including it in, but if you happen to be allergic to sex scenes regardless, then you\'re going to have trouble fully enjoying the show.Music\'s, unsurprisingly, a strong element in this series. Outside of tackling the technicalities or philosophies behind notes, though practice does make perfect, the series does everything else in exploiting the medium to create meaning in the music. Outside noise fillers and mood setters, they express powerful sentiments that put the thoughts and actions of characters within context, especially with Touma, whose feelings unseen and unspoken, given her reserved nature, bleeds into her piano pieces. It adds another layer of “show” through melodies and harmonies, and even the lyrics of the songs that have them are loaded with meaning in hindsight.And then there\'s the OP, “A Love That Cannot Be.” Known in romaji as “Todokanai Koi 13” by Rena Uehara in one track and Madoka Yonezawa, Ogiso\'s seiyuu, in another, its vocals, combined with electronic keyboard, electric guitar, and a synthetic backtrack, rocks and croons of a passionate nostalgia, of happier times in younger days past caked in a film of melancholy. The visual detail\'s not quite Kyoto Animation or P.A. Works standards, but it\'s still really good, and the visual content corresponds excellently with the music, blurs, glare, overlays, and the waning light from sunsets. It also features visually vague moments that occur in the show that contribute to this aesthetic, but aren\'t really spoilers since they\'re only fully significant in, once again, hindsight. It\'s best thought as a bittersweet reminisce by an adult of his or her turbulent youth. White Album 2 is winter-themed, and snow can be beautiful, if chilling. In addition, the transitions are handled with a quiet, yet powerful mix of grace and dignity. It also attempts to do this interesting thing with omitting Touma\'s face until Episode 3 to reflect a certain in-show direction, which would have been clever had it not been compromised by something in Episode 1.The ED for Episodes 3-6 and 8-10 (Episode 7 doesn\'t have an ED), “Sayonara no Koto,” or “Goodbye” also by Uehara, flows in the same thematic vein, with recaps of scenes of the episode now past, an evolution from a delicate, yet noble instrumental chorus of electric synthetics, keyboard, classic guitar, violin, then vocals, then electric bass, then drumset, then electric guitar, before it reaches a climax with a vigorous and progressive rock beat, and, finally, settling back down to its quiet origins. Episodes 2, 11, and 12 have their own Uehara EDs, “closing 13,” “After All ~Tsuzuru Omoi~,” or “After All ~Writing Down My Feelings~” and “Twinkle Snow 13” respectively are also great in their own ways but, for the sake of brevity, I\'ll refrain from their music other than saying they accompany rather significant moments with a certain someone. And after all, they\'re better enjoyed in context than not. That goes double for the insert concert songs, ""White Album,"" ""Sound of Destiny,"" and the OP, since, outside of singing, they contain some really nice surprises involving solos.Episode 1. It\'s not a bad episode, all in all; in fact, I think its conclusion was very well choreographed. Still, compared to its successive sisters, this episode has a couple of things that stick out like a sore thumb. There\'s a questionable amount of exposition within it that I think was a bit superfluous. A few carefully chosen words especially towards the end, coupled with the music, would have been better for the mood, but by far the biggest concern I have was the beginning, where the show previewed portions of the concert from Episode 7. I suspect it was supposed to be kind of a hook, but, returning to an earlier instance of direction which could have been clever, the omission of Touma\'s facial features seemed to be intended as a means for suspense that also worked in character, given her cold, aloof exterior. While it may have been no surprise that she would play one of the center role, what she looked like would, had it not been spoiled earlier by that flash forward.He has to know, climbing the stairs to the roof, treading the outer walls of the school from stories high to get into the adjacent room\'s open window. The rest is history.It\'s been an unparalleled experience to have watched this show and I sincerely hope after reading this review, everyone who\'s interested watch it as well. It is one of the most finely told romantic dramas I have ever had the pleasure to see, and while the ending was conclusive, since this is only the Introductory Chapter, the story\'s not even over yet.I give White Album 2 a 10 out of 10. where he has to know who.An adaptation of a Leaf and Aquaplus visual novel White Album 2: Introductory Chapter, White Album 2 itself was produced by Satelight, directed by relative dark horse Masaomi Ando, and scripted by Fumiaki Maruto, who was also the original scenario writer for the source material.

The visual detail\'s not quite Kyoto Animation or P.A. Works standards, but it\'s still really good, and the visual content corresponds excellently with the music, blurs, glare, overlays, and the waning light from sunsets. It also features visually vague moments that occur in the show that contribute to this aesthetic, but aren\'t really spoilers since they\'re only fully significant in, once again, hindsight. It\'s best thought as a bittersweet reminisce by an adult of his or her turbulent youth. White Album 2 is winter-themed, and snow can be beautiful, if chilling. In addition, the transitions are handled with a quiet, yet powerful mix of grace and dignity. It also attempts to do this interesting thing with omitting Touma\'s face until Episode 3 to reflect a certain in-show direction, which would have been clever had it not been compromised by something in Episode 1.The ED for Episodes 3-6 and 8-10 (Episode 7 doesn\'t have an ED), “Sayonara no Koto,” or “Goodbye” also by Uehara, flows in the same thematic vein, with recaps of scenes of the episode now past, an evolution from a delicate, yet noble instrumental chorus of electric synthetics, keyboard, classic guitar, violin, then vocals, then electric bass, then drumset, then electric guitar, before it reaches a climax with a vigorous and progressive rock beat, and, finally, settling back down to its quiet origins. Episodes 2, 11, and 12 have their own Uehara EDs, “closing 13,” “After All ~Tsuzuru Omoi~,” or “After All ~Writing Down My Feelings~” and “Twinkle Snow 13” respectively are also great in their own ways but, for the sake of brevity, I\'ll refrain from their music other than saying they accompany rather significant moments with a certain someone. And after all, they\'re better enjoyed in context than not. That goes double for the insert concert songs, ""White Album,"" ""Sound of Destiny,"" and the OP, since, outside of singing, they contain some really nice surprises involving solos.Episode 1. It\'s not a bad episode, all in all; in fact, I think its conclusion was very well choreographed. Still, compared to its successive sisters, this episode has a couple of things that stick out like a sore thumb. There\'s a questionable amount of exposition within it that I think was a bit superfluous. A few carefully chosen words especially towards the end, coupled with the music, would have been better for the mood, but by far the biggest concern I have was the beginning, where the show previewed portions of the concert from Episode 7. I suspect it was supposed to be kind of a hook, but, returning to an earlier instance of direction which could have been clever, the omission of Touma\'s facial features seemed to be intended as a means for suspense that also worked in character, given her cold, aloof exterior. While it may have been no surprise that she would play one of the center role, what she looked like would, had it not been spoiled earlier by that flash forward.He has to know, climbing the stairs to the roof, treading the outer walls of the school from stories high to get into the adjacent room\'s open window. The rest is history.It\'s been an unparalleled experience to have watched this show and I sincerely hope after reading this review, everyone who\'s interested watch it as well. It is one of the most finely told romantic dramas I have ever had the pleasure to see, and while the ending was conclusive, since this is only the Introductory Chapter, the story\'s not even over yet.I give White Album 2 a 10 out of 10.', ""Visual novel adaptations have always had a notorious reputation in anime communities. Whether it be issues with pacing, narration, or some nonlinear route structure, these adaptations suffer from a variety of heated complaints from fans of the original source material, sometimes even as to have their very existence denied.Thankfully, White Album 2 is not one of those adaptations.Adapted from the ~introductory chapter~ segment of the bestselling Leaf visual novel of the same name, White Album 2 (henceforth referred to as “WA2”) manages to retain a lot of the strengths of the source material while approaching it in a different, but appropriate, fashion. It is important...to note that, despite the title, WA2 is not a direct sequel to the first White Album, related only by setting and a number of references, so viewing of the first series is not required.With that said, WA2 is, simply put, a romance. To be more specific, it is a love triangle. It begins with a student named Kitahara Haruki trying to revive his high school’s light music club. In doing so, he eventually finds himself involved with the two girls who join the club: Ogiso Setsuna and Touma Kazusa.  Certainly, this is a fairly basic set-up for the genre. WA2’s romance is played out in a straight and down-to-earth manner, and its strengths lie with the subdued execution of that romance.  In a genre filled with stories that often resort to predictable archetypes and tropes to drive themselves forward, WA2 avoids the pitfalls of many other titles by doing away with the excessive melodrama and roundabout confessions. It does not strive beyond the boundaries of its genre, and thus certainly cannot be compared to shows that feature Titans being screamed at.Consider the very beginning of the show, which reveals some key events that will occur at the end of the anime. In this brief sequence, viewers will be made aware of the kind of road that WA2 is set on. Both readers familiar with the source material and newcomers may initially find this to be a questionable directorial decision. However, in the grand scheme of things, WA2 is not focused on the fact that these events occur, but on how the characters and their relationships caused these events. After all, there are only so many ways a romance can turn out without treading on the grounds of bizarre or convoluted narratives. In general, the genre should focus on the chemistry between the characters and how they deal with the emotions of love.And the characters are undoubtedly central to the romance in WA2. The characters are not dolls made to fulfill a given role, but believable people with distinct personalities. In particular, the main lead Haruki seems like an excellent student, yet so obviously flawed. His altruistic personality leads him into making many unintentional mistakes, and he is unable to avoid the problems he is causing despite being aware of them. And just like Haruki, Setsuna and Kazusa also try to avoid the problems in their own way, but inevitably end up hurting the others in the process. These characters make sensibly human mistakes that some viewers will resonate strongly with, while others may find themselves incredibly frustrated. The notion that viewers opt for a favorite heroine need not apply when the characters can be both endearing and detestable. The alleged title of “best girl” might as well be given to Haruki.Of course, much of the characterization is owned to the wonderful script written by Fumiaki Maruto, the original scenario writer for WA2.  The characters and their interactions are brought to life through clear and purposeful dialogue. The lines illustrate the chemistry between the characters and the gradual build-up of romantic tension as the show progresses. As an adaptation, the script is very much condensed to serve time constraints in the animated form, and Haruki’s insightful narration is lost. Thankfully, this is substituted by visual expressions and gestures used by the characters to show certain emotions rather than tell them. Setsuna’s physical distancing during some conversations in the earlier episodes, for example, indicate her perceptions toward Kazusa. In many cases, this use of storytelling adds to the scenes, improving upon the original. On the other hand, some lines in the script are altered, perhaps changing the nuance of the original scenes. A particular example of this is with the scene that introduces Kazusa, in which she speaks with an angry tone as opposed to a confused one.Despite the show’s use of visual storytelling, the technical aspects of the animation suffer from a number of problems, particularly due to the production by Satelight. While the character designs themselves are arguably an improvement over the original's, quality mishaps are abound regarding the anatomy of the characters in some shots. There is also a general lack of “liveliness” in the animation, resulting in dull movements and stills. A notable offender of this is when the concert scene occurs in the story, and repetitive shots of the school’s scenery are seen as music is playing. Moreover, a few other important scenes feature questionable fanservice shots and odd angles, intruding on the mood of these scenes.Fortunately, the aural aspects of WA2 make up for the mishaps in the animation. The soundtrack, featuring tracks that are played by an actual pianist, really complement the nature of the show, more so due to the focus on music. Dramatic sequences are accentuated with powerful yet delicate melodies, such as the instrumental of the aptly-named ending theme, “Sayonara no Koto.” Vocal songs are also prominent, reinforcing the show’s themes through their lyrics.  Ultimately, the music is an integral part of the experience in WA2.And the experience is certainly something else. Despite being only a prologue to a larger story, the anime adaptation of WA2 offers a sense of completeness that most adaptations, and anime series in general, should strive for. It is faithful as an adaptation, yet carries its own unique charm. It has a fairly simple premise, yet goes much deeper than that with its characters.  The season of White Album has gracefully passed us by, but it won’t be forgotten so easily. to note that, despite the title, WA2 is not a direct sequel to the first White Album, related only by setting and a number of references, so viewing of the first series is not required.With that said, WA2 is, simply put, a romance.

The season of White Album has gracefully passed us by, but it won’t be forgotten so easily."", 'Have you ever fallen in love?I did. I still am.White Album 2 is set after 10 years of the events that occurred in the original White Album. Despite the title being White Album 2, the story isn\'t a sequel but is pretty much a standalone or what you could say an alternate setting which has minimal relevance to its predecessor. The only apparent connection are the songs which were sung in the first anime and the people who wrote them, and that it is set in the same world. In simple words, you don\'t need to watch the first anime to understand this and...I would not recommend in doing so since I find the first one to be the complete opposite of what this is - a true masterpiece.The story of White Album 2 is pretty straightforward.The entire story revolves around the three main characters namely Kitahara, Touma, and Ogisa. These three are so relatable that I\'m pretty sure some of us could even picture themselves living and experiencing the different social dillemmas each character is facing - they\'re as real as it gets. At first they might look common, typical or plain but later on as the characters reveal more and more of their personalities and problems, they\'ll also grow on you. With the intent of being good friends, a simple admiration turned into something more but the intrusion of another led to a love triangle conflict without even realizing it. The story grows beyond from here but as much as I would like to tell more, I would rather have you watch it as it would only spoil all the fun.People tend to do crazy things when in love.As far as beyond what logic could measure, humans would do anything when it comes to love. Love is such an extraordinary phenomenon that people would do something they normally won\'t do. Trust, betrayal, and even sacrificing one\'s good for the sake of another - as long as love is present, there is so much an ordinary person could do yet there\'s so much to lose. That\'s what I find so great in this anime; it depicts real human emotions at its finest, and at its worst.For a mature and a serious drama/romance anime, the animation is as fitting as it should be. The characters and the backgrounds are very well drawn, the movements are fluid, and the shadings too are very well applied. Not only is the animation good on its own but it also compliments the feel to its amazing music.As one would expect from a musical anime, the music is really good. In fact the soundtracks are absolutely breathtaking from the first episode and it never did go any less up to the last. The lyrics of the songs completely fit the atmosphere adding up to the emotional feeling of the scenario they were on. The voice actors too did their roles very well, might it be just a simple conversation or was it through singing; you can really feel the emotions flowing.At its shining moments, the drama intensifies and the confrontations would make your heart skip a beat. You\'d even start to wonder why is it so wrong when it\'s supposed to feel right, or the opposite. But if you were a person in love, you would know why. After all has been said and done, I could understand why some would feel a bitter aftertaste but let\'s face it - because even in real life, not everything goes the way we want it to.White Album 2 is such an emotional rollercoaster. At times you\'ll find yourself smiling along with the characters, and at some you\'ll find yourself crying. You\'ll be totally engrossed that you\'ll find yourself glued onto the screen wondering what would they do next then asking yourself if you would have done the same thing. But by then you won\'t have even realized that you\'re already teary-eyed because of how you care and sympathize for the characters that have already grown on you. It is just that good.I\'ll be honest. I enjoyed every single bit of this anime. But I guess ""enjoyed"" is an understatement since I pretty much fell in love with this anime. And know what, people do crazy things when they\'re in love just like what White Album 2 made me do - to once again write a review in which I swore I would never ever do.

And know what, people do crazy things when they\'re in love just like what White Album 2 made me do - to once again write a review in which I swore I would never ever do.', ""White Album 2 is one of those series many people tend to overlook these days because for a variety of obvious reasons. Some of them might be prior experience with other “White Album” franchise anime that left with mediocre impressions. Then, there’s also a belief that anime series based off of visual novel tends to be the inferior brand. Finally, maybe it could just be the synopsis or premise of the show. It looks simple, tends to be simple, and it is simple. But what you might be surprised at is that White Album 2 is not what it appears to be. Rather than going...through a bunch of stereotypical ideas wrapped in a loop of cliches, White Album 2 actually jumps out of that zone on various occasions.Take first note that White Album 2 is not a sequel of the original series. The characters from White Album do not make appearance nor their story connect in any way. Instead, the show stands out as a standalone series based off the visual novel of the same name developed by Leaf. The series chronicles the lives of three young individuals as they become a trio of close friends during their last semester of high school. It’s their final chances to make some memories they won’t forget and chances don’t come easily.The series takes place in high school but focuses it at its ending stages or rather, the final semester. There’s a pressure of futuristic opportunities and decisions to make often during these times. Think of it this way: when you were in high school, have you ever thought what you wanted to be or what you wanted to do after you graduate? For Haruki Kitahara, he can be described as one of those individuals without an exact goal in mind. What he does have in mind though is his ambition to play at the annual school festival. The problem? They need members for the light music club to accomplish this task. This is where our two heroines comes in from the story.First, there’s Setsuna Ogiso, a popular girl at school known well for her beauty and talent in singing. It’s easy for people to make friends with Setsuna because of her bright personality. In fact, many of the times we see her throughout the series is where she is compassionate towards others. Setsuna also possesses the talents of a singer especially after Haruki discovers her on the rooftop one faithful day. The way she sings is majestic, beautiful, and those moments defines her character. On the other hand, there’s Kazusa Touma. Unlike Setsuna, she is usually cold, aloof, and distant towards others. This is evidenced by her hobby of skipping classes and falling asleep that often results in scolding from her professors. But if there’s one thing she does care is music. Music, a word that has transformed words into a form of art and revolutionized entertainment, is what Touma holds dearly to her life. With a common idea in mind, these three characters are the core of the show that define White Album 2.Characterization plays an imperative role throughout the show so it’s important to pay attention to them. Haruki seems to be your typical high school student without much to stand out. He is friendly towards others, honest, accepting, loving, generous, and determined. He might not be a celebrity but Haruki isn’t just a guy that looks around to goof off at school or hit on girls. Instead, he truly cares about his friends and be there when they need the most. On another scale, Setsuna is like a walking billboard of radiance that attracts others. But if we look at her carefully, there’s a sense of insecurity coming out from her character. The smile she wears sometimes seems to formulate a mask that hides her true emotions. It’s not that Setsuna wants to be selfish but some of her decisions tends to be an act based on herself and what she believes in. Finally, Touma is like a stone of hieroglyphics that is hard to decipher. No one really knows what she’s thinking because of her cold personality. It is evidenced that her childhood can be defined as lonely and solitary so that could be part of the reason that made her whom she is today. Luckily, Touma’s love for music defines her character in another way, as a girl that embraces the art and tries to perfect it as a passion. White Album 2’s main characters all get their spotlights and screen time that examines their personalities, lives, and development as they finish their finish year at high school.The story of White Album 2 might take a while to get used to. I’m referring to the rather slow pacing especially in the beginning as we get to know our main protagonists. Taking place in a high school life setting also places the story in a way that is relatable because of the focus on future, struggles at school, and relationships. The story doesn’t drive off with odd plot holes. Instead, it is quite straight forward that is easily comprehensible. It also offers anime-only viewers a way of predicting future events as each episodes unfolds itself. The series also defines itself as a romance show so it’s interesting to theorize who Haruki will choose as his partner for an everlasting relationship. It can be perturbing at some instances but can also create excitement especially for our main characters at the apex of their school lives. Yes, what I’m referring to here is their dreams and ambitions.It’s obvious that Touma is passionate about music. Thanks to her skills with the piano, electric guitar, and other instruments, she stands out as a prominent star of the series. The core of their school life doesn’t come easily as there’s an old saying that goes ‘practice makes perfect’. This concept generally applies to Haruki as he lacks the skills of a child prodigy. What he does have though is a determined heart and spirit to tackle any obstacle through. His dedication fortifies a will that seems to spread like an inspiration to others such as Touma. Setsuna’s skills of singing also becomes the voice of White Album 2. This only defines half the story however as White Album 2 later on takes on a route of that brings forth more emotional impact. It chronicles the relationships of our main characters that is a mixed bag of love, loyalty, respect, and sorrow.While White Album 2 remains refreshing, relatable, and realistic, the show suffers some problems as well. There’s a lack of focus on supporting characters as most of them fades behind the scenes. Most of them plays little roles other than being introduced that becomes part of the cast only on some occasions. The story itself also becomes a bit predictable on various occasions. There’s also some fan service that can be distracting and forceful. Haruki also seems to be portrayed as Mr. Nice Guy with nothing special in particular. I also find a few of his decisions to be irrational and seemingly absurd. Some events also comes as abrupt and hard to sympathize with in terms of development especially involving relationships. There’s also a problem with narrative as the show focuses on three characters but none of them goes through the story by their point of view.Artwork wise, White Album 2 is realistic and designed to look as well as feel like a slice of life. The character designs fits most of their roles well. The outfit designs during the light music club’s debut are fashionable and artistic. (Although more embarrassing in some ways for Touma) But taken on a technical perspective, the artwork is realistic enough that camera angles focuses on each movement of the club when they play music. Examples of this include Touma’s finger movements on the piano, Haruki’s flow with his guitar, or the way Setsuna sings her heart out at her fans. There’s no doubt that realism is strong in the artwork department with a peculiar sense of normalcy.The music of White Album 2 is an embodiment that defines our main characters’ passion and unites them as a group. The OST is calm and pleasant throughout the series but it’s the songs that truly shines. Songs such as White Album, Sayonara no Koto, and the OP song Todokanai Koi '13' defines the show’s style at its finest form. It feels like a juggernaut of feelings poured into the lyrics that makes the show stands out. Voice acting wise, I give praise to Hitomi Nabatame (Strawberry Panic: Shizuma, Chaos;Head: Aoi, Gantz: Kei Kishimoto) as her role of Kazuma Touma. Her voice fits perfectly with her mature and cold voice that defines the character that Touma is.So White Album 2 is probably a show that would stand as something a lot of people might overlooked. It could be the fact that the anime didn’t have much expectations based from the synopsis, preview, or experiences from the previous franchise. As a dark horse, White Album 2 is one of those series that realistic with a fusion of music, relationships, and characterization explored in ways that is surprisingly interesting. The story might feel a bit slow and predictable sequences will pop up. However, patience is a key to unlock the satisfaction of this show. And once you open that door, you’ll discover the true essence of White Album 2. through a bunch of stereotypical ideas wrapped in a loop of cliches, White Album 2 actually jumps out of that zone on various occasions.Take first note that White Album 2 is not a sequel of the original series.

It also offers anime-only viewers a way of predicting future events as each episodes unfolds itself. The series also defines itself as a romance show so it’s interesting to theorize who Haruki will choose as his partner for an everlasting relationship. It can be perturbing at some instances but can also create excitement especially for our main characters at the apex of their school lives. Yes, what I’m referring to here is their dreams and ambitions.It’s obvious that Touma is passionate about music. Thanks to her skills with the piano, electric guitar, and other instruments, she stands out as a prominent star of the series. The core of their school life doesn’t come easily as there’s an old saying that goes ‘practice makes perfect’. This concept generally applies to Haruki as he lacks the skills of a child prodigy. What he does have though is a determined heart and spirit to tackle any obstacle through. His dedication fortifies a will that seems to spread like an inspiration to others such as Touma. Setsuna’s skills of singing also becomes the voice of White Album 2. This only defines half the story however as White Album 2 later on takes on a route of that brings forth more emotional impact. It chronicles the relationships of our main characters that is a mixed bag of love, loyalty, respect, and sorrow.While White Album 2 remains refreshing, relatable, and realistic, the show suffers some problems as well. There’s a lack of focus on supporting characters as most of them fades behind the scenes. Most of them plays little roles other than being introduced that becomes part of the cast only on some occasions. The story itself also becomes a bit predictable on various occasions. There’s also some fan service that can be distracting and forceful. Haruki also seems to be portrayed as Mr. Nice Guy with nothing special in particular. I also find a few of his decisions to be irrational and seemingly absurd. Some events also comes as abrupt and hard to sympathize with in terms of development especially involving relationships. There’s also a problem with narrative as the show focuses on three characters but none of them goes through the story by their point of view.Artwork wise, White Album 2 is realistic and designed to look as well as feel like a slice of life. The character designs fits most of their roles well. The outfit designs during the light music club’s debut are fashionable and artistic. (Although more embarrassing in some ways for Touma) But taken on a technical perspective, the artwork is realistic enough that camera angles focuses on each movement of the club when they play music. Examples of this include Touma’s finger movements on the piano, Haruki’s flow with his guitar, or the way Setsuna sings her heart out at her fans. There’s no doubt that realism is strong in the artwork department with a peculiar sense of normalcy.The music of White Album 2 is an embodiment that defines our main characters’ passion and unites them as a group. The OST is calm and pleasant throughout the series but it’s the songs that truly shines. Songs such as White Album, Sayonara no Koto, and the OP song Todokanai Koi '13' defines the show’s style at its finest form. It feels like a juggernaut of feelings poured into the lyrics that makes the show stands out. Voice acting wise, I give praise to Hitomi Nabatame (Strawberry Panic: Shizuma, Chaos;Head: Aoi, Gantz: Kei Kishimoto) as her role of Kazuma Touma. Her voice fits perfectly with her mature and cold voice that defines the character that Touma is.So White Album 2 is probably a show that would stand as something a lot of people might overlooked. It could be the fact that the anime didn’t have much expectations based from the synopsis, preview, or experiences from the previous franchise. As a dark horse, White Album 2 is one of those series that realistic with a fusion of music, relationships, and characterization explored in ways that is surprisingly interesting. The story might feel a bit slow and predictable sequences will pop up. However, patience is a key to unlock the satisfaction of this show. And once you open that door, you’ll discover the true essence of White Album 2."", ""Two's a plenty, three's a crowd. Or so the saying goes.People like to say friendship lasts forever. They want to believe that things will never change between themselves and the ones closest to their hearts during their teenage years. However, when multiple men and women grow close enough to each other there eventually comes a point where life-changing decisions must be made. And if your social circuit happens to consist of one man and two women... then odds are that someone is going to have to be left out.White Album 2 is a rare anime in the sense that it is a story about actual...true love in a mature sense. It is also highly realistic and tangible, which is a strangely unusual thing to find in today's anime industry. Above all however... it is simply beautiful.If you want a short summary of what White Album 2 has to offer then here's a quick rundown of it. Otherwise the full review follows below:- One of the most faithful visual novel adaptations you'll ever find- Close to perfect pacing, not a single scene feels needless yet nothing feels like it's missing either- Very mature and realistic take on romance- Lots of actual romantic progression and relationship development- Quite serious emotional drama, this can either result in it being found tear-jerking or a bit cliché depending on who you ask- No stereotypical anime character tropes are utilized, everyone in White Album 2 feels like a real person- No moe, ecchi or other fanservice-esque elements- Very high-level and emotional voice acting- Heavy emphasis on music: the main characters together make up their high school's light music club and Setsuna's voice actress sing many of the series tracks (beautifully at that I have to say)- While the ending isn't conclusive since only the first chapter of the visual novel is adapted, it still leaves off on a very satisfying note, and therefore the anime works totally fine as a standalone product even for anime-only viewersWhite Album 2 is one of the absolute most critically acclaimed visual novels of all time, currently sitting at #2 on Erogamescape and #5 on VNDB among other things at the time of writing this, and it is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. This anime does not cover anywhere near the entire story however, but rather solely the ~Introductory Chapter~ which makes up roughly the first 15% of it. Now you may find the notion of an adaptation only covering such a tiny amount disheartening, but that is not really the case here as the first chapter on its own works just as well as a standalone anime. Furthermore, by narrowing down the scope this much, the anime instead manages to nail what little content it covers more or less perfectly, and as a result this is one of the absolute best VN adaptations I have ever seen. Satelight made an outstanding job turning this into an anime.White Album 2 (henceforth only referring to the anime) is the story of Kitahara Haruki, a diligent student and one of the only two remaining members of the light music club. He dreams of reviving the club after all its other members resigned, and to have them perform at the upcoming school festival as their last event before graduation. In order to do so he manages to get the aid of the cheerful karaoke-loving school idol Ogiso Setsuna, as well as the quiet black-haired beauty Touma Kazusa who is his fellow classmate and a high-level pianist. Together they try to somehow scrape together a performance in what limited time they have left in order to create a final memory before they graduate. That was the only intention.Or at least, that's what is what supposed to be.For the three of them however, the bonds they acquire with each other intertwine in a very intricate and complicated web of emotions, resulting in a rather convoluted and tension-filled love triangle. One without any optimal resolution in sight and packed to the brim with conflicting emotions. This results in the anime being somewhat of a tearjerker but an exquisitely written one at that. Of course not everyone appreciates these kinds of stories since it can also be interpreted as somewhat cliché, and while I cannot deny that fact I still think this is easily one of the best series of the genre.What really cannot be understated with this anime is just how good the pacing is. The ~Introductory Chapter~ of the visual novel is only seven or so hours long, yet the anime is given a full 13 episodes for that alone. It's such a refreshing feeling seeing a story with no holes in it at any point, yet it doesn't ever feel slow or boring for a single second either. Everything in White Album 2 feels like it's actually important and serves as an important piece of the overall story. There are also some neat narrative tricks utilized in the story presentation such as specific camera angles leaving out certain elements intentionally, as well as using flashbacks instead of a totally linear style of story-telling in order to give the show a bigger sense of unpredictability and creativity.The characters of White Album 2 are not based on generic anime tropes like the vast majority of today's shows are, but rather feel like genuine human beings. The concept of fanservice is more or less non-existent in this anime, and instead it offers a very mature outlook on what youthful love might look like in real life, as well as what responsibilities and consequences comes along with it. Is it right to wish for your own happiness if it comes with the misfortune of others? Is it always justified to follow the calling of your heart? These are some of the questions this anime asks.These types of intricate questions make the character development of White Album 2 quite spectacular, as you can clearly see how all three of the main characters change drastically over the course of time. This goes both for how they act by themselves and towards the other two. Whether the choices they all make are right or wrong at times is up to interpretation, but I think all of them are perfectly understandable at least. Above all though, it results in something actually HAPPENING. The biggest problem in most romance anime is the lack of actual romantic development but White Album 2 has it aplenty, despite only being 13 episodes long. Furthermore it actually feels sincerely believable for once, yet not completely predictable either.The presentation is stellar. The animation is very crisp and clean, and fits perfectly for the theme and atmosphere of the series. Above all though, the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. It primarily consists of remakes of the OST from the original visual novel, and contains mainly vocal-heavy and instrumental tunes. These tracks are further enhanced by them oftentimes actually being performed live by the characters themselves, albeit merely in practice more often than on stage. The timing of the music is also used excellently, as the key emotional scenes of the story are heavily supported by the background music and the superb voice acting. Really White Album 2 would not have been the same as it is if it wasn't for the audio department. I really cannot praise it enough.As always with these kinds of series, there will be some heavy shipping wars going on regarding which of the two girls every viewer happens to prefer, but regardless of who you happen to fancy I still think that the overall story progression of White Album 2 should be very satisfactory either way. This is not an anime about which is the #bestgirl, it's much deeper and more touching than that.Overall, although this anime only covers a tiny portion of the full story of the visual novel, it is without a doubt an outstanding series in and of itself. Ironically despite the majority of the story not being shown in this anime, the ending of it still feels a hell of a lot more conclusive than most romance series out there. If you didn't know there was any more story left to be told, then you'd probably never imagine there was. It really feels that conclusive despite everything.Recommended for:Fans of mature romance and emotional dramas, as well as people who can appreciate exquisite presentation and directive for what it is.Not recommended for:People who are looking for a lighthearted romcom and those who place too much emphasis on their personal favorite coupling coming into fruition. The latter is not what this show is about on a metalevel.For what it's worth, the amount of emotion and sheer quality White Album 2 manages to squeeze out of a mere 13 episodes is phenomenal. It goes to show just how far you can come with a good source material and some stellar directing.Now if only all visual novel adaptations could do the same thing... true love in a mature sense.

WARNING CONTAINS SPOILS. You have been warnedStory : 6The story starts off as any romance anime does, introduce the love interests and develop some back story for the characters. The story then revolves around Kazusa Touma, Setsuna Ogiso and Haruki Kitahara getting ready for the school fair which for their act is...putting on a music show. This is the part that looked promising, 3 friends working hard together to achieve a common goal and the bonds that are forged in the process but that all ends after the school fair arc. After the school fair arc Setsuna and Haruki start to date because Haruki (who has feelings for Kazusa, I will get into this in the character section) isn\'t firm enough with her and on the spur of the moment kisses and subsequently starts to date Setsuna. Setsuna despertly trying to keep the 3 of them together arranges various activities for them to do such as go to a spar. The final part of the anime revolves around the reveal that Touma is moving to europe and Haraki subsequent attempts to get her to stay in japan. This is the part of the story I fucking hate, Haruki lies to Setsuna (on her birthday) that he is sick and goes to visit Touma, a series of events happen that lead to them HAVING SEXUALLY INTERCOURSE, whilst he is still dating Setsuna on her birthday. Touma still decides to leave after all that shit and goes to catch her plain to europe but not before a heart warming last good bye right? WRONG Haruki then proceeds to start making out with Touma in front of Setsuna (who is still his gf btw). Touma then says her feelings in front of setsuna and then leaves for europe leaving Setsuna and Haraki with a broken Relationship.So with the first half looking like a fun happy anime ends up with every character being sad and depressed. Fuck this story and everything it represents.Music: 8Because this show is based on music you would expect it to be good and fortunately this is true. Their isnt\' anything noteworthy to be said but the sound track (mostly the same) is good and lives up to the nameCharacters: 4Haruki Kitahara:For the first half of this anime Haruki is a good guy, he treats people nicely and is overall not an asshole. This all changes however in the second half. As I mentioned before despite having a gf he proceed to have sex with touma, and then at the airport start kissing her in front of said gf. I just find him to such a despicable asshole. He has next no morals and only gives a fuck about what he wants with no consideration for anyone around him. The only other character I can compare him to is the main character from school days as both are assholes but unfortunately for this anime he didn\'t die in the end.Setsuna Ogiso.The only word I can use to describe her with is Crazy. Despite the fact the she knew that Haruki liked Touma he still basically forced him to go out with her which at the point was the downfall for the group she so desperately wanted to keep going. Then after finding out that her bf cheated on her and then kissed touma in front of her leaving her in tear, She still stayed with him. All in all shes a terrible character that probably contributed the most to the fall of the group she loved so much. DUMB BITCHKazusa Touma:The whole anime all she did was leave the guy she liked the cold shoulder. All she did was basically be a bitch to him but that didnt stop her from dumping all her feelings on him and having sex with him, despite the fact that she ""valued"" her relationship with Setsuna. She was the best of the worst in my opinion as till the end she sticked with what she wanted to do and said fuck Haruki im going to Europe, hopefully those two can clean after my mess.Conclusion.The anime had a strong start but feel off at around the mid point of the show. The characters all betrayed each other and by the end all that was left was 3 very sad people who did it to them selves.

This is a show that should not be taken lightly. The first episode does not at all warn the viewer of the emotional rollercoaster that is to follow. WA2 will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. It is filled with realistic characters with the best of intentions; however, acting on emotion instead of logic is the surest recipe for disaster. Perhaps this realism is the reason why I was so drawn to it. It is definitely an anime that will captivate you from its very first frame and linger in your heart long after its last.This review may include spoilers (particularly the conclusion). You\'ve been warned.White Album 2 (which will from this point on be referred to as WA2) is a simple love story involving three main characters, who, cruel by the stroke of fate, meet one fall afternoon. The trio become friends, and shortly after, a love triangle soon forms. One of the many reasons why I love the show is its consistency. The very first line in this anime sets the mood of the show, and never does it once falter from it. Going into this show, I didn\'t know what to expect; I was expecting your generic rom/com with excessive fanservice, nonsensical/nonexistent plot, and characters as flat and one-dimensional as paper. I\'m happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised.At the core of WA2 lies its characters. The first episode portrays each and every character in the most stereotypical, most cliche ways. We meet the geeky honor student, the tsundere, and the school idol. They are portrayed as characters without flaws; characters who always keep their cool and calm demeanor, knowing just what to say in a situation. By the second half of the story, however, this fascade that we (the viewers) have been shown this whole time starts to fall off, and we are met with a very flawed, imperfect, selfish, and greedy cast. Despite all the downright terrible things they do to each other, you can\'t blame them. As I said earlier in the review, these characters always have the best of intentions, wishing for everyone to be happy; however, acting solely on emotion while disregarding any logical reasoning will always lead to disaster. The character\'s actions, especially near the end, are always justified. They may be acting thoughtlessly, sometimes even blantly disregarding what happens to anyone around, but to them, their hearts are telling them that they are in the right. Sounds familiar, doesn\'t it? In almost every romance anime, we see characters fall head over heels for each other; however, rarely do we actually FEEL how much these characters WANT to be with one another. In WA2, I actually felt myself being immersed in these characters\' personalities, even empathizing for them, and when everything comes crashing down toward the end (and it does), my heart broke just as our protagonist\'s and the heroines\' hearts did as well.WA2 was produced by Satelight, a studio known for its most notorious work, Fairy Tail. Needless to say, the studio didn\'t hold back in terms of sound or animation. The colors, lighting, and character designs fit the mood of the show perfectly, so did its sound. For an anime revolving around music and art, I thought that the OST, particularly the ending song, ""After All"", was superb. I loved the emotion and score of each and every one of the soundtracks, and to this day, I still listen to them.Throughout the anime, the viewers are shown time and time again that love is messy. Unlike all the other romance/harems out there, WA2 realistically shows why a love triangle will never work. White Album 2 is a tragic tale revolving around three people who become friends and fall in love for the first time, and how their friendship is tested, strained, and eventually violently ripped apart because of ""a love that cannot be.""If you enjoy any form of romance anime, whether it be harem, comedy, psychological, or dramatic, I recommend you give White Album 2 a watch. If you don\'t end up liking it, I would be very surprised. punishments.""White Album 2 is a brilliantly executed romantic drama that premiered in the Winter 2013 season.

For an anime revolving around music and art, I thought that the OST, particularly the ending song, ""After All"", was superb. I loved the emotion and score of each and every one of the soundtracks, and to this day, I still listen to them.Throughout the anime, the viewers are shown time and time again that love is messy. Unlike all the other romance/harems out there, WA2 realistically shows why a love triangle will never work. White Album 2 is a tragic tale revolving around three people who become friends and fall in love for the first time, and how their friendship is tested, strained, and eventually violently ripped apart because of ""a love that cannot be.""If you enjoy any form of romance anime, whether it be harem, comedy, psychological, or dramatic, I recommend you give White Album 2 a watch. If you don\'t end up liking it, I would be very surprised.', 'If you\'re an anime fan and you\'re anything like me, then you\'re getting a little goddamn tired of high school rom-com slice of life shows. They seem to breed like rabbits, flooding each new season with waves of uninspired crap. Worse than the fact that they\'re founded on generic, predictable stories is the fact that 95% of them rely on overused tropes, poor attempts at slapstick humor, cliches, terrible dialogue and more anime-isms than one can count. Shows that are airing now like Ore Monogatari get credit just for deviating ever-so-slightly from the formula, and while I do give such shows credit I still cannot...help but feel as though the vast majority of all of these shows are unwatchable crap. This is ANIME, aka, DRAWINGS. You can do ANYTHING. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical pieces, surrealism: the number of possibilities and the the amount of potential is unbelievable. The fact that so much of that is being wasted is a tragedy.White Album 2, however, is not wasting anything. Yes, it is set at a high-school with a male protagonist. Yes, it has drama. Yes, it has romance. But it\'s difficult to even compare it to other shows of its genre. White Album 2 has something to say. It doesn\'t ""deconstruct"" the genre: that would imply that it uses any of the genre\'s common elements to begin with. White Album 2 reinvents the high school slice-of-life, showing just what can be done with it if you have a creative mind, an understanding of chemistry, conversation and people, and a goal in mind besides getting two people together. It\'s a powerful, evocative tale about how complicated emotions and relationships can be, and while it doesn\'t change my stance on the genre it certainly rises above it. If all high school slice-of-life shows were this good, I would have a vastly different opinion of them.Allow me to explain why.The first aspects of the show to grab my attention were the art and the music. This is a bit of an irregular for me, considering I usually place a considerably lower value on aesthetics than I do characters and plot. However, from the very beginning the show\'s aesthetics struck me not because they\'re of exceptionally high caliber (though they are extremely impressive) but because they\'re used creatively and effectively. They work with the story, not only complementing it but also adding to it. Art and music in anime are some of the best ways to achieve show-don\'t-tell, capable of highlighting character traits, establishing tone, and even telling their own story when subjected to good direction. This is something that should seem obvious, but a lot of shows under-utilize or just straight up ignore this possibility. My go-to example is Fate/Zero, a show with both top-notch animation and music (it seriously looks like it\'s from 2020) that puts neither to any use past having gorgeous fight scenes.White Album 2 makes full use of its aesthetics from episode 1. It uses gorgeously drawn sunsets to emphasize feelings of nostalgia and to reflect the feeling of not wanting the status quo to change (the setting sun implying the transition to a new day). It uses shot-framing to demonstrate what characters are focused on, as well as lighting to imply how characters feel (oftentimes characters having a conversation will be lit in different ways even though they are in the same place, showing how each of them view the other). It even makes use of font, using a crystalline and gleaming lettering for its credits and on-screen text that fits in with Touma\'s cold-feeling yet elegant aura. The music is another story entirely: White Album 2 is a show that revolves around music with several of its characters striving to be musicians of their own and everyone in the show being profoundly affected by music. Several of the songs that the characters listen to/play are repeated across the entirety of the show, both as diegetic sound and as background music, garnering meaning both to the characters and the audience as the show progresses. The song \'White Album\', first featured in the beginning of episode 1, both physically brings the characters together and is a reflection of the nature of their relationships. I was constantly impressed by the show\'s directing and the emotional response it was able to instill using aesthetics alone, and I award it full points in both of these categories for being a gleaming example of how these elements of a show can be used.However, regardless of how well art and sound are used in a show, they are never single-handedly enough to make it a masterpiece (at least in my opinion). Nisekoi was a striking example of this, showing that even SHAFT can\'t make everything good. So lets talk about the story. Look, I never thought I\'d say this. Even in the best high school slice-of-life shows the story is rarely very interesting, with execution and characters usually carrying the brunt of the burden. This is because after having so many of these goddamn shows and the extreme limitations they are bound by, there\'s really not much you can do outside of School Days that comes off as original or unique. Even Toradora, one of my long-standing favorites, has a plot that is for the most part generic. I am, however, forced to admit:White Album 2 has a good plot.Scratch that, it\'s outstanding. The underlying cause of this is that, as mentioned before, it has a goal in mind other than getting two characters together, and whilst it is completely unafraid to throw itself whole-heartedly into romance, it\'s not remotely exclusively about that. It\'s also about nostalgia (both for the past and the present), fearing the future, mistakes, heartbreak of many kinds, and regret. It weaves a tale that follows multiple characters thoroughly, valuing each of their ENTIRELY different struggles equally, and crafting them all together due to the character\'s shared bonds. None of the characters overwhelms the show by being viewed as more important or hogging too much of the focus. This allows for a story that is refreshingly original, relies on absolutely no cliches (there is no pool episode. There is no school festival episode. There is no school trip episode. There is no no fucking new years episode.) and follows what is important to the characters rather than what is going on at the goddamn high school. It also understands that high schoolers oftentimes do weird sh*t (in fact, all people do) and manages to embrace that in a way that is surprisingly touching and honest rather than coming off as creepy or ""irregular"". The show is absolutely void of fan-service: there is sexuality and sexual themes because hormones are a real thing that oftentimes take tangible form (WHO\'D A THUNK??) but they\'re handled in a mature way. For a show a mere 13 episodes long, White Album 2 covers an amazing amount of ground and really makes you feel as though you\'ve only seen a sliver of a long story with more on either end. That\'s perhaps the plot\'s strongest aspect: it doesn\'t feel as though it begins when the camera stars rolling. The show starts then, but the story started long before then and will continue long afterwards. So far I haven\'t even mentioned the ending, which simultaneously provides an unbelievably satisfying and powerful resolution to the story whilst still leaving the viewer feeling like there\'s much more to see. I guess that\'s what happens when you acknowledge that a kiss and a confession aren\'t the ultimate goal of life and don\'t result in an end to all struggles?At this point you should have enough good reasons to go watch this show. Stellar direction, unique, refreshing and impressive story, gorgeous music, outstanding art: that\'s high praise. I\'m pretty picky. But I\'m not done yet. There\'s still something I want to want to give the show credit for.White Album 2 has two aspects in which it stands above pretty much every other anime I\'ve seen: the combination of characters & writing. I know those are similar, but there is definitely a distinction. For instance, a show like Princess Tutu has amazing characters because the motivations and ideas behind those characters are original and believable, but the show\'s writing is pretty impressive because the dialogue through which the characters express who they are is bland and repetitive. White Album 2 both has outstanding characters in the sense that the ideas behind them are great and in the sense that their dialogue is crisp, real and refreshing. It is an absolute JOY to just watch people talk to each other in this show because they talk in the same way that, oh, I don\'t know, people actually converse! There are no rough or awkward transitions in subject matter, there are reasons behind the things that everyone in the show says and sometimes that reason is that people oftentimes talk without thinking. Emotions are expressed realistically and conveyed in ways that are deliciously real. Characters misinterpret each other in believable ways due to phrasing and every word actually counts. White Album 2 understands that people don\'t directly convey intentions to each other, they convey words and that others often misinterpret intentions through those words.The characters themselves are amazing. I don\'t want to get too much into them for the sake of spoilers, but by the end of the show no commonly used archetype could be used to describe any of them. They\'re all individuals. There are three main characters: Haruki Kitahara, Kazusa Touma and Ogiso Setsuna. Each of them has a distinct relationship with each of the others and they have a group dynamic between the three of them as well. Each of them possesses a wealth of both common and more uncommon personality traits, and the show allows these to play off of each other in the way that makes sense. Kitahara is unyielding self-sacrificing to a fault where he is kind to everyone but not to any one person in particular: no one feels as though they are actually special to him because he white-washes his relationships with his selfless attitude. Touma is reclusive and unmotivated, initially having succumbed to feeling hopeless and numb and expressing that through a cold exterior that is clearly crying for attention, something that she refuses to admit to herself. Ogiso Setsuna- well, Ogiso Setsuna is one of my favorite characters of all time. She craves an idea so badly that once it becomes reality all she can think about is her fear of losing it and does everything in her power to ensure that it will endure. She searches for happiness and validation from the people around her, seeing that other people with close friends are happy and wanting to have that closeness as well without realizing that unless she can accept herself and love herself no amount of compassion from others will make her feel at peace.Overall, White Album 2 was an absolutely incredible and unexpected experience. It easily made its way into my all-time favorites and I\'m currently in the process of rewatching it. If you\'re tired of repetitive garbage, anime tropes, romance cliches, and slice-of-life bullshit, give this a shot anyways. It wont change your opinion about any of those other shows, but who cares: it\'s a masterpiece of a show, and at this point it\'s entirely its own thing. help but feel as though the vast majority of all of these shows are unwatchable crap.

I liked it all the way up until episode 10. Great music, voice acting, art style, and likable characters. This suddenly changed. They made Setsuna an unlikable character, and Haruki even worse. Touma was the only character that I remained neutral with, since she always seemed the victim. Haruki seemed to have sociopathic tendencies near the end of the show, with no regard to the feelings of the ones who loved him. He did what he felt was the best for him at that very moment, not what it would do to others in short term and long...term, and to him in the long term. He was only thinking of the here and now. To me it seemed the author was trying to normalize Harukis terrible cheating behaviors, and make Setsuna the bad guy, when it was Harukis fault all along for not thinking ahead.

We have a nice guy man-pussy, a popular kawaii-wannabe idol and you run of the mill tsundere. For an anime focused on music the music is surprisingly generic. The ending song is alright I guess, but the rest of the sounds are rather forgettable. The anime picks up after about 10 episodes and the last two episodes are decent. But the journey to get there is slow, ardous and painful and the ending is just too little too late. I almost dropped the show post the 7th episode. Each of three main characters...can be distilled down to a single action they repeat over and over again. Haruki - ever dependable, always present to help others.

Not Santa Claus -- that large man with a huge belly donned in that trademark woolen clothing of his is crying out, ""Hohoho~,"" in the wooden chair. Not Rudolf...the Reindeer -- he\'s there but not as a living being; he\'s just a cardboard cutout standing beside him.

These three characters, bland when separated, harmonize like those seamless sequences of chords Kazusa plays on her piano. They love each other dearly. A genuinely affectionate relationship between three friends who wanted to play some good music on the school concert.Without that bond, I don\'t think the show (or even the VN) will work.

Anyways, I started watching. Before we get to rating and justifying the aforementioned, I have to admit one thing – this anime evokes borderline emotions. Whether positive or negative depends on the personal taste of the viewer, however, you can’t just walk past them indifferently. And because of that, it reminds me a bit of Golden Time (and not only because of that, mind you).Warning,...the following review contains a few minor spoilers.Story: 6The plot presented in the anime is solid and nothing above that. As it is portrayed in many stories, the school festival is the moment in the lives of the students in which they all enter a state of rut, and therefore, they want to do something about it no matter the cost. Here we have the revival of the Light Music Association. What’s interesting, the climax of the story, namely the festival, happens almost halfway through. Unfortunately, what happens afterwards only impacts negatively on the rating. Stupid behavior, attractions, crying, and tears have been unnecessarily condensed into four-five last episodes, which tires and disgusts very fast. Not going into detail, the plot, although trivial, had potential, however a bit wasted because of the uneven distribution of romantic aspects.Art: 8One can bicker about many thing in this anime, but being impartial, one cannot refuse that fact that from an artistic standpoint, the visuals are top notch. I totally don’t know the terminology to define the quality, but I know one thing – it’s pleasant on the eye and looks good.Sound: 9The first thing what one notices is the music – delicate and subtle rhythms played one some kind of string instrument (a cello?) and the sounds played by the protagonists on the guitar or piano are the best medicine for ears brutally raped by the cacophony of some anime. The singing of one of the heroines is very pleasant for the ear, as well as the other voices are very appropriate, not irritating or distracting one bit. In brief – a good job.Characters: 4One of the sections that cause the most mixed feelings in me. The MC looks promising, so different from the banality of most of the drama/romanse anime protags (either a total idiot that can’t open his mouth around somebody representing the different sex and getting beet red just from mentioning a woman, or a wuss that can’t decide on anything and always relegating his responsibility to others), but sadly, this changes with each passing episode. On the other hand, Setsuna and Touma are just cookie cutter characters. In the left corner we have an ex-idol dere-dere, and in the right corner we have a tsundere sociopath, one red haired and one black haired. One almost exudes her feelings for the MC in buckets, and the other is the classic case of “why won’t senpai notice me”. The scriptwriter probably tried to save the situation in the last episodes, but he just worsened the whole thing. During that time, the MC sheds more tears than Shinji during the whole course of Evangelion, and the love triangle starts shifting sides like in a kaleidoscope. Reassuming – what looked good in the beginning got screwed up in the end.Enjoyment: 6I really had a dilemma what rating to give here. The first eight episodes went in like a glass of Stolichnaya with an appetizer, but the next five just started causing a massive hangover. Maybe I don’t stomach love triangles and MC’s so ‘manly’ I’m pondering how deep their vajay goes, and maybe it’s just me who thinks that such behavior and choices are so totally and utterly stupid that my head starts to hurt. That’s why many people won’t probably agree with me, happens. However, in the end, I’ll give a 6. The first few episodes were genuinely fun to watch, pleasant both for the eyes, ears, and for my sense of aesthetics. Unfortunately, the next ones started spoiling my idealized picture of the anime. Despite all the errors and irritating design choices, the anime stand above average in my book.Everyone that likes such stories can easily add two points to my score, especially if you don’t mind a lead character that couldn’t decide anything and carry on the consequences of his decisions. Be what it may, I encourage you to watch it. the following review contains a few minor spoilers.Story: 6The plot presented in the anime is solid and nothing above that. As it is portrayed in many stories, the school festival is the moment in the lives of the students in which they all enter a state of rut, and therefore, they want to do something about it no matter the cost. Here we have the revival of the Light Music Association. What’s interesting, the climax of the story, namely the festival, happens almost halfway through. Unfortunately, what happens afterwards only impacts negatively on the rating. Stupid behavior, attractions, crying, and tears have been unnecessarily condensed into four-five last episodes, which tires and disgusts very fast. Not going into detail, the plot, although trivial, had potential, however a bit wasted because of the uneven distribution of romantic aspects.Art: 8One can bicker about many thing in this anime, but being impartial, one cannot refuse that fact that from an artistic standpoint, the visuals are top notch. I totally don’t know the terminology to define the quality, but I know one thing – it’s pleasant on the eye and looks good.Sound: 9The first thing what one notices is the music – delicate and subtle rhythms played one some kind of string instrument (a cello?) and the sounds played by the protagonists on the guitar or piano are the best medicine for ears brutally raped by the cacophony of some anime. The singing of one of the heroines is very pleasant for the ear, as well as the other voices are very appropriate, not irritating or distracting one bit. In brief – a good job.Characters: 4One of the sections that cause the most mixed feelings in me. The MC looks promising, so different from the banality of most of the drama/romanse anime protags (either a total idiot that can’t open his mouth around somebody representing the different sex and getting beet red just from mentioning a woman, or a wuss that can’t decide on anything and always relegating his responsibility to others), but sadly, this changes with each passing episode.

Be what it may, I encourage you to watch it.', 'This is my first review, but I\'ll do my best.White Album 2 is, to me, the epitome of human romance in anime.What do I mean by this? Well, I mean it\'s a perfect mix of irrational love taking over imperfect human beings and dictating their own actions to a point where those aren\'t their own anymore, spiced with artistic expression such is music, and with passionately written script.There are a few flaws in the package of course, like the imprecision (borderline laziness I\'d say sometimes) in the graphic department (at some scene, a guitar is being played by itself, without fingers to help create...the notes), or some proportion errors in a few scenes, but you\'re not really looking for perfection in that department when watching a romance/drama anime, from my humble opinion. Still, it affected the overall score accordingly, just not my personal choice of calling this 13 episode long show my favourite anime.Story: 9It certainly isn\'t an out of the norm plot, romantic triangles are quite abundant in the current romance anime meta, specially when based around a school setting. Still, the way it develops is close to no other, the storyline doesn\'t feel rushed at all, yet it manages to keep you attached to the screen and to the characters (specially the female ones) up until the last, heartbreaking scene. You may cry in despair, you might be angry at some points, even outraged. You might even laugh, or feel deeply happy at some stages of the story, but in the end the story feels truly human, and it manages to touch you in a rare way that you\'ll want to cherish forever, and you\'ll certainly be able to relate to the situations presented on this anime as long as you keep your heart open to it.Art: 7It has its moments, as I stated above, but overall the art (which is inspired in the visual novel this anime is adaptation of) is great. It doesn\'t have extremely outstanding visuals, it\'s rather austere, nothing like Byousuku 5 Centimeter and other shows with a much higher artistic budget, but it certainly does its job well. The character designs are fitting, and some scenes are truly precious and unforgettable. My wallpaper is one of those scenes, I\'ll let you guess which one if you\'re interested~Sound: 10This. This right here is the brightest star of the anime. The soundtrack level is worthy of Clannad: After Story and the likes. Madoka Yonezawa (Setsuna\'s seiyuu, relevant to the whole story) and Uehara Rena give voice to some of the most touching melodies ever composed. I honestly believe the music gives the story the extra push it needed to reach the highest place in my favourites list, and even now months after finishing the story I still keep the whole OST in my mp3, and upload entries of it to my blog rather frequently. Just listening some of these songs brings tears to my eyes. They say music is the language the heart speaks, and these songs speak directly to heart of the listener. It doesn\'t even matter if you don\'t understand the lyrics at first, they will touch even the remotest corners of your soul with barely a few chords and tones. You can feel their struggles within their melodic landscape. A masterpiece of a soundtrack. 10/10.Characters: 9I could say a lot of things about the characters, and it would be okay. But I think their most important trait is... they are human. Their actions, their thoughts... they are mirrors of the human nature. You can relate to their suffering and joy, you can feel it\'s not some kind of fairytale story but rather something that could be happening anywhere else in the world at the moment you\'re watching it. And that, to me, is one of the most important traits a character can have, specially in a romance/drama story. Being able to identify your own psyche in them... is a priceless feeling, and increases the overall value of the story to a point you start thinking it\'s a real incident what\'s through the screen. And certainly a heartfelt one.The main male character is the weak spot of this segment, but I\'ll let you judge by yourself about this, since I might be a tad biased after I finished the story.Enjoyment: 10I actually got all emotional while writing this review, what can I say? It struck right to my heart, and while it might leave you hanging for a few hours or days, I call that enjoyment. It\'s an unforgettable anime, much like the love stories most of us have gone through.  If you only like ""happy-go-lucky"" anime, well, you won\'t enjoy this, but if you appreciate a story that will leave you thinking for days about attachment, infatuation and how puppet-like we are under the effect of them... look no further. This will make you angry, sad, happy... but overall, it\'ll make you feel alive.Overall: 9Eventhough it\'s my favourite anime...by no means do I think this is the ultimate anime, or that it\'s perfect in every way. It\'s certainly imperfect. Just like us, humans.And I think that\'s one extra charm added to it.I hope you enjoyed my first review, but I wish you\'ll enjoy the anime as much as I did.Cheers, Sona. the notes), or some proportion errors in a few scenes, but you\'re not really looking for perfection in that department when watching a romance/drama anime, from my humble opinion.

Especially interesting is Sublimation because it seems strange that the pessimistic mindset would be conquered by itself in a self-mutilating loop (though maybe its because it feels self-mutilating that it becomes pessimistic, the thing about pessimistic philosophy is that its based entirely around aesthetic and gut feel over anything else). The point I\'m making in bringing up one of the big daddies of dark philosophy is that love for dark things is as fundamental a drive as love for romantic idealist things. It\'s just as...aesthetic to describe life as grand meaningless pestilent Gothic drama as it is to describe it as grand eschatological redemption. We live, especially in these times, in a world where the evils aren\'t even morally horrific and tragic as they are mere humiliations of the human spirit. Thus what appears to be great movements of the interior human spirit and great passions, especially with regard to our daily romances, comes across as petty and insipid when viewed from cruel reality. I mean we all want to lie on the grass and stare romantically at the stars with a significant Other, or we want to go crazy and shout our love everywhere, or dance on rooftops and drink champagne, but the truth of the matter is that from the view of another there isn\'t any fleeting transcendence involved in that when outside our own solipsism. Some of it comes across as banal and juvenile, as ridiculous embarrassment. So the true use of Art is to play our own little realities as fully as we possibly can, to make as it truthful to the tragic overtures or the idealistic life-affirmation that we conceive in our heads. Since we aren\'t romantics anymore though we turn to sickness, degradation, decay and edginess as the last bastion for meaning in our lives (or at least a whole bunch of people but not everyone does. I too am trying for the whole ornamented pessimist Gothic feel that Ligotti was aiming for it writing like this)""THE culture-heroes of our liberal bourgeois civilization are anti-liberal and anti-bourgeois; they are writers who are repetitive, obsessive, and impolite, who impress by force—not simply by their tone of personal authority and by their intellectual ardor, but by the sense of acute personal and intellectual extremity. The bigots, the hysterics, the destroyers of the self—these are the writers who bear witness to the fearful polite time in which we live. Mostly it is a matter of tone: it is hardly possible to give credence to ideas uttered in the impersonal tones of sanity. There are certain eras which are too complex, too deafened by contradictory historical and intellectual experiences, to hear the voice of sanity. Sanity becomes compromise, evasion, a lie. Ours is an age which consciously pursues health, and yet only believes in the reality of sickness. The truths we respect are those born of affliction. We measure truth in terms of the cost to the writer in suffering—rather than by the standard of an objective truth to which a writer’s words correspond. Each of our truths must have a martyr. (Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation)""Well okay then what\'s that gotta do with White Album 2?""Many books promoted as vehicles of a “dark vision” finish up by lounging in a warm bath of affirmation, often doing a traitorous turnabout in their closing pages or paragraphs.2 As every author, publisher, and carnival owner knows, lurid billing gets a patron in the door. And so we have innumerable books and magazine articles with such inquiring titles as The Misadventure of Consciousness: Are Human Beings a Mistake of Evolution? or “Should We Stop Having Children?” The answer is always “No,” sometimes resounding in its declamation but more often qualified, which is even more vile. Searchers after bleakness would do well, then, to begin at the ending of books and magazine articles with doomful titles or angst-fraught openings if they are not to be chiseled by a bait-and-switch maneuver."" (The Conspiracy Against the Human Race)Pessimism, as defined by Ligotti, is the belief that behind all the normal things of humanity, all our daily struggles and feelings, is monstrosity. If we take a Freudian viewpoint to romance then its less about pure feelings but more about uncontrollable drives. Whatever it is that moves us is horrific and we are constantly teetering on the edge of realizing this and falling into madness or decay. Likewise behind all the high-school nostalgia of White Album 2, behind the romantic tones of the orange evening and the light strum of the guitar, is poison. White Album 2 is relentless in its pursuit of a horrible metaphysical truth. It needed no Lovecraftian monstrosity or Ligottian nightmare to prove this but all it needed was to simply display a tight tapestry of destructive human desires and insecurities. It drags things to their eventual dark conclusions in a way that Ligotti would love (well then again Ligotti is a guy who likes Symbolist Gothic stuff and would probably not even raise a finger to touch slice of life anime).The thing about White Album 2 is that somewhere deep inside there it can be described as Ligottian, Schopenhauerian, Beckettian, or Kafkaesque but its touch is so subtle that there\'s hardly a linger of any such undertones. The dialogue is Absurdist in the way language is specifically used to weave elaborate labyrinths of meaning. Setsuna\'s talk about maintaining the status quo and remembering the school festival is a miniature version of Pinter\'s constant question dodging and silence in Betrayal. Haruki\'s heroism seems driven more by some dark puppeteer of insecure desire than anything else until he finally realizes what he wants and breaks down. A good work of art (like Evangelion and Kyousogiga) is when the microcosm is equivalent the macrocosm, which is why Evangelion is the travails of adolescence driven up to an apocalyptic level while Kyousogiga is the hardships of family pushed up to the realm of divinity. White Album 2 is fitting a complete pessimism into a slice of life narrative. It never deviates from its atmosphere the same way NANA or Clannad does (NANA with its mini Shojo comedic moments and Clannad with its light-hearted first arcs. WA2\'s comedy never causes a shift in its nature because it still is set in the realm of the illusion of high school nostalgia). It feels cohesive and constant in its vision.Postnote: This idea of formal unity has its roots in the Ancient Greek poetics, especially with Aristotle\'s unities. Generally the ancient genres were established in order to give poets a framework to work in so that they could focus on the formal content rather than spend time on deriving a complicated and subversive structure. As seen with Shakespeare\'s problem plays, having a disunity of atmosphere may work, but it can also be extremely jarring. Even though Hamlet is narratively experimental, with plays inside plays and supernatural elements, even in its most comedic moments, especially during the grave digger scene or Hamlet\'s bouts of madness, it never forgets that its about Death and the existential worry and insignificance attached to human life. White Album 2 never forgets that its a story about the perils of raising a naive ideal above a certain threshold of reality to the point that it becomes a dangerous game of betrayal to maintain the visage of the ideal. Kyousogiga never forgets that its about the awkward development of a group of people into the constructed instituition of Family. Evangelion never forgets that its about miscommunication the ability for humans to hurt each other due to being unable to communicate each others personal realities to one another. I could go on with this all day. Kara no Kyoukai never forgets that its a Buddhist Noir that raises questions about the nature of Time, Identity and Reality in the way Buddhism always likes to do. Madoka Magica never forgets that its a Goethian Fairy-tale dream. 5cm Per Second takes the nostalgic romantic high school perspective, where everything is about love and grasping, to the pinnacle of beauty.

It was not until I realized that White Album 2 is not really connected with White Album. I took it upon myself to try out the anime. What happened exactly? I was Hooked. I enjoyed this entire series in a day and I thought it was pretty amazing overall.Story 9/10The story is well-paced and pretty well thought out. Its a story with a few kids trying to have a good friendship but at the same time there is a love triangle. This leads on for some drama and some tough...decisions that makes you cling on to your pillow to see what is going to happen next.art 10/10The score speaks for itself.Sound 10/10I would expect the sound would be good for an anime that has to do with a small band. The music was really good from the opening, ending, and the scores within the anime.Character 9/10Everyone has a preference when it comes to who gets the girl in a triangle. However, you will come to like both of these women and the main character. Sometimes people are not what they seem. The development for these characters are amazing as the story progresses.Enjoyment 10/10I enjoyed every second of this anime. A romantic anime that I yearn for, intense drama between characters, and some emotional scenes that make you feel emotional. You will become happy, you will become sad, and you might even get mad.Overall 10/10This is really good anime to watch especially for people who are into romance, drama, or slice of life. This is a good anime for you.Sequel please? decisions that makes you cling on to your pillow to see what is going to happen next.art 10/10The score speaks for itself.Sound 10/10I would expect the sound would be good for an anime that has to do with a small band.

This is a good anime for you.Sequel please?', 'It didn\'t take much to get me interested in this title. I saw ""high school"" and ""music"" and I was sucked in. I HAD to watch White Album 2. It wasn\'t until later that I found out this was also a love triangle anime. White Album 2 is one of those shows that manages to achieve a balance between its multiple elements without losing focus of its main objective. The story and characters of White Album 2 are unrelated to the first White Album anime (which I\'ve heard, by all accounts, is mediocre). The show is based off of the ""Introductory Chapter"" of the visual...novel. I haven\'t read the visual novel, but other viewers claim that the anime stays pretty faithful to its source material. There are some fanservice shots, but it\'s nothing overly gratuitous. There is also a sex scene, but it\'s brief and most of it isn\'t seen. There is no explicit nudity.Story: 8/10 - Kitahara Haruki, an average guitarist, is the last remaining member of the Light Music Club. He\'s determined to put together a band in time to perform at the school fair, just weeks away. By a stroke of luck, he finds that the ""school idol,"" Ogiso Setsuna, is a talented vocalist, and the quiet, antisocial girl who sits next to him in class, Touma Kazusa, is the daughter of a world-famous pianist and is a musical prodigy herself. Thus, the Light Music Club is reformed and a love triangle begins to take shape. However, preparing for the school fair is not the focus of the entire show--in fact, this only accounts for about half of the episodes. The remaining episodes focus on the drama of the love triangle. In my opinion, this was an excellent screenwriting decision as this allows for both the music and the drama aspects of the show to have their respective time in the limelight. The show feels balanced. Each episode is a logical continuation of the next and thus the storytelling feels almost seamless. This is not a wishy-washy romance story; the characters\' actions are decisive. My only complaint about the story is its ending. Although I know that this is just the first part of a larger story, the ending left me feeling incomplete, and I felt there should have been an additional scene to provide more closure. I sincerely hope that the second installment of the visual novel will get an anime adaptation, because I need to see a definitive conclusion to this story.Art: 7/10 - Perhaps the show\'s weakest link is its art. Although the character designs are appealing, the animation seems to lack liveliness. This is painfully evident during the musical performances--do not expect Angel Beats-level detail here. Shots avoid detail so the intricacies of the instruments are left unseen. There are way too many shots from the rear, which conveniently obscure the act of playing instruments. Haruki\'s hands barely move when he\'s playing the guitar, regardless of whether he\'s playing chords or a lengthy guitar solo. Even shots of Setsuna singing feel like a bit of a cop-out: repeated shots of her legs and feet are interspersed with quick shots of her face that attempt to give the impression that attention is being given to details. There are far too many uses of stills. Ultimately, the animation doesn\'t feel nearly as dynamic as it should, which really sucks the life out of the performance scene as well as many others.Sound: 9/10 - Expectations are high here, being as this is a music anime. And it doesn\'t disappoint. Being a pianist myself, I especially appreciated the piano tracks, recorded by an actual pianist. Haruki\'s stumbles while playing the guitar sound genuine, and not just like a missed note on Guitar Hero. The soundtrack is excellent. The titular song, ""White Album,"" is a wonderful tune that I found myself humming hours afterwards. The quality of the sound doesn\'t fully make up for the lacking animation, but it gets pretty close.Character: 8/10 - The three main characters are all pretty well fleshed out, thanks to a script that doesn\'t reduce them to shallow, stereotypical love triangle characters. Haruki is a sincere guy who seems to have realized what his dream is a little too late. Setsuna puts on the image of being a ""school idol"" in order to avoid her worst fear, being left out. Because of events within her family, Kazusa understandably has issues with authority and cares about, well...nothing. It\'s enjoyable to watch how these three each change and grow as a result of each others\' company. They\'re all likable, and it\'s because we like them that the romantic drama hits so hard. We want all of them to be happy, but we know that can never happen. And ironically, that\'s what makes White Album 2 so enjoyable to watch. We feel their sadness; we feel their frustration as they struggle with their own personal dilemmas. We empathize.Enjoyment: 8/10 - The art and the ending were definitely detractors for me on this one. But, the most important thing is, first and foremost, having an engaging storyline and characters. White Album 2 has both. Combine that with an excellent soundtrack, and regardless of the art and the incompleteness of the ending, White Album 2 is still an enjoyable watch, although its lacking aspects prevent it from becoming truly great.Overall: 8/10 - White Album 2 is a good anime. It\'s emotionally engaging without wandering into the realm of melodrama. It also avoids creating characters that fall into any extreme trope. This is just a story of three teenagers, about to enter the next stage of their life, who play music together and fall in love. And in the end, there\'s something a little beautiful about it. novel. I haven\'t read the visual novel, but other viewers claim that the anime stays pretty faithful to its source material. There are some fanservice shots, but it\'s nothing overly gratuitous. There is also a sex scene, but it\'s brief and most of it isn\'t seen. There is no explicit nudity.Story: 8/10 - Kitahara Haruki, an average guitarist, is the last remaining member of the Light Music Club. He\'s determined to put together a band in time to perform at the school fair, just weeks away. By a stroke of luck, he finds that the ""school idol,"" Ogiso Setsuna, is a talented vocalist, and the quiet, antisocial girl who sits next to him in class, Touma Kazusa, is the daughter of a world-famous pianist and is a musical prodigy herself. Thus, the Light Music Club is reformed and a love triangle begins to take shape. However, preparing for the school fair is not the focus of the entire show--in fact, this only accounts for about half of the episodes. The remaining episodes focus on the drama of the love triangle. In my opinion, this was an excellent screenwriting decision as this allows for both the music and the drama aspects of the show to have their respective time in the limelight. The show feels balanced. Each episode is a logical continuation of the next and thus the storytelling feels almost seamless.

And in the end, there\'s something a little beautiful about it.', ""This is a hard anime for me to review, and honestly, I'm not sure that the score that I gave it is really representative of my feelings towards White Album 2. Hopefully, as I'm writing this review, I can get some type of closure and maybe fortify my rating decision. So bear with me a bit.I have strayed away from the pure romantic drama genre for years now, I thought that I was offered the best that a romantic drama can deliver in Clannad, and the worst that it can offer in School Days. I've also enjoyed shows like True Tears and Ef in the...past.While starting White Album 2, I immediately got sucked in by the beautiful art work, the excellent pieces of music, and the introductions of these rather well made characters. The main character, Haruki Kitahara, is not depicted as the usual MC. Haruki is a great student, a great leader ( he's shown organizing events, and even helping out clubs that he doesn't belong to), caring and conscious. To me, he was depicted a lot different than the usually dense as a rock main characters of romantic anime. I actually liked him a lot and related to his personality. I've always been the guy every one runs to for advice, and assumes that I got all the answers. And though Haruki was well known around campus, he didn't seem to be super popular, his personality was irritable to some. I think that is a good description of how perfectionists can come off sometimes.The main two girls were also introduced well. Ogiso Satsuna is your typical popular high school girl, she's pretty and has a sociable personality.  You may think you can put her in a box, however, Ogiso is a little deeper than what is shown in the beginning, and has some deep traumas that really affected her and defined her in this anime, for better or worse. Kazusa Touma is the second girl introduced, and she's rather unique. She's the opposite of what Ogiso is, Touma is introverted, quick witted,and cold. Touma was by far my favorite of the two. Their character designs matched their personalities perfectly.Since I hadn't watched a pure romantic drama in a while, the feelz for me during the first half of the anime were strong. I loved the way the friendship between the main characters formed through the shared goal of performing in the fall festival. There were a lot of training session, but they didn't feel dragging, and the songs that they played were not over-played to the point of annoyance. During those training sessions, it was somewhat eery and foreshadowing getting a glimpse of what was to come in the romantic lives of these characters. It's pretty easy to see who loves who, and I was hypnotized by the intensity matched with the music and bgm during the first seven episodes. The first seven episodes were easily all 10/10s for me, I fell back in love with the romantic genre just through these beginning episodes. Unfortunately, the last six episodes gave me a hard reality check, it reminded me the reason why I left this genre for so long.During the second half of this anime, the fall festival has ended, and music becomes a less central part of the anime. The drama between the three main characters thicken, and I'm being careful of not revealing spoilers, the invisible wedge between them grows bigger as time advances. It was painfully obvious what was going on, and you knew that one person (or possibly more) were going to get their heart demolished.In this second half, I started to see elements that I never enjoyed seeing in anime due to personal preference. Elements such as betrayal, lying, cowardice, and jealousy. These emotions are very hard to depict well in an anime, and can sometime come off as either fake, childish, or forced. I can say with supreme confidence that White Album 2 expressed these elements perfectly. Anytime you feel bad for the character that you don't think is the right fit for the MC, or when you  show fits of anger as you watch a particular action that a character has done, or when you actually feel the tears of a character longing for the affection of a person that they cannot be with......then you can say for certainty that the emotional elements of this anime was well represented.There were times during the second half where it took me hours to finish an episode because I would pause it so much. There were a lot of times in which I would face-palm and ask myself why I'm even continuing with this anime. These reactions are usually similar to reactions that you have when you watch really crappy shows, you think that this is so bad and face-palm at the stupidity of it. I think I may have confused, initially, why I was reacting this way. It wasn't because the anime was crappy, but rather the opposite, this anime did a great job depicting the earlier-mentioned elements to their fullest extent.The characters are experiencing real feelings, and the plot takes dark and unsettling paths. It is very different from other anime, because it doesn't want to leave you with this third party mindstate, it engages you into feeling the guilt, feeling the anguish, and feeling the betrayal. The worst thing is that the anime doesn't care if it leaves you in an ambiguous note, there is no guarantee of a concrete ending.   Wow, this part of the anime was just really well done.All in all, I didn't give this anime a 10/10 because the second half of the anime was just a little bit too overbearing for me. A lot of conversations seemed insignificant, and the anime was starting to run in circles a bit. The ending also left me with a really bad aftertaste. After watching the ending episode, I literally took a shower, mouth-washed, and I still couldn't wash away this unsettling and sour feeling. I guess that's a sign of the quality of this anime.I do recommend this anime, I think you will enjoy the first half a lot, and the second half will be up to your personal preference. It didn't initally cut it with me but the ending was realistic and well made, so I'm not going to chronically complain about it.Anyway do check it out, and if you want to discuss the ending with me (since I didn't want to reveal spoilers here) feel free to just comment me about your reaction. past.While starting White Album 2, I immediately got sucked in by the beautiful art work, the excellent pieces of music, and the introductions of these rather well made characters.

I\'d also say that this anime identically portrays situations that people in reality face, as people are always looking for ways to get what they want without hurting their friends. This anime truly makes it fall in love with you as they portray their characters in a way to relate it to reality by showing that humans truly do not like change, as shown in anime as the 3 main characters wish to stay the way...they are currently living forever.First of all, to the people who wonder as to whether they should be watching this anime or not, I highly suggest that you don\'t dismiss this anime based on a preconceived opinion without much reasoning behind it. Although I do understand that people simply dislike the \'love triangle\' category because of their own reasons, \'White Album 2\' isn\'t quite the average love triangle anime that displays two boys fighting over a girl. I also want to mention that \'White Album\' and \'White Album 2nd Season\' are completely irrelative to this anime and are based off of completely different characters. I wouldn\'t suggest you watch it due to its mediocrity but you\'re always welcome to do so.Moving on to the plot, the story revolves around the three best friends who make up the Light Music Club. Haruki Kitahara, who had begun playing the guitar and strived to improve in order to play on stage with his two other friends. Setsuna Ogiso, the school idol whom is adored by many due to her looks and kindness. And her polar opposite, Kazusa Touma, who is known as a rebel who is selfish and only cares about her music, therefore never paying attention to not only students but also teachers. Eventually, the three turn into best friends who adore each other possibly because the situation that they face are so similar in terms of the problems they face and  the things they\'re interested in.The characters are developed in a way where they believe that the time they spend together is just time spent developing their relationship with the intent of getting to know each other and becoming better friends, but that simple adoration towards each other turns into romantic love where they strive to develop a relationship that goes further than being friends. The way they face their incoming problems and how they react to that is truly something that will make you fall in love with the characters as they continuously still strive to staying as the three best friends who are part of the Light Music Club, but fail to do so as love intrudes their daily lives and prevent them from being the same trio ever again.People say that they strive to maintain friendly relationships with others, or that they would do anything for loved ones. Humans tend to sacrifice things like trust, destroy relationships, hurt others, or even disregard other emotions just because of one simple fact - that they love another. \'White Album 2\' portrays a person\'s true personality, and the things they would do for a romance. It perfectly singles out how human emotions can affect one\'s rationality and decision making ability and this similarity between reality and the anime; may or may not, make you fall in love with this anime.The art of the anime, however, isn\'t really as special as the story, and is just average, though I still think that the normal-like art perfectly fits this deep romance story and still successfully delivers and shows the watcher how the protagonists of the story are feeling. Whether it be a character blushing, or feeling angered, the art of the anime perfectly delivers visually.As a musical oriented anime, I would have been seriously surprised if the music and OST were bad and didn\'t fit with a certain scene, and fortunately, I wasn\'t disappointed as I really did enjoy the songs they sang during their concert and played with their instruments. The sound of the voice actors were also clear-cut, and the voice actors themselves deserve a clap and truly did an awesome job as well, as they spoke in a way that fit the mood of many scenes and also made me feel really into it. They successfully delivered and spoke in a truly emotional way that made me seriously fall in love with their characters, for example, the end of the anime shows a certain character leaving and another character is truly depressed about it, and the way that character spoke made me feel seriously bad for him.With the characters, I really do think that all three of the main protagonists are really well developed and the anime chronologically develops them and shows how the romance and guilt from betrayal affects them and eventually changes their thoughts and ideals. The romance between a set of characters is further developed than another set of characters due to scenes that showed they really loved each other and were crucial parts of each others daily lives, however, the peak of development was near the end of the anime where a sex scene is displayed (nothing is really shown) which shows how much these characters had grown as they were now entering their adolescent stages where they had to decide their future.As someone whose watched the series twice, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and hope people will watch this anime after reading my review, and as this is my first review, I don\'t think it turned out as great as I wanted it to be, but in the end, I just want to say that \'White Album 2\' is a masterpiece and indeed, the best romance anime I\'ve ever watched, and overall...I give \'White Album 2\' a 10 out of 10. they are currently living forever.First of all, to the people who wonder as to whether they should be watching this anime or not, I highly suggest that you don\'t dismiss this anime based on a preconceived opinion without much reasoning behind it.

What can one say about White Album 2. Well, it is obviously one of the most underrated series I have seen in a while. Going into this series, I had no idea what to expect. I should make it clear that i have not seen the original White Album series, so I didn't really care much when it was announced that White Album 2 was going to be animated. Now what kind of anime is this? I will point out right now I have seen awesome, great however you want to describe it tear jerking animes such as Angel Beats, Clannad,...AnoHana, etc., Being the cold person that i am, I did not shed a single tear, leading to my friends calling me a cold monster. After watching episode 1 of white album 2, i immediately got my hopes up of finally shedding a tear from watching anime.There is nothing special about the story. It is a typical school setting with a club about to be dispanded. Events occur and eventually, three best friends come together and a love triangle is formed as their friendship is tested by their love. What is special about this series is its pacing of the story. The first 5-6 episodes not only progresses the story further, but plays a great role in character development and makes each of the characters lovable and unique. More onto the characters later. The art and animations are good. The music used in the series immediately became my all-time favorite. The club the three friends are in the Light Music Club, so a lot like K-on, the group plays a series of songs, and like i mentioned earlier, the songs became one of my alltime favorites. I mentioned earlier about how the characters are good in the series. Well The male lead is Kitahara Haruki, a reliable and dependable student, whose, umm, not that good at the guitar. He practices every day with a mysterious student next door which happens to be Kazusa Touma a prodigy at music. One day, a beautiful voice by Setsuna Ogiso joins the group as the story goes on. I won't go into detail about the characters. You'll have to see it for yourself. The enjoyment, ahh yes. I have to say, this is one of the best drama romances i have seen yet( and ive seen a lot) With an average story, good art, great sound, awesome characters, and a unique form of enjoyment, I see it fair to give this anime a 9.

If you have never watched White Album 1 or is discouraged to watch White Album 2 because of all the criticism towards White Album 1 then forget all that and jump straight into White Album 2. That\'s what i did; i have never watched White Album 1. The only reference from White Album 1 would be the song, ""White Album.""White Album 2 can be described as, beautiful....It is a tear jerking anime that leaves you with pain in your chest. That\'s how good of an anime this is.Story (8):A student with a bright future picks up a guitar and continues playing it despite how horrible he is at it. This deepens his relationship with a delinquent who\'s a genius musician. This also leads to an encounter with the school idol who has a beautiful voice. Dreams sprout but the drama within the love triangle causes all sorts of pain between the characters and even the people watching the anime. It is a simple story that goes by very fast because of how it is limited to 13 episodes but it would not have made it any better if this was dragged on into a 24 episode series. It is perfect as is even though i did not rate it as a 10.Art (10):The anime is just beautiful. The art style, scenery, characters, everything. The only words or word that i can come up with to describe the art is the word ""beautiful.""Sound (10):This is an anime focused on music. Normally i wouldn\'t bother writing anything about the sound. The music they\'ve used for this anime matches the emotions that are in the atmosphere. The music that the three play is soothing and easy to listen to. The seiyuu\'s voices match their characters. What amazes me even more is that usually when a character sings in an anime, the voice sounds different than their usual voice but it\'s not the case for this anime.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6fPKWWiFIMHere is a 4 min youtube video that gives a good sample of the art and the music.""White Album"" by Setsuna Ogiso (one of the female leads)Characters (9):The two heroines are easily likeable. It\'s hard to decide which one you want to ""win."" There are times where you pick one but then something happens and it sways your decision. The MC is likeable too although people might disagree due to how he handled things and what happens near the end. That is if you do not put any thought into why he did what he did. If people think about what choices he had and everything, the MC can be forgiven or at least not hated. There are only a few supporting characters and they were pretty much unimportant until near the end.Enjoyment (x):I did not rate the enjoyment of this anime. Like i said, this anime is beautiful but tear-jerking and even painful to watch. It\'s hard to enjoy feeling the pain of the ""feels"" of the anime but that\'s what makes this anime so good too.Overall (9):One of the most beautiful animes I\'ve seen. The combination of the art and sound flows well with the story and sways your emotions. The love triangle is hard to handle due to the circumstances of the bond between the three. The only spoiler that i believe is okay to tell you all is that throughout the anime, many viewers have the feeling of ""School Days"". I totally agree that i had the ""School Days"" feeling throughout the whole anime but don\'t worry it is not like School Days. It is just heart retching, that\'s all. It is a tear jerking anime that leaves you with pain in your chest. That\'s how good of an anime this is.Story (8):A student with a bright future picks up a guitar and continues playing it despite how horrible he is at it.

Love compels, love pulls, love creates, love destroys - I would argue love is the most powerful human force. White Album 2 ignores the typical Hollywood-esque bland high school romances and sets in motion the most feels I've had in recent memory.This won't be like my typical reviews, in that I break down each and every category. I'm just going to pour my heart out by saying, if you want to feel something move inside you, watch this beautiful anime....There are some cheeky, corny moments, as well as a few archetypal and stereotypical characters, but once the story gets rollin' (oh, it goes by so fast) you soon forget.Though i can't personally relate to any of the characters, the way the story progressed made them see so real. Cartoon references aside, I felt each and every character's sharp emotional responses, and since the story is set in senior year of high school (not too long ago from my own life) and the finality of it all, it helps solidify a very personal view of each character.Perhaps the most surprising theme is the music. I enjoyed the songs, the piano, everything was well written and well put together. The background music, the songs, the opening...everything just screamed well done.If I haven't convinced you already, please just watch it. 13 episodes, you can finish it in a day or two if you have nothing better to do, especially in the summer.It was an emotional rollercoaster I normally would refuse to ride. But it's a ride I'll never forget. Haruki, Sestuna and Touma. Names that'll stick with me, forever. Look, it's snowing outside.

The main isse I had with the anime was the lack of content, for me the pace was too quick for such dramatic love triangle unfolding before my eyes.That's where the main adaptation, the game, comes and solves the issue.After thoroughfully getting through the game I can say with peace of mind, that this show is really one of the better romance series with actual DRAMA in it.The plot is heavy, but not overwhelming. In this love...triangle every character has it's own personality, they are hiding their true feelings, making decisions in the heat of the moment. Making assumptions that are not necesarrily correct and making choices that affect their relationships with each other.It is not your normal show where you know everything about the characters and all you can do is try to understand them with every minute of the showing.The anime adaptation is OK. The art, soundtrack, and especially lack of Kitahara's inner monologues creates a gap in quality... And lets not forget the fact, the anime shows the first, introductory part so it is obvious it won't be as good as main chapter where the real work begins.You can't grasp the delight of this fenomenal plot with just the anime and my poor ability to write reviews, so you need to finish the game yourself. Still, personally with many finished shows and especially romances on my account, with all content considered, I see White Album 2 as one of the best romance titles I've ever seen. triangle every character has it's own personality, they are hiding their true feelings, making decisions in the heat of the moment.

I've watched this anime because some guy said that this was the best romance anime he've ever seen, I hope I don't live enough to watch the worst.Like every other VN adapted anime, White Album 2 suffers from some pacing problems, especially towards the end, but I don't blame the anime for it.The story until the last episodes is your everyday happy-go-round highschool romcom, they tried introducing some musical drama to the plot but...failed miserably, I mean: a rookie in guitar playing that after a week of training is soloing like a God? A prodigy multi-instrumentist that plays mediocre piano at best? And last but not least let's not forget the oh-so-natural talent for Setsuna to sing in autotune. C'mon production guys, you could've done it better.The characters are really bland, really really bland. They only showed some backstory for one of the main heroines (and they've done it only on the last episodes), the other one was a literal selfish moeblob. The main character is the classic cliché VN harem protag: a righteous, earnest, honest boy but with average looks.The OST is repetitive and mediocre, there are some moments that the anime tries really hard to get emotional by putting some sad music (with violins and piano obviously) and some character crying/angry, it doesn't work for me at least, and I cry very easily.I didn't bother to watch White Album 1 so I don't know the context of some songs featured here (like the so called White Album song) but the music played on the anime was pretty bad. The melody was weak, lyrics were nonsense (yeah, I know they played a part on the plot, still bad though) and the singer is mediocre at best.The seiyuu work here is plain bad, the serious tsundere has a serious tsundere voice and the moeblob has moeblob voice, what a surprise. I don't know why but it feels like a really cheap production anime hearing the character voices, the overly dramatic screams and the EEEEHHHHH contribute to this impression I had.The character art is good though, but nothing to write home about. The direction and animation per se were plain and mediocre.TL;DR: The story is not good, characters are bland, OST is forgettable when not annoying, seiyuu work is plain bad, art is decent.

Everything flowed nicely, and stayed empowered right to the end. Thankfully White Album 2 did not suffer from '13 episode syndrome' as I like to call it. We as viewers were treated to something magical with this. Nothing was left to short, as well nothing was overdrawn. The progression of the Story, the Artistic feel, the Sounds, the Character development and perseverance and the overall Enjoyment.To touch on the Story a bit more. Firstly I love how they handled a...delicate aspect of a mature love triangle and didn't give it any gimmicks. Kept it strong and flowing from the start to the end. Along with the maturity of the Anime itself, didn't seem too corny, it all fell into perfect harmony. Secondly I really enjoyed that there was no letting up on the throttle. We didn't start running, we got to build up to it. There was no slowing down. The way the Story was handled did nothing but wonders for the Enjoyment I received from WA2, every minute of it I will cherish.To reiterate on the Art and Sound from this Anime. Well let's get the fact that music plays a large part into the plot, it wasn't too in your face. The Sounds and music we got treated to were nice. We didn't get that over used sound byte(s) that I've seen far too much. As well the songs were all perfectly executed. The main stick out from the OST in WA2 was it's OP. For the Artistic views. Well it was simple in design, but dynamic in effect.Personally my favorite asset of WA2 was the Characters. The way each Character was introduced. The way the three main characters were further developed, and the back story of Kazusa affection towards Haruki. The design of each Character was nice as well, the design seemed to fit with the personality we were given. I was able to connect with the three main characters, I felt as if I was in the shoes of all three. delicate aspect of a mature love triangle and didn't give it any gimmicks.

The title alone would give most people pause; White Album 2? What of White Album 1? Well, it would appear (correctly) that White Album 1 is not needed to watch this show. It takes place about 10 years after White Album 1 with a whole different set of characters; the protagonists of WA 1 are only referred to in passing, when they are credited with song names. The songs actually serve more purpose than the characters who originally sang them do.I heard the stories and the murmurs...of those who were saying back in 2013 that this was the greatest anime drama ever produced. I try and keep my hype and expectations low for such things, having been disappointed by far too many shows in the past. But being a sucker for romance and drama I couldn\'t pass this up. So I sat down on a Sunday and watched all 13 episodes to understand what I was missing. And I sure as hell was missing a LOT.StorySo where do we start? At the beginning? Sure. From the very beginning of the show it almost looks to be nothing special. What, just another band anime where someone is trying to make their ""dreams"" come true? Boring. Seen it a thousand times. NEXT. But no, it teases you. Sucks you in with the concert at the beginning and then the flashback to how it started. The dream has been realized, but you don\'t know how or why. I give credit to Satelight for making a premise that has been tried time and again and making something fresh out of it. I have to say though, some of the story did tend to trend towards odd decisions made by characters that were most likely left out of the VN due to time constraints. Unfortunately it makes for a less than perfect story.As for how the whole story goes up until that concert at the beginning is a different story. The only spoiler you could find is that it is indeed a romance so yes, there will be romance in between here and there. And yes it is a drama so there will be drama, etc. etc. It\'s impossible to tell you how the story is without you having watched it. It\'s something words can\'t convey, it\'s ""you had to be there"". It\'s wonderful and it\'s dramatic.ArtTalk about a beautiful show. Whether it be looking out on a crowd, a snowy mountain, or a simple still shot from the top of the school, the imagery and camera angles do wonder to tell the story. Some scenes look almost movie quality and the characters are all very pretty. And the HAIR seems to be quite the focus. Flipping, twirling, falling down naturally, it is definitely something the animators spent a lot of time on.My only small criticism with the art is probably more of a criticism of the original artistic choices. You\'re always reminded that you\'re indeed watching an anime due to the somewhat odd physics of some characters\' hair. It doesn\'t seem to fall naturally and I\'m not sure how many naturally orange or green haired girls Japan has. Regardless this is as minor as minor can be, but something big enough to irk me.SoundA music show with good sound. Who would have guessed. A fantastic use of vocal songs sung by the characters themselves combined with intense piano pieces and the oh so familiar ""song being sung while montage happens."" This happens more than once in the show but it\'s a show about a band who is making music. Of course there\'s going to be an abundance of music; for a 13 episode show the OST in its entirety has about 60 tracks. Some J-pop, some piano, some background music.I can\'t find a criticism with the sound itself. Nothing sounded ""generic"" or boring. It was used perfectly to set the mood when it was needed and blended seamlessly with the show when there was the need for it. Never a silent moment. Plus, it fit the mood of the season. All is white during the Christmas season and there\'s that specific tone of music you just HAVE to have. And the show hits the nail on the head, time and time again.CharacterWe have three main characters who feel utterly real. The biggest fault is that the main character could be seen as one of those normal, generic, nice guy MCs but he\'s given enough personality that the viewers can actually care about him. He has his passions and his desires and his faults. He\'s not perfect but he\'s not a helpless little child. We have the good girl who is the school\'s sweethart, surprisingly shy given her status, with the beautiful voice. And we have the n\'er-do-well anti-establishment bad girl who appears cold, distant, and cruel.But even though you could shoehorn them all into a character archetype it wouldn\'t be fair to the characters who feel so utterly real. Their struggles and their emotions are all conveyed so well to the viewers that they appear as any teenager would - brash, foolish, full of hope for the world. And that\'s why I enjoyed them. I love those characters you can relate to with life experience. The struggles that feel REAL.OverallIf you want a drama THIS is a drama. Nothing comes close in terms of quality. This should be the poster child for years to come about romance and drama and how the two of them blend together. There\'s no telling how each individual person will feel by the end of the show; of course, it\'s something each person has to experience for themselves. Anyone who has ever loved another person will understand these characters and what they\'re going through. Anyone who has ever been a TEENAGER will understand.This show should absolutely be viewed by anyone who even has a passing interest in drama or romance. Say what you will about your tastes and what\'s interesting to you, but the show, the director, and all the staff who worked on it deserve praise in turning what could have EASILY been a generic visual novel adaptation into one of the mostly highly praised works of 2013. of those who were saying back in 2013 that this was the greatest anime drama ever produced.

I should keep silence now but I need to express myself, need to tell people why I can\'t understand this show is so underrated in comparison to Shitgatsu.I\'ve watch White Album 2 in one day for two reasons. The first one is because I want to do it, that\'s a bit my chrismast gift ( I\'m too poor to bought reals presents, see ? ). And the second reason is because I\'ve enjoy it so much that my eyes can\'t unhook from the...screen. The second I\'ve hear those three characters playing and singing together, I was totally charmed.So, enough talking about myself, let me tell why this, ladies and gentleman, is not a masterpiece but close to.Story - 7Well, the story.It\'s a bit classical at the beginning but get really good in the second part.Because I\'ve separated the anime in two parts, the before part and the after part. The ""before"" part is focusing on learning, training and mostly form relationship between the protagonist. I really love the way they met, It was outstanding. Well, I\'m maybe getting a little excited now because It wasn\'t ""awesome"". In fact, It was almost boring, just like a generic school life start. But, over the clichés, I\'ve found my drug in the following events and then, It was really good. The main characters get to know them better, but in a really good atmosphere. They\'re practicing music, and that\'s all. There we are, why I love WA2 so much. The characters aren\'t doing some random shits to make some fan service, no, they are doing what they are working for, the high school fair and mainly them light music club.This part is good, really good but It can\'t beat the ""after"" part, who\'s happening after the concert ( Flash forward in the episode 1 and for real in episode 7 ).Well, it\'s a psychological part and I don\'t know why, it\'s often compared to School Days. God, I\'m gonna kill the first one who dare to say it. Yes, there is a love triangle, yes this is drama but no, it\'s not about killing and no, the male main character is not a dick like that Makoto faggot. fuu~Well, I can\'t really tell you without spoiling so I\'m gonna be clear.This is probably six of the best episode I\'ve ever seen and I was enjoying it as hell. It\'s deep and not trying to be some soft romance, no, It bears with real thematics, being very harsh, maybe gritty by times. But well, it was great, all the ways to the ending. And let\'s talk about it, the ending. Well, It makes totally sense and in some way, It couldn\'t be otherwise. I wasn\'t frustrated, not happy too, just a bit sad.So yeah, the story is such rich in revelations, plot twist and entertaining dialogs. And god, the drama is good, it\'s good at a point I can\'t even define.Art - 7At the first thought, I was thinking of WA2 like some Kyo Anim or P.A Works production. But well, it\'s Satelight, a studio I wasn\'t knowing before. And so, I found the art legit. Yeah, it\'s correct for a 2013 anime, really. I kinda love the character design. The sceneries are beautiful, with a ""palette très vive"" like we say in France. It means colorful, a pleasure to eyes. And so, the animation was very fluid even if, like it\'s a VN adaptation, it was more talking than moving.Sound - 9God, that was gorgeous.When, in the first episode, I got to hear the piano + guitar + voice version of White Album, I totally fell in love with and while I\'m writing these lines, I\'m still listening to. The OST in itself is not a masterpiece but just that god damn song is suffisiant to satisfy me. The opening is good, the endings are great, all of them. Well, for a music-related anime, bad music is impossible, don\'t you think ?Character - 9Kazusa Touma is my japanimation\'s favorite character, since her first appearance. Why ? Because I love her cold but thoughtful way to think, her honesty, her look and every single fiber from her body. Well, I\'m maybe getting a bit creepy so .. AHEM. I truly love that character, that was a blessing to see her playing or just chatting with the others. She\'s bad at school but had a lot of qualities to erase her difficulties and stubborn mind. For the others, It wasn\'t super good but well, It wasn\'t bad at last. Haruki is a straight boy, who\'s lecturing others but with some reasons. He\'s not dishonest and always try to do the best for his friends or people in general. That guy is, I think, the perfect male protagonist for this type of anime, with love triangle. And ... then, I don\'t really like Setsuna. Not because of her choices in the late story but I don\'t really like her way to do act, nothing more.But hell, finally an anime who\'s focusing on the protagonists and not on a supporting useless casting. It was just perfect for that kind of anime, really.Enjoyement - 10Yeah, a 10. I\'ve never give a ten to any anime. The overall is a 8 because the story wasn\'t perfect but If I could rate by enjoyment, It mostly would be a ten. I was in love with this anime and I can\'t even hear people who are praising jus average animes like Shigatsu who bet everything in tearjerker, not giving enough stake to the story. It\'s sad, very sad and that\'s why I love if people start looking animes by another way than rating.Overall - 8WA2 is not perfect, WA2 is not a masterpiece but damn, WA2 is an excellent anime. I can recognize the defaults and yes, there\'s a lot of defaults in this anime but maybe less than others school-life musical stories. Yeah, you\'ll maybe dislike it because It\'s too slow to reach the climax or characters don\'t fit with the tastes of yours. But well, it\'s such a great anime at my eyes and I\'m not gonna drop my opinion because of weebs legion. Coming for me, I\'m defending my kingdom. screen. The second I\'ve hear those three characters playing and singing together, I was totally charmed.So, enough talking about myself, let me tell why this, ladies and gentleman, is not a masterpiece but close to.Story - 7Well, the story.It\'s a bit classical at the beginning but get really good in the second part.Because I\'ve separated the anime in two parts, the before part and the after part. The ""before"" part is focusing on learning, training and mostly form relationship between the protagonist. I really love the way they met, It was outstanding. Well, I\'m maybe getting a little excited now because It wasn\'t ""awesome"". In fact, It was almost boring, just like a generic school life start. But, over the clichés, I\'ve found my drug in the following events and then, It was really good. The main characters get to know them better, but in a really good atmosphere. They\'re practicing music, and that\'s all. There we are, why I love WA2 so much. The characters aren\'t doing some random shits to make some fan service, no, they are doing what they are working for, the high school fair and mainly them light music club.This part is good, really good but It can\'t beat the ""after"" part, who\'s happening after the concert ( Flash forward in the episode 1 and for real in episode 7 ).Well, it\'s a psychological part and I don\'t know why, it\'s often compared to School Days. God, I\'m gonna kill the first one who dare to say it. Yes, there is a love triangle, yes this is drama but no, it\'s not about killing and no, the male main character is not a dick like that Makoto faggot. fuu~Well, I can\'t really tell you without spoiling so I\'m gonna be clear.This is probably six of the best episode I\'ve ever seen and I was enjoying it as hell. It\'s deep and not trying to be some soft romance, no, It bears with real thematics, being very harsh, maybe gritty by times. But well, it was great, all the ways to the ending. And let\'s talk about it, the ending. Well, It makes totally sense and in some way, It couldn\'t be otherwise. I wasn\'t frustrated, not happy too, just a bit sad.So yeah, the story is such rich in revelations, plot twist and entertaining dialogs. And god, the drama is good, it\'s good at a point I can\'t even define.Art - 7At the first thought, I was thinking of WA2 like some Kyo Anim or P.A Works production. But well, it\'s Satelight, a studio I wasn\'t knowing before. And so, I found the art legit. Yeah, it\'s correct for a 2013 anime, really. I kinda love the character design. The sceneries are beautiful, with a ""palette très vive"" like we say in France. It means colorful, a pleasure to eyes. And so, the animation was very fluid even if, like it\'s a VN adaptation, it was more talking than moving.Sound - 9God, that was gorgeous.When, in the first episode, I got to hear the piano + guitar + voice version of White Album, I totally fell in love with and while I\'m writing these lines, I\'m still listening to. The OST in itself is not a masterpiece but just that god damn song is suffisiant to satisfy me. The opening is good, the endings are great, all of them. Well, for a music-related anime, bad music is impossible, don\'t you think ?Character - 9Kazusa Touma is my japanimation\'s favorite character, since her first appearance. Why ? Because I love her cold but thoughtful way to think, her honesty, her look and every single fiber from her body. Well, I\'m maybe getting a bit creepy so .. AHEM. I truly love that character, that was a blessing to see her playing or just chatting with the others. She\'s bad at school but had a lot of qualities to erase her difficulties and stubborn mind. For the others, It wasn\'t super good but well, It wasn\'t bad at last. Haruki is a straight boy, who\'s lecturing others but with some reasons. He\'s not dishonest and always try to do the best for his friends or people in general. That guy is, I think, the perfect male protagonist for this type of anime, with love triangle. And ... then, I don\'t really like Setsuna. Not because of her choices in the late story but I don\'t really like her way to do act, nothing more.But hell, finally an anime who\'s focusing on the protagonists and not on a supporting useless casting.

I'm an absolute sucker for sad, bittersweet endings so I am absolutely biased in this regard.I went into this anime with zero expectations;...I know that it's an adaptation of a VN but never got the chance to play it.The anime's beginning is quite slow and doesn't really start to ramp up until later, but man oh man is it worth it. If we're talking story, then there are two aspects to it; the beginning that sees the formulation of the band is the first, but it's merely a plot device to highlight the real story, the romance. The romance is a complex web of lies, selfishness, and miscommunication on each characters' behalf, but really, that's what makes it so good, because it captures the self-centredness of what it means to be a high schooler in love. This 'romance' encapsulates each characters' agendas, motivations, backstories, and most importantly, their reasonings, all of which are perfectly portrayed and explained.It is very easy to empathise with all three main characters, but it is also quite easy to become frustrated with many of their actions, such as Haruki instantly accepting Setsuna's confession despite his doubts (dick move), Setsuna constantly emphasising the importance of their friendship despite being aware that she forced her feelings onto Haruki, and Touma for not speaking up at all about her feelings. These are just a few examples but you get my point, despite this, however, all of their actions are what makes it all the more real and heartbreaking, because there are layers to each of their personalities as characters.In short, Haruki is a people pleaser and goes with the flow, however, he slowly but surely grows a pair and decides what he wants. Setsuna is selfish, yet honest, her insistence that all three stay friends is guilt on her part for taking Haruki away from Touma. She means well, but, she just ends up hurting herself even more. Touma is in the same boat as Setsuna, because of her standoffish personality she ends up hurting herself even more (despite winning in the end), but, it's revealed that underneath her cold exterior, she is fragile and pitiful, basically just Setsuna on the inside. These aren't criticisms of the anime, however, instead, these are what make the anime such a masterpiece of melodramatic high school romance.One of the most memorable scenes that has stuck with me is after the graduation ceremony, wherein Setsuna informs Haruki that Touma had just left. The absolute panic and desperation Haruki felt as he was searching for Touma was heartwrenching. How Takeya grabs Haruki's shoulder as he's about to search for her and the defeated look Setsuna gives him as he momentarily turns around before regrettably running off is a melodramatic masterpiece. That one very scene symbolised how fragile Setsuna and Haruki's relationship was, how fragmented Haruki''s and Setsuna's state of mind and feelings were, and how the whole relationship was a facade to begin with.Story: 9/10 (Slow start, but it's definitely worth it)Art: 7/10 (Understandable, however, as it is an early 2010s anime)Sound: 10/10 (From the OP, ED, and BGM, everything just fit so well)Character: 10/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 10/10 Wish my love life was just as melodramatic and bittersweet as this :'(This anime has convinced me to play the visual novel, which I heard is even more heartwrenching and tear-inducing (wish me luck).

Thankfully White Album 2 (WA2 for short), does not join the countless series in its genre, whose plot revolves around useless plot devices, excessive fanservice, and little to no character development. White Album 2 is an excellently told romantic drama that isn't afraid to stab you right in the emotions and then twist the knife just to be sure.The Story:White Album 2 revolves around three separate individuals whose lives, by the cruel string of fate, meet one Fall afternoon. Two anharmonic sounds - a sad piano and...a lonely guitar, are brought together by one angelic voice, singing on top of the school roof. The three soon decide to make a band, and as the story progresses, form a deep friendship, which eventually turns into a love triangle by the middle of the story. Unlike other shows in its genre, who put love above friendship, White Album 2 outshines its peers by showing a more realistic view. In WA2, the level of importance of the two heroine's friendship is on the same level of importance as the romance each one of them desires with Haruki.The Characters:At the beginning of the story, each of the characters are generically portrayed. The school idol, tsundere, and plain protagonist are all cliche character archetypes abused in countless of comedies/harems. As the story progresses, and the characters develop, we see that they are not as perfect as they seem. Each character has their own flaws and weaknesses, and they do downright terrible things to each other throughout the course of the show. But it is because of these flaws and weaknesses that these characters can be best described as human. It is through this humanity that the viewer feels for the characters, and knows just how much they want to be with each other. We come to realize that they all have the best of intentions, but they let their feelings rule over logic, which is a surefire recipe for disaster.Art/Music:As expected of an anime whose core focus is the music, the art and music overall is top-notch. The character designs are pleasing to look at, the backgrounds are detailed, and the color palette of the show fits perfectly with its theme. There are no complaints for this section.Conclusion:Brilliantly told and flawlessly executed, White Album 2 is a show that all future adaptations should strive for. It has a simple premise, yet it delves much deeper than that. It is a show that will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. The emotions that it will leave in your heart will linger there long after the final credits of episode 24 roll past. It is a show that will leave you thinking and at the edge of your seat. A truly unpredictable emotional rollercoaster that will capture your heart from its very first scene, and leave you scarred and longing for more at its last. a lonely guitar, are brought together by one angelic voice, singing on top of the school roof.

I consider it by far the best series I have ever watched in my entire life. I went through joy and pain while watching this and I shed my very first tears just watching this. (Maybe because it reminded me of my first love)Well yeah. Story? Simply said, a love triangle between a boy, who just in his nature itself is kind and friendly to others, and two girls, Setsuna and Toumou. Consequences? Girls fall in love with him. I personally disliked how the MC dealt with this problem, but...I suppose that's what made this extremely good.As a viewer you'll be able to grab out some hints on how the plot will develop, but I personally loved how they displayed the show not only in one perspective, but in two somewhere in two episodes when the series came near to the end.Toumou's behind story was phenomenal in my opinion and you could just see why she just had to fall for him.Anyways, this was my first review and I hope it'll help some of you get into this series and go through the same experience that I did.10/10 for me.

Depending on the person, these relationships (wether romantic ones or not) will be hard at certain points of it. Some will have trouble engaging and starting one, others will have a hard time facing and overcoming certain things, and well, others will even go through tough times making the decision to end these relationships. It is indeed a very difficult thing, and you can see people\'s ""flaws"" and acting irrationally when these things happen. The ""right"" decision is always easy to see on paper, but acting accordingly is harder than you ever thought.Welcome to...White Album 2, a romantic drama that focuses heavily on human romantic relationships, and accepting and embracing our own flaws in order to go on and grow up in an emotional and empathic way.The story follows a high school guy who\'s trying hard to recruit new members into his music club, as the former members suddenly abandoned him, apparently because the lack of ambition and goals. Just about dropping his motivations completely, he starts roaming around the school, only to find two enormously talented and beautiful girls, who inspire him and give him back his hype, wanting to go all in for the music festival.The story will find its course by showing you how they start spending a lot of time with each other, trying hard to give their best into the festival working together. And of course, creating close bonds.The plot finds its peak when we can celarly see the characters true colors, having hard times making decisions that are written in their own morals, but are extremely hard to execute, as they would severely hurt their own happiness and desires. And this is, in my opinion, the strongest point in WA 2. It shows you clearly the kind of people we can be when our own desires are in danger, and deep inside we are all selfish at some point. The emotions are very relatable and you get to care for the characters, even when they do what they do.I usually enjoy anime\'s that have this ""dark"" atmosphere and emotional tension a lot. And the struggle that you see in the characters was something we have all been through. I suggets you to watch this if you enjoy some realistic drama and relantionships (not character) development.

I suggets you to watch this if you enjoy some realistic drama and relantionships (not character) development.', '(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[Synopsis]: With the school festival only a few weeks away and his light music club disbanded the armature guitarist Kitahara Haruki (Mizushima, Takahiro) seems to be out of luck until one day, while playing in the music room, a melodious voice coming from the roof of the school harmonizes with his instrument. Along with the enigmatic piano playing coming from the next music room over, the resulting song inspires Haruki to recruit Ogiso Setsuna (Yonezawa, Madoka) and Touma Kazusa (Nabatame, Hitomi) in order play at the upcoming festival as a newly reformed light music club.[Characters]:As the show...is a romantic drama I would normally say that the characters were the centerpiece of the show and that their characterization is what made the show what it is however I actually found that the story as well as the show’s music elements made up a good deal of the show’s strength as well and so while the characters were compelling they were not the sole strength of the show. The cast itself is fairly small – I might even argue too small in that, outside of the main trio of characters, the side characters seem to only appear at the show’s convenience and are both low in number and lack any development throughout. That being said, they are not a negative influence on the show and the individual strength of the main characters more than makes up for the lackluster background cast.The protagonist, Kitahara Haruki, is an intellectual and one of the top students in his class as well as the former class president. He is kind in how he interacts with others and can be a bit intrusive in his attempts to get to know people however his intentions are good. While he is a good student he is only a mediocre guitar player having only picked up the instrument recently and his improvement with the instrument is a decent part of the first half of the show as the school festival approaches. His good qualities aside, his incompetence in the area of romance is in part responsible for some of the drama that arises in the show and is a generalization of some of the character flaws that he possesses that make him compelling as a romantic lead character. He thankfully avoids the stereotype of the thickheaded protagonist however he has shortcomings in this area none the less.The first of the two heroines of the show is Setsuna Ogiso who is, on the surface, a kind and cheerful person and having won the Miss Houhou content two years in a row she is treated as somewhat of a school idol. Ogiso herself is a bit more complex and her desire for close friends is perhaps one of the biggest driving forces within the plot as it complicates the relationship of the main trio in unique ways. She is the first of the two female members to join the light music club after Haruki discovers her on the roof of the school.The second heroine is Touma Kazusa, a musical genius and the source of the piano playing from music room 2. She either skips or sleeps through the majority of her classes as her interests lie elsewhere however Haruki causes her to be more involved in her school life and interact with him and Ogiso. Like Ogiso she is kind however this trait is not immediately observable behind her tough appearance and her persistence and ruthlessness serves as the driving factor behind Haruki’s improvement with the guitar as the school festival approaches.In order to avoid character spoilers I am required to be vague in this category however I will say that the compelling nature of White Album’s characters lies in their complications and missteps. The characters are very deliberately flawed in different ways and occasionally must choose between what is selfishly best for themselves and what is best for the person that they harbor affection for. The disparities in their actions and incomplete perceptions give form to their shortcomings as people and their character defects. Normally one might get angry at the thickheadedness of a character like Haruki or the flakiness of the heroines as, through the dramatic irony of the show, we can assess their own crude actions in a way they themselves cannot however White Album does a great job of providing the context for these missteps and decisions which I felt made them far more complex than aggravating in any way. The characters are free to be selfish – they are free to mess up and make mistakes and this freedom of character makes them feel alive within the plot and is probably the strongest attribute of the show.[Art/Animation]:While the city and school setting of White Album does not allow for much inventiveness in the art department it is executed at a perfectly acceptable level and there are no real quality drops throughout the course of the show. The character designs are fairly reserved which helped compliment the realistic nature of the show and grounded the characters in a more serious way than if they were more elaborate or flamboyant – their simplicity worked well within their dramatic setting. The animation was fluid and natural in its depiction. There wasn’t anything in this category that wow’d me in unexpected ways however the art does a fantastic job of executing the characters, emotion, and story and this way does it exactly what it needs to while avoiding any and all pitfalls.[Story]:One of the most surprising things about White Album 2 was the structure and progression of its story and plot. Typically I am far more invested in the characters in a romantic drama than the story itself which usually serves as more of a framework and point of reference for the character interactions however White Album I felt utilized its story to it’s full potential alongside a cast of good characters.I think the structure of the story contributes a good deal to it’s success as the first half of the show, which focuses on the upcoming school festival and Haruki’s guitar playing, is drastically different than the latter half. The first part of the show introduces us to the main characters and lays the groundwork for future drama and plot developments and is far more laid back than what follows. Things truly begin to unfold after the festival is over and the relationships of the three main characters become the central focus as we gain new insights and a retrospective appreciation for what has transpired thus far.This approach worked well for the show and the flashback elements of the show worked well to give us a sort of contextual reveal that complicated the latter half of the show magnificently – This allowed me to appreciate the show in simple ways for what it was initially and then forced me to partially reevaluate what I had seen before delving into the far more dramatic section of the show. One final thing I will commend the show for was its avoidance of melodrama despite how serious its tone became – the drama felt legitimate and real instead of feeling trivial by real world standards and again the character flaws and complications complimented this aspect of the show tremendously. You never truly feel that any one character is in the right and from time to time they each act somewhat inappropriately which causes the viewer to reassess their opinion of them in an ever more complicated relationship.[Music]:While the actual presence of music somewhat falls off in the second half of the show after the school festival is over it is still a large part of the show. The music the characters play in the show is good and the main recurring theme of ‘White Album’ was catchy enough to avoid getting old in my opinion. There is definitely emotional and sentimental work being done within the music of White Album and many of the pieces played as well as their lyrics offer additional commentary on the characters and their situations.The soundtrack was additionally good however I found that it had a slightly problematic habit of using only a few go-to songs during certain dramatic moments that caused them to grow a little tired before the end of the show. The songs themselves are powerful as emotional background however their repeated and predictable usage grew a little old at times. None the less, the music works hand in hand with the drama on screen to bring forth a genuine feeling of emotion and its presence is nothing if not beneficial.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:White Album surprised me in a variety of ways and I ended up liking it more than I thought I would after the slightly less involved first half of the show (that is by no means bad). It wasn’t afraid to explore the relationships of the characters even after the vocalization of the character’s feelings which some shows tend to act more coyly around. The serious tone and melancholic attitude of the show pushed it into a more appreciable place for me as a viewer and I was most happy with how it developed the characters in reasonable ways while avoiding melodrama.Rating: 7I gave White Album a 8 because of the numerous strengths of its characters and story and I don’t think it could be called anything less than ‘good’. What stops it from rising any higher I don’t feel is any fault of the show but more simply personal preferences and the unfortunate shortness of the show itself – The story felt comfortable in its 13-episode run and ended in a conclusive manner however because of how it ended as well as the lengthy nature of its source material I feel that the story could only benefit from additional content and development. Any great fan of the romantic drama genre I’m sure would fall in love with this show and perhaps grant it a higher score than 8 however I would consider this grade high praise.[Recommendations]:White Album 2 was most certainly worth the watch and its concise format makes it easily digestible in an afternoon or two. The show excelled quite predicatively in the areas of its romance and drama and so I would most primarily recommend the show for these reasons above all else. While the characters don’t quite exhibit complexity in the more classical sense of the word they do ultimately come off as being so and so any viewers interested in this character trait would do fine to pick up the show. Lastly, while the show has a decent amount of slice of life style episodes at the beginning, it is almost entirely devoid of comedy and so I would caution anyone who picks up these kinda of shows anticipating the infrequent gag or comedic bit as White Album takes itself fairly seriously throughout and doesn’t really have any comedic traits about it. is a romantic drama I would normally say that the characters were the centerpiece of the show and that their characterization is what made the show what it is however I actually found that the story as well as the show’s music elements made up a good deal of the show’s strength as well and so while the characters were compelling they were not the sole strength of the show.

His good qualities aside, his incompetence in the area of romance is in part responsible for some of the drama that arises in the show and is a generalization of some of the character flaws that he possesses that make him compelling as a romantic lead character. He thankfully avoids the stereotype of the thickheaded protagonist however he has shortcomings in this area none the less.The first of the two heroines of the show is Setsuna Ogiso who is, on the surface, a kind and cheerful person and having won the Miss Houhou content two years in a row she is treated as somewhat of a school idol. Ogiso herself is a bit more complex and her desire for close friends is perhaps one of the biggest driving forces within the plot as it complicates the relationship of the main trio in unique ways. She is the first of the two female members to join the light music club after Haruki discovers her on the roof of the school.The second heroine is Touma Kazusa, a musical genius and the source of the piano playing from music room 2. She either skips or sleeps through the majority of her classes as her interests lie elsewhere however Haruki causes her to be more involved in her school life and interact with him and Ogiso. Like Ogiso she is kind however this trait is not immediately observable behind her tough appearance and her persistence and ruthlessness serves as the driving factor behind Haruki’s improvement with the guitar as the school festival approaches.In order to avoid character spoilers I am required to be vague in this category however I will say that the compelling nature of White Album’s characters lies in their complications and missteps. The characters are very deliberately flawed in different ways and occasionally must choose between what is selfishly best for themselves and what is best for the person that they harbor affection for. The disparities in their actions and incomplete perceptions give form to their shortcomings as people and their character defects. Normally one might get angry at the thickheadedness of a character like Haruki or the flakiness of the heroines as, through the dramatic irony of the show, we can assess their own crude actions in a way they themselves cannot however White Album does a great job of providing the context for these missteps and decisions which I felt made them far more complex than aggravating in any way. The characters are free to be selfish – they are free to mess up and make mistakes and this freedom of character makes them feel alive within the plot and is probably the strongest attribute of the show.[Art/Animation]:While the city and school setting of White Album does not allow for much inventiveness in the art department it is executed at a perfectly acceptable level and there are no real quality drops throughout the course of the show. The character designs are fairly reserved which helped compliment the realistic nature of the show and grounded the characters in a more serious way than if they were more elaborate or flamboyant – their simplicity worked well within their dramatic setting. The animation was fluid and natural in its depiction. There wasn’t anything in this category that wow’d me in unexpected ways however the art does a fantastic job of executing the characters, emotion, and story and this way does it exactly what it needs to while avoiding any and all pitfalls.[Story]:One of the most surprising things about White Album 2 was the structure and progression of its story and plot. Typically I am far more invested in the characters in a romantic drama than the story itself which usually serves as more of a framework and point of reference for the character interactions however White Album I felt utilized its story to it’s full potential alongside a cast of good characters.I think the structure of the story contributes a good deal to it’s success as the first half of the show, which focuses on the upcoming school festival and Haruki’s guitar playing, is drastically different than the latter half. The first part of the show introduces us to the main characters and lays the groundwork for future drama and plot developments and is far more laid back than what follows. Things truly begin to unfold after the festival is over and the relationships of the three main characters become the central focus as we gain new insights and a retrospective appreciation for what has transpired thus far.This approach worked well for the show and the flashback elements of the show worked well to give us a sort of contextual reveal that complicated the latter half of the show magnificently – This allowed me to appreciate the show in simple ways for what it was initially and then forced me to partially reevaluate what I had seen before delving into the far more dramatic section of the show. One final thing I will commend the show for was its avoidance of melodrama despite how serious its tone became – the drama felt legitimate and real instead of feeling trivial by real world standards and again the character flaws and complications complimented this aspect of the show tremendously. You never truly feel that any one character is in the right and from time to time they each act somewhat inappropriately which causes the viewer to reassess their opinion of them in an ever more complicated relationship.[Music]:While the actual presence of music somewhat falls off in the second half of the show after the school festival is over it is still a large part of the show. The music the characters play in the show is good and the main recurring theme of ‘White Album’ was catchy enough to avoid getting old in my opinion. There is definitely emotional and sentimental work being done within the music of White Album and many of the pieces played as well as their lyrics offer additional commentary on the characters and their situations.The soundtrack was additionally good however I found that it had a slightly problematic habit of using only a few go-to songs during certain dramatic moments that caused them to grow a little tired before the end of the show. The songs themselves are powerful as emotional background however their repeated and predictable usage grew a little old at times. None the less, the music works hand in hand with the drama on screen to bring forth a genuine feeling of emotion and its presence is nothing if not beneficial.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:White Album surprised me in a variety of ways and I ended up liking it more than I thought I would after the slightly less involved first half of the show (that is by no means bad). It wasn’t afraid to explore the relationships of the characters even after the vocalization of the character’s feelings which some shows tend to act more coyly around. The serious tone and melancholic attitude of the show pushed it into a more appreciable place for me as a viewer and I was most happy with how it developed the characters in reasonable ways while avoiding melodrama.Rating: 7I gave White Album a 8 because of the numerous strengths of its characters and story and I don’t think it could be called anything less than ‘good’. What stops it from rising any higher I don’t feel is any fault of the show but more simply personal preferences and the unfortunate shortness of the show itself – The story felt comfortable in its 13-episode run and ended in a conclusive manner however because of how it ended as well as the lengthy nature of its source material I feel that the story could only benefit from additional content and development. Any great fan of the romantic drama genre I’m sure would fall in love with this show and perhaps grant it a higher score than 8 however I would consider this grade high praise.[Recommendations]:White Album 2 was most certainly worth the watch and its concise format makes it easily digestible in an afternoon or two. The show excelled quite predicatively in the areas of its romance and drama and so I would most primarily recommend the show for these reasons above all else. While the characters don’t quite exhibit complexity in the more classical sense of the word they do ultimately come off as being so and so any viewers interested in this character trait would do fine to pick up the show. Lastly, while the show has a decent amount of slice of life style episodes at the beginning, it is almost entirely devoid of comedy and so I would caution anyone who picks up these kinda of shows anticipating the infrequent gag or comedic bit as White Album takes itself fairly seriously throughout and doesn’t really have any comedic traits about it.', ""Let me tell you one thing in start that my favorite genre is slice of life with romance , drama.Story:Story is about Love triangle and how it progresses.

Naturally the music (even the background music) was of a high standard.

After that it becomes a generic, boring and painfully predictable piece of a class B romance.The story revolves around a musically skilled but socially inept daughter of a famous pianist, a school sweetheart that all the bays drool over and a pragmatic but dull af boy. Their...ambition to perform in a school festival, to become friends forever and the drama revolving around a love triangle. Pretty common stuff to be honest.As for the main cast…Haruki Kitahara - an intelligent, preachy, annoying at times but caring young man aka our resident moron. After all, what's a romance anime without one? To be honest, for the first 5 episodes I liked him as the protagonist. He was determined to achieve his goal, the fact that he actually had one set him above most of the protagonists, unfortunately after that it’s all downhill for him. He becomes a bland, goalless, passive character with a slight hint of a backbone late in the last episode.Kazusa Touma - A very skilled musically young woman. She sits next to Kitahara in class and sleeps most of the time while at school. She does have an attitude problem when it comes to most people and teachers. Her social skills are beyond horrendous, she’s unable to verbalise her own thoughts and feelings up until the last two episodes. Despite that, she's more than happy to take on the role of Kitahara’s music teacher. To be honest she’s the worst of all three main characters. She has a semi-sad backstory involving her famous mother but all in all she’s just a spoiled brat and changes very little across the show. The only thing that does change is that she actually grows a pair and confesses her feelings… in a dumb, roundabout way but I guess it still counts.Setsuna Ogiso - last of the three stooges. Setsuna is a pretty, vocally talented school sweetheart. She befriends Kitahara and Touma rather quickly and is the catalyst of change that starts with Touma and her ability to verbalise emotions. To be honest she’s the least annoying of the main cast. She’s straightforward and in her own twisted way, cares about her friends. She’s the most aware of the social dynamic between the main cast and does have some reservations about intruding but that doesn’t last long. The reason why I think she’s the best of tha main cast is that she’s not reserved like Touma and isn’t as dense as Kitahara. She even volunteers to play the villain (and fails) just so Kitahara can feel better about himself (which he doesn’t deserve, at this point he’s pretty much scum).The plot is divided into two distinct arcs. The Festival arc and whatever the hell the shit after is. Don’t get me wrong in a vacuum the second part of the show would be serviceable but contrasted to the first park it crashes and burns quite a bit. In the second part everyone loses their drive and motivation and focuses on keeping their friendship intact. Something that at this point is impossible and only Touma seems to realise that and even tries to step aside to let Kitahara and Ogiso have their space. It’s really badly written. EVERYTHING that happens in the second part could be avoided if Kitahara took some time before jumping into something he didn’t actually wanted.That’s why I have problems giving a proper numerical value to the show. The first part is properly written, nicely directed, has some good music and is all in all enjoyable. The second part (starting from episode 6) is a goddamn shit show. It’s like a whole different cast of people made that part. The writing is lazy, using only the most cliched tropes out there and relies almost entirely on plot armor and deus ex machinas for its development.I guess You can still watch this but after the first half get a drink to soften the blow. ambition to perform in a school festival, to become friends forever and the drama revolving around a love triangle.

The set up is pretty plain. Boy and two girls have fun, everyone falls in love, problems arise, as per your usual love triangle romance drama. Where this story shines is in the development of the events that follows post confession. I will not say more than that about what happens.Coming from someone who, excluding the musical talent, have been in this exact situation and first hand experienced about the exact same outcome as in this series. I really need to emphashize the realism...of the direction of which the story travels.Art: 9/10I loved the art. The lighting was increadible and the color palette changes beautifully to match the mood of scenes. Even if noses have a slight tendency to vanish at certain angles like in most anime, facial expressions are at a really high level in this anime. My only complaint about the animation lies with the handling of instruments.Sound: 8/10The op and end is great. The actual songs performed are increadibly solid(10/10). The underlaying soundtrack is also superb, BUT it's not as varied as I would like, mostly piano.Characters: 10/10Like previously stated the realism in this story is remarkable. That also goes for the characters. They all want to be happy, but they don't want to hurt others. They are kind and selfish. They make mistakes and try to make them right. I loved the characters and wanted them all to be happy. An amazing feat in a mere 13 episodes. What makes these characters stand out from alot of other romance anime I've seen is that their features are not over cooked. We don't have the super tsundere and stupidly shy female characters. And our MC doesn't get flustered at the sight of a female knee. They all have a mix of traits that you should easily recognize from real life.I've seen people brand some of the characters choises as too drastic for real life. But I can tell you from experience, they are frightenly realistic.Enjoyment: 11/10I had to watch all episodes straight after I passed episode 3. Related to characters and situations. Fell in love with the characters. And loved the show.I know there is no 11/10, but I want to point out that my personal experiences was not the reason for the 10/10. I would in all likelyhood have given this show 10/10 without them. Therefore, I added my experiences on top of that for a solid 11/10 because the show hit home as much as it did.Watch the show, look for the little things and allow yourself to be put in their positions. of the direction of which the story travels.Art: 9/10I loved the art.

This would then give rise to an imbalance to the overall character development.But White Album 2 (WA2) is a totally different thing.When I watched WA2. my first impression would be, 'it must be just like any other VN adaptation where there will be one winner'. but certainly that was proven wrong during the last episode. There were no winners, only three people who were broken.The story itself is about Kitahara Haruki, Touma Kazusa and Ogiso...Setsuna. Haruki, the main male lead was just a decent guitar player. Had always been the second guitarist. When the school festival was just around the corner, plus with the members pulling out from his club, he was on the verge pulling his club out of the festival itself. For him that time, nothing else mattered to him. Only practicing his guitar.Although practising alone, someone from the music room 2 always accompanied her, which is Kazusa. But he didn't know that. When these two were playing, Setsuna heard them and started singing along with it. And this was the start of the story.From the first moment of the anime, it had stated, the happiest moment was halfway of the story. Which is in fact true.All the characters showed almost realistic emotion in each situation. And for me, the one character that developed the most, was Setsuna. Yes she was the school idol and people would die to be her boyfriend. Haruki managed to get her. As an anime character, she was actually very realistic in the way she talked to Haruki and all.  But then again, everything is not what it seems.Kazusa is basically an anti-social girl who just wants to play piano. At first you would definitely think that she won't get Haruki. because not much was shown about her, but you know that there are more to it because how she acted and talked with Haruki felt more comfortable. You can feel that Haruki was more comfortable with Kazusa.At first you would never had guessed which one will be the main girl. You don't even know. But the anime itself made you feel Haruki's choice. And why he chose that person.After a certain episode, you would then see how little things could give you a huge impact, like they said, the little things matter the most. and you would start asking yourself, is she the one?This anime explores the depth of ones friendship and ones desire. How three friends who seemingly formed a love triangle with friendship on the line. And how evil can a person become when they are being selfish. All of this aspects were introduced in this anime.And as the result of that, everything crumbles to tiny pieces and can't be fixed. The beautiful friendship, now lost. For an anime adapted from a VN, this particular ending is very unique, and the fact that they managed to pull it off and the emotions made it through to the audience. It was brilliant. I could never ask for anything more that that.The music accompanying each scenes were executed perfectly and hit on the spot with the emotions. Even the H-scene was actually for me very emotional. They knew they can't be together forever, but for just one night, please let them be.The story, from episode 1 till 13 build up consistently. Towards the end, i can only say that the episodes were all solid episodes.If you love watching romance, and is trying to find something different, you can try watching WA2. If you are a Key fan, you should try this because i think, WA2 is on par with some Key animes. Sometimes, in life, not everything will go according to plan. and that was what the anime tried to convey.And it is true. Setsuna. Haruki, the main male lead was just a decent guitar player. Had always been the second guitarist. When the school festival was just around the corner, plus with the members pulling out from his club, he was on the verge pulling his club out of the festival itself.

At first you would definitely think that she won't get Haruki. because not much was shown about her, but you know that there are more to it because how she acted and talked with Haruki felt more comfortable. You can feel that Haruki was more comfortable with Kazusa.At first you would never had guessed which one will be the main girl. You don't even know. But the anime itself made you feel Haruki's choice. And why he chose that person.After a certain episode, you would then see how little things could give you a huge impact, like they said, the little things matter the most. and you would start asking yourself, is she the one?This anime explores the depth of ones friendship and ones desire. How three friends who seemingly formed a love triangle with friendship on the line. And how evil can a person become when they are being selfish. All of this aspects were introduced in this anime.And as the result of that, everything crumbles to tiny pieces and can't be fixed. The beautiful friendship, now lost. For an anime adapted from a VN, this particular ending is very unique, and the fact that they managed to pull it off and the emotions made it through to the audience. It was brilliant. I could never ask for anything more that that.The music accompanying each scenes were executed perfectly and hit on the spot with the emotions. Even the H-scene was actually for me very emotional. They knew they can't be together forever, but for just one night, please let them be.The story, from episode 1 till 13 build up consistently. Towards the end, i can only say that the episodes were all solid episodes.If you love watching romance, and is trying to find something different, you can try watching WA2. If you are a Key fan, you should try this because i think, WA2 is on par with some Key animes. Sometimes, in life, not everything will go according to plan. and that was what the anime tried to convey.And it is true."", '""My heart is being torn apart right in front of me, but everything seems to be my fault!!!""white album 2 is what appear to us as your typical adaptation of any other VN out there where to us will look like normal and not wanting to watch!!well i\'ll make it short White Album 2 (WA2) is one of those romance anime that catapult to top spot because of it\'s realism and outstanding animation, voice actors/tress, wonderful OP/ED and songs that will make you feel relaxit tackle what love really is?who to love?who to betray?this highlights that there is a fine line between friendship...and love, love and betrayal!character development and characters are very likable and well written!story is unique (like most of the people here i was wrong i thought this is like a remake of White album which is wrong totally wrong! )9/10 because of the ending well the anime is 1/3 of the total story (the anime series is part of the Introductory Chapter (IC) the nxt part is the Closing Chapter adn the last part is the Coda part). and love, love and betrayal!character development and characters are very likable and well written!story is unique (like most of the people here i was wrong i thought this is like a remake of White album which is wrong totally wrong! )9/10 because of the ending well the anime is 1/3 of the total story (the anime series is part of the Introductory Chapter (IC) the nxt part is the Closing Chapter adn the last part is the Coda part).', 'Sometimes sequels are not good. Especially those that carry the same title name, but have a completely new cast of characters, like in the other Aquaplus sequel: Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen (""Mask of Deception""). I really loved the old stories that Leaf Studios produced: the original Utawarerumono, the original White Album, To Heart 2. With the new spin-off titles and marketing, it seems like they are less focused on the quality of the story and more interested in how many lewd scenarios they can fit under one game title. It\'s infuriating! White Album 2 has less than deep character writing and more gaping contrivances, despite...being a beautiful-looking series⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersSo, basically, the three main characters decide to perform in a band together... seeing as the trio seems to be the only members to have joined their school\'s light music club. There are two attractive, teenage girls pining after one guy, nothing bad could possibly happen, right? I don\'t have a problem with shows being divorced from reality, I\'m a ""Symphogear"" fan, for God\'s sake! But, when characters are so obviously stupid or purposely oblivious to the concept of a bad idea, it doesn\'t work as a compelling drama!It\'s either a set-up to an erotic situation, like its source material, or a way to create forced drama. Imbecilic character writing only really works in horror stories, where there\'s a schadenfreude element towards a character ultimately being their own undoing, but it does not work in a drama... where you\'re actually supposed to like the characters! To start out, what girlfriend thinks it\'s a good idea to let her boyfriend spend the night at another girl\'s place, in the pursuit of ""music lessons""?If you don\'t know the story, despite the spoiler warning, early on... the protagonist (Haruki Kitahara) accepts the vocalist\'s (Setsuna Ogiso) confession, despite eyeballing the young, musical prodigy (Kazusa Tōma). What could possibly go wrong? Let\'s ignore the fact that Haruki progresses from only knowing a few chords on the guitar, to reaching Jimi Hendrix-levels of playing... in a single week — with all of that aside, he\'s practically living with someone other than his girlfriend, someone that the series has revealed to be wildly attractive and good at ※everything! She even has a more accomplished seiyū! How is that even fair?※Kazusa can pick up any instrument and play it seamlessly, because her mother is a professional musician. It is implied that she\'s some sort of savant.So, of course, Haruki is going to cheat on his girl-next-door girlfriend! It\'s frustrating how tilted the stage is, and it\'s even more infuriating, because the framing in the series makes it so convoluted, that you can\'t even see Setsuna as the hapless victim. Because at the end of the show, it reveals that she knew that the two of them had feelings for each other from the very start, even before she confessed to him! So, then, why push for them all to play together in a band? Why be so supportive, when your boyfriend is SPENDING THE NIGHT at another girls house, for days on end? Why even pretend to be shocked and dismayed by the news of the infidelity, if you knew that he was probably going to cheat on you from the very beginning?I really don\'t get it, why do people love ""White Album 2"" more than ""White Album""? Is it because it has a happy ending, without any consequences? The main character, Haruki, really doesn\'t get any repercussions or show any guilt for cheating on Setsuna! In fact, Kazusa tries to ignore her feelings for him and push him away, and he forcefully kisses her, despite her rejecting him. The ending made me want to ram my head through a wall! Which is sad, because I had high hopes for this series, because of the high production values and the endless stream of online adoration for it.Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Masaomi Andō (director), notable works:* Gakkōgurashi!

The reveal at the end of the series made me scratch my head a bit... a talented seiyū, despite the questionable character writing!Overall, this series was ingratiating.

The approach to Setsuna\'s whole character extrapolation felt like Ed\'s affair with Norma in ""Twin Peaks"" — except, that ordeal was intentionally framed to be ludicrous and immoral.

The story revolves around our 3 main characters: Kitahara, the class representative, Ogiso, the school idol, and Touma, the outcasted piano genius. The first 7 episodes are told in a flashback format so episode one introduces an event that happens at the end of episode 7 and episodes 1-6 detail the events that lead up to that...scene. In the first 7 episodes, we follow Kitahara as he tries to get a band together in time for the cultural festival. These episodes mainly function to establish Kitahara\'s relationship with the two girls. There\'s not much drama that happens here. The real drama in White Album 2 begins in episode 8. From here on, this is where the story really stands out. Unlike other anime with love triangles where the romance is all lovey-dovey, White Album 2 paints romance in a very realistic light. It does not try to tell us that love always has a happy ending, or that people will just cry and move on. Love gets wild and White Album 2 is not afraid to tell us that. Further, the anime doesn\'t only showcase romantic love. Because they are in the same band, Ogiso and Touma become friends. However, they find themselves eyeing the same guy. Can they both love the same man without hurting each other? The power of love can really test a friendship.White Album 2 has a very relatable cast. Although the anime has a relatively ""elite"" cast of members (a class president, a guy\'s dream girl, a piano prodigy, you can\'t get more ideal than that), they eventually become very down-to-earth, to put it crudely. In other words, their layers gradually get peeled off and in the center, their true desires are laid out for all to see. Kitahara has an outgoing and caring personality but he struggles with his feelings when he finds himself entangled in the love triangle. Ogiso has a pretty bubbly character who, as she admits, is selfish at times. Finally, Touma is very antisocial and as a result, has trouble expressing her feelings. As the characters develop, their human desires begin to surface and interestingly, the line between a fictional character and a real person began to blur. As the characters make their decisions, I began asking myself, would I have done anything different?In the art department, White Album 2 does a really good job. The animators did slack off during the performance scenes as it was mostly stills and simple movements, but they made it up with their stellar scenery. The best aspects of the scenery is exemplified through the lighting and in particular, the rays of the sun (those scenes left quite a lasting impact on me). In retrospect, the lighting reminded me of JJ Abrams\' lens flares (for those of you who are familiar with his work). The anime rests primarily on a mellow color palette, particularly any colour that goes well with the color of sunset.Since White Album 2 is primarily a music anime, the music has to shine and indeed, it did. The background music primarily consisted of strings and solo piano. Everything from the guitar rhythms to the piano solos were all beautifully composed. One standout song in the anime is called ""White Album."" It has a really catchy rhythm and I find myself humming this song throughout my day.  The OP had a great blend of the upbeat guitar and the melancholic lyrics. It has become one of my favourite anime openings of all time.White Album 2 was definitely an enjoyable anime. It takes a fresh approach to the standard romantic models. From the typical love triangle to the general character archetypes, it is always great to see an anime once in a while that throws these models aside and develop a sincere and real story. It is unfortunate that this show doesn\'t get enough publicity. For example, I was unable to find this title listed in any top 10 romance shows. White Album 2\'s story, characters, complexity have all captured my heart. If you are a big romance fan, you need to add White Album 2 to complete your romance anime list. If you are just looking for a great, realistic, and psychological story, you should go pick up this show right now.I definitely recommend White Album 2 to all anime viewers!Did this story speak to you in any way? If you want to discuss anything about this show, please drop me a comment! I would love to hear from you!! scene.

One standout song in the anime is called ""White Album."" It has a really catchy rhythm and I find myself humming this song throughout my day.  The OP had a great blend of the upbeat guitar and the melancholic lyrics. It has become one of my favourite anime openings of all time.White Album 2 was definitely an enjoyable anime. It takes a fresh approach to the standard romantic models. From the typical love triangle to the general character archetypes, it is always great to see an anime once in a while that throws these models aside and develop a sincere and real story. It is unfortunate that this show doesn\'t get enough publicity. For example, I was unable to find this title listed in any top 10 romance shows. White Album 2\'s story, characters, complexity have all captured my heart. If you are a big romance fan, you need to add White Album 2 to complete your romance anime list. If you are just looking for a great, realistic, and psychological story, you should go pick up this show right now.I definitely recommend White Album 2 to all anime viewers!Did this story speak to you in any way? If you want to discuss anything about this show, please drop me a comment! I would love to hear from you!!', ""If you want the heartfelt, warm romance anime that are typical of romance dramas nowadays, I suggest you stray from this one. Yet it is exactly those aspects of White Album 2 that makes it one of the best animes I have seen to date. The story is balanced and well-paced; the characters are not only relatable but dynamic. There is symbolism and emotion at every turn in the series. It is, without a doubt, an emotional rollercoaster, but the melancholic feeling that follows finishing the series and the story is one that is bitter yet also at closure.Beginning in episode 1, the story...grabs the attention of the viewer. Retrospect and flashback techniques are nice, but the anime lets you know this is not going to be the happiest. Without spoiling anything, the series and characters have you in suspense throughout the entire series. Al lot of this was mainly through the characterization of the Setsuna, Haruki, and Kazusa. Their dynamic was one that not only I could relate to, but one that evolves, breaks, and repairs itself. It was a real life model of what romance is really like, it's one that hurts, that thieves, that drives people to do things we don't understand. Each character had their own personality, different and complex, yet how they interacted and melded together was really the highlight of the story.Romance Dynamic: The three characters, Setsuna, Haruki, and Kazusa, are not just static characters. Nor do they hold the same traits throughout the series. By interacting with each other, they change and adapt. They fight, laugh, and love just like we would imagine doing in real life. In the end though, is it enough to let a problem get so big that it begins to hurt all three of them? This story has much more hidden under the surface than it seems. With every action, every interaction, the story changes, it becomes more of a living idea, it grows on itself. And the viewer can follow. They can understand why things are happening, as well as become frustrated at both the characters and story itself. A nice balance of the two lends itself well to the romance aspect and the characters as a whole, giving it even more of a realistic feel.Universal Ideals: Love is not a smooth road. It is filled with bumps, cracks, and turns. The decisions we make influence those around us, and sometimes change how we interact with others forever. There are words and actions that we regret, end up not taking, or change our lives. These are just some of the many universal ideas that one can take from watching White Album 2. Again, the writers and producers did an amazing job at incorporating a real life relationship complex into fiction, giving us dynamic characters that have more depth than we originally thought. Actions aren't just forgotten or wasted, they are beginnings of the chain reactions that can come back around if we aren't careful. Love is a dangerous and often disheartening game.The Ending: No spoilers here, but I will comment about the melancholic way the show ends. I have seen anime which end abruptly, without closure or giving the show proper justice. This is not one of those series. The producers end the show in a way that makes sense, one that's predictable, but not necessarily to the extent the audience would want. That being said, one of the greatest points of this anime is the ending, and I encourage those who finish watching it and complain about the ending to look back on WA2 as a whole. The dynamic of the entire show and its characters makes the ending perfectly clear and understandable. The story is a lot more serious and significant than one may think, especially toward the second half. It drives itself to the finish, piling on emotions and relationships one after another.That all being said, White Album 2 is amazing. While I won't comment on the art or sound (I mainly judge anime on its story and characters unless art or sound really detracts from the overall presentation), I will make the argument that this show takes real life implications of a complicated issue and spins it on its face. Romance, life, and choices. These are not small things in our society, so why shouldn't they be in the anime? Why shouldn't serious issues lead to serious consequences? The show does a marvelous job at integrating some of the things we don't like talking about in romance and putting characters and actions on them. We can feel and relate to the characters, we can imagine the story, and we can see the complex relationships and hardships that they go through. It reminds us how reckless, heartfelt, disappointing, rewarding, complex, heartbreaking, and bittersweet real love can be. An emotional roller coaster ride, a bittersweet and complex story, and lovable yet frustrating characters all contribute to me giving this series a 10/10. grabs the attention of the viewer.

I\'ve said everything I wanted to say. Now we know everything about each other. Though, from the moment we become friends, we\'ll never speak to each other again"" - Touma KazusaI was quite skeptical going into this show because of the fact that music anime is not my strong suit as well as the fact that the first season of this show left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite the first season lacking key elements that made it a grind for me to watch this does not hinder the fact that White Album 2 was quite enjoyable even more...so than I expected it to be. I love when any sequel to any anime can raise the bar from it predecessor and White Album 2 did just that with a completely different story only carrying over music that was used in the first season as a starting point and is the only connection that it makes to the prequel.Not only does White Album 2 bring elements to an anime that I enjoy as a viewer. It captivated me with the heart-wrenching drama it portrayed throughout the show, it made me sympathize with the characters I enjoyed and rooted for, and it taught me the value of friendships.... And how fragile they truly are.....Story: White Album 2 takes place in a traditional high school setting which is what I prefer in anime when realism, drama, and romance are what drive the story. We take the place of Haruki Kitahara who is part of the slowing dissipating club known as the ""Light Music Club"" and his dreams to someday play in the upcoming school festival. With his friends Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna by his side the story then unfolds as they together as a group must practice towards Kitahara\'s dream of playing in the the school festival through each of their own unique talents and skills. Let me admit this now so I can get this off my chest. Yes. It is a love triangle and with most love triangles things can seem quite predictable especially if you watch anime of this nature as is my favorite type of anime to watch on a regular basis; however, this doesn\'t mask the fact that this is a remarkable show for it seriousness and dark dramatic moments truly compensate for the traditional ""generic"" guidelines that this show has to follow. What I enjoyed most about this anime is sheer drama this show illustrates through these so called ""friendships"" the three of these characters share together. Selfishness, Betrayal, Love, and Friendship are the 4 main words I can use to describe this show and it does not disappoint those who want a good drama. We all know that when a love triangle is involved someone is bound to get hurt especially if someone breaks that triangle which is the fundamental reason why relationships stay in the friend zone all so that no ones feelings are hurt or left out. This show incorporates this ideal and blows it up ""dramatically""... Literally..... And is part of the reason why I enjoyed this anime so much. I love any anime that has genuine realism to it because it makes me ponder if ""This could actually happen?"" even though I know it\'s an anime which is why White Album 2 has such a compelling story from beginning to end.Characters: White Album 2 has 3 main characters that drive the show these characters being Haruki Kitahara who is our main male protagonist along with Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna who are our 2 female leads. Let\'s start with Haruki Kitahara, Kitahara overall is a genuine young man who cares for his friends and wants nothing but the best for them. Kitahara tries his hardest weather it be practicing guitar or helping someone out and this is what makes Kitahara a perfect target for someone to fall in love with. Next we have Touma (who is my personal favorite of the show) and she can be described in one word and that word is cold. Touma literally does nothing but sleep during class and after it all she does is practice on the piano (which she is really really good at) when she has time. She can be very pragmatic at times and other times she can be sincere and down to earth depending on her mood or if something is bothering her which is usually Kitahara and Ogiso most of the time. Lastly we have Ogiso Setsuna who can be described as our ""Genki"" character of the show. She just radiates sunshine and smiles and is often called a ""beauty"" in the eyes of most fellow classmates and to go even further she has a beautiful  singing voice which is what drew in Kitahara to find her on top of the roof. These 3 characters are vital in the  development of the show and each build off each other which in the ends leads to a powerful dramatic collapse in the end.Art/Sound: The overall art of the show is... Great. It\'s simply great. Satelight productions did a great job producing this show just as they did with Aquarion and other various anime projects. The whole winter theme greatly enhances the drama because of the fact that it is cold, dark, and enduring and colors were on point not being way to colorful or bright to let the atmosphere of the show sink in for the viewers. Now let\'s talk about the sound, I\'m going to try my hardest not to be biased towards sound just because it is a music anime but sound was outstanding and I just love the fact that they borrowed soundtracks from the ""White Album"" to use in ""White Album 2"" . The OST that I found simply amazing was called ""Silent Winter Night"" it was played just at the right times throughout the show and it it evoked a feeling every time it played. To this day when I hear ""Silent Winter Night"" I get goosebumps and it transports me back to those moments when the dramatic moments played synchronized perfectly with the song. Now let\'s talk about Openings and Endings, the opening to this show.... I loved... and it set the correct mood for the journey you are about to embark on. The ending on the other hand.... I found forgetful and didn\'t really do much to enhance the show for me personally. In the end, you are going to get great sound and art from this show and expect to get ""The Feels"" once all is said and done.White Album 2 did a lot and has proven to me that drama can successfully blend with music to create a beautiful  show. It gave me an anime that was enjoyable from start to finish, an anime that left me pumped and excited for the school festival from the start and left me emotionally torn and teary eyed in the end. I can\'t express enough how much I love the drama in the show and how serous the show can be with its dark and romantic elements. After all is said and done ""White Album 2"" was an overall amazing show with my only complaint being how short it was.... I know the anime was adapted off a visual novel and stretching the show could cause problems but in the end..... ""White Album 2"" left me sad yet happy that such a show exist. so than I expected it to be.

""White Album 2"" left me sad yet happy that such a show exist.', 'It pains my heart to see all of the positive feedback for this series. Perhaps if you can swallow a few massive pills, you may be able to see the light in this series and it\'s so called ""message"" or ""moral."" Which is I guess don\'t settle for the one you don\'t love (terribly portrayed). But when I saw terms like ""masterpiece"" and ""realism"" being thrown around, that\'s when I realized many people just want to see the world burn. It wouldn\'t be possible to review this without jumping into mild spoilers, but as I begin, I just want to say that this is going...to be a very passionate and heartfelt review, because I cannot stand for trash like this to be praised when it is so very wrong and poor. Let\'s beginPerhaps the only reason why I wouldn\'t give this a 1/10 is the first 7 or so episodes. It was good, fun, dramatic, entertaining, but nothing romantic really happened. It wouldn\'t be fair to rate a series solely based on it\'s final few episodes but such is the nature of a romance anime, it\'s the reason why everyone clicked the series in the first place. A huge problem I have with this series is that the characters just turn into completely different people after 7 episodes. They go on LONG tirades about wanting to ""stay together forever"" as the tropes goes on and develop this very deep friendship. And they all throw it away ""in the name of love."" And yes, of course, love is something deeper than friendship, but what happens is that both the MC and the two love interests begin to start backstabbing each other like crazy. It\'s as if they never knew each other and it\'s just terrible writing to be honest. The writers really didn\'t opt for realism here. I have absolutely no fucking idea how you can call this show realistic. Mild spoiler: the MC is in love with two girls at one time, but surely you already knew that, it says love polygon in the description. Another mild spoiler: the horny fuck ends up hooking up with both girls. The show isn\'t packed with fanservice but there is definitely enough to sexualize both the girls. Just because the virgin losers are sex deprived and would fuck both girls does NOT mean the MC is relatable to you in any way. This terribly written MC is simply the idiotic writers way of ensuring this damn-awful anime finds it\'s way to it\'s target audience. Afterwards, the writers don\'t know what to do so they just pull out plot-twist after plot-twist along with random backstories to simply create as much chaos and melodrama as possible.We need to discuss what really makes a drama good. I really really hope that most people would acknowledge things like TENSION and BUILDUP and EMPATHY. There is NONE of that present. Obviously one girl has to lose out in the love triangle, and while I was completely neutral (I promise), the authors had the audacity to have said girl say that she is ""vile and rotten for making her move."" What a load of absolute bullshit. There is no consistency in your writing, from the very beginning of the series onwards, the Main character acted in a way as to say to her ""I promise I will be with you forever"" MULTIPLE times and then the other girl tells the losing one that ""she had no competition"" initially. Listen here, whether or not she deserved to lose or was the best option is far from the point. The whole connection regarding this has to do with the production team/author\'s opinion of ""wholesome"" is, and let me tell you, it is completely warped.Spoilers start to get a little worse here:The authors develop a friendship and a number of dialogues that just get thrown away later on. You can\'t just develop a character like that and then throw her away as if she was a mere plot device it is just bad writing. It goes to show that the authors have no sense of what is right and wrong as the MC and winning love interest start to become intimate right in front of the other girls face. But then they realized that this is somehow wrong. I\'ll go ahead and narrate how they chose to write this.Writer 1: ""guys what do we do I don\'t think you can just cheat on a girl in front of her face."" Writer 2: ""hmmm idk bro i\'ve never been in a relationship""Writer 1: ""yeah me neither bro I only know my body pillows and harems""Writer 2: ""WAIT BRO THATS IT!""Writer 1: ""wtf are you talking about.""Writer 2: ""lets just throw her in there and have her act like she doesn\'t care that her best friend and lover are fucking in front of her knowing her feelings and then she acts like she doesn\'t care as long as the three of them are together and then they live happily ever after!""Writer 1: ""that\'s genius bro, then we can act like it\'s deep and realistic because apparently, in real life, people get cheated on!""Writer 2: ""that\'s crazy bro, my waifu\'s would never cheat on me!""I am not sure if you have any friends or not but if you do have somebody you are close to, I implore you not to watch this show. I understand that there can be different perspectives, I totally get it. However a lot of the reviews of this anime tell me that some people just couldn\'t care less about the bonds between friends. Yeah I know it\'s just an anime, enjoy what you want or whatever the fuck they say. However, when it comes down to evaluating the writing and story of a piece, you can\'t just skip over such elements just because you enjoyed it.To conclude, from the bottom of my heart, I implore you not to watch this anime. It\'s just pure trash, and not the good kind either. A lot of trash (rent a girlfriend, all isekai harems, girlfriend girlfriend, scums wish, citrus) know that they are trash. But the shows are still alright? Why? How can that be? I\'ll tell you, the writers aren\'t stupid enough to think their show is alright, that their characters are realistic. Because in order to truly bring about realism, there must be a level of self-awareness from the creator. The series\' I mentioned do this in some shape or form, whether that is character development and change in the series\' that try to be serious (citrus, scums wish) or just endless anti-climactic moments and laughter in the comedy ones (rent-a-girlfriend, girlfriend girlfriend, classic isekai harems). I\'ll say it once, i\'ll say it again, and i\'ll say it forever, this show is poorly written and complete trash. plot sucks character sucks art is mid, soundtrack and voice acting are good, there you have it. If you disagree with me, have a reason why please. My DM""s are always open, if you wanna discuss anything I said in this review, I\'m game.

I\'ll say it once, i\'ll say it again, and i\'ll say it forever, this show is poorly written and complete trash. plot sucks character sucks art is mid, soundtrack and voice acting are good, there you have it.

Thanks for reading, -nashy', ""Well this is my first time reviewing an anime at this site,so bear with me!White Album 2.. it may sound and look like your everyday RomCom about a love triangle but it actually turns out that the anime is something entirely Beautiful and The Love Triangle consists of everything! friendship,hatred,jealousy,revenge,heartbreaks and of course! LOVE!Story-The Story was pretty much simple, about how a guy and 2 girls form a band and after that love blossoms but it wasn't a comedy like most of the animes present out there. It gets deep after every episode. After every episode we come to know every character's inner desires...and hatred. What started as a love Triangle ends with Three line segments that do not intersect each other whatsoever. It feels like there should be more to it! I Want more! but what is, it is... Heartbreak...Art-The Art was really fitting as everything looked as it should . Perfect lip movements and perfect flowSound-Normally I do not watch animes with a musical theme but i got addicted to this anime because of what I normally hate- Music, that's right. The Soundtrack is perfect. Nothing goes out of beat. I even watched the op's and ed's every episode which i normally don't.Character-Every character. Yes, every! Everyone has their own uniqueness well developed and well drawn.Enjoyment-What Can I Say? Normally animes made from visual novels are bad... very very bad.. But there are a few exceptions like Myself; Yourself, Little Busters And Of Course This Gem! This is not a sequel or continuation. It is a completely different story from from the first white album which pretty much sucked! Watch this if you want to Feel The FEELS... and hatred.

Having the weakest of ties to the first story, this second anime lacks both the interesting time setting (later part of the 80s) and the plot (trying to maintain a love relationship with an idol) that the first one had. Not to mention the fact that the action takes place in the oh-so-generic-and-overused setting - high school.What we\'re presented with here is a typical love triangle. If you\'ve watched ""romance"" anime in the past, you\'re probably familiar with it by now. It doesn\'t deviate from the...pattern much, and that predictability makes it even less interesting - when 2 characters get together after only half the episodes have finished, you know that next in line is a lot of drama that will probably break them up.The characters are, i would say, generic anime ""impossibilities\' - if you listen to their dialogue, it\'s quite clear that there aren\'t any actual high school teens who talk like that. This is the sort of dialogue you come up with in the middle of the night when you think about how you could have replied to someone during the day-it doesn\'t feel natural at all.Other than the main trio, the other characters, tho barely present, do have some resemblance of normalcy, usually trying to set things straight and prevent the 3 from making stupid mistakes.From a technical point of view, the animation is, i guess, decent, tho less realistic than ""White Album"". The songs are mostly covers from that series too, so at least in that regard everything is ok.All in all, this does little to stand out in the over-saturated ""love triangle romance anime"" category. Forgettable at best, maddening at worst. pattern much, and that predictability makes it even less interesting - when 2 characters get together after only half the episodes have finished, you know that next in line is a lot of drama that will probably break them up.The characters are, i would say, generic anime ""impossibilities\' - if you listen to their dialogue, it\'s quite clear that there aren\'t any actual high school teens who talk like that.

I went for it and had the mindset that people were saying that they treat a certain character like crap, other than that I didn\'t know what to expect.This is one of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen and it is THE worst anime I ever finished and I regret that. Here\'s why I finished it though: The first half draws you in like bait for a fish but then you sucker-punch the fish, it had...my attention and I was always interested in what was next. I started seeing vibes of these characters being stupid but I just kept going and thought how bad can it get? There were only a few episodes left anyway. Then it derailed real fast, it did a lot of damage those last few episodes and I kept saying ""it can\'t get any worse."" It did. They treat the one character pretty crappy as I heard but I imagined it in a much different way. This anime is stupid and ruins the whole romance aspect of it, destroys any respect you had for any of the characters and goes beyond what you should see to get the point across. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you. my attention and I was always interested in what was next. I started seeing vibes of these characters being stupid but I just kept going and thought how bad can it get?

It is not a sequence of White Album, but it is a different Story.White Album 2 gives me a lot of chills. Graduation is underway and Kitahara Haruki, Setsuna Ogiso, and Touma Kazusa shared precious memories on such short time. Kitahara is a role-model student in their class. Setsuna is the beauty queen of the campus. Kazusa is the type of student with an aura of unfriendliness.What I like in WA2 is the unexpected plots and the chosen beautiful words which is strikingly direct hit to my heart....Please watch I do not want to spoil the grace of this anime.Note: Touma was exceptionally beautiful, well animated. I'd pause 1 minute staring at the beautiful masterpiece! Please watch I do not want to spoil the grace of this anime.Note: Touma was exceptionally beautiful, well animated. I'd pause 1 minute staring at the beautiful masterpiece!"", 'I\'ve never written a review for an anime despite the many times when I\'ve felt compelled to, but this ends here. White Album 2 is something truly special - a beautiful romance driven by subtlety, with some of the most honest-to-life and endearing characters I\'ve ever seen. Now, for those of you with worries that a visual novel-based anime like WA2 is going to absolutely blow, fear not. WA2 is, in its own right, just as well-written as any romance anime out there.The plot revolves around three characters: Kitahara Haruki, the former class rep and top-scorer, Ogiso Setsuna, the winner of Miss Houjou Prep...two years in a row, and Touma Kazusa, the cool and collected genius pianist who can\'t seem to stay awake in class. WA2 is a love triangle - let\'s get that out of the way - and as such, wouldn\'t seem to be completely original. But the show takes a simple premise and transforms it into a rare breed of anime: a realistic portrayal of love complicated. While the story is nothing new, the way the content is executed turns WA2 into a masterful piece of storytelling which tugs at the heartstrings and left me awestruck after its conclusion.Speaking of which, events to come are hinted at in the very introduction to WA2. This in no way detracts from the experience, but rather serves as an effective form of foreshadowing that heightens the sense of unease, the sense of impending conflict. However, unlike love triangle romance anime of the same ilk, WA2\'s characters share a genuine bond. Their friendship is what makes the show so painful but powerful.As for the music, there\'s not much to be said. Sound is often an appropriate accompaniment for your standard fare anime, but here, it serves a deeper purpose. Not only does the narrative utilize the creation of music as a backdrop for the romance, but certain songs hold great significance that can only be understood after watching. In fact, WA2 is riddled with symbolism - picking on said subtleties is one of the most rewarding aspects of the show, and makes earlier events all the more important.And if you\'ve read other reviews here, you\'ll know that there\'s a sex scene. As offputting as it sounds, it actually fits perfectly in context and was executed appropriately - to reuse my own diction, it adds without detracting.I won\'t go into further detail because WA2 is an anime best experienced by oneself (without spoilers, of course). The characters are relatable, lovable despite the mistakes they make, and above all else, painfully human. Please do yourself a favor and watch the show - if you\'re like me and the many other MAL users who have been touched by WA2, you\'ll love it as well.10/10*As a side note, White Album 2 is in no way directly related to the original White Album.

Very few shows have affected me like this, and certainly very very few of this genre, resulting in my abnormally high rating. I picked this up with very little expectations and it absolutely destroyed me. However, this is not the reason why I rated the show so highly, nor am I someone to give out a 10 lightly. I'm not too sure what it was about this show that clicked with me in such a way. If you enjoy lighthearted or comedic shows, or cannot deal with or do not enjoy emotional turmoil this show is not for...you. But if you want characters you can connect with, real characters with flaws, balancing selfishness and selflessness, this show may be for you.

This sequel only makes a few references to the original (namely the songs that get played) but ultimately is a stand-alone title. Now that\'s out of the way.If your asking how is this adaption compared to the VN. It\'s fine, don\'t worry about it.StoryThere really isn\'t much in the way of story for the first season. On the surface it\'s simply a story about 3 students trying to prepare for the school festival. However, being a romance/drama, there\'s of course more to it then that. It\'s mainly about all the emotional shifts that...our protagonist experience as they grow closer to each other. This is not a story where the characters make the most ideal of decisions, but rather take things in a more realistic albeit flawed fashion. Fair warning, this show may anger you with some of the decisions that get made, and it\'s intent is probably to do so. However if you carefully analyze why the characters make the decisions they do, you may find them more understandable.That being said it is a rather slow story, slow as in it takes awhile for any ""real"" drama to hit. Though don\'t get me wrong it\'s paced that way intentionally and has a lot of thought put into it. Just fair warning if you prefer things to get rolling right away as most of the series is spent on the build up to the climatic finish.CharactersThere is a handful of side characters but our main focus is on the three protagonists. Haruki is a busybody whose main drive in life is to lecture people. Kazusa is an extreme introvert with a talent for playing almost any instrument. And Setsuna is the school idol who seems suspiciously too nice for her own good. All three are deconstructions of archetypes you normally see in other anime. In that ""hey what would it be like if a kuudere if she existed in real life?"", and the answer would be she would have no friends and be incredibly lame to other people. Like said before they all have their positives and negatives for a fairly well balanced love triangle. Unfortunately the anime was playing favorites a little too much and gave Kazusa a little too much love in comparison to Setsuna (not a factor in the VN) but still nothing that should detract from the audiences enjoyment too much.If there is any flaw, I will say that sometimes the characters got a little too overdramatic when it wasn\'t fully necessary. Considering the show is relatively realistic, resorting to melodrama that is otherwise present in more over-the-top shows seems a little out of place. Not that it\'s done especially poorly, but that it makes the characters come across a little silly at times. It becomes difficult to take them seriously at the end especially. Now I understand that sometimes when a persons feelings explode it will be handled in a melodramatic fashion. However WA2 takes things a little too far. I understand that many people feel like ""the more dramatic the more entertaining"" but that really doesn\'t work with this kind of show I feel. Sometimes less is more and more subtle handling of the drama could have really made this series a lot stronger.Another problem is that the friendship between Kazusa and Setsuna is developed too fast to be really believable. Even in the VN this was the case. Quite honestly I could just never buy they were good friends and really cared about one another. Unfortunately this really works against the drama as it becomes even harder to take seriously then it already was. But I will say the moments when feelings are being discovered or hidden...those moments are well done.Art/SoundPassable on both fronts but nothing more. There\'s some nice vocal songs but the background music is completely forgettable much like the game itself. Art and animation is roughly the same. But hey its a drama, I bet no one was expecting epic animation in this kind of show.Actors play their roles well, nothing to complain about.Enjoyment:Fairly enjoyable overall. The flashbacks in one particular part though were excessive and drained the tension completely out of one scene (which in fact was the most important scene to get right, so yeah not too pleased about that). But otherwise its a nice watch at only 13 episodes.OverallIf you didn\'t like this part, don\'t even bother checking out if this show gets a second season. This is actually the strongest part of the story anyway, so hey you might not like the second part either way.WA2 is how to do a proper romance love triangle.

Chiaki alone makes it worthwhile... but there's lots of good stuff to hold you over until Coda is finished. Don't spoil it by reading a summary. Just be patient. "", ""Have you ever think about what you fear the most? Is it spiders? Is it natural disasters? Or is it something more abstract like being heart broken? Well i thought what i fear the most was being cheated... But i never had a relationship or love that is so strong that would totally tear me apart if i lose my loved one. In this show, love between characters are so strong that you can feel it as if its your love which is being torn apart.Story: 10/10 (*Slight spoilers for this section*)Every human in this planet, i do think feels incomplete. They search for things...that they can complete them, maybe that's a nice suit, maybe that's cars, maybe it's so small like a flower, maybe it is love... In this show love is told in an abstract way, like it should. Feelings we have for people should be abstract, it should not be straightforward or else that would be only liking... Real love is complex, real love finds its way, real love does hurt, real love has obstacles, real love is understanding even if you don't, real love is hope, real love is sorrow... this show has real love. I think guitar playing which is accompanied by piano is a really good example for that, real love just sticks together without any plan or without any form of thinking in mind.*Big Spoiler Here*I get really really sad when piano sounds from music room 2 has stopped. It broke my heart so much, it didn't feel good at all... Like my love is the one being torn apart.*End of epic spoiler*Art: 10/10I'm not a good judge of art, but if art is conveying feelings, then this one does it.Sound: 8/10Sound plays a really big role in this anime. Voice actors i think did a great job but i don't think original soundtrack of this anime was that catching. I have heard some epic soundtrack of final fantasy series and animes like Clannad's before so i can't really give it a 10 in this area, sorry.Characters: 10/10 (*Slight spoilers for this section*)I have to say, i hate people that cheat. I really hate people that cheat but i kinda felt sad for all of the main characters of this show. I knew they all did bad things, they all had bad thoughts and they all were so selfish that i wanted to smack them in face... but at the same time i feel pretty bad for all of them and wished best for all of them through the end of the show. Characters have some special aura between them that they stick together pretty well; like that complicated puzzle of yours, you cant see the small pieces when you look at it from afar. Each character was as realistic as possible, they had their own thoughts and motivations but they don't show those straightly as real humans do. You have to guess their inner motivations, as it is in real life...Enjoyment: 7.5/10This part will be interesting for some because it is so low compared to other sections. I do believe episodes of 2-3-4-5-6-8 were not necessary and had slow pace compared to other part of the series. Last 3 episodes were absolutely striking in terms of enjoyment and other episodes from the ones mentioned above was pretty good.Overall:Now i have to write things here, i usually am pretty logical guy when it comes to decisions and by logic i can say this anime deserves 8.5 overall score.

I feel that the author did all 3 characters justice by ending the way he did. This story is the truest  representation of A Love Triangle. If you ever felt frustrated at the denseness of Raku in Nisekoi, the complete inability of Onodera, Chitoge and Raku to take any actions or express themselves; or if you wished Oregairu had taken a different turn if 8man was not as jaded as he was of the world, and that perhaps Yukino and Yui was...more willing to take things into their own hands and not be as hampered by their own images of how they should act or by their feelings for one another; then WA2 completelywent ahead to finish the race and left both of them in the dust. WA2 was where each character did what they believed in the most and to the truest of their feelings.Setsuna - At first glance, one may harbour hatred towards Setsuna for what she did - knowingly and purposefully stepping in between Touma and Haruki to be the 3rd party, but in realityn would you really condemn what she did? All she wanted was for the 3 of them to be together forever and in order not to be left behind, she did the only thing she believed was possible. And that is to tie down Haruki while forcing Touma to be together too because she knew neither Haruki nor Touma would be able to reject her. Both of them would willing put her feelings before their own, because that's the kind of people they are. Of course she could have just let them be and it was only a matter of time before Touma and Haruki got together since both of them had feelings for each other, but where would she be in that picture? No where, and so she chose the path which would bring her the most happiness. You could call her selfish or evil for stepping in, but if you were in her shoes, would you have done it otherwise and let her love go? Would you not applaud her courage for going after what she wanted?Touma - For being the Ice Queen and supposedly cold, she did a terrible job of hiding her true feelings. For Haruki to not notice was entirely reasonable, since Haruki was THE person she was trying to hide her feelings from, but Setsuna, standing at the side could see everything clear as day. There were multiple instances throughout the story where Setsuna wouldmutter things under her breath like 'yeah, right' when Haruki would describe her as cold and not expressing herself, because all Setsuna could see was Touma placing herself where Haruki would be. Be it noticing where he went, to his terrible guitar playing, to helping him get better, all Touma did was literally 'all action no talk'. Seeing Setsuna confess to Haruki, yetalso knowing how kind Haruki was, and unable to reject Setsuna, she did all she could to act aloof and as if she didn't care at all. Multiple times she denied knowing what Setsuna was talking about when she apologised, but in her heart she never forgave Setsuna did she? For her to do that with Haruki, she was in her own words, 'the worse betrayer'Haruki -As the supposedly smartest person in the school for acing subjects, he was led in circles by both Setsuna and Touma. Unable to reject Setsuna, unable to see through what Touma was going through. Not that I blame him though. He was just trying to be kind to the people around him - by accepting Setsuna, and trying to be true to himself - never really letting go of Touma. Could you really blame him for his persistence in going after Touma? Afterall, that is who he truly loved. You could say he was a two-timer, but he could never bring himself to reject Setsuna, neither could he bring himself to forget Touma. Love never had a black or white answer, it all depends on where you stood. And where Haruki stood was at a pitchblack concretecrossroad with snow falling all around him.届かない恋 - Todokanai Koi, or A Love That Cannot Be - The last song the trio sang together might be the best one-liner summary of WA2. All 3 did what was in their mind the best course of action, but yet that resulted in an ending where none of them could be happy. A love that cannot be. Wonderful series. Half way through I was pretty doubtful if WA2 could be a 10 in my heart. But how the author masterfully concluded the series made it a 10 for me. Never mind it was not a happy ending, never mind that it was not entirely conclusive; because isn't that the most realistic representation of real life too? more willing to take things into their own hands and not be as hampered by their own images of how they should act or by their feelings for one another; then WA2 completelywent ahead to finish the race and left both of them in the dust. WA2 was where each character did what they believed in the most and to the truest of their feelings.Setsuna - At first glance, one may harbour hatred towards Setsuna for what she did - knowingly and purposefully stepping in between Touma and Haruki to be the 3rd party, but in realityn would you really condemn what she did? All she wanted was for the 3 of them to be together forever and in order not to be left behind, she did the only thing she believed was possible. And that is to tie down Haruki while forcing Touma to be together too because she knew neither Haruki nor Touma would be able to reject her. Both of them would willing put her feelings before their own, because that's the kind of people they are. Of course she could have just let them be and it was only a matter of time before Touma and Haruki got together since both of them had feelings for each other, but where would she be in that picture? No where, and so she chose the path which would bring her the most happiness. You could call her selfish or evil for stepping in, but if you were in her shoes, would you have done it otherwise and let her love go? Would you not applaud her courage for going after what she wanted?Touma - For being the Ice Queen and supposedly cold, she did a terrible job of hiding her true feelings. For Haruki to not notice was entirely reasonable, since Haruki was THE person she was trying to hide her feelings from, but Setsuna, standing at the side could see everything clear as day. There were multiple instances throughout the story where Setsuna wouldmutter things under her breath like 'yeah, right' when Haruki would describe her as cold and not expressing herself, because all Setsuna could see was Touma placing herself where Haruki would be. Be it noticing where he went, to his terrible guitar playing, to helping him get better, all Touma did was literally 'all action no talk'. Seeing Setsuna confess to Haruki, yetalso knowing how kind Haruki was, and unable to reject Setsuna, she did all she could to act aloof and as if she didn't care at all. Multiple times she denied knowing what Setsuna was talking about when she apologised, but in her heart she never forgave Setsuna did she? For her to do that with Haruki, she was in her own words, 'the worse betrayer'Haruki -As the supposedly smartest person in the school for acing subjects, he was led in circles by both Setsuna and Touma. Unable to reject Setsuna, unable to see through what Touma was going through. Not that I blame him though. He was just trying to be kind to the people around him - by accepting Setsuna, and trying to be true to himself - never really letting go of Touma. Could you really blame him for his persistence in going after Touma? Afterall, that is who he truly loved. You could say he was a two-timer, but he could never bring himself to reject Setsuna, neither could he bring himself to forget Touma. Love never had a black or white answer, it all depends on where you stood. And where Haruki stood was at a pitchblack concretecrossroad with snow falling all around him.届かない恋 - Todokanai Koi, or A Love That Cannot Be - The last song the trio sang together might be the best one-liner summary of WA2.

Sometimes it can blossom out of friendship and bring people closer together while other times it can tear people apart. And it\'s because there are so many ways in which this emotion can be portrayed that romances are my favorite genre in the animated medium. Don\'t get me wrong, sometimes they can be done poorly to the point where I can\'t even find myself entertained (Cough* TWILIGHT *Cough). However, sometimes, much like right now, I stumble across something great completely by accident. Something that makes be board the feel train, only...to get off with a void in my heart.Case OpenCase Summary + Witnesses:(Before you say anything, no you do not need to watch the first season to appreciate this one)The story of WA2 focuses on the life of three students in their final year of high school. We have Haruki Kitahara, the male lead who is overly helpful when it comes to his friends (which is his greatest asset as well as greatest fault). We have Setsuna Ogiso, the shy and quite popular girl who learns to come out of her shell. And finally we have Kazusa Touma, the quite musical genius who never had anyone look after her before.It is the relationship between these three that drives the story of WA2, coming together as the light music club in order to perform before their graduation. Music will be played, strong bonds will be formed, and friendships will be tested. However, even without a nice boat in sight, this series is far from a fluffy one.Analysis:WA2 is a story that sticks very close to your standard music anime formula and because of this, a good portion of the story was predictable. However, through careful pacing and well executed flashbacks, WA2 knows when to show us what needs to be shown and did an excellent job of building tension without treading to deeply into melodramatic territory.The characters themselves might appear to be nothing more then the standard troupes that we have seen before in the past, but it was their interactions that lead to them to be so interesting. Throughout the story you feel how close the three were becoming whether it was out of respect or admiration. The chemistry and dynamics felt real which of course was essential in making such a love triangle work as the closer they becoming, the harder it was to maintain their friendship. There was no ""bad guy"" between them, no single character that caused problems for others. Rather the real enemy in the story was the love they all harbored. By the end of the story, choices needed to be made and if you\'re expecting a happy ending then you will be disappointed. For when it come to love and friendship, sometimes it\'s impossible to walk away completely intact.Presentation:Being produced by studio satellite, WA2 features very fluid and decently polished animation. This especially becomes apparent during the concert scenes which were some of the more pleasurable moments to remember. Character designs and backgrounds stick very close to the visual novel with my only complaint being that Haruki bears a disturbingly strong resemblance to that A-hole from school days. But I digress.Saying that the series aesthetics just get the job done are an understatement to say the least as even the pallet stuck very close to the shows namesake. Soft colors were used with certain sheens and well placed lighting allowed everything to mesh together well without it looking bland or plain. The series gave off a very gentle, yet bittersweet atmosphere which reflected the seasons that were being portrayed to an exceptional degree.But of course, being a music anime as well as a romance, WA2 delivers when it needs too with splendid combinations of vocals, piano and guitar that will hit you right in the Kokoro. While much of the music was taken from the original visual novel, it was still cleverly executed without sounding generic or overwhelming.Closing Statements:Overall, WA2 is a very emotional romance that will make you feel attached with its visuals, aesthetic and music while at the same time slowly reach within your chest, grab that blood pumping organ that you thought was incapable of feeling, and tug on it nice and slowly. You ever come across one of those shows that you think isn\'t going to be all that great but then becomes one of the best that season? No? Then maybe you should give this a try. Just tread with caution because, believe me, just like real love, it isn\'t always sunshine and rainbows. to get off with a void in my heart.Case OpenCase Summary + Witnesses:(Before you say anything, no you do not need to watch the first season to appreciate this one)The story of WA2 focuses on the life of three students in their final year of high school.

I liked it very much as I decided to make a review for it.After I finished the anime, I feel that I want more of it! So I\'ve surf the net and I found what I\'m looking for! The "" TRUE ""  ending . Here is the link: http://mdzanime.me/2013/12/29/white-album-2-concluding-chapter-coda-rough-summary/I was so relieved and so happy that it ended well. A happy ending for two lovers and their friends. The chapter that should have been animated as the anime ending, how I really wanted it to happen.The Story10/10: It\'s so romantic...how the two lovers got to know each other, how I wish this happened to my life. I think this is the reason why I love this anime. There is this episode when a flashback from one of the main character that captured my heart. It is when she found the right guy that can understand her.The Art9/10: Well the art is great but I\'m kinda like more of round eyes etc. But I think this kind of anime drawing is more SERIOUS or more MATURE than my preference.The Sound10/10: I enjoyed all the music I even downloaded all of them on my pc. All the music used for the scenes are suited perfectlyThe Characters10/10: Each characters has portrayed their role really great that it\'s all I can say.

I swearOverallIt\'s over 9000!: Seriously', 'In the beginning, I looked over it. At first, I thought, ""Hmm, I dunno. I\'m rather skeptical about it. Looks alright but...""Such thoughts appeared in my mind after I scrounged around this website for reviews on the previous 2 iterations of the series. And, judging from what I bore witness to, well, let\'s just say that I became decidedly put off by the series as a whole. I\'ve heard of it many years ago, but I was confused then as to which is the first in the chronological order of events.UNTIL late last year... After a Japanese correspondent of mine Tweeted to me on what...shows he\'ll be watching for the Fall 2013 anime season, in which he said that he\'d give the VN adaptations a try. (And a big etchi lover this guy was, sigh...) One such anime that he mentioned was this anime right here, White Album 2. And so, in keeping together with the Japanese injunction to ""relate to one another in a spirit of \'similarity\'"", I decided to give it a go.If only I knew what I was getting into... OH-MAI-KAMISAMA!!!Immediately after I went through this existentially scathing emotional-wringer of a romantic drama, I started to question my own relationships (not the romantic ones for I\'ve no such thing) to that of other people- in a way.For one, the plot of White Album 2 is rather straightforward in what it aspires to present: it is by all accounts, a story of a young man who wishes to end his final days of high school leaving behind good, fond memories. However, he happens to chance upon two beautiful young women, each with their own distinct set of personality traits and histories, and goes through the motions of becoming closer to them as friends. UNTIL... *Spoilers*Now, the strength of the series\'s plot isn\'t in its \'astoundingly original\' premise, but in the execution and emotional depth of it. All too often do we see aggressively optimistic, comically pessimistic, melodramatically sappy, maniacally nonsensical depiction of romances being bitterly regarded as the standard staples of fictional narratives, but few are truly a force to be reckoned with in its depiction of the subject matter. Never once did I feel that everything that ever was presented before me was needlessly amped-up or dumbed down so that they can elicit a reaction from me. No, not once at all. The key to their presentation of the three protagonists\' struggles in love and friendship lie in the subtle cues and psychological subtext that are carefully spread out throughout the plot. Though there were instances of heated verbal fights and emotional reticence, such things do not come by without the plot\'s masterful handling of back story exposition, character personality traits and character motivations, all of which are utterly decisive in heightening the emotional impact of scenes while driving the messages that the plot attempts to convey.As for the art, though there are quite a few occasions of rather sub-par animation, it for the most part succeeds in setting the overall tone of the series. The artwork is deep, vibrant, subdued, perfect for the series\'s intention to properly convey its narrative and accompanying themes. I\'ll also have you know that the opening sequence to the show is very impactful and will, if nothing else, leave a deep impression upon you, particularly as the plot progresses- both in terms of content and music.No profound romantic drama can ever succeed without superb voice acting on the VA\'s end, for they have truly brought these characters to life in their stellar depiction of the characters\' emotions during a particular scene. Sadness, anger, resentment, joy, all of it were properly executed. None felt that they were overacted or underacted in attempts to compensate due to atrocious directing or lack of skill. Musically speaking, the series\'s soundtrack is greatly fitting as it succeeds in conveying all manner of emotions to the audience, just like the voice acting. The lyrics to some of the songs are also rich in meaning and will leave you thinking when the series concludes.When it comes down to the characters, considering that this is a heavily-character driven narrative, let\'s just say that they were unmistakably well-written and that their overall interactions and responses to one another\'s actions is within the realm of plausibility and possibility. However, if you are looking for tremendously complex characters with an immense amount of variance and depth within them, then this series will not be able to suffice your desires for they are very much portrayed as ordinary Janes n\' Joes, save for one who stands out rather considerably.Personally, I did not expect such a narrative to be so impactful once experienced, but the fact that it was left a profound impression upon me, and by the end, I am left ever more wondering if in the future we will be able to encounter such rare, underrated gems in storytelling. However, I could hardly say that I \'enjoyed\' this in the most technical sense for there is no pleasure in witnessing hardship and sadness- unless if one was emotionally sado-masochistic towards oneself, I know I was.And that concludes my first full review of an anime series. I hope you found it helpful in some way or another in clarifying your thoughts of whether you should take a gander at the show- or not.

I liked this anime because it resembles my bittersweet memories of my girlfriend in my High school days. The anime was entirely great especially the story itself. I disliked this...anime because it made me remember the times that I was left behind. Suffering from pain and being alone.Story: 9/10The story is entirely great. Making a love story anime is not that great but this anime deserves the spot. Getting strucked by the love triangle in the story and how they will solve their problems together. Practicing their music notes and arrangements in the house of their friend and aiming to pursue themselves to their respective goals.Art: 8/10The art makes this anime feel the essence of the story. The season is somewhat connecting to the route of the story. Being lonely at winter and happy in Fall. White Album 2 is the color of snow and snow is use to symbolize being cold to others and alone.  Although the art is not unique but the art itself is the resemblance of this Anime.Sound: 10/10One of the reasons that I have watched this anime is because of the sounds that are used and composed mostly by instruments(piano, electric guitar, saxophone, keyboard) The background music fits the story and every part of the anime. The music that are used is sad but encouraging me to feel more what love is and what part of love is hurting the most.Character: 8/10There are 3 main characters in the story. 1 boy and 2 girls that wants to perform in their school festival. They used their music capabilities to fulfill their goals in life and make these 3 characters to be together forever.

What I enjoyed the most is how they will manage their relationship to each other. Not every anime is like this and that\'s why enjoyed this.Overall: 9/10White Album is your romance and drama anime.

And you may be right, but what stood out to me was the execution. The story takes its time, focusing on the characters and relationships. I thought this was handled very well, but some people might not like the slow pacing. I won't go too in depth, since I want to avoid spoilers, but I...will say that most tropes are absent or presented in a way that feels refreshing.The three main characters-Haruki, Setsuna, and Touma-really drive the story with their actions and interactions with each other. They may not seem very interesting at first, but as the story progresses and the show examines their characters, it becomes clear that they are realistic and relatable with insecurities and passions of their own.The art and animation for WA2 are by no means bad, but they aren't much to write home about. The anime uses a somewhat muted color palette wuth focus on the scenery-such as the music room, the falling snow, the setting sun. It isn't stunning, but it still looks very nice and fits the mood of the anime well.The soundrack is probably one of the best parts of the anime-it's very nice and builds the atmosphere, and the opening is probably one of favorites.White Album 2 is a mature romance that uses beautiful music and nice animation to tell a moving story and build realistic characters. If you're not a fan of slow-paced anime, this isn't for you.

This was one of those magical shows that crushed me when I was done with it. It was one of the first bittersweet anime I had seen, and that scene at the airport was one of the more devastating finales, even more so than a great character dying in my opinion.At first, when I was done, I was mad. I wanted to go back in time, and just say ""This show was 12 episodes, I should never have watched that last one."" I...didn\'t rate it right away, but I couldn\'t sleep for thinking about it that night. It made my blood boil, I could not stop thinking about it all day and night. This made me realize, I had grown a deep attachment to the characters, in just twelve episodes.  I was mad at Setsuna for making a move on Haruki after she had seen Kazusa\'s emotional outburst after the concert in the music room. I was frustrated with Haruki for needing to please everyone so bad, and getting himself into that situation in the first place. And I was pissed with Kazusa, that when she finally gets what she wants, she just flies away, leaving her 2 most important relationships behind.This show touched me, and whenever I hear Powder Snow, White Album, opening, or closing, my heart breaks even more. But what made this show so great, was that they were real people.They have realistic personalities. I just shoe Haruki into the \'Go with the flow\' mentality. It\'s why he ends up coupled with Setsuna, in my opinion. The big \'character development\' moment is Kazusa\'s confession. Both Haruki & Kazusa manage to overcome their specific character deficiencies in that scene.While it sucks for Setsuna, it seemed like the most \'honest\' moment of White Album 2. At that moment, both of them overcome their most crippling character defect, if you will. They both let down some pretty significant walls, and the passion that followed could be expected. Right/wrong and morality aside, I think that was the definitive scene for the whole show; the confession, and what it leads to. It all made me think, wow these could be real high schoolers.WA2 is one of the best romance animes made in the last 20 years. That\'s not even hyperbole. You get the regular story through the first 9 or 10 eps, which is 7/10 or so at best. But then you hit the last 3 episodes, and everything changes. The series immediately jumps to 10/10.The music, the sound, is incredible. Besides the sheer awesomeness of Haruhi Suzumiya\'s concert, this was the greatest anime concert I have had the pleasure of watching.You don\'t need to watch White Album before this one, as White Album is really just the origin of the song ""White Album."" I had unfortunately seen the first one before and knew the story behind it. No spoilers for the first one, but it made it so much worse for me.This is the only anime, to truly break me. For months after I had seen it, I could not get it out of my mind. I did not dare to put the soundtrack in the playlist, because I knew I would get into my feelings. I have never cried at an anime, but this was the closest.So I beg of you, please, give this a try, and it will be one of the greatest, while traumatic and beautiful, choices of your life.10/10 didn\'t rate it right away, but I couldn\'t sleep for thinking about it that night. It made my blood boil, I could not stop thinking about it all day and night. This made me realize, I had grown a deep attachment to the characters, in just twelve episodes.

GUITAR DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT!Overall grade: 4/vittu mitä paskaa... "", 'On the surface White Album 2 appears to be a show about music but music is really only padding to the central story which is about a love triangle where all three people end up making each other miserable. White Album 2 is NOT an anime about music.The first three episodes of White Album 2 are actually probably the best of the entire series. Everything else goes downhill after that. The set up, which has protagonist Haruki playing guitar accompanied by a ""Mr. Music Student"" after school, is very cute. Of course, as is obvious from a mile away, ""Mr. Music Student"" is actually the...black haired girl, Touma, who sits next to Haruki is class. There was no surprise in that twist although the show tried to act like it was surprising. They play piano and guitar in adjacent rooms with the windows open and jam together. Everything changes when a vocalist joins them in playing together. The set up is cute, interesting, and unique. However, that\'s the end of anything unique in this show.There\'s some good music content as they build up towards a performance at a school fair. A cliche set up, for sure. No defending it. However, the build up to that performance is when some real cracks start to show in the plot. The music within the show itself is mediocre at best.White Album 2 must take place in a kind of black hole where time is severely altered because many of the timelines make very little sense. That is to say, things happen too quickly. Haruki goes from being mediocre on guitar to mastering multiple hard songs over the span of a week. I found this to be mildly unrealistic. It\'s not so outside the realm of the possibility as to be absurd but it\'s definitely not the most believable. Even with a skilled teacher, simply playing guitar 24 hours a day will not yield dramatic improvements within a week. Exhaustion and sleep deprivation severely hamper the growth of any skill in real life. Practicing fewer hours over a longer period of time is universally the better path to improvement. White Album 2 probably shortened the timeline to raise tension but the end result only weakens the show.Then there\'s the feelings. School idol Setsuna goes from not knowing Haruki to ""loving him so much"" again in a very short period of time. The characters talk often about all the amazing times they spent together but most of that was over a week. That\'s not how human relationships work. They\'re still basically strangers having spent some time practicing music together, especially Setsuna and the other two. Haruki and Touma do actually have some history together over a year so it\'s a lot more believable but Setsuna\'s reaction to these two really stretched my suspension of disbelief. She went from being the most popular girl in school (who has no other friends that are named characters within the show) to intensely valuing the \'friendship\' and \'time spent\' with Touma and Haruki.White Album 2 would have benefited from a much longer timeline. A month to prepare for the festival would\'ve made a lot more sense and added a lot more weight to the changes in Setsuna\'s feelings and in Haruki\'s guitar skill.These questionable timeline decisions could be easily overlooked, however, if it weren\'t for the show having an absolutely miserable ending. Everyone that claims to be such good friends and to love each other so much ends up hurting each other and the conclusion concludes basically nothing. No one ends up together and everyone\'s crying. The ending of a romance anime is important. First, this anime appears to be a music anime but it doesn\'t really scratch that itch.

Then it appears to be a romance but it definitely doesn\'t scratch that itch either. So what is White Album 2?White Album 2 is a flawed but decent anime with an extremely unsatisfying ending.', 'Have you ever missed an opportunity to tell someone how you really feel? Have you ever thought that maybe the person you are with is not the right one for you? Well, the anime I am going to be talking about now revolves around both those questions and more.White Album 2, or Hwhite Album as the characters say it, is not a sequel to the original White Album, nor does it have anything to do with the original besides having a song called White Album play a big part in the first half of the story.The anime begins introducing us to our selfless main protagonist,...Haruki, who is one of the last members of the dying Light Music Club. His character is that of an everyman, the anime tries to make him as boring as humanly possible, probably to make it easier for the audience to relate to him. That is not to say he doesn\'t have any defining characteristics, he does, he just doesn\'t have anything that makes him stand out too much. Even his character design is rather boring compared to the other male characters in the show.His guitar playing is one of the main catalysts for the plot of the show and is what brings him and the two girls closer.Setsuna is our second main character she is one of the two romantic interests for Haruki. It is made clear from the very first episode that she is the star of the high school, she is every boy\'s dream winning the school\'s Miss contest for the last two years. Regarding her character development the anime pulls a KareKano on us and reveals that she is in fact a nerdy girl who wears glasses. There is more to her than that, she is energetic, upbeat and a klutz, as she was built to basically be the polar opposite of the other love interest, Touma Kazusa.Touma is, of course, best girl but also the one who provides a counter-point to both Setsuna\'s overly energetic personality and Haruki\'s overly dull personality. She is the daughter of a world renowned pianist and also an aspiring Hachiman when we meet her in the beginning of the anime. Her character, is arguably the one that changes the most, and I think she would have been better suited to be the MC of this anime, and the anime agrees with me because she has more than an entire episode dedicated to viewing the story through her eyes. Touma starts out as a cold and calculated music genius delinquent who because of the other two charactes influence grows a tiny bit more affectionate. Not too much though, wouldn\'t want to ruin her bad girl image.The story revolves around the friendship these three create and the infinite amounts of sexual tension between them. As you may have already guessed having two characters of one gender and another of the opposite gender can only mean that we are going to have a love triangle. But rather than having the entire anime focus on the love triangle, the anime only uses its latter half to do this. The first half is more focused on how the characters got to like each other and, of course, the central event in the entire anime: the school fair concert. Honestly, I enjoyed the fist part of the anime mainly because it was light-hearted and more preoccupied with the music part of the anime. Not that I disliked the almost soap opera levels of drama in the second half, in fact, I would say it\'s the better part of the anime. Why do I say that? Well, probably because I like romance anime in general, I can see how some people might find the confusion, shouting and tears to be irritating but for me it was done well enough that I never felt irritated in the slightest.I would also talk about the ending of Hwhite Album 2 a but I don\'t want to spoil anything so I\'m just gonna say that while I appreciate what it was trying to do, that is, leave a bittersweet taste in the audience\'s mouth, I don\'t like how it did it.The animation is pretty standard TV anime fare. Nothing really stands out most of the time, except for a few scenes where it seems like they might have used more of their budget like the concert scene. I really don\'t have much to say about this point, if you\'ve seen almost any other anime set in a high school then just take that and add and orange tint to it since a lot of scenes take place at dusk and you have Hwhite Album 2.You can\'t speak of the sound design without talking about the music. The songs in the anime, have a mellow feel to them and, since the anime likes its winter symbolism, they are ""colder"" love songs. And not just the vocals tracks either even the instrumental insert songs have this feeling of melancholy and coldness to them. The eponymous White Album is probably my favourite song out of the multitude of EDs, the OP and the songs sung on stage by our three protagonists.As a final verdict, Hwhite Album 2 is a very drama heavy anime that uses music as a central plot element. Some might like it because of the romance, some might like it because of the music, for a 13 episode anime there are enough elements in it for most people to find something they like about it. I liked it because of the characters and their relantionships and interactions, there is a lot that I didn\'t go over in this short review, so if it seems like you may be interested in White Album 2 then I suggest you watch it because there is a lot to like here.

Not that it's relatable to my circumstance or past history of relationships but because it's just a well produced work. Recommended to all who enjoy the romance/drama genre of anime. Typical high school love triangle, yet it's much more. The art, sound, and pace makes this anime into something words could never describe. It has a type of nostalgic atmosphere that really draws you to it and you feel apart of this complicated triangle. Simple enough as it is, the story isn't compelling enough to write a standard review about . Character personalities, dialogue,...expressions, and actions with the colors/scenery leave an impact on you visually. I still see images in my head of the snow and the song the three perform on stage. The show moves slow and calmly until the end but that's what makes it great. It feels realistic and natural all the way through and as sad as the story is in itself, I like to remember the postive instances as the characters develop into close friends. expressions, and actions with the colors/scenery leave an impact on you visually.

This is another series I think I just stumbled across, and I'm so very glad I did so, as it was a stirring and wonderful experience. Of note, I have not experienced the visual novel, and am coming in without having seen the first White Album either. This is purely based off the anime alone. If you have an eye (or heart) for romance and love triangles, this is the stop for you! Will the feels train stop to deposit a post on the RTLR wall of tsundere girls? All signs point to...yes, but let's break this thing down and see for sure.Story: 8The story deals a light music club basically falling apart leaving only a pair of guitarists, one of them really new to playing. This beginner is our male lead, who dreams of playing in the school festival, and particularly dreams of playing an original piece on stage. One day while practicing by an open window in the club room, he hears a pianist fall in and accompany him perfectly. This mystery pianist is in the locked 'elite' music room 2. He enjoys his little sessions with the pianist, until one afternoon he hears a heavenly voice singing with the duo. The voice belongs to one of the most popular girls in the school, standing on the roof. The guy sees a chance to possibly make his dream of playing on stage come true, and he immediately moves to recruit first the beautiful singer, and then the mysterious pianist. This is the beginning of a love story filled with emotion, heartbreak, and dreams.The story moves along some familiar lines, and is for the most part very well done, with scenes that are cut in such a way to make us think we understand what is going on, only later to flash back and show even more of the conversation/event, where we gain new insight. This directorial direction is masterfully done, giving us what we need as we move through the story, holding back various parts in such a manner as to heighten the drama and bring us to the edge of our seats. The love triangle that develops seems one way at first, only later do we find the honest truth about it as the characters grow and struggle in their positions.The reason why this section didn't score higher is  that the tsundere girl gets really close to overdoing it some of the time. I adore those kinds of characters, and she does have a human side that is shown in her actions and words, but she's so stubbornly rough on the guy that it was sometimes frustrating. The other big knock for me, oddly enough, is that the pacing is a little slow in the beginning, before picking up very nicely at the conclusion. I don't mind slow (say it with me yall: Maria-sama ga Miteru) but I prefer for a steadier pace, instead of a slower walk turning into a run at the end. It's not even close to a deal breaker for me, but just one of those things that caught my attention.We'll get more into detail regarding this later in the character section, so I'll see you guys there.Art: 10I ADORE the look this show has. To me, this is what I think of when I think 'anime'. I'm a fan of how the characters look, with their expressions, and the general appearance, especially the two girls. The instruments look good, and the eyes are expressive enough where looks, glances, and facial expressions are used to convey messages and story progression.The complaint I felt about the art was a design decision. I don't like the way the tsundere girl dresses in the festival concert, it just seems too revealing for her to have gone along with. She seems more conservative, and even though she makes a biting comment about her displeasure with the outfit, it just wasn't enough. I think her character would have rejected wearing it. Or at least that's what I expected. Other than that kind of thing, I didn't find much to criticize personally.Sound: 9The music is very well done, with only a single issue that irked me. The piano pieces are beautiful, and the theme music is pretty enough. The song that repeats throughout the series is appropriate and fits the theme of the show very well. They do drop the themes more often that most series, mainly it appears to fit in more character time, as they often have speaking scenes throughout the time usually reserved for the ending theme, or even a time or two for the opening theme.The issue I had was with the guitarist. He plays simply for the most part, as is fitting since he's new to the guitar. The tsundere girl demands he practice a great deal, several hours a day, and while he makes progress as expected, he sometimes makes too much progress. They show him learning a fairly complicated solo in only a manner of days, something that in my experience as a musician, seemed to be a bit unlikely. The singing girl sounds wonderful, and the piano matches well. The tsundere girl also plays other songs when she's thinking or just practicing and they are all very interesting, musically speaking and nice to listen to.Character: 9This is where things get interesting. The trio of guy, tsudere girl, and popular girl all have motivations and realistic reactions to events around them. This is very much a character driven show, and they do not disappoint. The guy is presented as diligent, and hard working. He is classmates with tsundere girl, and reaches out to her to help her even with her treating him badly. He is bright, and doesn't give up on her, taking her insults in stride. This is important to the tsundere girl's motivations later on. His kindness and warmth is not lost on tsundere girl, even if it seems like it at first.The popular girl has motivations that seem very innocent and normal at first, but she harbors a secret as well, a reason for doing what she does that turns out to be far more than just simple feelings that we see at first. The reasons for each person to act the way they do fits into a realistic situation. They do not seem forced by any means, and they are not cookie cutters made to fit a single role. They express a complexity that is often difficult to properly portray in stories like this. The only thing is the tsundere girl clinging so hard to her defenses and walls to keep the others out, even as they imprint deeper and deeper into her heart. This is especially true for the guy, who the more she seems to come to feel for him, the meaner she seems to get.The tsundere girl is quicker to admit the popular girl is her friend, and her only friend, but that is even a strain for her. She has a good motivation, having suffered trauma at her mother's treatment of her through her childhood, which explains well why she's the rough girl she is. Inside however, her defenses aren't as strong as she wants everyone to think.The popular girl seems innocent and somewhat predictable, yet they give her motivations for her actions that are a little surprising, though they make perfect sense once they are revealed. She's not as sweet and innocent as she first appears, though in the end she shows a level of love that is admirable.The guy, as we discussed, is true blue, a good guy through the heart of him, even though he gets into some difficult situations as the end comes around. He tries his best to not hurt anyone, though the situation isn't that easy to escape, and hearts are involved, massively complicating the whole thing. He tries to tread lightly, but it's just not a situation where there's a 'right' way out of. He deals with what happens in a manner that speaks of his wounded heart, as he struggles to not only honor the girls, but also stay true to himself. He's a satisfying male lead, something that can be a bit hard to find in some of these romantic triangle type stories. Even though he does some things that clearly hurt the girls, he is not a player nor is he looking to juggle the girls, or have his cake and eat it too. He's trying to navigate the minefield that is love, and stumbles here and there, as we all do.Enjoyment: 9I really loved my time with White Album 2, with one reservation, that being the ending. It is not a bad ending by any means, but if you've ever seen any of my other reviews you might be aware of my love of grand endings. This one does not go out the way I would have it do. It's heartbreaking, yet at the same time, the ending is also immensely heartwarming and beautiful. Even though I would have made it a 'Western' styled ending for the tsundere girl, it admittedly not cap the story off in a way that gave any true resolution. Though I'm loathe to admit it, they really did a good job wrapping the story up. So I had my expectations, and I still wanted it to happen that way, I can't deny they masterfully brought it all to a close and in a manner that is hopeful for the trio. It was a heartwarming tale from beginning to end, with only a small bit of pacing issues, and as the end steamed into the station, I found myself mesmerized and anxious to continue watching as each episode ended, which to me speaks to how much I enjoyed the series.Best Girl: Touma Kazusa. The tsundere girl wins hands down. The popular girl is cute and played well, but nothing beats a mean girl, ever. I love the way Kazusa was drawn, her voice, and her demeanor. She might have been close to too mean at times, but I guess I like the abuse. Mean girls forever!In closing I would heartily recommend giving White Album 2 a chance, especially if you like drama and romance, as this has both in spades. There were times I felt the agony the characters were going through, times when my heart soared and I was giddy when a good development happened, and smiled like a fool every time tsundere girl dropped her attitude for a moment and showed she was actually a caring person, no matter what kind of mask she wore. As for the RTLR wall of romance, Kazusa and Setsuna bumped off a pic of Black Widow from the wall, taking the spot instead. All thumbs up! yes, but let's break this thing down and see for sure.Story: 8The story deals a light music club basically falling apart leaving only a pair of guitarists, one of them really new to playing. This beginner is our male lead, who dreams of playing in the school festival, and particularly dreams of playing an original piece on stage. One day while practicing by an open window in the club room, he hears a pianist fall in and accompany him perfectly. This mystery pianist is in the locked 'elite' music room 2. He enjoys his little sessions with the pianist, until one afternoon he hears a heavenly voice singing with the duo. The voice belongs to one of the most popular girls in the school, standing on the roof. The guy sees a chance to possibly make his dream of playing on stage come true, and he immediately moves to recruit first the beautiful singer, and then the mysterious pianist. This is the beginning of a love story filled with emotion, heartbreak, and dreams.The story moves along some familiar lines, and is for the most part very well done, with scenes that are cut in such a way to make us think we understand what is going on, only later to flash back and show even more of the conversation/event, where we gain new insight. This directorial direction is masterfully done, giving us what we need as we move through the story, holding back various parts in such a manner as to heighten the drama and bring us to the edge of our seats. The love triangle that develops seems one way at first, only later do we find the honest truth about it as the characters grow and struggle in their positions.The reason why this section didn't score higher is  that the tsundere girl gets really close to overdoing it some of the time. I adore those kinds of characters, and she does have a human side that is shown in her actions and words, but she's so stubbornly rough on the guy that it was sometimes frustrating. The other big knock for me, oddly enough, is that the pacing is a little slow in the beginning, before picking up very nicely at the conclusion. I don't mind slow (say it with me yall: Maria-sama ga Miteru) but I prefer for a steadier pace, instead of a slower walk turning into a run at the end. It's not even close to a deal breaker for me, but just one of those things that caught my attention.We'll get more into detail regarding this later in the character section, so I'll see you guys there.Art: 10I ADORE the look this show has. To me, this is what I think of when I think 'anime'. I'm a fan of how the characters look, with their expressions, and the general appearance, especially the two girls. The instruments look good, and the eyes are expressive enough where looks, glances, and facial expressions are used to convey messages and story progression.The complaint I felt about the art was a design decision. I don't like the way the tsundere girl dresses in the festival concert, it just seems too revealing for her to have gone along with. She seems more conservative, and even though she makes a biting comment about her displeasure with the outfit, it just wasn't enough. I think her character would have rejected wearing it. Or at least that's what I expected. Other than that kind of thing, I didn't find much to criticize personally.Sound: 9The music is very well done, with only a single issue that irked me. The piano pieces are beautiful, and the theme music is pretty enough. The song that repeats throughout the series is appropriate and fits the theme of the show very well. They do drop the themes more often that most series, mainly it appears to fit in more character time, as they often have speaking scenes throughout the time usually reserved for the ending theme, or even a time or two for the opening theme.The issue I had was with the guitarist. He plays simply for the most part, as is fitting since he's new to the guitar. The tsundere girl demands he practice a great deal, several hours a day, and while he makes progress as expected, he sometimes makes too much progress. They show him learning a fairly complicated solo in only a manner of days, something that in my experience as a musician, seemed to be a bit unlikely. The singing girl sounds wonderful, and the piano matches well. The tsundere girl also plays other songs when she's thinking or just practicing and they are all very interesting, musically speaking and nice to listen to.Character: 9This is where things get interesting. The trio of guy, tsudere girl, and popular girl all have motivations and realistic reactions to events around them. This is very much a character driven show, and they do not disappoint. The guy is presented as diligent, and hard working. He is classmates with tsundere girl, and reaches out to her to help her even with her treating him badly. He is bright, and doesn't give up on her, taking her insults in stride. This is important to the tsundere girl's motivations later on. His kindness and warmth is not lost on tsundere girl, even if it seems like it at first.The popular girl has motivations that seem very innocent and normal at first, but she harbors a secret as well, a reason for doing what she does that turns out to be far more than just simple feelings that we see at first. The reasons for each person to act the way they do fits into a realistic situation. They do not seem forced by any means, and they are not cookie cutters made to fit a single role. They express a complexity that is often difficult to properly portray in stories like this. The only thing is the tsundere girl clinging so hard to her defenses and walls to keep the others out, even as they imprint deeper and deeper into her heart. This is especially true for the guy, who the more she seems to come to feel for him, the meaner she seems to get.The tsundere girl is quicker to admit the popular girl is her friend, and her only friend, but that is even a strain for her. She has a good motivation, having suffered trauma at her mother's treatment of her through her childhood, which explains well why she's the rough girl she is. Inside however, her defenses aren't as strong as she wants everyone to think.The popular girl seems innocent and somewhat predictable, yet they give her motivations for her actions that are a little surprising, though they make perfect sense once they are revealed. She's not as sweet and innocent as she first appears, though in the end she shows a level of love that is admirable.The guy, as we discussed, is true blue, a good guy through the heart of him, even though he gets into some difficult situations as the end comes around. He tries his best to not hurt anyone, though the situation isn't that easy to escape, and hearts are involved, massively complicating the whole thing. He tries to tread lightly, but it's just not a situation where there's a 'right' way out of. He deals with what happens in a manner that speaks of his wounded heart, as he struggles to not only honor the girls, but also stay true to himself. He's a satisfying male lead, something that can be a bit hard to find in some of these romantic triangle type stories. Even though he does some things that clearly hurt the girls, he is not a player nor is he looking to juggle the girls, or have his cake and eat it too. He's trying to navigate the minefield that is love, and stumbles here and there, as we all do.Enjoyment: 9I really loved my time with White Album 2, with one reservation, that being the ending. It is not a bad ending by any means, but if you've ever seen any of my other reviews you might be aware of my love of grand endings. This one does not go out the way I would have it do. It's heartbreaking, yet at the same time, the ending is also immensely heartwarming and beautiful. Even though I would have made it a 'Western' styled ending for the tsundere girl, it admittedly not cap the story off in a way that gave any true resolution. Though I'm loathe to admit it, they really did a good job wrapping the story up. So I had my expectations, and I still wanted it to happen that way, I can't deny they masterfully brought it all to a close and in a manner that is hopeful for the trio. It was a heartwarming tale from beginning to end, with only a small bit of pacing issues, and as the end steamed into the station, I found myself mesmerized and anxious to continue watching as each episode ended, which to me speaks to how much I enjoyed the series.Best Girl: Touma Kazusa. The tsundere girl wins hands down. The popular girl is cute and played well, but nothing beats a mean girl, ever. I love the way Kazusa was drawn, her voice, and her demeanor. She might have been close to too mean at times, but I guess I like the abuse. Mean girls forever!In closing I would heartily recommend giving White Album 2 a chance, especially if you like drama and romance, as this has both in spades. There were times I felt the agony the characters were going through, times when my heart soared and I was giddy when a good development happened, and smiled like a fool every time tsundere girl dropped her attitude for a moment and showed she was actually a caring person, no matter what kind of mask she wore. As for the RTLR wall of romance, Kazusa and Setsuna bumped off a pic of Black Widow from the wall, taking the spot instead. All thumbs up!"", 'First of all, this Anime is very underrated due to the fact that many people dislike  pure drama and extreme love triangles. This Anime is not for those who get easily Irritated by a Scene that could be called cheating? or Maybe they just don\'t stand to be patient.People are calling this Anime ""NTR"" garbage and all, but every single Anime where theres Drama and Love Triangle theres bound to be heart twisted scenes.For this Story,its a 10/10. Because the Mellow drama goes so well with the Story development. I really loved this story, dont know about othersArt 10/10, do I have to tell...people whySoundtracks.... SPOT ON... the White Album\'s sound tracks are so amazing.Character... Both for The two Female leads its a 10/10... as for the MC, if you have watched other Love Triangle Animes, the MC is bound to be a Loser and Dumb when it comes to love since You are the Lead as the MCEnjoyment... like I said, Many mightve underrated the show, but They still watched every single episodes.

', ""IntroductionEvery season, despite my best efforts, there is a great anime that slips beneath my radar. Last fall, that anime was White Album 2—an excellently told romantic drama that isn’t afraid to stab you right in the emotions and then twist the knife just to be sure.*Note: Despite being “White Album 2,” this is not a sequel as a much as it is a second anime set in the same world. While characters and events of White Album are mentioned, they have no impact on the story.A Solid, Serious Love StoryIn these days where the amount of rom-coms vastly outnumber serious romantic dramas, White...Album 2 is a bit of a rarity. It is the tale of three seniors in a high-end college prep school: Haruki, an excellent student learning to play the guitar, Kazusa the “bad-girl” (and secret musical savant of the class), and Setsuna, the school idol. The three form a band and, as the story progresses, form a deep friendship that eventually turns into a love triangle.It is a great example of a group of people struggling to keep both the friendships they have and yet get the romance they want as well. Moreover, it is not simply two girls fighting over the boy they want; it is a true love triangle where the friendship between the two girls is on the same level of importance as the romance each desires with Haruki.In other words, it’s one of those shows that will put your emotions through the wringer several times before it is done.Human, Though Not Always LikeableHaruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna are all well-rounded characters. They have their own goals, backstories, and motivations. Moreover, they develop as the story goes on. But what makes them human are the dumb and/or downright terrible things they do/inadvertently do to one another. No one is evil: They always have the best of intentions, but sometimes letting feelings rule over logic is the surest recipe for disaster.Selective DirectingFor the most part, the story of White Album 2 is told from Haruki’s point of view. Occasionally we see Setsuna or Kazusa’s actions without Haruki present, but these scenes tend to be short and/or serve to set the stage for Haruki’s next entrance. While watching, it is something you probably won’t notice nor think about—until secrets start being revealed as the anime nears its end. While feeling like you are getting the complete story as you watch, the selective viewpoint serves to blind both Haruki and you to all that is happening behind the scenes—especially in the case of Setsuna.A Villain in Her Own Love StoryWithout a doubt, Setsuna is the deepest character in White Album 2. On one hand, she is beautiful and talented. On the other hand, she is emotionally scarred by rejection from her friends years before—making her now keep everyone at a distance. Yet, her backstory is just the tip of her development. As the series goes on, we see her gain friends and even enter into her first romantic relationship. But what’s most interesting is how she views herself in this whole situation.ConclusionWhite Album 2 is one of those works that showcases one of life's simple truths: Love is messy. Three good people with all the best of intentions heading in can easily find themselves tangled in a mess of emotions where there is no right answer; someone, potentially everyone, is going to get hurt. If you need a serious romantic drama in your life, there are few better emotional rollercoasters in recent anime than White Album 2. Just don’t expect to come out of it feeling happy and fulfilled.

What makes this show different from let\'s say Clannad is that while the focus is the romance; it covers other themes as well. The themes of betrayal is real heavy, as well as the theme of selfish love. But when it\'s not deep into drama, White Album 2 is an enjoyable story about three people in a band. The problems the band go through to get things done before the festival, and the bond of the Haruki, Setsuna, and Kazusa...is very strong. The only thing that might bother others, is the very slow, but subtle pacing. Some may feel not much was done in the episode, but something was done; that may come into focus later. But, really this isn\'t a problem for me. As, I enjoyed the interaction of the character a lot.CHARACTERSThe characters are what really made the show for me. Well, three characters. Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna. They really do seem like the typical anime characters, at first. Haruki, is your harem main character, Setsuna is your misunderstood idol, and Kazusa is the silent expert. But as the series goes on, they turn out to be all very flawed characters, in a good way that makes everyone give off a very human vibe. They are all selfish in one way or the other, and it really makes the relationship between them really interesting, and heart breaking to watch. Setsuna is notable for this. Her actions weren\'t always likable, but I understood them, and she didn\'t come off as a character of malice. But as a rather humane-like character. Same thing with Haruki and Kazusa. They both come off as humane. But, I found  Setsuna the most easy to relate to, because of her overall character theme of her character arc. Which I would not dare spoil.ANIMATIONThe animation is actually nothing too special, it works,and that\'s it. While White Album 2, does not excel in the actual animation, it does do some excellent shading and lighting. Every character in the show has some shiny appeal to them, and it makes the character designs look more pretty than it should. The lighting is very pretty. During the night is particular good looking. The night just gives off a cold tone to me, and when it\'s after school, the sky just looks like how I\'d like after school in real life to be. (Instead we get hot sun...)MUSICThe music of  White Album 2 is kind of underwhelming , but at the same time I it supports the scenes they were used in greatly. I notice the music and at the same time I don\'t. I don\'t remember most songs, but the moment I hear them; memories flood in. But what really made me like the music, is  the insert songs. I usually don\'t go for the 90\'s pop, but I really like the insert songs. One of my favorites is the song, ""White Album"", really is a great song, that connects the characters. Overall, while the soundtracks mostly just support the anime greatly, the insert songs, are very effective.OVERALLI found White Album not to be the best or original romance ever, but really this shows has some of the most complex characters in a romance I have ever seen. While anime like Nagi no asukara, do indeed show that being in love means possibly hurting someone else. White Album 2 shows us that being in love really makes us monsters, selfish, and sometimes it can make us do irrational things. Overall, White Album 2 has to be one of the best shows that aired in 2013. And, I kinda regret passing it off as a shit harem. Man, as much I would like the rest of the story animated, I don\'t think it will.  With the low sales in Japan, but for what we have, I\'m satisfied. is very strong.

What I’m talking about is the sheer amount of reality there is in this anime. It\'s so real, I even answered one of the characters questions because I got mixed up between real life and this anime, and believed it was directed at me. That\'s why; at the end of the anime I shed man tears. (Not to be confused with regular tears). The anime shows the “Truth” of romance.

An interesting love trio, a realistic an entertaining plotline and good music. This show wasn’t your typical slice of life “K-ON, Fill them up so much you can fill a canyon filler” anime, it was plot, development and enjoyment. In fact, it was so unflawed I could use this anime as a shield and sit through an entire episode of mars of destruction, though I might have had to skip the opening and ending (lets not get crazy here, I still have a good 80 years ahead of me).The anime really touched upon some pretty deep subjects such as Trust and Responsibility, showing how a deeper connection is needed, and more communication is also needed for a relationship to take place. For instance, the main character had no idea that the Touma was interested in him. Touma, the typical “Tsundere” type of character. her personality made all advances impossible for Kitahara, leading to a sad ending where they both knew they initially loved each other, but their personalities got in front of that.So, in conclusion there are two ways you can go about watching this anime.1.\tThe most typical way, watch it and enjoy it throughout.2.\tWatch it, and learn from it.I took the second rout; I’ve learned two main things:1.\tCommunication is the most important thing in any relationship; Friendship or Dating.2.\tThe Truth hurts.And some scores for those who wanted some:Character: 10Art: 9Sound: 10Enjoyment: 8Story: 8Overall: 9Hate music and wondering whether to go for the watch or not?

Instead of taking an easy way out with the ending as so many romance shows do nowadays, you'll actually get a conclusion, even if it is somewhat disappointing to be honest.The story follows Haruki, Setsuna, and Kazusa as the three form a band for their school's festival. As expected, a love triangle begins, but unlike most love triangle scenarios, this one actually does an incredible job developing each character's emotions and really showing you that everyone loses in a love triangle and that no one really is the...bad guy. This is pretty difficult to pull off since it's so easy to just pile the blame onto one character who just breaks everyone's heart. But because the inner workings of the triangle don't really get revealed until halfway through the show, the first half will probably be boring if you're not a fan of watching concerts, because after all it is categorized as a music anime. After episode 6 or so, a lot of plot and character development happens as you begin to learn that because love in itself is a selfish thing (you want that person for yourself and vice versa), a love triangle cannot satisfy everyone, but the key like I said before is that because each character doesn't want to hurt anyone else, they lie both to each other and to themselves about how they really feel. This is probably the strongest aspect of the show. However, the ending definitely is disappointing. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be satisfied with it, but in the end you realize it's realistic; a love triangle could end no other way.The art was okay, but like what a lot of other reviews have said, the way they animated their movements when playing instruments was a little bland and not expressive.Since it is a music anime, you're going to be hearing a ton of it, and honestly the music is fantastic. It would've been difficult to watch it through if the music had been bad.The characters were really well developed too, but you might not get that feeling at first. They might seem pretty cliche in the beginning: a nice guy, an outgoing popular girl, and a talented tsundere. But soon you'll realize that they're both immature and mature in their own ways. They all want to preserve their friendships with each other, so they think lying and burying their feelings is the best option, but alas a love triangle never works out that way. By the end you'll be sympathizing with all the characters, discovering that given the position they were in, they probably did make the best choice.Overall, I thought this was a fantastic anime that was well executed. It's not easy to make a love triangle situation where no one is the bad guy, but they pulled it off with White Album 2. If you're in the mood for a romance anime with an actual ending and not some weird harem conclusion, then this is the show for you. bad guy.

It’s a feels like a void, that after watching this you won’t be able to find anything to fill the emptiness that this show leaves on an emotional level. White Album 2 is a rollercoaster ride of emotion, and trust me it is one hell of a ride.White Album 2 was done by Satelight who have done a wide range of anime from Noein to Fairy Tail.The story follows Haruki Kitahara and the light music club in his high school. It takes place in...the last half of his final year in high school. The light music club is disbanding and the only thing that can save it is if Haruki gets the mysterious piano player from the room across from where he practices and finds a replacement singer before the school festival. Now White Album is a sequel but a standalone sequel, you don’t need to see White Album to understand what is going on in White Album 2. The story itself is what White Album 2 does very well. It is a drama, romance, slice of life anime and from the anime from the same genres I have seen White Album 2 is a great one, it does have its flaws but so does every anime. The story is set in two arcs: before the festival and the aftermath of the festival. The first focuses on character development and showing us the personality of the characters setting up the second half of the show. The second arc presents us with the development of the characters relationships with each other and expands upon their already developed characters. The story is tear jerking and wonderful and fills you with so many emotions through the course of thirteen episodes. To me it is a good love story with many twist and turns from, illness to love triangles.The characters are also very well crafted. To start things off you have our main lead Haruki Kitahara, he is a smart, preachy, meddlesome and caring boy who would do anything to help his friends. He is your typical male lead from a slice of life show. Haruki is also a member of the light music club and he plays the guitar. There is also the dual female lead: Setsuna Ogiso and Kazuki Touma. Setsuna is the school idol who everyone adores, with a beautiful voive. Kazuki is the mysterious student transferred from the elite music department. Both characters like Haruki’s are very well fleshed out, they both add something different to the drama aspect of the show. Setsuna is the happy go lucky girl of the group who is near enough perfect, whilst Kazuki is your typical quiet tsundere character who at first doesn’t say much but you have a deep feeling she wants to say more than she does. In anime I usually don’t like the tsundere characters but Kazuki Touma is the exception. Her character is so well developed and her interactions with the other characters so well done that I couldn’t help but love her as a character. There are a few side charcaters like Haruki’s friends and Kazuki’s mother and they fill their roles perfectly. The only character I actually had a problem with was Haruki himself just for the fact that he was a little bit dense when it came to women but I suppose it was kind of a character trait as well.The animation is quite good. It’s not Kill La Kill or Gurren Lagann quality but it’s very pretty and works well with the show. The animation was at its best during the musical performances especially at the festival performance episode. They used great use of lighting in the show which helped the moods of the scenes.The soundtrack is amazing. Its musical score fits the show so well. The songs used in the performance scenes are well written and catchy as well as the opening and ending songs. The music in most places was light and peaceful and added a sense of magic to the show. The voice actors do a great job making their character’s come to life. Hitomi Nabatame did a great job voicing Kazuki Touma. She has appeared in a wide variety of anime like Oreimo voicing Saori.Now I have gave my praises I should probably let you in on the flaws of the show. To me they are pretty minor, the biggest of these minor flaws being how abruptly the show ends. It just stops. However it could be argued that this is to show reality and that even though the characters want one thing doesn’t mean they will always get it.Currently I White Album 2 hasn’t been licensed outside of Japan. I searched for a while and I couldn’t find any details on if it was licensed or not. However fear not if you want to watch this anime then you can do so on Crunchyroll, I will leave a link and you can go watch it and if you want to enjoy White Album 2 to the fullest you can sign up for the 2 week free membership and try out their premium services. Thank you for reading my review and till next time sayonara the last half of his final year in high school.

Thank you for reading my review and till next time sayonara', ""I almost didn't watch White Album 2. I was under the presumption that White Album 2 would be a continuation of the original White Album series. I was very put off by White Album 1, so I was hesitant to jump into this show. However, once I learned that White Album 2 was in no way related to White Album 1 (different characters, separate plots, etc.) I decided to give it a try. Boy, am I glad that I did.This was the most emotionally impactful show I've watched in the past year. That is a really bold statement when you include shows like Golden...Time and 5 cm/s (and others of their ilk) in the list of things I've seen in the past year. If I rated this show on it's emotional impact alone, I would give it a 10/10. This show had me thinking about it for days after I finished watching it.The story and characters seem to be somewhat typical for an anime of this genre on the surface, but as the show progresses the depth of the story and characters becomes very apparent. This isn't a show that spoon feeds you plot points through dialogue though. You are expected to pay attention and take note of the characters' non-verbal cues as well in order to understand the depth of what is happening. I actually had to re-watch a couple episodes because I took a break mid-way through the series and forgot a few important details (that were very quick in terms of the screen time) that really impacted the end of the story.Art/Sound are well produced and typical of a major anime studio. Nothing particularly special stands out about the art. It is very average for this genre. However, many people will mention the music--and the songs are well sung and somewhat catchy--but this isn't an anime about music. Music is more of plot device that brings the characters together and helps to drive their initial interactions.That said, I felt the music choices were appropriate and helped amp up the emotions to 11. One quick note I have to sneak in is I really enjoyed that the sound director knew when SILENCE was actually the most effective tool. It was extremely powerful every time the music cut. I was happy to see a sound director who didn't create an overly dramatic scene with maudlin music and instead let the actions and atmospheric sounds create their own drama.I have minor complaints regarding the characters and the plot, but I don't feel they are significant enough that they should discourage or encourage someone to watch the show. Ultimately, this is a story of consummate love and the strife that often follows it. Many things that the characters do will be loved by some and hated by others. I try to analyze the characters from their point of view and decide for myself what I felt was appropriate or not, so I'll allow any potential viewers to do the same.Ultimately, those small flaws and the average art bring the series down to an 9/10 for me. Even so, I can't express how much I enjoyed this series. It is insanely close to being a 10/10, but I simply don't believe the animation quality and the other minor flaws allow me to give it full marks.This is a must watch for any fan of anime.

Before you read anything else just make yourself a favor and read the Visual Novel at some point because it is truly a masterpiece.As for the anime, it is a romance anime, a love triangle about a boy named Haruki and two girls named Kazusa and Setsuna. They come together while preparing for the school festival.This is...a show that is more about the characters than any specific plot points. Also, as someone who had already played this part of the Visual Novel which was adapted, I would suggest you reading this to just go blind but also to give it some time to mature because it doesn't try to fill you with twist at the end of episodes or a bunch of jokes but this is really something that comes together as a whole package.As for the technical stuff, the music is lovely but due to the structure of anime episodes having only 20 minutes on average, some moments I felt needed more time to the music to hit its intended objective but in the need of cut scene a bit shorter, they may not quite hit their mark. Again, this is from the perspective of someone made a comparison with the VN, but one just seeing this may overlook this.The art is beautiful, much more so than the VN in my opinion. The overall tone and colors are also lovely the sad thing is that the animation itself isn't top tier but it is understandable and given this is a down to earth story it is perfectly fine.Overall, I recommend it but by the end you may be wanting a bit more (the visual novel). a show that is more about the characters than any specific plot points.

You are the second anime to do that to me after Anohana.I believe White Album 2 is something what all romance lovers seek and want to watch.Lets take a look at its different aspects.Story: I give the story a 10. It revolves around three people Kitahara Haruki, Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. As you might have guessed with 2 female characters and 1 male it is bound to be a love triangle. And here it is your guess is correct. Is this series generic? At one part I would say yes(won\'t...give you the spoilers though). The three main characters somehow come together in the Light Music Association with a lot of effort but up by Kitahara. The heart breaking tale of the three then begin which is sure to touch your hearts.Art: Giving it a 9. Only one word ""beautiful"".Sound: Well the anime has a musical setting. Obviously the sound quality is something it should be praised for. The voice actors are in perfect sync with the Characters. Also I must say the songs in the anime are just wonderful. I hardly felt like skipping them(and here I am who doesn\'t even understand the songs but still want to listen to them).Character: The character development is slow and steady and yeah you get attached to the characters of the story. At one scene I was like please don\'t cry Kazusa, I can\'t see you cry.(Yea that kind of a feeling comes every now and then).Enjoyment: Sure the series is enjoyable. If it wasn\'t I wouldn\'t have bothered to write a review. The twists and turns in the story you getting totally immersed in the story. What is it if not enjoyment?Overall the series is a 10 for me.P.S. Give it a try its lovely. give you the spoilers though).

I think it was a trainwreck kind of show, but surprisingly it was the good kind of trainwreck.I liked how it ended. It felt natural. Because life isn`t always about dream-like encounters and never ending hapiness. I could see that ending coming right from the very beginning but it was still really enjoyable.I`m not gonna lie, before watching episode 1, i thought ""this will be a freaking disaster and i know i`ll drop it right in the first three episodes"".But guess what? I ended up liking it a...lot.You see, the thing with certain anime series is that sometimes they try too hard to portray a realistic story. And they often fail (hard) in doing that. But then you have shows like White Album 2, that actually succeed in creating a serious and mature atmosphere. The characters here are human and naturally have flaws. And that`s a good thing. It makes them more likable that way. And harder to blame for what they do during the series.Besides, it has an outstanding soundtrack, a very, very good one.Sure, i don`t think this is the kind of story that can blow you away, far from it, but it`s definitely one of the best romance stories of 2013, so you shoul give it a try! lot.You see, the thing with certain anime series is that sometimes they try too hard to portray a realistic story.

Why? Well...White Album 2, for me, is very good. Each aspect of this anime is done very well. The story is fantastic. It is very believable, and you will get invested to the plot and the characters. Speaking of characters, that for me is another strong point of White Album. Haruki, Kazusa, and Setsuna are all very likable, and you could easily emphatize with all 3. They are all three dimensional, with motivations, goals, and...flaws. Another strength of this anime is the sound. Though the BGM doesn't exactly stand out, the music that the characters perform are actually very good, and you would fall in love with 'White Album' by episode 1.If I have to state any weaknesses to this show, it would have to be the animation. Stills appear numerous times. The one that particularly irks me is the concert one, where instead of showing us, say, the atmosphere within the gymnasium, or the audience just rocking out to the music, we get a montage recycled animation from the last episodes. A bit lazy there, I think. It didn't actually affect my experience much, though, since I'm more of a story guy than an art guy.I hope you could see where I'm coming from when I gave this anime an initial 10. So why did I take it back? Well, in my personal opinion, there isn't what I'd call an 'x-factor' to it. Even though White Album 2 is great in pretty much all aspects, there's really nothing that stands out from it. I noticed that those animes that are 10-worthy really has aspects that make it stand out from the usual crowd, i.e. Steins;Gate with its stellar storytelling and character development, or Clannad A.S. with its heart wrenching scenes.But for what it is, White Album 2 is a really damn good romance. It's very well made, and I highly recommend that you pick it up if you have the time.(Note that this is my first review, so apologies.) flaws. Another strength of this anime is the sound.

That being said, W.A.2 is 10 times better than W.A.  The story is about growing up, love, and friendship.They managed to tell a good, complete story in 13 episodes with minimal fillers and silliness.  They make full use of each episode, and spend their time largely on character development.  All I can say is WOW!!!!  Watch this Anime!!! ', 'White Album, 2 a anime that started off great potential but is squandered with bad writing, horrible storytelling and a idiotic conclusion. Its pretty disappointing and frustrating because w.a.2 could really have been amazing. After reading some of the glowing reviews and seeing it scored so highly, I went in with hopeful expectations but ended up severely disappointed.Art:Great Artwork all around. The character models and backgrounds are well detailed. The more crucial emotional scenes were especially impressive and beautiful with the snow,lighting and coloring.Sound:With a title white album comes with expectations in this department an  it did not disappoint. The score...was somber and beautiful throughout the story and conveyed the mood of the scenes perfectly.Characters/Story: (I put this category together as my opinion coincides and pertains greatly with both)The first couple of episodes left me hopeful and excited how the characters and their relationships would develop and how the story would unfold but instead of leading into something great... it falls flat.  I can\'t go into details without giving MAJOR spoilers and my review won\'t much sense without revealing them but i\'ll do my best.As a story themed around Love and Friendship its done horribly. The romantic feelings and love the mc\'s has toward one of female\'s mc\'s is severely underdeveloped and doesn\'t even make sense, it basically comes out of nowhere. The story/flashbacks only portrays his kindness and friendship never love and so when he reveals his love to her its unbelieveable, totally spoiling the main conflict! Setsuna\'s troubled past with friends in middle school that shape her thinking and motivations is also laughably underdeveloped, its shown/talked about very lighty for 3 minutes! Its just plain written poorly and a super weak motivation overall why she is crazily obsessed with holding the 3 mc\'s friendship forever.  Even the conclusion\'s reveal that shows the main twist and main motivating decision and logic of one the mc\'s is just baffling and implausible , making you question and think  ""really....that was the whole point behind that mc\'s actions and decisions... how nonsensical and moronic"".Conclusion:As I cannot give any proper review why i scored white album 2 a ""5""  without giving spoilers I apologize. While i don\'t think its the worst romance anime ive seen, its average at best.

Even the conclusion\'s reveal that shows the main twist and main motivating decision and logic of one the mc\'s is just baffling and implausible , making you question and think  ""really....that was the whole point behind that mc\'s actions and decisions... how nonsensical and moronic"".Conclusion:As I cannot give any proper review why i scored white album 2 a ""5""  without giving spoilers I apologize. While i don\'t think its the worst romance anime ive seen, its average at best. Maybe watch it on rainy day if you got nothing to watch and bored, is the only way i can recommend it.', ""SPOILER-FREE and R-RATED REVIEW:Here are some things you MUST know before watching this anime:- This anime is only 1/3 of the entire story. I would recommend Googling a summary of the follow-up chapters from the visual novel or game, called the CC and the Coda. These are a real doozy; keep this in mind when the plot becomes absolute raw emotion and just generally crazy as hell.- This anime is based off of eroge visual novels. And it definitely plays like one. The pacing is very similar to what you would expect from a visual novel. Although the VN's are pretty sexual, this...anime is definitely toned down from that. Probably appropriate for anyone 13+.- The beginning is EXTREMELY slow. Like, I almost stopped watching after episode 6 because I felt like nothing was really progressing. There I was, in bed with the flu, and I was STILL bored watching this... and I literally had nothing else to do. But hey, that's just my opinion.I had an extremely hard time developing an opinion of this anime, but I feel as though I have reached mySTORY: 6/10 - 3 of the most unlikely of friends come together to form a small band to play for the school's upcoming fair. Nothing special, until later, where the REAL plot starts to kick in. However, as mentioned before, I still felt the introduction was WAY too long and slow for my tastes.ART: 5/10 - I thought the art in this anime was completely run-of-the-mill. If you like that KyotoAni art style then you will probably enjoy the looks of this, but I found it average at best. Also, that animation of Haruki's guitar playing, besides the intro, is laughable.SOUND: 9/10 - Obviously if you're making an anime about a band of musicians, there's gotta be music. That White Album song is super awesome, even if it sounds like something straight out of 90's pornography. I appreciated the background piano tracks; they were pretty nice but not spectacular or anything I would listen to on its own.CHARACTER: 8/10 - The one thing I thought was the most unique about this anime is that the characters are very human like, especially near the conclusion. This anime isn't always lovey dovey. It can be ruthless at times - to each other, and to the audience.  Besides this, I won't go in detail of the characters in general for 2 reasons: First of all because the side characters are mainly useless and rigid. Secondly because this is a spoiler-free review and the two female leads are very complex, so it's better left unsaid for the sake of this review.ENJOYMENT: 4/10 - As I said before, this anime is incomplete plot-wise and the beginning is very slow. I liked the show at times, but I mostly found myself bored, as terrible as that sounds. The drama in this show can be a little absurd at times too, with characters being in places they have no right to be just for the sake of them seeing or hearing specific events. The ending was pretty tense, but I was left unsatisfied by the end of the series.OVERALL: 6/10 - This score is found by taking the scores of all categories and finding the average. And a 6 it shall be, which I find appropriate for this.Would I recommend it? Only in niche cases, if you are looking for a heavy drama with some music. Otherwise I would tell you to pass. anime is definitely toned down from that. Probably appropriate for anyone 13+.- The beginning is EXTREMELY slow.

I think the characters are really interesting and the interactions between them are great. A lot of people say the characters change halfway through or towards the end. I disagree. We learn more about the characters towards the end of the show and understand some of the choices they made and what their thoughts and perspective were.The music was great. Especially ""White Album"". I really love that song. The...soundtrack was very fitting for the emotional parts. No problems there. The problems lie in the story organization and decisions.The show has three critical points. The halfway point which was episode 7. Then around episode 10 ish is the end of the second ""arc"" you could say. Then the last two episodes. I think that the build up and character forming up to episode 7 was great. I think continuing on after episode 7 was good too. *IMPORTANT* A lot of people said it went downhill, which is incorrect. It was perceived like that because the show didn\'t get better after episode 7. Just because it didn\'t get better doesn\'t mean its bad.The ending was interesting. I think it wasn\'t fitting for the show but it didn\'t ruin the show either. Its really hard to explain without spoilers so go watch the show, form an opinion, and come back to read this next part:*SPOILERS*Alright, to start with, the show builds up to episode 7 really well. However I think that it was too early to have such a strong, meaningful climax. After the show is finished, this climax doesnt really mean anything. That\'s my problem with the show. The way the ending was written and the things said by Ogiso at the end really bother me. The show was really good and fun to watch but they threw it away a little bit by making the ending a giant f***fest. Both girls loved him but Ogiso loved him less but still told him that so he got with her instead of Touma? Dumb. The feeling I had throughout those last few episodes was annoyed. A level of annoyed not enough to make me quit but enough to put me in a mood and make it hard to enjoy. I think that the way Ogiso explained that she knew that Touma loved him and he loved Touma and that she got in between them was super wack, I guess? I don\'t think it was very brilliant writing for a drama/romance series that was talented enough to make the first half. Still yet, the show is good and I really love it.How I would fix it:First off, first 7 episodes go by too quick. The first 7 episodes needed to be a full season perhaps. The 8th episode was really fitting for the beginning of a new arc, which could\'ve been a season 2. If it were 10 episode seasons, the shows spacing would\'ve been perfect. The first season would be developing character relationships and then the seventh episode (the climax) would end the season. The first season foreshadows about the love triangle we witness later on. The second season (last six episodes) would spend the first bit giving perspective to Touma and then confronting the love triangle going on. But instead of Ogiso rolling over and just taking it, she fights for herself a little more. Saying things along the lines of, ""I knew you were in love with her but I love you too."" type of deal. And then the finale being he chooses between them in the airport I guess? The last episodes would need to be tweaked from what actually happens in the show.MAIN POINT:The shows ending isn\'t satisfying because Ogiso just gives in. She doesn\'t fight for his love, she just gives it to Touma which made all of the annoying f***ery not worth it in the end. Her giving up at the end like that makes the show uninteresting and makes everything they developed in the beginning useless. The big picture of it being, it makes it hard for you to feel bad for Ogiso and it doesn\'t feel good for Touma to win either, no matter who you were rooting for.Thanks if you read it all. Means a lot! :) soundtrack was very fitting for the emotional parts. No problems there. The problems lie in the story organization and decisions.The show has three critical points.

Means a lot! :)', ""White Album 2 was just a different type of romance anime to me. It had a much different feel than anything I had watched before. This might be weird to say about a high school romance anime, but it felt more mature than a normal show of the genre. This maturity made the relationships in the show feel more realistic.I usually don't talk about or think about themes when reviewing shows, as it usually isn't pertinent enough to my rating to bother mentioning, but I loved the theme of White Album 2. The messiness, and non-optimal scenarios that is love. That things don't work...out for the best just because its fated that way but because of decisions we make, and that sometimes even if the right thing is the right thing, for ouselves it can be the wrong thing. And similarly, sometimes doing the wrong thing is right for us. *Minor Spoilers* It also had what I would rate as the most tastefully done, best sex scene in an anime. I wholeheartedly believe that scene was actually important in making WA2 what it is and would hurt my rating of the shows plot and story progression had it been left out. *Spoiler end*This show is a great 8.5, which makes is a top 10 show on my list. It is fantastic. Definitely a great watch.Also, as a side note, I absolutely loved the music in this series. It was great. out for the best just because its fated that way but because of decisions we make, and that sometimes even if the right thing is the right thing, for ouselves it can be the wrong thing.

It is fantastic. Definitely a great watch.Also, as a side note, I absolutely loved the music in this series. It was great."", 'In my review for White Album the original, I stated that It was a masterpiece and I don\'t regret saying that one bit because in it\'s own way it undoubtedly was, but I\'d be lying to myself If I didn\'t say that WA2 is simply better. It hit that much harder in my heart honestly I feel it myself. This show has the best portrayal of love and jealousy throughout all of anime: across all anime- 10/10. #ToumaIt really started the moment that Setsuna asked him out, especially taking into consideration the fact the she said multiple times after he fell into...his love for Touma, that it was her own fault because she knew of the existing feelings between the two of them but figured that if she acted now she wouldn\'t have gotten turned away.- This is where the jealousy is, she had developed her own love for Haruki so after she saw Touma kiss him she became jealous and asked him out, basically an act to take him for herself. It occurs a second time when it is snowing in the city and he meets with Touma... She lays herself bare when haruki starts slandering her only for him to realize that it had been his fault all along(Best moment); The second best moment as simple as it, is when Haruki and Touma had there passionate time together in his apartment.In comparison to White Album this has a lot less for me to think about. White Album on the contrary to this, didn\'t have all of the characters lay themselves bare, even the ones that did lay themselves bare like Mitsuki, Rina(Hard to tell), and Touya do it in a way and have following actions that make it hard for the viewer to realize what the character are truly feeling. This despite how it sounds, allows the watcher to use their heads and I think it\'s good for the show and let\'s the watcher decide it\'s worth; In WA2, The characters are laid bare. Simple as that but not simple at all,-- Touma in the city, Haruki in his bedroom with Touma, in the airport with the three of them, and Setsuna when she realizes Haruki\'s true feelings. This makes for viewers to see this story as something much more complete which I myself think it was, but in all honesty, it\'s not. I\'d like to see the future, the future with Haruki and Touma together as one, something more complete, more absolute... I stayed up past 4am on a school night to finish this, because these are the questions and thoughts that were parading through my mind, and despite their obvious responses I wanted to see more of it; The fact that I want to see more shows just how well the anime did of portraying the original story, tugging on all of my emotions in order to make me feel this story as though seeing it first person. This truly is a masterpiece in it\'s own right, one that\'s easy to miss and ignore, one that chooses to be shallow in some places and deep in others. This is an anime that brought GENUINE human feelings to the characters and played them perfectly, this is why it\'s superior to its predecessor and tons of other romance animes.I also enjoy how they reference to Yuki and Rina\'s songs and listen to ""White Album"", Everytime it comes on I can\'t help but sing and start feeling nostalgic as I think about White Album. This Mangaka has outstanding skill to be able to pull out such human emotions from drawn characters. With such a cliched plot, the human personalities make the anime that much better than many other romances. Totally would watch again; I\'d undoubtedly rank this #1 in terms of romances not because the story was that incredible, but because of how much it impacted my emotions and thoughts directly. his love for Touma, that it was her own fault because she knew of the existing feelings between the two of them but figured that if she acted now she wouldn\'t have gotten turned away.- This is where the jealousy is, she had developed her own love for Haruki so after she saw Touma kiss him she became jealous and asked him out, basically an act to take him for herself.

The pacing was correct, even though some things doesn't seem really neccesary to the story or are a little boring. The ending was pretty good and full of feels (sad, yes, but that doesn't make it bad).Art(7/10): This section bothers me a little. Sometimes the characters are really well designed with...really good colors. Very well made. But other times they aren't that well made. Not bad, but not outstanding. That bothers me, because they've already shown us that they can make things correctly. That's why I'm not giving this section more than a 7.Sound(10/10): As it is an anime based on a little group of music, the ost is really good. The bgm music go with the events correctly and the three main song (White Album, Sound of Destiny, Todokanai koi) are incredible (Todokanai Koi in the end of the last chapter really hit my kokoro).Characters(6/10): This is what really fucks me up. The characters sometimes act really stupidly. For example, when Kitahara was staying in Touma's house. Why kept it a secret? Why make things more confusing? And why did Setsuna get angry when she saw Kitahara's toothbrush in Touma's house? Like you are not the man's girlfriend yet, You've no right to get angry.Kitahara sometimes doesn't seem to have any kind of personality, he just do what others tell him to do. Other times he act in an exaggerated manner. Like wtf man, relax your tits. At least, he isn't all the time  like this. He has his good moments as well.Then there's Touma. I know you're meant to be proud and cool. But you've been in love with the man all the time and you don't move a single finger to do something, even when Setsuna was taking advantage. Like if you want him, go for him, don't cry later like you did.And finally there's Setsuna, I dont really dislike Setsuna, only the fact that she got in the middle of those two. It isn't bad what she made, I mean she got in love with the man and she went for him (learn Touma). But it doesn't make a lot of sense since she knew that Kitahara had been in love with Touma all the time.I've only  written about them in general, but they've all made a lot of dumb things that got me nervious a couple of times.I liked as well Kitahara's friend (not even remember his name lol), but he didn't appear too much.Enjoyment (8/10): As a matter of fact, I had already watched this show when it was being aired, so this has been my second time wacthing it, That's why there were some things I already knew about the show (I didn't remember a lot of other ones tho). There were points that got me a little bored, but I really enjoyed the ending and a lot of other moments.Overall(8/10): I'll recommend this show? Of course. It has his good moments and the feeling it lets you with is really good and nostalgic . really good colors. Very well made. But other times they aren't that well made. Not bad, but not outstanding.

It has his good moments and the feeling it lets you with is really good and nostalgic ."", 'White Album 2 (same universe yet from a different time) has very little to no connection to White Album. So you can immediately watch this series without worrying about the first season (which is subpar anyways based on my personal preference).The story and plot was decent enough to have a good foundation to a romance drama anime. I personally like the art style and character design, and the music was indeed outstanding.  A very genuine take on love triangle and the internal and external problems that comes with it.An anime with very great characters and a very solid pacing with decent plot. A...case where a love triangle is wonderfully portrayed. case where a love triangle is wonderfully portrayed.', 'I really wish there were more anime like White Album 2. Nothing about it is overly complex or ambiguous, and it makes for a relaxing show. My favorite genre is slice-of-life, and I tend to watch one whenever I finish an anime that is very mentally strenuous. White Album 2 made for a very pleasant experience in a very short period of time.Starting with the story of White Album 2, we find our characters in generic Japanese high school #1978650. The main male protagonist is Haruki Kitahara, a kind and responsible young man with a passion for music. His wish is to revive the...Light Music Club after its disbandment and play in an upcoming school festival. In my opinion, Haruki is somewhat generic. His design is lacking of any distinct characteristics, and he really is just a normal guy with a normal life and normal goals. That\'s not always bad however, as it is more realistic than a main who is overly bombastic, perverted or lazy. He\'s just average is all, but that is ok for this kind of story.Very quickly we see a simple love triangle form between Haruki and the other main characters. The first of which is Setsuna Ogiso, a kind girl who is a talented singer, as well as the idol of her school for winning the Miss Houjou Academy pageant. The second is Kazusa Touma, a very reclusive girl who is also a talented pianist. Haruki finds himself between these two ladies as he needs both of their support to revive the Light Music Club. Conveniently, Haruki is the guitarist, so the singing of Setsuna and the piano playing of Kazusa is the perfect fit.My main problem with White Album 2 is the cast. It’s not that they are bad characters, but rather that the anime kind of ""plays it safe,"" so to speak. The supporting cast is very small, and they get very limited screen time. Like Haruki, they lack defining characteristics, and their development is little to none. The only characters that I feel stick out are the two female leads. This is partly due to them being the only characters with backstory that isn\'t directly related to the plot. However, the lack of character development is not a hindrance, as the story is not so complex as to require such depth.The thing that makes White Album 2 better than other love triangle stories is the music. I don\'t necessarily mean the soundtrack, however. It’s just that for the majority of the show, music is what drove our characters. Music is what brought them together in the first place. And yes, the soundtrack is quite good. Although a bit overplayed, there is one song that appears several times during the anime that is especially good. Appropriately, it is called ""White Album.""Now, I did lose a little interest in the latter portion of the show. I did just say that the music is the most special thing about White Album 2, and the second half was primarily about the romance between our main characters. This makes sense of course, but it is saddening when your favorite thing about an anime takes the back seat for something else. Still, nothing about the second half is bad. In fact, it’s fantastic. The story is paced very well and it leads up to a satisfying conclusion.White Album 2 is not a masterpiece, but it is certainly well done. Being able to watch a good story in such a small amount of time was very refreshing. If you are not a big slice-of-life fan like myself, there are certainly better anime out there for you to watch. But if your tastes are similar to mine, you should put this anime on your list. Light Music Club after its disbandment and play in an upcoming school festival. In my opinion, Haruki is somewhat generic. His design is lacking of any distinct characteristics, and he really is just a normal guy with a normal life and normal goals. That\'s not always bad however, as it is more realistic than a main who is overly bombastic, perverted or lazy. He\'s just average is all, but that is ok for this kind of story.Very quickly we see a simple love triangle form between Haruki and the other main characters. The first of which is Setsuna Ogiso, a kind girl who is a talented singer, as well as the idol of her school for winning the Miss Houjou Academy pageant. The second is Kazusa Touma, a very reclusive girl who is also a talented pianist. Haruki finds himself between these two ladies as he needs both of their support to revive the Light Music Club. Conveniently, Haruki is the guitarist, so the singing of Setsuna and the piano playing of Kazusa is the perfect fit.My main problem with White Album 2 is the cast. It’s not that they are bad characters, but rather that the anime kind of ""plays it safe,"" so to speak. The supporting cast is very small, and they get very limited screen time. Like Haruki, they lack defining characteristics, and their development is little to none. The only characters that I feel stick out are the two female leads.

Pretty early on, you notice that both female protagonists have (or develop) feelings for the main protagonist, yet there's no real telling what will happen relationship-wise.

No matter what the outcome will be, at least one of them will be heartbroken in the end.The ending for me was really saddening, and definitely not what I would've...expected.There's kisses, romance, hugs, a sex-scene, but also betrayal, heartache and a lot of tears. expected.There's kisses, romance, hugs, a sex-scene, but also betrayal, heartache and a lot of tears."", '***May contain minor spoilers***""We finally became friends.

The show is a fairly straight-forward high school romance drama which follows Kitahara, Ogiso and Touma. These three are the main characters in the show and they receive all the attention. This is both good and bad as it means that we get to focus on their relationships with each other and their struggles in the more mundane life of high school. On the other hand the supporting cast receives almost no attention at all, and mostly serve as sounding boards when the main characters are in trouble.The story is simple;...Kitahara, our male hero, must convince Ogiso the school idol and Touma the enigmatic delinquent to join his k-on band. The goal of this is to perform in the school fair which is fast approaching. The relationships that evolve out of this simple premise is the main focus of the series. While it is a generic-sounding story-line, it remains interesting due to the fact that the fair does not happen at the end of the series, rather it happens somewhere in the middle. This gives us the chance to look at what happens both before, during and after. The chronological order of the series isn't entirely straight-forward either . All in all this gives a sense of forward motion, in other words the show doesn't really drag that much.The sound effects are nothing noteworthy, but the soundtrack has at least one track which caught my ear (White Album, as the series title). The voice acting didn't really stand out to me apart from Nabatame Hitomi who voiced Touma, she did a great job.The art suffered at times, still shots were used when there was no real reason to use them, and it seemed as though there were problems in production. This was far more noteworthy in some of the middle episodes. Character designs didn't really stand out, and I actively disliked the design on Ogiso Setsuna. She's supposed to be a school idol but seemed far too generic for my taste. Touma was more interesting visually (which might very well be on purpose) while Kitahara is as generic as male protagonists go design wise.The directing feels very focused on drawing out an emotional response from the viewer, yet I never felt as though I was closely connected to any of the characters, and at no point did I emphasize with them. Granted I'm a fair bit older than the characters, but that won't stop me from connecting with them if they're well-made. This made the not-so-subtle moments in the story stand out, and not in the way that the studio had intended.Yet in the end I found quite a bit of enjoyment from the series. It's pacing, structure, and willingness to depart from a chronological timeline all worked in the show's favor. The characters were quite well written, and manage to hold up the story with believable actions. The ending, while definitely not perfect, tied the plot together well enough. If you like shows with a heavy focus on romance and drama then this is your cup of tea. If not then you might still get some enjoyment out of some of the more bizarre situations that arise.A well-deserved 7/10.

I ended up sitting through all thirteen episodes until it was five in the morning and I was crying my eyes out.The characters, while driven by relatable, easy to understand motives really bring this show together.

Never have I felt more conflicted about the ""antagonist"" within the show. Setsuna steals Haruki in a believable and human way.

And I\'ll probably not write a review for a long time.I don\'t know why I gave this anime a 10. I rewatched it now and it wasn\'t really that good. It was just a love triangle romance anime which was done a billion times. But something about this anime... Something about that singing voice and that ending me cry something...Ok, so I watched this anime like 5 years ago and loved it. It was my favorite anime and I watched a playthrough of the original visual-novel this anime just because I loved it so much. I even cried for a...week for this anime. But then 5 years passed and I suddenly saw it in myanimalist. (My taste back then was pretty fucking trash)So I rewatched it, and I have to say it\'s not special like I thought it was. But somehow it made me cry. Somehow... even though it is so average. I don\'t understand!So now I am going to examine this anime carefully and see why this anime made me cry even though it was just a 13 episode love triangle. Of course, I know that nostalgia is a big part of why I cried but I need to examine this anime just to see what my teenage self found so captivating and emotional about it.Actually I\'m too lazy and I don\'t really care anymore. But I still do wanna point out a misconception about this anime. Think of it as a mini analyses/reviewI feel like most people have gotten the whole point of the anime wrong when they\'re trying to antagonize a single character.Ok lets go,Touma pulls the idc act. Theres no way to really see that she\'s in love with Haruki, so he accepts Setsuna\'s feelings as a result. However, it\'s Touma\'s first love. She is uncertain about her own feelings and doesnt know how to go about them.Setsuna did the selfish act, she got in the way of two lovers. But she had no other choice, if she didnt confess to Haruki, then she wouldve eventually been in Touma\'s position, in this case, the excruciatingly painful third wheel. Thats why i find people who say that ""Setsuna shouldnt have gotten in a way"", mostly hypocritical, because a world where she never did (confess), is a selfish desire of Touma, as selfish as Setsuna confessing.Futhermore, she even asks Touma if it\'s alright if she (setsuna) can date Haruki, but Touma continues to pull the idc act; is it really fair to blame just Setsuna?Haruki waits for people to confess to him. Like Touma, he is indecisive. When he accepts Setsuna\'s feelings, he neglects his own, which causes pain for everyone, including himself. Here\'s where the story get interesting. Unlike Touma, who realized her feelings for Haruki from the start of the anime, Haruki didnt realize it until Touma started to neglect him. Its because she was getting further from him he realized his love for her. He said it pretty clearly, how he wanted to spend Setsuna\'s birthday party with her only, because he wants to confirm his feelings, but by this point, he already knows his heart isnt with Setsuna. It is also at this point, Haruki could have cut the losses (of the pain train) by being honest with Setsuna and broke up with her, but he doesnt out of selfishness.  Because if Touma rejected Haruki,  he would be left with nothing.None of the characters could predict how their actions would reap such sever consequences. Their love driven actions were for themselves, not their desired SO: which makes White Album 2 such an accurate depiction of what young love is truly about.Anyway I hope you like my review.I think a big part of why I gave it a 10 was just because it was my first romance anime and it just took a special place in my heart very early.

But it\'s a college story I thought, it can\'t be that good. But it is, also the characters bear an uncanny resemblance to Kouta and Lucy from Elfen Lied as well as Touko from Bloom Into You.White Album 2 is a story about strong bonds and a love polygon. Sometimes the writing in these series can be not so good and the characters not very interesting, for me Relife was forgettable for example. But the writing here is good,...the characters are interesting and the complexities of their relationships are portrayed well. The sound design is very good too. For me it\'s a solid 9/10 the characters are interesting and the complexities of their relationships are portrayed well. The sound design is very good too.

I\'ve been through some sad stuff lately and I\'ve been watching my fair share of SoL cause it makes me think about better days and I have to admit none made me feel like this one did. That\'s exactly what I want to focus on and maybe it will make this review somewhat biased but if you want to feel something then this is definitely for you. The review will be spoiler free.Story: 7Honestly SoL are more about character development and their interactions, the story arc isn\'t anything that will leave...you surprised. Even then, the story is far more complex than most SoL. Drama is huge here and it gets served in the right circumstances, nothing is too random. An argument can be made that the first 3 episodes are slow and eventless with a lot of cliches but it\'s not something too major. I give it a 7 cause the story is fairly simple but it\'s well executed and is consistent as soon as it gets going. In my opinion there\'s also an amazing closure to it, even though I\'ve seen a lot of rants about the ending (which I absolutely loved). It\'s open due to the Visual Novel game existing (that story arc is also pretty cool) but the anime ending still is somewhat fulfilling leaving you with a mouthful of mixed feelings.Art: 6This is the biggest problem. Animations are clunky and the art style makes pretty characters look kinda of disharmonious or downright ugly at times. Honestly some frames make them look dumb and emotions are not often conveyed with the power that this anime deserved. That aside the ambients range from fine to very pretty, even if somewhat stale, and it\'s nice to see varied clothing here and there, maybe with the exception of the over the top concert costumes but they are likable after all, fanservice or not they also have a meaning in the story. The art score is carried to a 6 by some few amazing scenes towards the end of the series. If you were only to watch the top moments of WA2, this score would probably be an 8. Sadly camera angles do matter a lot and art looks terrible from some of them.Sound: 10I\'m kinda obsessed with the soundtrack so this is uber biased. Even then everything is so catchy that is hard to blame myself. It is a music driven show after all and let me tell you that music carried me through the beginning of this anime. I\'m so glad it did cause it gets even better later on and every song in the end makes you feel something, which is the most important thing. All OD and ED are meaningful to the story and very nice to hear so big ups here. Sound is well executed in every other department, nothing really shines but it makes great moments even greater. Voice actors for the 3 main characters make them really feel real. At the beginning I hated one of the voices but it grew on me once I realized what really was behind the character that the VA was trying to portrait. This stands true for all the protagonists.Characters: 9I don\'t give it a 10 because only three characters are developed but boy, are they developed.Haruki is an undecisive young man who\'s approaching the first few important choices in his life and the way he confronts these and gets overwhelmed by them is sooooo real. Sometimes he looks like a dick, sometimes he looks like a passive guy, sometimes he looks like he firmly has in hand everything about his life. His strengths and weaknesses make him a real human being and that will make you hate him at times but life is hard and love hurts, he deals with it the best he can which is not very much.Kazusa much like the MC has no clue how to be around people and how to develop a relationship the way it\'s ""supposed"" to be. This character is the one who has the most complicated decisions, who gets the worse of it and at the same time is the one with the most consistent behaviour imo. She\'s not very complex, she just hides it very well. She may look like your average harsh, cold and collected character with a sweet side but she reveals to be much more without betraying these distinguishable traits.Setsuna is the most complicated character in this show. If you don\'t think too deeply about her actions and motives she may look like a selfish bitch but she has so many moments in which she redeems this, even while being very impulsive at times. She\'s manipulative to the point of being scary, that\'s cause her insight is just absurd for a girl her age. She\'s the only one who had to face something actually really hurtful and her sense of abandonment shines bright in every single thing she does. Don\'t let her childish appearance fool you, Setsuna is by an immense margin the most mature character in here. She\'s deeply flawed like the other two but until the very end she\'s the one who cares the most about everybody around her. So conflictive yet so coherent, she\'s so weird to explain.Everyone else is kind of... just there. No one really has a moment, some characters feel useless while others have a very limited purpose which gets fulfilled quickly and smoothly. This isn\'t really a flaw to me but you only get the 3 main guys. That\'s the only reason why I gave this score a 9 instead of a 10.Enjoyment: 9Again, this is a show that will make you feel something. It will make you uncomfortable, happy, sad, angry, confused, amazed. From episode 7 onwards it\'s honestly a huge rollercoaster. I gave it a 9 cause that\'s exactly what I\'m looking for in this genre, feels. It may appeal more to some people and will make other enjoy this very little but I will make it very clear that WA2 isn\'t for everyone and is probably aimed at a more mature audience which has experienced their fair share of love disappointment. It shows the real side of humans and that shit isn\'t always pretty. If you\'re looking for comedy tho, look elsewhere. I don\'t remember a single time I laughed and jokes are served very seldomly and rarely with the real purpose of making you laugh, there are cheesy moments that will make you smile but comedy is another thing.Overall: 9Summarizing everything, this is a particular kind of drama SoL which aims to show you the full spectrum of young people behaviour and it stands true to this concept, revealing how flawed, immature and inconsistent they can be. It will kiss you on the cheek before punching you in the chest but everything feels so real you can\'t stop yourself from actually caring about these guys and their little love story. Understood that it\'s not an anime for everyone, I highly recommend this to everyone who\'s probably 20 to 30+y/o and is looking for some feels, whichever nature they are. The only real problems this show has are the (somewhat) unsettling character\'s art and the awful pacing of the first 4 episodes which are really generic. Everything after that catches so much pace, every single episode I was answered some questions and was left with more until everything was made clear in a spectacular ending that, trust me, will make you feel something: Angry, happy, sad, whatever that something is I promise it will leave you staring at the black screen for a bit. you surprised. Even then, the story is far more complex than most SoL. Drama is huge here and it gets served in the right circumstances, nothing is too random. An argument can be made that the first 3 episodes are slow and eventless with a lot of cliches but it\'s not something too major. I give it a 7 cause the story is fairly simple but it\'s well executed and is consistent as soon as it gets going. In my opinion there\'s also an amazing closure to it, even though I\'ve seen a lot of rants about the ending (which I absolutely loved). It\'s open due to the Visual Novel game existing (that story arc is also pretty cool) but the anime ending still is somewhat fulfilling leaving you with a mouthful of mixed feelings.Art: 6This is the biggest problem. Animations are clunky and the art style makes pretty characters look kinda of disharmonious or downright ugly at times. Honestly some frames make them look dumb and emotions are not often conveyed with the power that this anime deserved. That aside the ambients range from fine to very pretty, even if somewhat stale, and it\'s nice to see varied clothing here and there, maybe with the exception of the over the top concert costumes but they are likable after all, fanservice or not they also have a meaning in the story. The art score is carried to a 6 by some few amazing scenes towards the end of the series. If you were only to watch the top moments of WA2, this score would probably be an 8. Sadly camera angles do matter a lot and art looks terrible from some of them.Sound: 10I\'m kinda obsessed with the soundtrack so this is uber biased.

They are creatures comprised of one or more human souls, metal skeletons and Dark Matter, the latter two supplied by the Millennium Earl. By design, they...are forced to obey the orders of the Earl and the other members of the Noah Family without question, even if it is against their will. They, however, have been known to go behind the Clan\'s backs on occasions when they are unsupervised.Akuma are created when a living human in mourning over the loss of a loved one makes a contract with the Earl to bring the soul of said lost loved one back. The Earl presents the living human with a skeleton of Dark Matter and has them call the departed soul of the loved one back, the soul then becoming trapped within the skeleton and forced to obey the Earl\'s will. Once trapped within the skeleton, the soul then ""puts on"" the body of the loved one who called it back, using their skin to move around in the human world in disguise.After the transformation is complete, the Akuma, now a Level 1, the soul of which is tormented and consumed by hate for the living world, goes around killing in order to grow and evolve to become stronger and better serve the Earl\'s purpose.As they grow through killing humans, Akuma evolve, the known levels ranging from 1 to 4, with 4 being the strongest.

Although it gives you a reason to read the after...events. events."", '(May contain SPOILERS )Okay first of all,this anime left me hanging in a displeasured way. At first you thought, ""Oh! An enjoyable slice of life school music anime?"" then you would be confused who to ship with the main character. At some point of the anime, you would be thinking,""Oh so sweet! This anime has romance."" but weird shit happens and everything went hell. The male protagonist is denser than a teaspoon of osmium. The music is good but after you watched the anime, it feels like Satan chainsawing your pitiful heart. The impact is good but I just didn\'t like the storyline. ', 'I\'m not one for long reviews, so I\'ll do my best do keep this as brief as possible.White Album 2 is a prime example of a hidden gem. As of 05/02/2018, it\'s ranked #641 on MAL\'s popularity list - not much of a surprise, but...come on, it deserves a lot more credit. To be honest, I was skeptical when I first looked into this show. I heard White Album, an anime that is almost completely unrelated to this ""sequel"", got a bad rap. Knowing this, I was cautious towards watching it at first, but then I said: ""fuck it"". And boy, oh boy - I...was not disappointed.This anime did something that I\'ve never seen done before: make me care about the characters involved in a love triangle. To be frank, I\'ve never been a fan of love triangles - in fact I hate them, even now. I\'ve always seen them as meaningless plot devices that often force awful sequences of melodrama. I didn\'t even realize that this show involved one after a couple of episodes. However, what other stories involving love triangles tend to forget that White Album 2 in contrast, does very well, is convey sincerity. Sure, these  three main characters may seem typical: a cute idol worshipped by the entire school, a cold and mysterious black-haired musician, and some generic looking guy (...that\'s really all I can describe how he looks...). What separates them from anime\'s plethora of shitty characters were their unexpected authenticity. I was surprised at how genuine they felt - showing both the good and bad in being human, while even reaching towards extremes. With a slight touch of moral ambiguity, I got hooked.Without spoiling anything, I can say that all of these characters were horrible people. Saying otherwise would be completely false. At their very core, they were ""good"" people, but with layers upon layers of depth added on, that initial image of ""good"" character seems to fade, and an unpleasant reality begins to take shape. Selfishness, greed, manipulation, betrayal, irrationality, temptation, deception, jealousy - all of these words can be applied these main characters. And despite all of these god-awful traits that everybody should gravitate away from, you can empathize with them. It\'s commonplace. White Album 2 grabs you by the throat and MAKES you feel for these characters. It manages to make immoral decisions seem somewhat justified. You\'ll likely experience the pain, the heartbreak, the wrath. You\'ll hear the gears turning in their heads as they question their own morality and that of others. On top of that, don\'t expect satisfaction when it\'s all over. If you do, all I can say is play the visual novel or read a summary like I did. It\'s still gonna fuck with you no matter what.Aside from the characters, I\'ll talk about the other stuff, but like I said - briefly.The first half of the story more or less seems like a regular Slice of Life series. The Light Music Association is about to crumble! Where have I seen that before? While not being the most original start to a series, it successfully overwrites the fact by excellently involving you with the characters and providing a smooth flow of progression. There are times here and there where the story may be dragging on, but honestly it\'s fairly rare and not much to worry about. Things don\'t get REALLY interesting until the second half, however. Not to say that the first wasn\'t a lot to care about, but you\'ll see what I mean when you watch it. Hitting the second half of the series is like accidentally spilling a fuck ton of spice into your soup. Shit doesn\'t immediately hit the fan, but it\'ll get there the more you mix the pot. By the way, this series should definitely be raised to R+. I wasn\'t prepared.On to the music, not much to say except there were surprisingly a lot of memorable tracks. This show has a Music tag for a reason, apparently. Not going into details, but many of the songs sung in this series provides deeper insight into their respective characters, as well as improve the effectiveness of some emotional scenes. Shit hits hard. Add a couple of catchy tunes and the beautiful voice of a lead singer and that\'s an easy 10. Other than than, artwork\'s not astounding, but nice to look at nonetheless. I\'m not an expert when it comes to critiquing animation and stuff like that, but if it\'s pretty and doesn\'t bother me, I\'ll roll with it.Finally, this series was incredibly enjoyable, especially towards the second half. It\'s hard to talk about this show without spoiling even a little bit. While it surely hit like a truck and ruthlessly stomped on my chest a couple of times, I loved it anyway. If this anime doesn\'t seem like your thing, I highly encourage you to give it a shot anyway. I\'m certainly glad that I did. With all taken into consideration, White Album 2 brilliantly showcases a harsh reality. It doesn\'t bullshit with a predictable story or one-sided characters. It doesn\'t hesitate to bring one\'s morality into question. It doesn\'t sugarcoat the cruelty that comes with life. I\'ll leave you with this quote that I pulled out of my ass, which I believe pretty much summarizes the themes of White Album 2:From sacrifice comes sorrow. From sorrow comes suffering. From suffering comes pain. Fight through pain and find happiness - a happiness that lasts until the inevitable cycle continues.9/10 was not disappointed.This anime did something that I\'ve never seen done before: make me care about the characters involved in a love triangle.

There are many moments where you think ""He shouldn\'t choose this way""(Well this is what i think).Many people were refering to School days but it ended quite differently though i didn\'t like the...ending so much, it began Amazing and ended amazingIt\'s not like it\'s a bad ending or something like that but i am not satisfied with it, i don\'t like with who he ended with, he just dropped the other without even thinking.The story itself is not bad, although not really original but yeah no one cares about it anymore. What i like the most is that the characters feel about what they have done, which many anime\'s dont have and i think it\'s something special about it.It was one of the most realistic anime i\'ve watched in a long time around the Romance Genre.The art is not very different from some other anime\'s but there wasn\'t a moment where it was Bad, Some scenes was done great/Amazing and some of them were moderate but not bad enough to call it bad or mediocre.The Sound, i don\'t really care about it but well let\'s review something about it, i don\'t really care if it\'s wonderfull or just moderate, The OP & ED enjoyable, that\'s enough.It was great done overall especially the story i liked the most without the ending though, i don\'t know why i don\'t like the ending because it\'s something like ""I\'m Done with you, There is a another"" i don\'t like these animes where the main character makes too fast decisions but yeah nothing to do about it, the story itself continues with these moments.I prefered it ended otherwise though.I would recommend this anime ""White album 2"" Really much, it\'s a romance anime like you never saw before, Amazing done, great story etc. ending so much, it began Amazing and ended amazingIt\'s not like it\'s a bad ending or something like that but i am not satisfied with it, i don\'t like with who he ended with, he just dropped the other without even thinking.The story itself is not bad, although not really original but yeah no one cares about it anymore.

I demand big red letter warnings for this stuff! Note that this could still potentially be in 9/10 range if we consider this was just a third of the story, and the rest of the story holds up to expectations.}Watching original White Album anime is not required at all. This is a separate story. Interesting production values, environments and everything except characters and animation are great, and characters aren't bad at all either. But sometimes there are noticeable inconsistencies between scenes, and character animation that feels a bit static and not lively...enough. But it's definitely passable and doesn't detract too much from the experience. First half was pretty great, it made me expect at least 9/10 and a potential 10/10. It's one of those shows that's hard to stop watching as you really wanna know what happens next. There's some great music, great romance and solid writing. I especially loved how it was actually about music, unlike 90% of the so called music themed shows out there,*khm*K-On!*khm*. Another obvious plus is that it takes itself seriously, so it's pretty much completely free of romcom anime logic and animeisms. Despite not being a comedy, it often made me laugh or chuckle out loud using rather tasteful and subtle humor.Then in second half it loses its momentum, for a couple of episodes, and then goes on to become sort of a semi-beautiful trainwreck till the end. It has a couple of moments where strange character actions get perfectly rationalised a bit later and you just wanna hit yourself for doubting the writer. Don't doubt this writer, and you won't semi-ruin a couple of great scenes for yourself. But then there are some other such moments where things are just supposed to be just taken at face value. So does the whole story structure work in the end? I honestly can't say for sure, but if it does, then it's stretched to the near breaking point all over the place. In a way that I feel justified in saying it definitely should have handled the whole thing differently, regarding the second half. But it's hard to point at any single thing and say it's completely unbelievable or uncalled for. It feels like a story that's barely holding itself together and remaining coherent. Unfortunately, for me it caused emotional detachment for the bigger part of the second half, even though not all of it is bad, and some parts on their own are pretty good and effective in surprising the viewer and delivering emotion.The ending itself didn't have enough resolution, again, it had barely enough resolution in order for it to legitimately be an ending. Another downside was that it was a bit too predictable after a certain reveal, whereas before said reveal it's nearly impossible to guess where the story is heading. It makes the first half better at the expense of the second half. The only thing in the said predictability that was intriguing was wondering how the hell is writer going to get out of this mess in a decent way. And then it turns out it gets out of it in a pretty lame messy way. Enough ambiguity time for spoilers:SPOILERS AHEAD:One major problem I had was the implication that Setsuna was to blame for pursuing Haruki, and that her suffering is kind of a karmic punishment for it? That's bullshit reasoning and I'm not buying it. It only works in characterisation of what a saint Setsuna really is, and that's only aspect of it I can accept. Having ending rely on that made it feel cheap and incomplete to me. Too bad inserting school days ending would have been too much of a ripoff for it to be viable here. The ''I obviously lied'' twist near the end and the scene it leads into was the most effective scene in the whole show. It pretty much made me want to scream ''Somebody give this girl a bloody chainsaw!!!''. But unfortunately this anime just didn't set up such an ending so it was pretty obviously not what was up. I was still hoping for some miraculous satisfactory ending that I didn't see coming, but we kinda get ''and that's it folks''. I guess the absolute superhuman unbelievably mega awesome kindness and tolerance that best girl displays in the end is meant as a final resolution of some sort? She's not giving up on him after he gave her the reason enough to literally chainsaw him. But what's with his feelings? So are they good now? I doubt it? I guess one of my biggest issues was seeing this level of moegirl suffering end up unavenged. I need my vengeance damnit! She's too good for that jerk! I need to see her happy aaargh! And no, clinging to that jerk doesn't count as happy. Damnit emotional investment! Spinoff! NOW!edit: Or as I later found out, two more seasons, NOW! enough. But it's definitely passable and doesn't detract too much from the experience. First half was pretty great, it made me expect at least 9/10 and a potential 10/10. It's one of those shows that's hard to stop watching as you really wanna know what happens next. There's some great music, great romance and solid writing. I especially loved how it was actually about music, unlike 90% of the so called music themed shows out there,*khm*K-On!*khm*. Another obvious plus is that it takes itself seriously, so it's pretty much completely free of romcom anime logic and animeisms. Despite not being a comedy, it often made me laugh or chuckle out loud using rather tasteful and subtle humor.Then in second half it loses its momentum, for a couple of episodes, and then goes on to become sort of a semi-beautiful trainwreck till the end. It has a couple of moments where strange character actions get perfectly rationalised a bit later and you just wanna hit yourself for doubting the writer. Don't doubt this writer, and you won't semi-ruin a couple of great scenes for yourself. But then there are some other such moments where things are just supposed to be just taken at face value. So does the whole story structure work in the end? I honestly can't say for sure, but if it does, then it's stretched to the near breaking point all over the place. In a way that I feel justified in saying it definitely should have handled the whole thing differently, regarding the second half. But it's hard to point at any single thing and say it's completely unbelievable or uncalled for. It feels like a story that's barely holding itself together and remaining coherent. Unfortunately, for me it caused emotional detachment for the bigger part of the second half, even though not all of it is bad, and some parts on their own are pretty good and effective in surprising the viewer and delivering emotion.The ending itself didn't have enough resolution, again, it had barely enough resolution in order for it to legitimately be an ending. Another downside was that it was a bit too predictable after a certain reveal, whereas before said reveal it's nearly impossible to guess where the story is heading. It makes the first half better at the expense of the second half. The only thing in the said predictability that was intriguing was wondering how the hell is writer going to get out of this mess in a decent way. And then it turns out it gets out of it in a pretty lame messy way. Enough ambiguity time for spoilers:SPOILERS AHEAD:One major problem I had was the implication that Setsuna was to blame for pursuing Haruki, and that her suffering is kind of a karmic punishment for it? That's bullshit reasoning and I'm not buying it. It only works in characterisation of what a saint Setsuna really is, and that's only aspect of it I can accept. Having ending rely on that made it feel cheap and incomplete to me. Too bad inserting school days ending would have been too much of a ripoff for it to be viable here. The ''I obviously lied'' twist near the end and the scene it leads into was the most effective scene in the whole show. It pretty much made me want to scream ''Somebody give this girl a bloody chainsaw!!!''. But unfortunately this anime just didn't set up such an ending so it was pretty obviously not what was up. I was still hoping for some miraculous satisfactory ending that I didn't see coming, but we kinda get ''and that's it folks''. I guess the absolute superhuman unbelievably mega awesome kindness and tolerance that best girl displays in the end is meant as a final resolution of some sort? She's not giving up on him after he gave her the reason enough to literally chainsaw him. But what's with his feelings? So are they good now? I doubt it? I guess one of my biggest issues was seeing this level of moegirl suffering end up unavenged. I need my vengeance damnit! She's too good for that jerk! I need to see her happy aaargh!

Let me make myself a little more clear a love triangle is a emotional tearjerker ride but all 3 of them are in love, it isn't something that makes you want to cry and puke at the male the same time it is more like nisekoi where you sometimes cry and always support sometimes get angry for their sacrifice (not their stupid honor or selfishness)Lets sum it up the first...6 episodes was for the music and i would have given it a solid 8 or maybe 9 but the other 7 episodes was for cheap adolecence mixed poor and tasteless loveish triangle kind of stupidity (Ok not everone will think this way but it was for me), i will give this episodes a 4 maybe a 3 even so overall a 6 is enough.For the final sentence should you watch it.... i think yes but not with an expectation for a masterpiece.

The plot is magnificently executed by it's characters. Despite the foreign cultural milieu, the events are easily relatable. The characters are quixotic which causes the pacing to falter. It's strong point was in the character's latent emotions. While the ending does feel rushed, the road to it great. "", ""This anime has two distinct phases. The first is where they're preparing for the concert. This focus on establishing each of the three main characters and developing the relationship between all three of them. This part is good because each of these three characters is interesting. The protagonist being someone that is blatantly honest and quite competent was actually pretty refreshing considering how these usually go. Touma too was interesting, in that she was a tsundere, but definitely felt like one with a lot more depth than a standard one, and came across as a lot more genuine.\xa0Kazusa too had depth in regards to how...she portrays herself and her past. Because the characters are interesting and likable, seeing them give it their all and managing to acheive what they're working hard for was quite satisfying as well, and hence this portion came across rather well. However, this is all just a build up to the next phase, which is the true core of the story. The relationship between all three is developed quite well and the viewer is very invested in it, but once the concert is over, the relationship immediately begins to come apart, with the three desperately attempting to hold it together. While the first half developed the characters well, it focused mostly on their good aspects and how those helped make the relationship between them stronger and gained happiness as a result. In the next phase, their worst traits and weaknesses come out, we see them suffer for it. The show very much conveys that relationships can become incredibly complex and tremendously painful. And as the show approaches the end, and the attempt at holding things together completely falls apart, it gets incredibly intense. Touma's story especially hit really hard and had the strongest emotional impact on me. All of this comes to an end that while not happy in the slightest, felt true to the direction things were going, and while not satisfying exactly, it felt right. The choice to skip the final concert song, and then play it at the end was strange, but ultimately I would have to say it worked very well in hitting the emotional beat it needed to.In terms of art and animation, it was really good. In terms of music, it was good but not as good as it should have been. Music is a major aspect of this show, as it was with the first White Album. However, here the best tracks were those taken straight out of the first show, and while those were chosen and used incredibly well, it didn't feel that great when it comes to new tracks, or mainly track really. The OP track was great, but it also being the main final track felt somewhat weak. The soundtrack too, would be good for a non music related show, but here it felt weak, relying too much on repeating old tracks.I should also note that the ending was mostly judged from the perspective that the story isn't anywhere near over, because it really isn't. The majority of the story is yet to take place from the perspective of the VN. Though as I can't get to the rest of the story now, possibly never, that does sour me a bit.tl;dr: An incredibly impactful anime centered around music and relationships. she portrays herself and her past.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Now that I\'ve watched it for the 3rd time, decide to make a quick ""review""✦StoryDarker drama/romance. Not sure what else to say without spoiling. All I can say this is my ""close to heart"" Anime, was story had lot of elements that felt personal and somewhat (potentially) similar to own events. Same for the characters, saw in some fair amount of self and some others. Seen this anime 3 times and every time ended up depressed/crying. Think it\'s going to be my yearly Christmas re-watch.Point being, story...is serious drama between the cast, main issue being inability of being true to self or self-sacrifice. Their great relationship, their breakage, their doom, their happiness, their issues and solutions. I found it deeply relatable and depressing. Probably one of the best drama/romance Anime and the most real (for me) than most of the romance/drama tropes or moronic causes/reasons. Considering it even had aspect I hate regarding relationships/drama/romance, I just couldn\'t hate the characters because of their reasoning or inability to be true to self.. thus ending up in such predicament.Only reason I couldn\'t give it 10, even though purely on personal/emotional side I gave/wanted (changed back to 9) it 10. Would be that I was not satisfied the way it ended. And a bit of a bummer was as well that the story presentation felt sometimes slow, but the event rich story felt a too bit fast. Meaning that they story conveyance felt a bit incorrect for me.TLDR; Superb more serious and darker drama/romance.✦Art & SoundFound art the most beautiful looking standard art-style Visual Novel I\'ve seen. It felt fitting, great and enjoyable.Music was absolutely superb, superb vocal tracks, superb piano tracks. Probably only part I didn\'t like were the guitar solos (don\'t like guitars).✦CharacterGrowth and depth were great. Love absolutely Touma, would love her being my real waifu. Did love her for another reason as well, but that won\'t bother with.Main guy, is student president stereotype with a weakness to own emotions or others. Then we have Setsuna, the idol-like persona with actually snobby/needy personal side. And Touma, silent, asocial, tries to be strong yet actually is really fragile, caring and weak. Of course each character had a lot more to them, but those aspects you will learn by watching the Anime.✦Enjoyment & OverallDid probably already sum it up mostly in the story section. But I can add, that even though I absolutely enjoyed this Anime, even though it made me absolutely depressed, and all the 3 times made me cry and being especially personal, it was  step away from perfection to my taste. And yeah, as mentioned, the issue was way it wrapped up. I probably will have to eventually  play the Visual Novel.. which I\'m not sure if my heart can take it. Because supposedly VN is even more depressing and darker.Anyhow, superb Anime in almost every aspect. is serious drama between the cast, main issue being inability of being true to self or self-sacrifice.

(also there might be minor spoilers though but I'll try to keep it as little)StoryIt's simple basically, Haruki wants to save the light music club and meets Setusna an Idol and Touma a somewhat delinquent but great musician, and after they joined they started hanging out and of course the two falling in love with Haruki.It seems common...at first but what I like is how the romance was portrayed, and I actually thought that this is one of the best love triangles that I saw in an anime and I'll explain it furthermore in the characters why, regarding their music life, well I there is less music although It was an Improtant part as well especially for Touma.Sound and AnimationI do admit Haruki's design is pretty boring and for setsuna I guess the reason why I sort of not ship him with Haruki is I guess due to her design being generic as well, her design reminds me of Orihime a character that I really hate.Regarding Touma  her design is okay, but I do think she voice is too low, for the sound, and and I think overall WA2 has a pretty generic designs of characters although It's good for the winter themed anime I guess I think they got a great OST's I enjoyed White album and Sound of Destiny although the opening and ending was pretty boring.Charactersnow I'll try to explain  my thoughts as much as I can since I'm basically a lazy typerHaruki- I got mixed emotions from the guy, first let me say that he's somewhat forgettable considering his design and despite his attitude as a smart guy I think that didn't make him remembering enough, and I also thinks that he has lack of character development.Still though despite that his love troubles is something that is realistic, because sometimes we are confused whether we should date someone who confessed to us out of guilt knowing that we'll hurt him or her, and if we got caught in a really complicated situation how will we face it, I'm glad that Haruki manages to pull that off.and despite him being smart I think he's dumb when it comes to love stuffs I mean he realizes who he truly loves when things got really complicated.But what I really like is his relationship with Touma, like in Mashiro Iro Symphony which is one of my favorite Romance Anime's of All time, I like that he has to work hard just to win Touma for her to join his club and teach him about music.Touma- My Favorite Character of the series and I think has decent character development , she came from a hot head to someone who opens up to a friend, although she still ignores a lot of people, I would love her though to talk to other people, I do criticize her to having an NTR scene with Haruki, (although I still enjoy it),, still I like her for how she handles Heartbreak and her realtionship with Setsuna is great as well, knowing that the girl is the one whose causing her heartbreak she still manages to stay friends with her.Setsuna- perosnally she's not enjoying to watch but I would say that she has the greates character developement among three, she knew that she's tearing up Touma's heart but she still tries her best to be friends with her and she worries about her, she doesn't go beserk whenever Haruki and Touma we're together, what's more she even cried when Touma made a decision regarding her future (I wont spoil it)what's more she knew about the consequences that she felt for falling in love with Haruki and what she should do, and overall I think she's a strong person, but still I won't ship with with the guy, since Haruki x Touma has more chemistry and has a deeper relationship, but still she's still a good character.Enjoyment- well yeah I did enjoy the series as a whole, though they seem to be forgetabble but they did great in portraying their roles at first but what I like is how the romance was portrayed, and I actually thought that this is one of the best love triangles that I saw in an anime and I'll explain it furthermore in the characters why, regarding their music life, well

2 just hits so many soft spots. It in my eyes is one of the best romantic anime\'s, especially if you\'re into pop music.PROSWhite album 2 just has so many pros. Firstly the music is impeccable, I even attempted to learn the melody on the piano after watching it. The romance it archives is astounding, it without a doubt rivals that of ""Your lie in April"" and ""Golden time"", that\'s saying a lot, coming from me. It\'s just such a well rounded anime, it knows what it is and what its not which is becoming less and less common to see....What it does do is what it sets out to achieve, ultimately it\'s a hall of fame piece that portrays love and music without doing too little or too much.CONSThere is little i can say that\'s bad about White album 2. It in many ways does lack true and meaningful themes like the other anime\'s above however this isn\'t what this anime\'s about and it knows it.Should you watch it?It\'s a pretty obvious YES. if anime\'s like ""Your lie in April"" drew you in however you found the music to not be your style then you probably are more suited to white album two. It does everything a good romantic anime should with some damn good music along with it. White album two isn\'t just an experience for the eyes it\'s for the ears as well. Just get a box of tissues ready!

Just get a box of tissues ready!', 'Sometimes love and friendship just cannnot be together...White Album 2 is one of those rare works that manage to reach you deep inside. Not many anime deserve to get a 10 score and sure not make me write a review about it, however, i truly desire that anyone reading this has the chance to enjoy this as much as i did. So... read carefully.Story (10): Nowadays it\'s hard to find good romance anime and maybe it\'s because they are too predictable and most of them follow a much well know pattern. White Album 2 throws that scheme through the window and gives you a well...structured story that perfectly combines the correct amount of build-up, drama and a fitting conclusion. I must admit it starts pretty confusing with a lot going on by the first 10 minutes and you might feel a bit overwhelmed but, keep watching. The story gives you a refreshing plot  that doesn\'t fall flat in any moment or starts giving you cliche scenes to keep you interested, instead it gives you reasons to stay put and keep watching until the very end. When i said that it reached me deep inside i mean it! The story feels life-like and you are able to truly undersatand and feel for everything that happens through it.Art (7): I am no expert in art for anime but i also don\'t give 10 scores just because it ""looks pretty"". The art in WA 2 fits just fine with the atmosphere and the tone of the scenes; however a bit more of detail and dedication would\'ve captivated me much more; still, it was exceptional.Sound (9): I want to get both OP and ED out of the way by saying that both are pretty good to my ears and that now i listen to them in my phone. But regarding the soundtrack present at all times, it was sophisticated and appropiate for every scene. The sound of piano and soothing notes let you get inmersed in the scenes making you feel what the characters truly feel. And talking about characters...Characters (10): No tsundere or shy-klutz waifu here my friends, and no generic and average dense fuck MC. Haruki, kazusa and Setsuna, the three pillars of the story each have qualities and  flaws that shine and hurt them across the story. The way you see them grow as friends is actually cute and heart-smoothing because the frindship they manage to form is one many people would kill for. The various obstacles they face make them fall and stand back up and at some point you even feel for them, it does not matter who you like the most, by the end you will love the three of them.Believe me when i say that this is not enough to show my love for  this anime but still i think that it\'s the correct amount of insight to make at least one good otaku enjoy this trip as much as i did...

What is different than other romances is that it doesnt try to be psychological, or mindblowing, but realistic and it works perfectly.2.Art. The animation is decent and smooth, the art style looks great, but certain characters...may  look similiar at the start, but over time you will distinguish them. The standout is amazing lightning, that truly brings environments to life.3.Sound. Of course considering that the anime is music based, the sound is amazing. The sounds effects are great, but soundtrack, the music is a masterpiece, the show has a couple of songs that are used  many times. Most important part of them is the guitar (main character is a guitarist) the riffs are recognizable and all instruments are clear in sounding.4. Characters. They all are great, almost the same as oregairu, if you want to know which one are similiar to others, just look at the art *they even look pretty similiar).5.Overall. This show is a hidden gem, a modern classic. Everyone should watch it, even if anime romances arent your thing, this one still could impress you. may  look similiar at the start, but over time you will distinguish them.

Even though the ending broke my heart a little I think they should of not made it go that way but what can we do for that now?.. Please come back for a season 2 I beg you ;( SPOILERS AHEADStory 10/10: I absolutely loved the story to this! I've never watch a romantic, music type anime and this has set the bar high for any others types that come by.. I kind of hate how the ending turned out on the 13th episode because none of the main characters got what they...want and that's what kind of sucks about it.. Haruki was left with someone he didn't love, Setsuna is left with someone who doesn't love her and Kazusa flew away leaving behind her lover and best friend betraying both of them! God it's just so hard! Back to the review..The story line was amazing, how it brought all the characters together was incredible.. I really don't have anything that really stuck a thorn in my side (apart from the ending) that's going to bother me that much.Art 10/10: I really liked the art style for this anime.. I'm really attracted to this type of anime style and won't settle from any unrealistic type of anime so it was nice to see this type again!Sound 10/10: Sound for this series was amazing, I'm a big fan of the White album song and have fallen in love with it! The songs and music they used for some of the scenes aswell were quite amazing!Character 10/10: It was a good twist towards the end seeing how they would try to stay separate but it didn't end up that way. Each character progressed very well in the series and we got to saw how each of them came out of their shells and it was really well made characters.. I felt like we were made to hate each of them in their own ways aswell which was really good..Enjoyment 10/10: Would highlight recommend this to someone but don't expect to get your hopes up in the end.A little rant: It really annoyed me seeing how people would post about how bad they felt for Setsuna in the end, but yet she basically caused all of this.. She knew how the girl felt and how it was going to go but yet she wanted him all her self.. want and that's what kind of sucks about it..

The problem was, the love was all focused on Haruki, which waged a silent war between them, that was taken by storm.TLDR: (9/10) Great series, breaks the heart however, but thats how it is. The show has wonderful writing and feels really well paced, max one would skip...is 20 seconds to skip transitions. The only way I could like this show more is if it was like Amagami SS and Amagami SS+ where there would be a different path between the characters and give a choice, then the outcomes will be displayed by a few episodes, which could give more credence to Setsuna and Kazusa and show the good stuff afterwards.Story: (10/10)- well detailed and well deserving story to some well crafted characters.Art: (10/10)- Personal preference but I like the art style.Sound: (7/10)- Not as much focus put on this but it is good for what it needs to be.Character: (9/10)- Main cast is fleshed out, side characters have a personality but no screen time.Enjoyment: (9/10)- gets boring at some parts, but really is enjoyable past all the excess dialogue.Overall: (9/10)- Makes great use of the characters and drama to point out plot points, no holes in the plot, makes for a wonderful watch, although maybe not extensively re-watchable. is 20 seconds to skip transitions.

So I'm going to keep it short and simple. This is one of the fucked up endings I've ever seen in an anime. I've watched earlier an anime named Scum's wish which had an okayish ending but trashy plot progressi but this anime has an overall good progression plot but a trashy ending btw I have only watched the anime don't know about the VN.This anime has given justice to one of the negative emotions that humans posseses like jealousy.If you can plz put yourself in place of any of the characters for a moment....Are you okay with that much of agony? Are you okay with that much of suffering?Anyway this is just my opinion you can watch it and you can judge by yourself and btw the feels this anime gives is going to stay with you for a while.Some things that characters posseses are jealousy, fear of being left behind, cheated on , lied to , lack commitment, are not true with themselves and neither true with their feelings.This anime has a lot of feels,drama,going to left a hole in your anime. If you want something dramatic then I do recommend you to watch WA2 and you are going to learn a lot what jealousy does to people. Are you okay with that much of agony?

I had finished the Domestic Na Kanojo manga and wanted something to lift my spirits. I got no such thing here. Does that make the anime bad however? Not at all. The anime was, in my opinion, quite decent. The art style was pleasing, sound was more than I could have asked for despite lackluster character and plot development.The plot for White Album 2 primarily follows Haruki Kitahara and his two classmates Touma...Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna in their final year of high school. The light music club is in danger of disbanding due to lack of members, but this doesn't dampen Haruki's determination to get enough members in time for the school festival in the fall. I won't get into spoilers as I'd like people to keep everything a surprise however.Story: 6 -  In my opinion, the story for White Album 2 was good, but nothing to write home about. It does have reference to the first White Album anime but it is by no means required that you watch the first one to watch this anime. The plot in the first half of the anime is quite linear and makes sense to me. It's nothing surprising but it manages to take the tried and true path for a slice of life anime and do it well. The second half is an entirely different beast though.. The respect and love I'd built up for these characters over the course of this anime were thoroughly destroyed in the last quarter of the anime with typical MC and heroine fatal flaws. The story deals a lot with themes of Jealousy, love, envy, longing and passion which lend themselves well to the development of the story but I found the ending to be entirely unsatisfying, unfulfilling and contrived. No matter which girl you're rooting for, I doubt this anime will provide an ending that checks all of the boxes on your list.Art: 8 - The art style for this anime, considering it had come out 8 years prior, was very good for the time. I found the art style to be refreshing, easy on the eyes and quite varied. The expressions are done very well and the colors/shading are very pleasing to my eyes. The only gripe I had with it was probably the lack of diversity of design for characters but otherwise I cant complain.Sound: 10 - As expected of an anime with a heavy focus on music, the soundtrack is top notch. They fit the scenes well and they help to pull at the heart strings in the right way at the right time. I'd expect nothing less from an anime of this subgenre. Not a whole lot else to say, I'm just very pleased with the music and sound.Characters: 5 - What I've said about the plot and its development is what I can say about the characters and their development. Characters are 'unsatisfying, unfulfilling and contrived'. The MC seems to suffer from what a typical harem MC would suffer from (overwhelming density) which is just a major gripe in my book for any anime really. It also really bothered me that a lot of the problems caused in the anime were a result of the lack of communication by the main characters and the issues at hand would have been non-issues had any of them properly communicated their feelings. One of the characters has a very strong conviction for the way they act, but in the very end go back on those feelings, lying to themselves and others in a way that doesn't feel representative of the real world in my opinion. Overall, the characters could have used a lot of work to prevent them from being almost one-dimensional. One thing that I will give the characters credit for, however, is that instead of making things worse, they actually gained some depth and perspective and tried fixing things (a little too late for my taste however).Enjoyment: 5 - Unfortunately, as good as the art and sound were, I'd say they're quite secondary to the characters and story, which is why I rate my enjoyment as 'mediocre'. This comes down to personal preference as there are absolutely people who will vehemently disagree with my assessment of the plot and characters but once again this is just me. For in depth reasons for my enjoyment being a 5, please refer to my review of the story and characters above.Overall: 6 - Overall, this anime (in my opinion) wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly good either. I bought a seat for this show, but I only needed the edge for the first half. I was gripped by the story, rooting for certain characters but still hoping for the best for others. By the end, I was overwhelmed with a sense of apathy, I was skipping a minute or two at a time at some parts in the final two or three episodes just to see how it ended and 'get it over with'. Will I ever watch this anime again? Never. Am I happy I gave this anime a chance and decided to watch it? Yeah, I'd say so, but not enthusiastically. There's quite a number of romance anime/manga that stand out to me but this one will not be among the ranks of those. This anime did not end up being what I wanted it to be, or what I needed it to be, but maybe for you it will be. This could be chalked up as a 'coming of age' story where the characters make their mistakes and learn their lessons as they venture off into the real world beyond highschool. Please take this review with a grain of salt as this is just one anime fans opinion.To surmise, this is an anime that is worth giving a shot, for the music if nothing else. If I were being 100% objective, I'd rate this anime a 7, possibly an 8 if you're stretching it, but I realise that the best reviews are also somewhat subjective. Art and Sound are above average, if not outstanding which helps carry the lackluster plot and character development. I'd still encourage people on the fence (like I was) to give this a chance as you may like it more than I did, but don't hold your breath on this one.

Overall I enjoyed the anime, but it is hard for me to claim that it is good or that I loved it. I feel like the foundation of something is there, with solid enough story progression, but ultimately that story falls flat in the latter part of the season.The ending left me feeling very unsatisfied which seems to differ from the opinions of others...that have reviewed it here.

I watched this show after being recommended it by a friend, so I had the highest hopes for it. However, my enjoyment and interest slowly seeped away as the show progressed, and my uninterested attitude turned into frustration. Essentially, this show is just an extremely vanilla and safe version of School Days. White Album 2 is a boring attempt to portray an ""emotional"" love triangle.Animation and ArtVery bare bones. Not much flair; it simply works. Incredibly inoffensive but does not stand out at all. The...character designs are also nice and easily digestible. I\'m personally not very attracted to the art (or general character) of either of the two main heroines, but they are cute enough for most people to enjoy.SoundThe best part, I guess.

This is NOT a music show to any degree. The subject of music is only there to hammer down the ""emotional-ness"" of this show. The sole focus of the show is romance and only that. And along with that, they use every cliched, romantic trope that they can. The two main girls are a vanilla main heroine and a tsundere? Of course they are. Both of the girls have a ""dark"" history, but these other sides of the girls are so exaggerated, one-dimensional, cliched, and contrived that it makes it very difficult to take them seriously at all. However, what\'s even worse than the two main girls is the main guy. This show\'s MC is the prime example of a cardboard cutout. And then the ending goes and makes him really horny for some reason? Ignoring that, he has very little flaws and comes out the end as a selfish brat who does not recognize the consequences his choices have on others. Unlike the two girls who have some history to explain their actions, the main guy has no such history provided, so his choices simply appear on a whim. At least in School Days, every character was so terrible, irredeemable, and unrealistic that you can\'t help but laugh at it\'s self proclaimed seriousness. In the case with White Album 2, they try to act like that the three main characters are all inherently good but just have a couple flaws that hold them back and attempt to portray that drama as ""realistic."" In reality, that will not happen. People are a little more complicated than that. Even viewing the show as a story by itself, it relies on way too many romance cliches to drive home a ""dark"" drama that is more akin to a poorly written fanfiction. The romance has terrible buildup based off the pacing of the story and only remotely exists due to the emotional beats being paired up with music filled with strings and a piano.I am not sure what the main message I am supposed to get out of this show. Don\'t be too horny?? I have not seen the first White Album or the original VN, but I do not plan on seeing either after this. I originally thought this was going to be a forgettable show after the first episode, but it\'s actually boring, contrived, unrealistic, and forgettable. This shows bears a striking resemblance with School Days, and although that show is also bad, at least it made me laugh.

This shows bears a striking resemblance with School Days, and although that show is also bad, at least it made me laugh. All I got out of White Album 2 was a waste of time.', ""Alright, this one's interesting...Starting plainly, this show is, if nothing else, a lot better than its predecessor. Where I described the original 'White Album' as a show that could have been really interesting, but was ruined by a deeply uninteresting protagonist, 'White Album 2' avoids a lot of its pitfalls, especially with its own protagonist.Haruki is, at the very least, genuinely likeable, and actually has some momentum as character. The show also benefits greatly from a reduced romantic cast, with the harem set-up in the original being replaced with a simpler, and much stronger, triangle; Haruki and the two love interests, Setsuna and Kazusa....All three are interesting, likeable characters, with clear motivations, and strong personalities. In my opinion, a love triangle works best when you either despite one of them, or love all three, and this does the latter nicely; whoever ended up together, you were going to feel bad for someone.As for who that someone ends up being, that's a little... well, vague is probably the best word. Despite it being fairly clear at the end who Haruki chooses, the show neglects to give us any real closure, with a somewhat noncommittal ending that seems to drop away from the story at an emotional low. And it's not that it couldn't have done a slightly bittersweet ending, I'd have been fine with that, but it feels like there's a missing episode somewhere; there was no closure to it, nothing to really tie the story together (Incidentally, the real solution seems, in all honesty, to just go with a sort of polyamorous arrangement; honestly, everyone seems to care so deeply about each other that the three of them together could probably be really happy, but I digress...). It's not as loose and unsatisfying as its predecessor, but it definitely felt underwhelming, given how well the story had progressed until then.Other than that, the show's more or less what you expect from a high school romance. The animation is a lot more consistent than 'White Album', but still isn't going to set the world on fire. I did feel that there was a lot more unnecessary sexualisation than the original; not necessary an excessive amount for an anime, but given I found 'White Album' had a lot less than I'd expect, something which I appreciated a lot, it feels fair to bring it up here.Overall, I did enjoy the journey; I liked the characters, and was excited to see where it went. In all honesty, it didn't quite stick the landing, but if you don't mind that, it's a perfectly enjoyable romance story.

White Album 2 (WA2) sets the story of three high school students - Kazusa, Setsuna and Haruki who together create an unforgettable memory as they form a trio to perform in their last school festival, its a story of love, friendship and the future and combines these themes together to create a show that plays with your heartstrings which eventually rips it out by ep 13. WA2 is an anime that is executed so goddamn well that you can\'t help but appreciate and...love all three characters, in comparison to most other love triangles where you usually find yourself only rooting for a specific person. I\'ll split my review into parts that each talk about one of the main cast because they truly are the spotlight of the show.Touma KazusaTouma Kazusa would be best described as an ice block that slowly melted throughout the show. To be completely honest, I didn\'t like Kazusa when she was first introduced into the show, she began as a mystery character (which was pretty obvious to deduce), being the student who played the piano in Music Room 2. She stood out to me as somewhat of an arrogant and rude ice queen that only cared about the piano, I mean she kept a whole music room to herself and was not afraid of flexing her piano (and guitar/saxaphone/bass) skills in front of Setsuna and Haruki. But as the story continues, you learn more about her character and the struggles she has in her own life, she became more grounded and likeable as she opened up more and more to Setsuna and Haruki. Touma is a girl that tries to be emotionally strong, she has her own sense of right and wrong as sticks to it through the entirety of the show, she has a goal and a future and she knows she has the capabilities to achieve it, she believes Haruki is the one who put her life back in place and she loves him for itOgiso SetsunaOgiso Setsuna has a completely different dynamic to Kazusa who I describe as the flame that burns through both Haruki and Kazusa and eventually herself. Setsuna was the best character in the show in my opinion because of her situation in the story as someone torn between love and friendship. I call Setsuna a flame because her character and presence pretty much engulfs the show as she pretty much gets everything she wants at some point during the show - she gains friends, gets to sing and got to date Haruki, she\'s also the reason the three of them have some amazing moments but she\'s also the reason for the saddest ones. Setsuna faces many problems in the show such as accepting that she can\'t have everything she wants, especially in regards to her friendship which she deeply cherishes and her love for Haruki, deciding on one or the other truly tears her apart in this show and it really hit hard at the final scene where she said something along the lines of ""I\'m not going to leave so that my heart doesn\'t get frozen"" because of her greediness of wanting to keep both their friendship and her relationship with Haruki despite knowing it can\'t happen resulting in her losing both of the things she cherished so alot. Similar to this, Setsuna also had it difficult accepting the fact that the good things that were happening in her life weren\'t going to last forever, her constantly asking both Kazusa and Haruki if they\'d stay in their lives forever made me feel really bad for her because it was just empty reassurance for a future that won\'t happen, and she probably knew it also. I starting this series really rooting for Setsuna but in the end it didn\'t matter if she had won or not, she was the character that showed the most flaws but still did her best to make herself happy and I respect her for it.Kitahara HarukiKitahara Haruki is a rare respectable male MC in the world of romance. His character is created really well as you understand why the two girls developed feelings for him, he\'s nice, smart, responsible, respectable and hard working from the get go but at the same time his character isn\'t perfect, and the show doesn\'t hold back in making him look \'bad\' towards the latter half of the series. But all in all, Haruki was someone that really did care about both Setsuna and Kazusa, he was a protagonist that thought about the other girls\' feelings relationship-wise and couldn\'t help but hate himself for continuing to have feelings for Kazusa despite already being in a relationship with Setsuna. Haruki felt like a very real character as a high school boy stuck between two girls, he made dumb but understandable decisions, and he\'s deserving of both of their love which is something I can\'t say for most shows that have a similar premise to this.In conclusion, I loved this anime, I\'m writing this so I can cement my feelings I have for this show right now. The ending is very well up to your own interpretation but I\'m too shook to think about what would happen in the events after, but by episode 10, I didn\'t really care who ended up with who, heck I would\'ve been fine with an ending where none of them got together (which was kind of what happened) and because of this feeling, I\'m saying that this show is a transcendent romance series, because of course, love isn\'t something that always bear fruit but no matter what, it is something that teaches everyone that goes through it a lesson, and I\'mcertain Kazusa, Setsuna and Haruki had something to takeaway from what they went through together in their final months of high school.PS The music in this show is freaking amazing, White Album and Todokanai Koi will forever make me cry whenever I listen to it love all three characters, in comparison to most other love triangles where you usually find yourself only rooting for a specific person.

This is where many people drop the show as this is actually very off putting.Haruki had feelings for kazusa but he couldn't confess as he thought that she wouldn't accept it and didn't want to ruin...the friendship they had.In the heat of the moment he kisses setsuna and they start dating. In my opinion this was mostly because he didn't want to hurt setsuna as he knew she had feeling for her.But the thing he didn't realise was the fact that kazusa did have feelings for him. Kazusa not able to bare the pain of him and her best friend dating tries to move to Europe. And haruki not able to let her go trys to stop her many times.What makes it worse is the fact that setsuna is aware of how they feel for each other but still clings to haruki dispute knowing that he loves someone else and haruki still not able to say anything to setsuna.And in the end haruki ends up having sex   with kazusa while he is setsuna's bf and in the last ep even kisses her in front of setsuna.If haruki was not this indisdisive or if  kazusa was open about her feelings this could have been avoided.Nonetheless it was a great anime tispite that and many would enjoy it and I recommend you watch it before criticis it. the friendship they had.In the heat of the moment he kisses setsuna and they start dating.

How many words do i need to include for mal to accept this review ', 'Personally, I think that WA2 has good and bad points in a similar proportion, although, as usually happens in many cases, the script\'s problems stand out from the other aspects (such as the technical part). Although it is somewhat generic and with many plot conveniences, at the beginning the story is bearable, with the 7th episode as the climax, and then it plummets as explained before (although the second part has the story dedicated to Kasuza, which that saves her from being total slop). To make matters worse, the romantic conflict feels forced because, as the series itself shows at a certain point, the MC\'s...decision is more than obvious, the rest being just to generate unnecessary drama.Another serious problem that I see in this work is -in my opinion- the excessive polarization of the heroines, because Kasuza and Setsuna are presented in a diametrically different way within the story, which seems to me an arbitrary decision on the part of the scriptwriters, comparable - without exaggeration - to this; As said before, while one is presented as a more serious and mature character, with more time on stage, development, and emphasis on her problems, the other presents an incredible level of caricature, little goes into her conflicts, and has fewer difficulties ( or at least that idea leaves the series) and ends up looking more like an ""intruder"" than an equal opportunity heroine within a love triangle. Here the predilection for one of the protagonists is too noticeable, and that greatly damages the development of events.In short, this anime is one of those works that -from a general point of view- are acceptable, but could have been better if bad decisions had not been made during its development. If the story had remained in the same tone that it had been doing from the beginning and had not degenerated into an elaborate drama, chapters as bad as the one on the hot springs (image above) or the one in which Kasuza cold, replacing them with really important content (such as more emphasis on Setsuna\'s background, thus giving her the protagonist treatment she really deserves) and/or keeping the focus on the musical part, would have turned out much better. decision is more than obvious, the rest being just to generate unnecessary drama.Another serious problem that I see in this work is -in my opinion- the excessive polarization of the heroines, because Kasuza and Setsuna are presented in a diametrically different way within the story, which seems to me an arbitrary decision on the part of the scriptwriters, comparable - without exaggeration - to this; As said before, while one is presented as a more serious and mature character, with more time on stage, development, and emphasis on her problems, the other presents an incredible level of caricature, little goes into her conflicts, and has fewer difficulties ( or at least that idea leaves the series) and ends up looking more like an ""intruder"" than an equal opportunity heroine within a love triangle.

The intensity that I felt when reading the story in the game can be felt on the fights the Knights of the Round Table. The OSTs made the scenes better, and the animation is just pure SAKUGA.I know myself that many people don't really like some rough handrawn...movements. But Sakuga community, most of you will be pleased I know.Character design isn't like Babylonia and Solomon which are suffering to Same Face Syndrome.The only bad things in here is that in here is that it's a movie which is understandable to have cuts. And Fate series is cursed by bad adaptations anyways. The whole duology only focused on Bedivere 90% of the time. A lot of characters didn't create a proper attachment and one character there should've been cut instead. Fujimaru is once again, 1000x better in the manga. And also because the 1st movie existed. If the 1st movie properrly paced and explained more, The anime of Camelot chapter would've been better.Overall, this is an amazing adaptation.

This is going to be quite a long review, TL;DR is at the bottom. Let\'s get into it.-Story-To put it short, the story is incredible. Dare I say no Fate series which has been animated has average or below average story and plot; it\'s always above average and beyond. If you play the mobile game like I do, then you already know what\'s going to happen in this second movie. There...are, however, differences in this movie from the original source itself. Though I finished the singularity quite a long time ago so I don\'t remember every little details, but it still is a solid adaptation. This movie also suffers from the same problem the first movie has, which is the pacing. It\'s very quick paced. One minute the characters are at the Pyramid and in the next they suddenly are on the move towards some camp. It\'s like the director wants this movie to end as fast as possible. To be fair, this problem occurs within the first 20 minutes of the movie, so the later parts do have better pacing.-Art-As with most Fate series, this movie also has incredible designs. The characters look unique from one to another. Never are you going to mix Nitocris with Sanzang and this applies to all characters present. I do have to say, the designs of the characters look a little different from the first movie. I heard that two different studios handle each movie, so it can\'t be helped. Fujimaru looks different, Mash looks cuter in the first movie; but they still look very good. The scenery of the Holy City looks astonishing, and the Pharaoh\'s Pyramid also looks amazing. This movie takes place mostly in the desert (like, literally in the middle of nowhere), but when some different scenery does take place, it does look very good. The animation though, oof, is a little jarring. When you talk about Fate series, the first two things that will come up to mind are: cute/hot anime babes and fight scenes. This movie, does not do some of the fight scenes justice. There are a couple of fight scenes that are on par with the infamous \'my pain is far greater than yours\'. Seriously, I couldn\'t tell what was going on. It\'s like they\'re trying to make them fast-paced hand-to-hand combat, but failed miserably. Again, this is not the case with most of the fight scenes; only a couple or three scenes are like this, and they don\'t ruin the movie for me.-Sound-Not much can be said about the sound in this movie. The sound effects, the voice actors/actresses, Noble Phantasm sounds are masterpiece as always. Takahashi Rie especially does a very good job portraying different emotions Mash is having. You can tell just how afraid Bedivere is whenever the topic Lion King surfaces, and that\'s thanks to the amazing performance of Mamoru Miyano. I can go on and on about how amazing all the casts are, but there is no end to it, so make do with just both of them.-Character-If you\'ve watched the first movie, I guess there\'s no point in explaining how the characters are. Nothing has changed between the first and second movie; not that it\'s a bad thing. There is a tad bit of what people would call \'character development\', but it\'s going to spoil the story, so I won\'t touch that subject.-Enjoyment-Above all, I think the most important aspect when it comes to rating a show is the enjoyment. An anime can have a good plot and story, but if it\'s boring and unenjoyable then all of that is going to waste. When I watched the movie yesterday, not once did I yawn. Every other minute, I was always at the edge of my seat which tells me the movie is very enjoyable. Definitely glad I went to see this one.-Overall/TL;DR-If you\'re a Fate fan, then this is a must watch.

Definitely worse in terms of animation, with many fight scenes where they obviously ran out of budget and/or outsourced to other animation studios. 7.5/10I left the first movie impressed with the visuals but underwhelmed by the story. I left this 2nd movie the exact opposite: the story was much more engaging than the first one, and they finally explain all the character motivations and made me care about what was actually going on.Unfortunately, it was also clear that they ran out of budget for...many of the fight scenes, some of which looked outright bad. Honestly the animation quality was all over the place, and there were some scenes where the art style changed completely, sometimes for the better, but mostly for the worse. Certain scenes also seemed like they were outsourced, and the characters ended up looking like some college art major's project and completely out of place.But overall, I would say I enjoyed this movie just a little bit more than the last one, so a solid 7.5/10 (not rounding up to 8/10 for this one, sorry). many of the fight scenes, some of which looked outright bad.

Now where's the complete version of the movie? Huh? This is the full movie? What?My opinions and thoughts from the first movie didn't really change much after this one. The pacing was still all over the place, and the character interactions are some of the weakest.The two movies fails as adaptation and as stand-alone movies.It's frustrating to watch as a fan of the game's story, with all the cut characters and noodle-wet interactions from the characters. And I imagine how boring these movies can be from an anime-only perspective with the butchered pacing and characters.The...only good thing that came from this movie is the sakuga-fest animation and some good-*ss ost. The insert song at the end was also great. Those are the only good things I can list from this movie.Overall, if you want to watch flashy and fluid animations, then I recommend this. Otherwise, just don't touch these movies.(5.6/10) only good thing that came from this movie is the sakuga-fest animation and some good-*ss ost. The insert song at the end was also great.

Otherwise, just don't touch these movies.(5.6/10)"", ""So, I'll start off by saying that I am a massive fan of the Camelot singularity in the game; one of the best written Fate stories, in my opinion, is Bedivere's story, and all of the side characters were also good, and meaningful. The first movie was disappointing. The animation was okay, art was good, OST was good, but the pacing was poor, with the first half of it being really boring, and the second half really rushed. This film was a straight up massive improvement in all departments.Story - 7/10Due to the limited runtime, a lot is skipped or skimmed over, which is why...this isn't a higher score. However, the main arc - Bedivere's arc, is brilliantly done, so it still gets a good score. It is very climax heavy, with about 2/3 of the film being the climax and conclusion, but it had the right emotional impact, especially for those who have played the game. I even think the parts after they enter Camelot were better done than the game itself.Art and Animation - 8/10Sakuga isn't for everyone. A lot of people prefer the mix of CGI and fluid drawings that Ufotable uses instead, but as a sakuga lover, I absolutely had a blast with the Sakugafest that was this movie. The art itself is good, animation is incredibly fluid, and the fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed. The only reason this isn't perfect is because the expressions are bizarre at certain points, but it's still good, and had some of the very best fight scenes in the whole franchise.Sound - 9/10Amazing OST. The first film's OST was already good, but this is even better. Every fight has its own theme, and they are all brilliant, with the seamless transitions between fights and OSTs being perfectly handled. The outro song as well, is really good.Character - 7/10There's some good, and some bad. Mash is okay. Bedivere's arc is brilliant. Gawain, Tristan, Agravain, Lancelot, the Hassans, and Egypt gang also have satisfactory conclusions and very nice characters. The main complaint is Fujimaru. I still don't quite understand his purpose, or what he adds to the narrative. He makes an epic MC speech but is immediately shut up and shown as an idiot, and his other strong moment with Bedivere is actually only because he's narrating another character's views. I know he has to be there and that he's a self-insert, but still. His VA does a great job though.Enjoyment - 9/10I had a lot of fun watching this, and cried a lot at the end. Couldn't ask for a lot more.Overall - 8/10Dragged down by the short runtime, but with what they had and considering movie 1, I don't think anything could've been better done. this isn't a higher score.

Bedivere's character arc is very fulfilling, leading to a very touching conclusion that I was not expecting at all. While other character's might not have as prominent of character arcs, it's pretty obvious that the main focus of this film is Bedivere's journey. And it's also fine since the narrative behind the Knights and their...actions is still really entertaining.The biggest thing that blew me away when it came to this movie though was the animation. They pulled no stops when it came to the visuals of this movie, whether it was the sense of scale and incredible framing and storyboarding at points, to the absolutely gorgeous fights that feature talents such as Weilin Zhang, Hakuyu Go, Bahi Jd, and so many more, Paladin; Agateram is a visual feast, and provides some of the absolute best moments to come out of the Fate franchise.The music was fantastic. I don't know enough about music to go in depth, but I can definitely say that the grand orchestral soundtrack, with moments of classical music thrown in here and there, really heightened the drama and fights within the film, and there are definitely a bunch of songs in this soundtrack that I'm gonna be listening to over and over again.Overall, this film was a fantastic experience.

In typical Fate fashion the story is completely fuc*** and there's random person's with random powers coming at you left right and center, even more than in some other fates.I would argue there's no way to understand any of what happened, well someone who has played all the games, read all the manga/novels and watched all of fate anime could say he does but I wouldn't believe that person at all.That being said it doesn't mean Camelot wouldn't be a good watch I just can't really say why I enjoyed this second movie of the series...in particular. Maybe it was the directing, but somehow I even felt a little emotional at the end. It's just that even predictable and simple words can make you feel things.Also there were a lot of epic fate fighting and who would say no to that?

extend to much on it.But before i have to say even with all the bad things the story and the characters(leaving aside the protagonist and the girls) were above the average and actually really interestings and made the movies worth the time to watch them even with the bad points that had.I think it was wrong by my part to actually think that in this part the movie could redeem ,...i mean the mistakes were already made from the previous movie so there wasnt anything that could revert that, this movie keep committing the same things that i already wrote in my previous review so i dont gonna write that again.BUT this movie actually make me furious in a way of how much potential wasted in the movie and characters even more after finishing this movie, in this one we actually get to know more about the past of bedivere and the reason of why the lion king its how she its in this movie as well as the others knight of the sacred round table, the problem resides and keep´being the fact that THERE IS NO WAY THAT ALL THE AWESOMENESS THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TRYING TO PORTRAYED WERE POSSIBLE IN ONLY MERE 3 HOURS.It was wasted so much that i dont wanna actually enter in details but the knights itselft were really interesting and almost none of them was developed how it should actually just giving us glimpses of what could be their ambitions and past, bedivere was an amaizing character but also i feel wasnt exploited to fullest, so mcuh potential to an really touching and compelling story that wasnt adapted as its should deserved.As the previous one the animation and ost were top notch to my opinion beautiful and make us inmerse even more in the movie really amazing in thet sense ( i even think that there was even more epic track in this one),  the fights ,well that aspect also bright so much and had really outandings moments.If this were an tv series of around 20 episodes its could be just perfect, gives the perfect mount of time to actually develop and get depth in the reasons, past, ambitions and story of this singularity, this movie just lets so many loose ends in many characters and felt really abrup and didnt even explain what happen to some characters after their battle or in middle of it ( yes im watching to you lancelot), other werent properly giveng the right amount of screentime (because its impossible in an movie) to show us all the facets of our characters.RESUMEIn few words yes this story in many ways its awesome and could end up being something epic , but wasnt taken advantage to the fullest in so many aspects which makes me sad ,angry , frustrated and all the kind of adjetives that you can imagine.It had an decent ending, but considering all the things that were leave aside doesnt really make justice in any way to this singulariy ( i wish they could readapt this arc in an tv series, im complety sure that in that way it bassicly imposbbile that they could fuck up this ,if they keep the same quailty in the others aspect that this movie had.If you are an fan of fate or maybe not i think this two movies are worth it even with all his flaws that i metioned, i mean you are gonna realize after watch both of them that actually the potential it was there and had some nice things , if you are able to forgive in what actually sins i think its really an decent movie.PD:personally after finishing it i at least take away an good taste in what this singularity was trying to tell, i could appreciate it for what tried to be. i mean the mistakes were already made from the previous movie so there wasnt anything that

sequences, a more solid storyline, and a more definite adaption.On a number of levels, I believe I was correct.In comparison to Babylonia, Camelot was a series that was inadequately adapted.Many elements of the first film were omitted, including a slew of game-related explanations that never made it to the screen. The storyline problems were not resolved in this sequel. It could be due to financial constraints, but the general spectator may not...comprehend why certain sacrifices or choices were made or what was going on.

The anime severely understated the Lion King's true power.If we're talking about this film particularly, it has a few redeeming qualities that are worth discussing. Making Lancelot and Agravain appear onscreen is one of them. Also, allowing Sanzang to fight someone.Having said that, this movie was still far superior to the first. The animation was excellent, and the battles were thrilling. Not to mention, the use of music here was much better than the last one, whereby the music actually wrecked the mood and ambiance in part.I believe that if this were developed as a series with more resources and time, it may even rival Babylonia in terms of quality, as it has a deeper story and is unquestionably one of the best-written singularity. And that's coming from a Gilgamesh fanboy whose favorite singularity is Babylonia.If you're just watching it casually, I'd still recommend giving it a go because it will explain more than the previous movie while still being more enjoyable, and if you want to learn more about the story and what you missed out on, you can play the game or read the story transcripts online. comprehend why certain sacrifices or choices were made or what was going on.

I came into this expecting it to have a climax, since that\'s what fate does most of the times (with earlier movies building up and later ones having a big conclusion). HOWEVER, I was not expecting this at all. Right of the bat, the first half the movie was already a step up to the previous one, I was watching it with a friend and in the first 15 minutes I literally told him ""I\'m going to give it a 10 without even watching it"" and I have...never done that with any other show.

Bokura no,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1690/Bokura_no,"['“I have no choice but to pretend I am a warrior who knows no fear.”Truer OP lyrics have rarely been attributed so well to an anime series.Fifteen children are tricked into participating in a battle for Earth itself. However, don’t be fooled by video clips of huge mecha fighting each other – this is not a classic mecha series with epic space battles and the like. Instead, each child who comes to pilot the mecha known as Zearth faces not only the struggle to save the world but also a struggle of their own. What do they fight for? Some fight for their loved ones....Others fight for themselves. A few see it as their duty. Some don’t know why and struggle to find a reason to look death in the face for the sake of complete strangers.Each story arc deals with the next pilot set to fight on Earth’s behalf. Each child has a story to tell, a conflict of some sort to work out before they fight. One wants to prove himself to his workaholic father. Another deals with bullying because of her mother’s reputation. Another grapples with his disappeared dad while supporting his three younger siblings. And so on and so forth. At first, getting to know all the kids all at once is overwhelming, but as each one is explored and developed, they become unique and well fleshed out. Each arc then becomes a “coming of age” story for each of the kids, culminating in their final battles as they reflect on their lives and the world they fight for. In the meantime, the group of children draw unwanted attention to themselves from the government and military and they must deal with the implications of their actions.As you can imagine, it’s heavy on drama and it gets amped up even further as the story progresses and the children learn more about this twisted “game” (but to discuss them here would be very spoilery). Bring tissues.For the more technical merits of Bokurano, it fares pretty well. Animation and art aren’t overly detailed and there aren’t any bright, glaring colours. Realism is what the animators seemed to be aiming for. Still, it slips up here and there, and sometimes obviously so. I also caught some re-used animation a few times, too. The mecha are done in CG and while it’s noticeable, it doesn’t stick out too much in a bad way, and Zearth and some of the other mecha designs are well rendered.The OP and the two EDs are all sung by Chiaki Ishikawa. The OP, “Uninstall”, carries a rather haunting melody and is well-suited to the anime. The EDs are, unfortunately, more forgettable. Still, it’s notable that the lyrics of each song fit the anime to a T, so the translated lyrics are well worth paying attention to. The background music is, for the most part, unremarkable – not noteworthy but not bad, either. I have no complaints about the seiyuu as they all did a great job.Overall, Bokurano was a surprisingly strong series that gives viewers plenty to think about. No magic tricks here, no fairy tale endings. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships the characters face, I can’t help but feel a bit hopeful, like I should appreciate life a little more and all the good things in this world. After all, we never know when it’ll all be over. Others fight for themselves. A few see it as their duty. Some don’t know why and struggle to find a reason to look death in the face for the sake of complete strangers.Each story arc deals with the next pilot set to fight on Earth’s behalf.

In the meantime, the group of children draw unwanted attention to themselves from the government and military and they must deal with the implications of their actions.As you can imagine, it’s heavy on drama and it gets amped up even further as the story progresses and the children learn more about this twisted “game” (but to discuss them here would be very spoilery). Bring tissues.For the more technical merits of Bokurano, it fares pretty well. Animation and art aren’t overly detailed and there aren’t any bright, glaring colours. Realism is what the animators seemed to be aiming for. Still, it slips up here and there, and sometimes obviously so. I also caught some re-used animation a few times, too. The mecha are done in CG and while it’s noticeable, it doesn’t stick out too much in a bad way, and Zearth and some of the other mecha designs are well rendered.The OP and the two EDs are all sung by Chiaki Ishikawa. The OP, “Uninstall”, carries a rather haunting melody and is well-suited to the anime. The EDs are, unfortunately, more forgettable. Still, it’s notable that the lyrics of each song fit the anime to a T, so the translated lyrics are well worth paying attention to. The background music is, for the most part, unremarkable – not noteworthy but not bad, either. I have no complaints about the seiyuu as they all did a great job.Overall, Bokurano was a surprisingly strong series that gives viewers plenty to think about. No magic tricks here, no fairy tale endings. Nevertheless, despite all the hardships the characters face, I can’t help but feel a bit hopeful, like I should appreciate life a little more and all the good things in this world. After all, we never know when it’ll all be over.', 'I posted this review on a forum as a recommendation to someone who was looking for a depressing and slice of life anime, and I was told by two people that my review was able to get them to watch the series and I believe they enjoyed it, so I decided to share my review here in hopes of intriguing more people into watching it.Thoughts: This anime cannot be completely enjoyed unless you have the patience to watch it all the way through. Even if you do not have much patience, I still think the first episode ends in a way that compels the...watchers to continue watching because it really does leave you at a cliffhanger. I would go more into detail, but I really rather not spoil it for anyone. Even though Slice of Life is not one of the genres for this anime, I still think it has its moments where this genre is applied. The children have to go through a lot, and there are many times throughout the anime where you feel sorry for them, since they lose, let\'s say, something very close to them after each battle. Again, I do not think the first episode will be as exciting if I go into more detail, so that is as far as I will go.Story: While watching the scenes from the opening song, you figure that the anime will be a typical mecha with the typical battles, and since you are told that there are 15 children and 15 alien battles, it is hard to be persuaded the battles are going to be very unique. That is partly correct. The battles do seem overused a lot, but the actual plot for the anime is rather unique. As you continue watching, you learn that there is more to the actual battles with the ""aliens"" each time. There is a deeper meaning in the anime, but it is the watcher\'s duty to figure it out, which is a good and bad thing. If you are just watching an anime for enjoyment, then I really do not suggest this. However, if you wish to analyze the anime and find the deeper meaning, then this will probably interest you.Animation: The art is rather simple, and I did not have any problems with it, but I think it could have been better. Sometimes simple art works well for certain kinds of anime, but I think it was not completely fitting for this one. There have been plenty other anime out there that have successfully been able to pull off the simple style of animation before, but unfortunately this one could not. The 3D for the mecha battles were actually pretty good, any way.Sound: The opening song, Uninstall by Chiaki Ishikawa, was impressive, I thought. She has a pretty powerful voice, and it really worked for the opening. I think the music could even make up for some of the disappointing animation, but that is just my opinion. The ending songs work too, but Uninstall was mainly the only song that captured my attention.Character: I really could not favor one character over another in this anime (partly because almost all of them ""disappears"" by the end), but I liked how one of the characters in the beginning acted like a total jerk, and eventually lightened up in the end. There is actually a side story that explains why his attitude is like that, but I cannot be bothered to explain everything in that area. You will learn that some of the characters live depressing lives, pretty much like any other anime, but I do not think there is any one perfect character in this show, which makes it more enjoyable.Enjoyment: I just really liked how this anime played out overall. I think I said this before, but it is a rather unique story. I do not recall there being much comedy or any at all, but I think that works for some people. I believe most watchers will definitely cry during some episodes. I have to admit that I did. watchers to continue watching because it really does leave you at a cliffhanger.

It began running in Shogakukan\'s Ikki magazine in 2004, and is still running at present, at a total of eight collected volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.A light novel entitled Bokurano ~alternative~ written by Renji Ohki and with character designs done by Mohiro Kitoh began running in May of 2007, and is still running at this point in time, with three volumes released this far.  It also has yet to be licensed Stateside.The anime series clocked in at a total of 24 episodes, and was done...by Studio Gonzo (famous for Gankutsou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Saikano) and directed by Hiroyuki Morita (famous for his work on The Cat Returns).  It ran from April 8th to September 25th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though they have yet to say when they\'re actually going to release it.  EDIT: As of this time, Funimation has only ordered cease and desists to fansubbers on behalf of Gonzo, but a NA liscensor has yet to be announced for this series.Story: So, there are these fifteen kids, all in middle school except for one girl in fourth grade, and they\'re at this summer camp.  They end up finding a grotto with a random guy in it, and he enlists them in a ""game"" involving robots.  What he fails to mention is that the game is real, and that they actually do have to pilot a robot.  There are fifteen robot enemies, one for each kid.  They have to beat them, or the Earth goes bye-bye.  The robot they pilot runs on their life forces, though, so even if they win, they die, too.The story focuses on the backgrounds of each of the kids as they\'re called up to pilot initially, but there are subplots involving the government and the overall game added in after the halfway point, along with some AMAZING plot twists.The story isn\'t quite as good as Gankutsuou was, but this is up there with Gonzo\'s better works.  Yeah, the story\'s just a bit depressing, but there are little rays of brightness that peak in every once in a while, and it\'s enough to keep you going through.  Each kid gets development enough that you care as they go to face their deaths, and you\'ll at least be able to remember either their first or their last name, as do other people who become involved in their situation.It\'s a good story and all, but it didn\'t quite have the impact on me that I thought it would.  I mean, just looking at the show\'s description, I thought it would be Saikano-esque levels of depression, but it never quite reaches those.The show\'s also very self-aware at times, and pokes fun at the mecha genre (the kids naming the robot, shouting out their attacks, getting ""uniforms"" to wear as they ride in it, etc).If you\'re going into this as a mecha fan, though, be aware that the robot fights aren\'t central to the story; there\'s at least one every episode, but the story\'s more centered around the children than it is around the robot.Also, let\'s cover a big controversy that came up while this was being released, and contains slight spoilers, so read ahead at your own risk.  The creator of the manga, Mohiro Kitoh, made a blog entry while the show was being released that claimed that the author hated the source material (he did dislike it, admittedly, which begs the question of why he was even chosen to do this), and has asked if there was a way that he could save the children.  Kitoh supposedly gave the go ahead, but asked for fans of the manga to stop watching the anime, because it wouldn\'t be anything like the manga.  Well, I went and compared what I could find for information about how the manga unfolded and how the anime turned out, and the only real difference that I could find was in how some characters were handled and the order in which they were called to be pilots. Again, yes, different from the original, but the children were not freed from the contract and the fifteen who are contracted do end up dying, and the changes that did happen were nothing that would call for Kitoh to ask fans to boycott the series.  I think this is a case of overreaction from the original author.  It\'s all the more ironic and hypocritical since he\'s involved in a complete retooling of the story (the Bokurano ~alternative~ light novel).Art: The style that Gonzo chose to use for this is a bit simpler than I\'ve seen with other productions that they\'ve done.  It just doesn\'t look very good, honestly -- I\'ve seen other series that have done simple well, like Kino no Tabi, but it just doesn\'t work as the series goes on.3D is obviously used for the mechas, and it looks pretty good.  Yeah, it stands out quite a bit, but then again, it\'s highly doubtful that one could do a robot entirely in 2D, and the thing\'s SUPPOSED to stand out.Music: The background music for this series is, like Toward the Terra and Elfen Lied, one of the few scores I\'ve actively listened to and noticed since Gankutsuou.  Excellent recurring themes.The OP, ""Uninstall"", is done by Chiaki Ishikawa, and is an absolutely beautiful piece that fits the series perfectly.  Both of the EDs are also done by her, and are more of the typical female JPop ballads, but I like the second one (""Vermillion""), more than the first one (""Little Bird"").Seiyuu: Kenji Nojima, who replaced Takemoto\'s seiyuu in the last episode of Honey and Clover, plays one of the children,  Tomokazu Sugita (Soldier Blue in Toward the Terra and Mayama in Honey and Clover) also appears as one of the children, and another child\'s seiyuu also appeared in Paranoia Agent as Shounen Bat.  The rest of the cast gives excellent performances, as always.Length: This feels about right, though there were some character\'s arcs who took more than one episode and probably could\'ve been shortened a bit.  Any longer and it just wouldn\'t have worked.Overall: A good, solid mecha story centered around the children who pilot it, with decent art and length, beautiful music, and pretty good seiyuu.Story: 9/10Art: 8/10Music: 9/10Length: 8/10Seiyuu: 9/10Overall: 43/50; 86% (B ) by Studio Gonzo (famous for Gankutsou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Saikano) and directed by Hiroyuki Morita (famous for his work on The Cat Returns).

It doesn\'t have the high-tempo, flashy battles of most mecha anime, nor does it have characters which fit into any standard role, or any of the type.The first episode of the show can be quite overwhelming to some; you will rather suddenly be introduced to the entire cast of fourteen seventh-graders and one fourth-grader. They are gathered from various places on a summer camp, enjoying a seemingly peaceful summer. That is, until they decide to explore a hidden cave. here they encounter a peculiar man with an even more peculiar name,...who invites them to play a certain game...To put it simply, they are tricekd into a contract binding them as pilots for a giant robot, and what\'s worse, they have to fight other giant robots, unless they want Earth to face acopalypse. And so they decide to fight. But there are a lot of secrets revolving around the impeding fights, the robots and why they have to fight. And some of them are more horrible than others...Of course, the outside world isn\'t going to stand still as rampaging robots duke it out across cities, killing thousands and ruining property for billions. This results in some intricate side-plots with some, well, some standard mecha parties/groups. Namely, the military, and some separate group of scientists. And these side-plots, which plays out quite well and interestingly, are pretty much what you get of a real, continuous plot; because aside that and the fighting it\'s much more about each of the characters struggling with problems in their life.And the characters, sure, they get their screen time and it is done very well. Extremely well. Though I must admit that for seventh graders they act a little on the mature side. Maybe they shoulda been a few years older and it owuld have been completely believeable. Anyway, they are normal children, thrown into an unescapable battle with everything at the stakes if they lose and nothing but despair to the victor. Since they each know what cruel fate awaits them when they get chosen as the pilot for the robot, they end up living out their last days doing what they feel compelled to do before parting with this world. And yes, you get to see inside the lives of each of the teenagers; some getting more screentime than others, and it would seem that each of them have their troubles in life. Love, forbidden or not, revenge, family problems, there\'s a ton of stuff these adolescents have in their life.Oh, it plays out quite beautifully, except for the aforementioned fact that they seem to young to actually react to these problems, at least in the way they do; they seem overly mature for their age.And along with the main cast, there\'s quite the few interesting side characters. who have their important say in the plot and the lives and struggles of the main characters, while shining wonderfully on their own.There was one thing which struck me when I watched Bokurano. It was that it seemed very dispassionate, almost cold in its emotions. When there\'s a battle, it\'s not like one would feel the adrenaline. When characters face problems, it\'s not like they seem overly emotional about it; at least the viewer will not go as far as to become emoional with them. The voice actors, they were all quite quiet and calm, and so was the mood set forth by the animation and the soundtrack. This was, to this reviewer, a good thing for the show. It is great to see that the show is never rushed; yet, at the same time, it doesn\'t get bogged down with unecessary scenes or anything. It just is placid.Together with this, the animation is quite marvelous to look at. It\'s not breathtaking or meticulous, but it\'s good to look at. There\'s no sharp, glaring or bright colours. There\'s no rough edges or anything. The light and shadow efffects are lovely to look at, too. It\'s all very temperate. Even the massive mecha, which are all made in CGI, aren\'t too glaring or disturbing to look at in the environments it is put into. Movements in eneral are qutie smooth; they certainly didn\'t skip ahead on frames when making this anime, and that is really nice.Going along, the opening and ending themes are quite melliflous tunes. Chiaki Ishikawa has a serene voice and sings three stunning songs thereafter, all of which are themes I would want to listen to over and over. ""Uninstall"" is very mysterious, almost a bit adventurous; yet very inviting and makes you feel that the show has something for you to experience. The ending themes, ""Little Bird"" and ""Vermillion"" both are interesting themes to listen to. The first is something I could gladly listen to after going to bed at night, to fall asleep to, or simply and plainly relax to. ""Vermillion"" leans towards the J-pop side of things, but has its interesting tone, like you\'re just drifting off somewhere, in a world of dreams, illusions.The background music is composed mainly of calming string tunes and mysterious, inexplicable piano songs. It sets up the mood quite well, albeit keeping mainly to a single one or two; making sure that your emotions keep within the doldrums; reposed and quiet.If I were to sum it up, I would have to say that Bokurano isn\'t a show that stands out very well. It doesn\'t leave a lasting impression, but while you watch this, you will most certainly be affected by an aura of melancholy; of placidity and stoicism. It drags you into the lives of a group of unsuspecting adolescents and shows you what would happen if someone suddenly had the choice between not doing anything and watch the Earth go asunder; dying along with it, or try and save it, with a risk of failing, and still dying. It shows you what a variety of people would do with their final days, if they knew they were about to die.

To me, Bokurano was quite good, but not entirely up there.', 'Overview:Time for a totally random review! Today, I\'ll be covering the always polarizing Bokurano. One of my offline buddies loves this series, so he let me borrow it. I really wanted to like it but...yeah.Story:The story is that God is an utter asshole. He arbitrarily decides that there are too many universes and now a fighting tournament is needed to see which universe survives. This series has the same plot as Dragon Ball Super Tournament of Power, but plays it DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS! You are setting yourself up to fail if you create a plot that Akira ""poop on a stick is funny"" Toriyama would...come up with and take it this seriously. Each parallel Earth chooses a bunch of random children and forces them to pilot a giant robot in a best of 12 contest. However, the robot is powered by the souls of children, so the kid dies even if he or she wins. The kids of our Earth decide to name their robot ""Zearth"" because I guess Dio copyrighted ZA WARUDO! Zearth is OP as fuck and easily wins each and every battle...then the kid dies. That\'s basically every episode. Our universe survives, the others die and...that\'s really it.Characters:Bokurano has a lot of characters...but they all die shortly after introduction and leave zero emotional impact. You\'re left going ""oh no...so and so\'s dead...what a shock!"" Let\'s introduce kid #1. He\'s an athlete who was sad that his dad never came to his games, so he quit sports. Then he pilots a giant robot and says goodbye to this cruel world. I don\'t even remember his name. I can\'t remember what he looked like. Is that the point? That we are all disposable cogs in the machine of this horrible existence? Is this anime just a sophomoric foray into nihilism? Maybe there is some deeper meaning the author intended, but I sure didn\'t see it. I was probably a tad distracted by how fucking stupid the plot is.Art:Did you think the CGI in Full Metal Panic aged poorly? You ain\'t seen nothing yet! I think this anime at least looked sort of acceptable upon release, but now it\'s a visual abortion.Sound:I at least liked the opening theme and its chorus of DELETE! DELETE! It sadly just reminded me that I could be re-watching Matt Hardy\'s The Final Deletion again, which is far better than this anime. Yes, watching 2 redneck wrestlers launch fireworks at each other and spew total nonsense is a million times better than this anime.Overall:I obviously didn\'t care for this anime, but maybe some other people found enjoyment or profundity where I didn\'t. That\'s cool. At least this anime started some fun conversations.Me: ""I\'m sorry man...but this anime is just abject trash.""My friend: ""Oh really? Coming from the guy who loves Elfen Lied?

Instead you should watch a REAL anime...the first season of Slayers from 1995.everyone: ""Yeah...Slayers is pretty good"" come up with and take it this seriously. Each parallel Earth chooses a bunch of random children and forces them to pilot a giant robot in a best of 12 contest. However, the robot is powered by the souls of children, so the kid dies even if he or she wins. The kids of our Earth decide to name their robot ""Zearth"" because I guess Dio copyrighted ZA WARUDO! Zearth is OP as fuck and easily wins each and every battle...then the kid dies. That\'s basically every episode. Our universe survives, the others die and...that\'s really it.Characters:Bokurano has a lot of characters...but they all die shortly after introduction and leave zero emotional impact. You\'re left going ""oh no...so and so\'s dead...what a shock!"" Let\'s introduce kid #1. He\'s an athlete who was sad that his dad never came to his games, so he quit sports. Then he pilots a giant robot and says goodbye to this cruel world. I don\'t even remember his name. I can\'t remember what he looked like. Is that the point? That we are all disposable cogs in the machine of this horrible existence? Is this anime just a sophomoric foray into nihilism? Maybe there is some deeper meaning the author intended, but I sure didn\'t see it. I was probably a tad distracted by how fucking stupid the plot is.Art:Did you think the CGI in Full Metal Panic aged poorly? You ain\'t seen nothing yet! I think this anime at least looked sort of acceptable upon release, but now it\'s a visual abortion.Sound:I at least liked the opening theme and its chorus of DELETE! DELETE! It sadly just reminded me that I could be re-watching Matt Hardy\'s The Final Deletion again, which is far better than this anime. Yes, watching 2 redneck wrestlers launch fireworks at each other and spew total nonsense is a million times better than this anime.Overall:I obviously didn\'t care for this anime, but maybe some other people found enjoyment or profundity where I didn\'t. That\'s cool. At least this anime started some fun conversations.Me: ""I\'m sorry man...but this anime is just abject trash.""My friend: ""Oh really? Coming from the guy who loves Elfen Lied?

I still enjoyed it but its quite different from the story summaries, previews, etc.At start the story seems lame and rushed, just a little excuse to put some kids fighting for earth in some big robots, the fights are quite dull as well and the animation is quite average with some bad parts even but thats mostly at the start.I'm glad I kept watching it because it gets much better, the story...twists, or better, it unveils a completely different plot from the first appearances becoming rather interesting. The fights improve allot compared to the first ones but this is not a mecha style anime with lots of cool fights and moves, its a story driven drama where each episode u get to known one of the characters better, usually before their respective battle portraying their will and reasons to fight or give up. The mystery behind the robots and the battles is also unveiled slowly and I'm afraid I can't say much more to avoid spoiling the development, one of the good aspects of the show.The music isn't bad, the opening becomes quite enjoyable after a couple episodes and theres the usual backtracks accompanying the crucial moments.Overall its a good show, with a decent story about a couple kids who are put into a non desirable situation without even being asked, and are now carrying the burden to save earth, their own problems and doubts are explored while they find a meaning to fight for earth, themselves, protecting someone or simply giving up.

Unfortunately, it sets the bar higher than it can actually reach and ultimately fails to live up to its potential.(This review contains major spoilers for both the manga and anime).My first impression of this show was really good. It seemed like it was setting itself up for an intelligent story that would leave you thinking about it long after it was over. The kind of story that deconstructs popular concepts within fiction (in this case the...""giant mecha genre""), in order to drive them to their dark and desolate conclusions. One that ultimately brings you a new reflection of reality, that can only be seen through the lens of fiction. That is the kind of story it was setting itself up to be.At first, I had thought I had hit the jackpot seeing as how the content was pretty much the darkest thing I could never imagine. Kids, having to sacrifice their lives in order to save the crapsack world that doesn\'t care for them; the revelation that they are in the process, destroying other worlds that have people setting out to do the same; having what may very well be the highest death count in any story of all time. In fact, it was more than just dark, it was pitch black.However, as I continued to watch it, I realized that the show being dark was pretty much all there was to it. Even though it clearly presents itself with the ambitions of being profound and thought provoking, and with the presence of a show that has lots to say, it ends up saying not much at all, almost as if believing that the subject matter itself is enough to get your interest, leaving you instead with emptiness. The worst part is the ending which is so bizarrely out of place, nonsensical, and naive, that it becomes downright insulting that the writers would expect you to swallow it.Before I get into details, let\'s talk about the ""Bokurano"" manga series. I began reading the manga immediately after finishing the anime. Not because I liked the anime so much but because I had heard that the manga was a lot different. I learned that the anime had been produced while the manga was still going and so I reasoned that the story must have suffered solely due to the anime making it up on its own when it no longer had the manga to go by. I was convinced that the manga was where the story would reach the hights it was setting itself up for, and so I gave it a try.Although the manga did in fact redeem it to some degree, it wasn\'t by a whole lot. The biggest difference with the manga and the anime is the level of cynicism. The manga may be the most cynical one I have ever read, which fits the tone of the dark story and subject matter. It still feels empty in what it wants to convey, but at the very least it feels like it is supposed to. The anime on the other hand tones down most of the cynicism of the manga and tries to portray this pitch black story with an air of optimism, which makes it absolutely ridiculous. Especially when contrasting it with the manga does this flaw become apparent.The best example that I can think of comes from a chapter in the manga that didn\'t make it into the anime. Kirie has been selected as the next pilot and talks about how he doesn\'t want to go through with it with Tanaka. In this scene, he talks about how he sees no reason to protect a world that has done nothing for him, just because it is the world he himself belongs to. The surviving world consists of people just like this one, and it would be hypocritical to justify sacrificing one world to save another, just because one of those worlds is your own. Especially when the world in question is one that you do not care for. At the end, Kirie ends up fighting after all because he realizes by watching the pilot of the other world that both of their worlds are just as bad, and there is no reason for saving or sacrificing either one of them over the other. So he fights, because that is the role he was given and it ends up being the only role he is able to live up to.In the anime it\'s a tad bit different. First off, the entire scene with Kirie and Tanaka doesn\'t take place whatsoever, and although Kirie\'s position to piloting the ship is retained, it is incredibly dumbed down. However, the most striking difference is in how this arc is concluded. Kirie sort of just changes his mind and gains confidence that his world is awesome and worth protecting after all. Then he proceeds to fight as if it was the most obvious thing there ever was. As if his previous attitude was just some temporary mood swing. Oh, and when he starts fighting, he does a bunch of elegant fighting moves and stuff, because that\'s cool right?However, this is nothing in comparison to what I am about to write next. If you have only been skimming through this review until this point then at least read the following couple of paragraphs carefully because it is pretty much the most spot-on illustration of my problems with the anime that I can think of.In the same conversation as above, Kirie and Tanaka also talk for a while about movies. Kirie explains how he never sees happy endings in movies as actual happy endings because of the means that are used to get to them.(Paraphrasing)""A hero that kills a 100 faceless bad guys, rescues the girl, and saves the world, is always depicted at the end of the movie with a smiling face even though there were a lot of sacrifices made for him to get there. Why doesn\'t anyone in the audience feel sad for any of the 100 faceless mooks whom may have had families of their own, whom loved and cared for them? What if they weren\'t actually that bad? What if they just happened to take a wrong turn that eventually led to them getting in the way of the protagonist? Why does the audience only get upset when something happens to the main characters anyway? Does the protagonist even have to be a sympathetic character to gain the audiences respect? Or does his presence as the centre of the story dignify every action he makes? It seems that as long as the story ends with the hero being alive and happy, everything is alright and we can end it on a happy note, ignoring all of the bad stuff that actually happened before it.""This here is one of the few parts of the story that actually made me think a little. If only there was a central direction for the story to take that would head deeper into this kind of content, it would have made for a much more rewarding experience. One thing I love about this conversation is how meta it is. If you think about it, everything Kirie says in this scene can be applied to the readers of this very manga. In a way, it is as if the author is making fun of you.However, the reason I brought it up is to discuss the message that the author is giving us. What this conversation basically is telling us about ""Bokurano"" as a whole is this: The ending of this story will be just as harsh as everything that has preceeded it. It will not contrive itself to bring you a false happy ending that defies logic and insults your intelligence.This exactly is why the anime fails, because the thing is, well... it perfectly describes the exact kind of ending the anime got, doesn\'t it?I mean think about it. That has got to be the defining quality of a failed adaptation. Sure, this might not have been the easiest story to write a fitting ending for but if the adaptation becomes the very kind of work that the original is criticizing and using as a source of social commentary, then you have created the antithesis to the story you were supposed to make. The people who made the anime, simply had no idea what they were making an anime out of or they didn\'t have the ambition or the guts to actually make it, and that is all there is to it.Speaking of endings, the one in the manga was expectedly in a much harsher tone, consistent with the rest of the story, it ends simply by going full circle, ending up where it started with everything starting over again but with new people. It\'s not a happy ending nor a sad one. It comes off with the empty sense of insignificance you have been feeling throughout the entire read, and plays it off as if it was the most natural thing in the world, which by that point it is.Although the cynicism of the manga makes the story work well enough as it is, the premise is too good to be wasted on a story that could have been so much more than just a nihilistic presentation of ""a million is a statistic"". The manga aimed to be amazing yet it managed only to be pretty good, while the anime aimed to be pretty good and ended up being nothing more than decent. The manga wanted to go somewhere but didn\'t, while the anime wanted to go somewhere until it changed its mind and went back. This story had so much potential but it led absolutely nowhere. It told me to think but gave me nothing to think about. Somewhere in here there might be a masterpiece, but it is shrouded in a story that amounts to nothing. Though for the premise and subject matter alone, it still holds up to being an entertaining enough watch to sit through.

I apologize in advance if I do this and I hope to avoid spilling the beans on a very good anime. I\'ll admit my review is also kind of long. For a tl;dr, go the second to last paragraph.Bokurano has always seemed to me to be a very contentious and controversial anime....Viewers and commenters appear to either love it to death or hate its very existence. Enjoying Bokurano is highly dependent upon bonding with the characters, feeling their pain, weeping with them, and leaving each episode like you have just left a funeral. In anime such as this, viewers tend to either develop this connection with the protagonists in which they love the series or the viewers do not and so they find themselves hating it. I can\'t promise that you will like Bokurano, but I can promise that I will tell you why I like it in the hopes that you will find out if you will enjoy it like I did.Bokurano is about 15 teenagers who are tricked into piloting a massive mecha to defend Earth against other massive mecha who are attacking for an unknown purpose. Each of these kids has their own reason for fighting, these reasons are very personal and most are not caught up in the idea of protecting humanity. The series is structured around arcs of one or two episodes focused on each of the pilots. In each case, we see the life of the character in question, their families and people around them, why they seem beaten down and driven into a corner, and finally, why they choose to fight the attacking mecha.I see Bokurano as the ultimate ""feel-bad"" anime. There are very few happy or funny moments. Each heartwarming moment turns to sorrow within 10 minutes and many of these moments are intertwined with suffering. Gutwrenching events occur almost every episode and I often found myself wanted to go sit in a corner after watching. I would not recommend seeing Bokurano as an anime similar to CLANNAD or Steins;Gate. These anime begin with humor, happiness, and charm to introduce you to the characters and then put them through hell in the pattern of what TVTropes has called Cereberus Syndrome. Bokurano does not take any time trying to win you over with hints of a happy series. By the end of the second episode, it is clear that things will not go well for our heroes and heroines. The fights are never shown as something cool or fun and aren\'t even that interesting to watch. A minor amount of strategy in these fights is discussed, but it\'s not a big focus of the series. The battles bring the kids together and connect them to each other, but are primarily used as a plot device to keep things moving.You may have already noticed that Bokurano seems very similar to a much more famous anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion (abbreviated NGE). NGE seems to have been a major inspiration for Bokurano and both anime have significant similarities. Indeed, I find it pretty hard to discuss Bokurano without comparing and contrasting it with NGE so I\'ll get that done here. Both NGE and Bokurano go heavily into the implications of using emotionally unstable teenagers as the first and only line of defense against mysterious, eldrich beings who attack and fight for apparently no reason. Neither anime is particularly happy or uplifting and the protagonists in both can seem distant and hard to get along with throughout the series. The mission control and support for the children piloting the mecha is very limited and the pilots commonly feel like no one in the world is there for them. The most obvious antagonist in both series is the one driving the protagonists to keep fighting (Gendo Ikari and Dung Beetle for NGE and Bokurano, respectively). Be aware, however, that there are major differences as well. NGE is not solely about the suffering of its protagonists. It heavily uses Judeo-Christian naming and symbolism and the battles against the Angels can be interesting and cool at times. NGE also heavily goes into Freudian psychology and often has a highbrow, even pretentious feel to it at times. Bokurano has none of these things. Bokurano\'s sole focus is to rip into the Humongous Mecha genre and show why it is not fun, cool, interesting, or a good idea to enlist young, emotionally unstable children as the soldiers against enemies who threaten our species. I personally feel that if you like one of these anime, you will like the other, but I know many NGE lovers who did not enjoy Bokurano as all, so please be aware of the differences between these series if you came from NGE looking for something similar.Bokurano uses much less symbolism than NGE, but there is one major symbol I would like to comment on: chairs. Each of the chosen pilots has a chair they are transported into the robot with. The significance of these chairs differs for each of the pilots, but each one relates to their dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their life. A sadistic, socially Darwinistic boy is associated with his father\'s office chair. His father is a nasty caricature of a heartless businessman who seeks to profit off the destruction of the battles occuring throughout Japan. Another boy has a floor cushion, used as a symbol of his family\'s poverty and the troubles he goes through in order to support his siblings who were all abandoned by their parents. A girl brings a piano bench; her parents love to hear her play, but she doesn\'t particularly enjoy it. All of these chairs provide insight into the protagonists and their lives and each helps the viewer understand them better and to emotionally connect with these characters. I think the use of chairs was done extremely well by the series and is used to great effect to demonstrate how each of the protagonists is both and different from all the others.Now that I have finished my initial discussion and analysis of Bokurano, I am going to discuss each of the official ratings MAL gives its reviewers to rate anime. If you have read this far, you likely still have some interest in Bokurano and I will attempt to use this section to help you make a final decision of whether to watch it or not:Story: Bokurano has the saddest story of any anime I have seen at the time of writing this. The characters all go through hell and get very little for their troubles. There are so few happy moments that the most common criticism I see of Bokurano is that the viewer can become apathetic to the trauma suffered by the characters due to the mostly uninterrupted melancholy of the series. I personally did not have this happen to me, but I can easily understand why others say this. Note that Bokurano is also very dependant on surprising plot twists and does not hesitate to make its cast miserable for the sake of the plot. If anime are to be classified as plot-driven or character-driven, Bokurano is definitely plot-driven. Overall, I give the story 8/10 for its capacity to be touching, but it probably could have used some contrast.Animation: The animation in Bokurano is not particularly eye-catching or attention-grabbing, but I feel that a bright, colorful animation style would be out of place. The characters are all animated realistically except for Dung Beetle whose slightly cute appearance is contrasted with his sadistic behavior. I really like that Bokurano avoids the animation caricatures that anime often slips into such as huge eyes, brightly colored hair, and flamboyant outfits. The overall gray tint to the show adds to the gray mood of the story. Because the animation fits the theme, but isn\'t particulary remarkable, I give it 9/10.Sound: Bokurano opens with one my favorite anime OPs of all time, Uninstall by Ishikawa Chiaki. I absolutely love this song and still play it regularly while driving or working. In fact, the tagline for this review is a line from the OP. Be sure to look at the lyrics as they describe a lot of the general feeling of the series. Both endings to Bokurano, Little Bird and Vermillion (by the same artist), are much less interesting, but still are good to listen to and capture the feel of the series well. The voice acting and background music didn\'t particularly get my attention as it is neither very good nor very bad. I personally think that this works out well overall when the sound doesn\'t distract from the atmosphere and Bokurano isn\'t a series where much would be gained from music and voices grabbing one\'s attention. Mostly due to Uninstall, I give the sound 10/10.Characters: Bokurano has a very large character list. 15 children pilot the robot. In addition to them, Dung Beetle and various government officials make regular appearances. Add all these up and we get a series with at least 18 main characters (and arguments can be made for others). As a result of this huge cast in a 24 episode series, characterization is somewhat limited. While each character changes throughout his or her arc, there really is only time to designate one major change. Series with so many important characters also run the risk of not showing much of their cast besides the designated protagonists, but Bokurano averts this nicely and makes each of them essential to the progression of the story. Everyone changes and develops and I found myself sympathizing with each of the protagonists, something that is quite rare with such a large number! This rating might get me some hate, but I give the characters 10/10.Enjoyment: It\'s always hard for me to describe enjoyment for a series that really isn\'t fun. I would be lying if I said that Bokurano was a blast. It made me cry repeatedly and I felt rather like a dung beetle after every episode. Moments of happiness and hope get squashed very quickly and moments of sadness permeate throughout. You will see horrible things and gutwrenching moments on a regular basis while watching Bokurano. I doubt that many viewers will ""enjoy"" Bokurano in the way that the word is generally used. However, it was very emotionally cathartic so I\'m going to give an enjoyment rating of 8/10.Based on these numbers and how I liked the series, I give it 9/10 as one of the more powerful anime I have seen, but not quite good or consistent enough to warrant a perfect rating.I will end this review by making a few comments to help if you are still undecided on whether to watch Bokurano or not. If you are looking for a dark action series, go elsewhere. I recommend Wolf\'s Rain or Ergo Proxy. If you want a dark series with black humor while keeping a lot of pain and suffering, I would try Mawaru Penguindrum or Kaiba. If you want a more positive story with a large amount of feels, I\'m not the best person to ask since that\'s not really my thing, but I would try The Place Promised in Our Early Days or Millennium Actress. However, if you want to watch an anime completely and entirely about how much saving the world sucks with a story which does not hesitate to make its characters miserable, watch Bokurano. If you like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Texhnolyze, I highly recommend Bokurano.Note: This is the first anime review I have written and is a repost of the review I made for Bokurano on hummingbird found here: https://hummingbird.me/anime/bokurano/reviews/10222. If anyone has suggestions for making this review better, please let me know in a message! Thanks for reading!Acknowledgment: I took the idea for opening my review with a quote from Uninstall from Aeterna\'s review of Bokurano. Thanks! Viewers and commenters appear to either love it to death or hate its very existence. Enjoying Bokurano is highly dependent upon bonding with the characters, feeling their pain, weeping with them, and leaving each episode like you have just left a funeral. In anime such as this, viewers tend to either develop this connection with the protagonists in which they love the series or the viewers do not and so they find themselves hating it. I can\'t promise that you will like Bokurano, but I can promise that I will tell you why I like it in the hopes that you will find out if you will enjoy it like I did.Bokurano is about 15 teenagers who are tricked into piloting a massive mecha to defend Earth against other massive mecha who are attacking for an unknown purpose. Each of these kids has their own reason for fighting, these reasons are very personal and most are not caught up in the idea of protecting humanity. The series is structured around arcs of one or two episodes focused on each of the pilots. In each case, we see the life of the character in question, their families and people around them, why they seem beaten down and driven into a corner, and finally, why they choose to fight the attacking mecha.I see Bokurano as the ultimate ""feel-bad"" anime. There are very few happy or funny moments. Each heartwarming moment turns to sorrow within 10 minutes and many of these moments are intertwined with suffering. Gutwrenching events occur almost every episode and I often found myself wanted to go sit in a corner after watching. I would not recommend seeing Bokurano as an anime similar to CLANNAD or Steins;Gate. These anime begin with humor, happiness, and charm to introduce you to the characters and then put them through hell in the pattern of what TVTropes has called Cereberus Syndrome. Bokurano does not take any time trying to win you over with hints of a happy series. By the end of the second episode, it is clear that things will not go well for our heroes and heroines. The fights are never shown as something cool or fun and aren\'t even that interesting to watch. A minor amount of strategy in these fights is discussed, but it\'s not a big focus of the series. The battles bring the kids together and connect them to each other, but are primarily used as a plot device to keep things moving.You may have already noticed that Bokurano seems very similar to a much more famous anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion (abbreviated NGE). NGE seems to have been a major inspiration for Bokurano and both anime have significant similarities. Indeed, I find it pretty hard to discuss Bokurano without comparing and contrasting it with NGE so I\'ll get that done here. Both NGE and Bokurano go heavily into the implications of using emotionally unstable teenagers as the first and only line of defense against mysterious, eldrich beings who attack and fight for apparently no reason. Neither anime is particularly happy or uplifting and the protagonists in both can seem distant and hard to get along with throughout the series. The mission control and support for the children piloting the mecha is very limited and the pilots commonly feel like no one in the world is there for them. The most obvious antagonist in both series is the one driving the protagonists to keep fighting (Gendo Ikari and Dung Beetle for NGE and Bokurano, respectively). Be aware, however, that there are major differences as well. NGE is not solely about the suffering of its protagonists. It heavily uses Judeo-Christian naming and symbolism and the battles against the Angels can be interesting and cool at times. NGE also heavily goes into Freudian psychology and often has a highbrow, even pretentious feel to it at times. Bokurano has none of these things. Bokurano\'s sole focus is to rip into the Humongous Mecha genre and show why it is not fun, cool, interesting, or a good idea to enlist young, emotionally unstable children as the soldiers against enemies who threaten our species. I personally feel that if you like one of these anime, you will like the other, but I know many NGE lovers who did not enjoy Bokurano as all, so please be aware of the differences between these series if you came from NGE looking for something similar.Bokurano uses much less symbolism than NGE, but there is one major symbol I would like to comment on: chairs. Each of the chosen pilots has a chair they are transported into the robot with. The significance of these chairs differs for each of the pilots, but each one relates to their dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their life. A sadistic, socially Darwinistic boy is associated with his father\'s office chair. His father is a nasty caricature of a heartless businessman who seeks to profit off the destruction of the battles occuring throughout Japan. Another boy has a floor cushion, used as a symbol of his family\'s poverty and the troubles he goes through in order to support his siblings who were all abandoned by their parents. A girl brings a piano bench; her parents love to hear her play, but she doesn\'t particularly enjoy it. All of these chairs provide insight into the protagonists and their lives and each helps the viewer understand them better and to emotionally connect with these characters. I think the use of chairs was done extremely well by the series and is used to great effect to demonstrate how each of the protagonists is both and different from all the others.Now that I have finished my initial discussion and analysis of Bokurano, I am going to discuss each of the official ratings MAL gives its reviewers to rate anime. If you have read this far, you likely still have some interest in Bokurano and I will attempt to use this section to help you make a final decision of whether to watch it or not:Story: Bokurano has the saddest story of any anime I have seen at the time of writing this. The characters all go through hell and get very little for their troubles. There are so few happy moments that the most common criticism I see of Bokurano is that the viewer can become apathetic to the trauma suffered by the characters due to the mostly uninterrupted melancholy of the series. I personally did not have this happen to me, but I can easily understand why others say this. Note that Bokurano is also very dependant on surprising plot twists and does not hesitate to make its cast miserable for the sake of the plot. If anime are to be classified as plot-driven or character-driven, Bokurano is definitely plot-driven. Overall, I give the story 8/10 for its capacity to be touching, but it probably could have used some contrast.Animation: The animation in Bokurano is not particularly eye-catching or attention-grabbing, but I feel that a bright, colorful animation style would be out of place. The characters are all animated realistically except for Dung Beetle whose slightly cute appearance is contrasted with his sadistic behavior. I really like that Bokurano avoids the animation caricatures that anime often slips into such as huge eyes, brightly colored hair, and flamboyant outfits. The overall gray tint to the show adds to the gray mood of the story. Because the animation fits the theme, but isn\'t particulary remarkable, I give it 9/10.Sound: Bokurano opens with one my favorite anime OPs of all time, Uninstall by Ishikawa Chiaki. I absolutely love this song and still play it regularly while driving or working. In fact, the tagline for this review is a line from the OP. Be sure to look at the lyrics as they describe a lot of the general feeling of the series. Both endings to Bokurano, Little Bird and Vermillion (by the same artist), are much less interesting, but still are good to listen to and capture the feel of the series well. The voice acting and background music didn\'t particularly get my attention as it is neither very good nor very bad. I personally think that this works out well overall when the sound doesn\'t distract from the atmosphere and Bokurano isn\'t a series where much would be gained from music and voices grabbing one\'s attention. Mostly due to Uninstall, I give the sound 10/10.Characters: Bokurano has a very large character list. 15 children pilot the robot. In addition to them, Dung Beetle and various government officials make regular appearances. Add all these up and we get a series with at least 18 main characters (and arguments can be made for others). As a result of this huge cast in a 24 episode series, characterization is somewhat limited. While each character changes throughout his or her arc, there really is only time to designate one major change. Series with so many important characters also run the risk of not showing much of their cast besides the designated protagonists, but Bokurano averts this nicely and makes each of them essential to the progression of the story. Everyone changes and develops and I found myself sympathizing with each of the protagonists, something that is quite rare with such a large number! This rating might get me some hate, but I give the characters 10/10.Enjoyment: It\'s always hard for me to describe enjoyment for a series that really isn\'t fun. I would be lying if I said that Bokurano was a blast. It made me cry repeatedly and I felt rather like a dung beetle after every episode.

If anyone has suggestions for making this review better, please let me know in a message! Thanks for reading!Acknowledgment: I took the idea for opening my review with a quote from Uninstall from Aeterna\'s review of Bokurano. Thanks!', 'I like to start off by saying that, yes, I have rated this a perfect ten score but I have a reason for doing so other than the fact that I do have special favor for this anime. I did try to be as fair as I can on the rating, but I do want to note the reason for a perfect score, which I think everyone deserves to know why. I really think that this anime accomplished exactly what it\'s purpose was. Many people that I have heard talk about Bokurano in the past in a negative way feel it is trying to be...like Evangelion or some other mecha animes with kid pilots in giant robots. So I\'m going to elaborate on exactly what I think this did well and what made it unique.First off, this story, to me, was very well executed. The first episode builds interest while at the same time giving you a little bit of insight on the characters, and actually, if you pay enough attention, are a foreshadowing into the future of this anime. They really give very good hints of what the characters are like, these small hints really help you understand why the characters react certain ways later on in the story. As for the characters themselves they are very different, very unique, in a matter of fact their personalities are almost polarized. Several times when watching this anime I have seen the characters act in smalls way, doing small things, small nuances about their personality reminding me about how I would react to certain situations. They are all deep, 3-dimensional characters, but their action reflect what\'s on the inside AMAZINGLY well. Expounding on the characters in the aspect of how they are drawn, Mohiro Kitoh has a very simplistic, a very normal, average way of portraying the characters. No one has any strangely colored hair, no one\'s body shape is over exaggerated, no one is too cool, too strong, or too smart, they\'re all drawn and written in a way you can relate to. You don\'t look down on them as being less than you, but rather as equals. Mohiro Kitoh is also very good at expressions. In his original manga every character on the screen has a very unique expression that is true to the person who is expressing it and I feel that this was translated very well into the anime. There is one particular scene where all the characters are together during a very emotional time. The camera pans across the screen showing every characters expression. Just looking at each of their faces you can almost read their minds in that very moment by the way that they are expressing themselves. Even with more than one person on the screen, every character has a very unique expression which is drawn very in a very detailed way.Another thing that many people have complained about in the past about Bokurano is the art being “sub par”. I, for my part, believe the art accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. You also have to realize that this anime was made in 2007, as well as the fact the art isn\'t meant to be so beautiful, so attractive, that the art distracts from the characters and story. To me the art style was drawn exactly the way it was on purpose. Everything is just normal, when it comes down to it, through the eyes of the characters the world isn\'t a very beautiful place anyway, at least not most of the time, so why should the background be drawn any differently? The way art was drawn really reflected the story in a very realistic way in my opinion.Just like the arts the music sets the mood very well. The music was soft, warm and reminiscent, almost like a dream or a memory. It\'s warm, yet gloomy, and it\'s sole purpose was to set the mood. NOT to stand out. How can I say the Music deserved a ten? One of the ways I find best to see how effective a soundtrack is, is to watch the anime, download the OST and then listen to it from track one to the last track. How quick does it set the mood? How quick does images of the anime flood your mind? With Bokurano, the soundtrack is absolutely inspirational to me. With anime OSTs that are  cool, epic, or just good from a musical standpoint, not all of them recall memories from that anime as vividly as the Bokurano OST did for me. Each track is distinct and simple enough to tell you without words, what each song represents in the anime. Images, places, characters are instantly brought back to mind when listening to this.Now I have saved my thoughts for the story and enjoyment last, because these are the most controversial. If you have seen Bokurano, you know that the story is not a happy, frolicy, joyful one. Bokurano really addresses several problematic issues about individuals and society in general. I can\'t begin to name all of them. Some of the most poignant issues to me are child abuse, relationships between step family members and the effects of death, suffering and burdening responsibility on children. All of these topics are discussed in an honest non-graphic way, which I love. There are 14 different children as well as several other main characters and support characters. The cast is quite large and yet no one gets lost in the background.  This anime is just so honest, so real... and one thing I want to get out of the way. This is not another Eva. I really don\'t think a child would react the way Shinji did, and the story of Eva, to me, wasn\'t really about Shinji but the Eva\'s. In Bokurano The robots are used as tools to teach you about people, real people, with realistic lives. These kids are not orphans or estranged kids clammering for the attention of their parents that are never there, trying to make a life with their giant mutant robots. They have families, GOALS, and things they are torn away from to serve a greater need. It\'s very easy to put yourself in the shoes of a Bokurano character, any angst developed in the story is so down  to earth you can really feel their pain. Bokurano is TECHNICALLY a slice-of-life but so was ""Star Driver"". Bokurano really is a drama, a character study even, and it may take several times watching it to  get everything out of it. Also, some people felt it was slow at  times and yes, I do believe that that is true, but if you find the characters interesting enough I believe you\'d want it to go even slower. When watching this I  was deeply intrigued with the characters and I read every word in the subtitles, sometimes even pausing and rewinding, contemplating how this adds to what the character is now. At times I wish it would have gone slower because there is so much to be learned. Even if the plot was slow at times it wasn\'t enough for me to even drop the story rating from a 10 to a 9.And finally, on the subject of enjoyment... I\'d rather use the term appreciation. Due to the dark, gloomy and doleful nature of this anime I can say en-JOY-ment, root word ""joy"" or happiness isn\'t appropriate. But after watching  this you will appreciate it and very likely come to appreciate many things. (To understand what I am talking about... watch it.)In conclusion, if you are not a fan of dark and gloomy, you will not like this, but if you appreciate good story telling, with wonderful character development, and characters who you can relate to, you\'ll like this if you have the patients. Despite the Mecha this is far more. like Evangelion or some other mecha animes with kid pilots in giant robots. So I\'m going to elaborate on exactly what I think this did well and what made it unique.First off, this story, to me, was very well executed.

Despite the Mecha this is far more.', 'Bokurano was recommended to me by another MAL member on the IRC channel, because I said I liked Clannad. According to him ""Bokurano is an instant feels trip from start"". Now, that I watched the series, I do understand where he is coming from, but I have to disagree with that. Here is why...If I had to summarize what Bokurano is, it\'s a mix between Neon Genesis: Evangelion and Gantz, sans blood. The story follows 15 high-school students, who are tricked into piloting a giant mecha, fighting off periodically arriving enemies to save the world from certain doom. Now, as far as basic premise goes,...this is as simple and cliché\'d as it gets. But what sets Bokurano apart from all the tons upon tons of mecha anime is the tone and the underlying story behind the mask, full of symbolism and metaphors.See, Bokurano is built entirely upon the ""Reluctant Hero"" trope. The 15 kids never asked to be the saviors of humanity, they never wanted to fight or bear the enormous responsibility, having the destiny of the entire world resting upon their shoulders. (This is why I mentioned NGE up there.) They were all tricked/forced into this situation, and from then on it\'s ""do or die"", there is no going back. But unlike many other similar anime, this is NOT a heartwarming coming-of-age story, not in the slightest. The 15 kids didn\'t know each other beforehand, they kind of only just met. And now each of them faces the same predicament of having to fight to save the world with a bunch of (almost) complete strangers. (Hence the mention of Gantz.) Unlike other mecha anime, and the case of Shinji from NGE, these kids are NOT a team. They are but a bunch of confused and terrified children, who want nothing to do with the whole thing. They fight, but not because of some lofty goals of justice, valor, heroism, or because ""it\'s the right thing to do"". No, they fight because...what\'s the alternative? Let it all just end? They don\'t even try to be heroes, Bokurano tears down the pretentious, overblown morals of other such anime, and replaces it all with true grit, the feelings of how a real human must feel when thrown in that situation. These kids never really come to terms with what is demanded of them, they each have to muster some kind of reason to fight. Some personal reason to fight for a world they barely even had the chance to experience.There is a resaon I haven\'t mentioned the ""big mecha battles"" yet, because those are but a tiny piece of the whole story. Bokurano is NOT about mecha battles, but the people involved. So, if you came for that, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. It\'s almost entirely a character driven piece, where the mecha fights are nothing but backdrop, without any flashy ""attacks"" or ""moves"", only a means to an end. Don\'t get me wrong, Zearth and the other mechas look fantastic and full of symbolism, but they are only there for show, this tale is not about them. The story itself is very slow-paced and structured like a Lego house. Each episode follows a single kid\'s story. As we progress through the series, we get to know the 15 kids, their backstories and their personal battles in their lives. Broken and dysfunctional families, child neglect, bullying, tarnished friendships, hard life choices and a LOT of anger, fear, angst, regret and ""could\'ve/should\'ve/would\'ve"". The drama is real, and mostly well written, but it\'s really nothing to cry on or get a feels trip about, unless some of the kids\' stories hit a little bit close to home. It is very diverse and has many thing going on at any given time, but sometimes the scenes just drag on too long with unnecessary exposition and side-arcs that ultimately lead to nowhere, and it sometimes makes the whole thing confusing. I guess the creators bit off just a bit more than they could chew. I feel having so many central characters in a regular length (24 episode) anime is just a bit too much. There are too many to really flesh them out individually and because of that I couldn\'t really get invested in any of them.The animation quality is okay, and I particularly liked the character designs and the art direction. The visuals are well suited for the subject matter, there are no bright colors, flashy special effects or comical cuts and trasitions. This is a very down-to-Earth anime in this respect, discounting the futuristic setting and the obvious giant mechas. There is also an absolute abundance of symbolism and visual metaphors for the keen-eyed, a really good addition that complements the story in various ways. Well done!A special mention goes to the music, especially the opening song, ""Uninstall"" from Chiaki Ishikawa. The very second I heard the song I fell in love with it. Such a beautiful song, beautiful voice, and the whole tone and the lyrics suit the anime so well, it\'s simply perfect.In conclusion, Bokurano is a pretty unique piece of anime. It\'s a little tamer in tone than NGE or Gantz, but exactly that\'s why it\'s so powerful. It doesn\'t need the shock value, graphic and psychological brutality and gallons of blood and tears to get it\'s message across. The devil is in the details. Make no mistake, Bokurano is a pretty dreary anime with lots of emotion, and if the belt catches you, you will go on a feels trip. It really all depends if you can connect with the characters and the source material or not. There is also a lot of symbolism, both in the narrative and in the visuals (and the title itself), so the literately and visually inclined will have a field day with this anime for sure. this is as simple and cliché\'d as it gets.

It\'s almost entirely a character driven piece, where the mecha fights are nothing but backdrop, without any flashy ""attacks"" or ""moves"", only a means to an end. Don\'t get me wrong, Zearth and the other mechas look fantastic and full of symbolism, but they are only there for show, this tale is not about them. The story itself is very slow-paced and structured like a Lego house. Each episode follows a single kid\'s story. As we progress through the series, we get to know the 15 kids, their backstories and their personal battles in their lives. Broken and dysfunctional families, child neglect, bullying, tarnished friendships, hard life choices and a LOT of anger, fear, angst, regret and ""could\'ve/should\'ve/would\'ve"". The drama is real, and mostly well written, but it\'s really nothing to cry on or get a feels trip about, unless some of the kids\' stories hit a little bit close to home. It is very diverse and has many thing going on at any given time, but sometimes the scenes just drag on too long with unnecessary exposition and side-arcs that ultimately lead to nowhere, and it sometimes makes the whole thing confusing. I guess the creators bit off just a bit more than they could chew. I feel having so many central characters in a regular length (24 episode) anime is just a bit too much. There are too many to really flesh them out individually and because of that I couldn\'t really get invested in any of them.The animation quality is okay, and I particularly liked the character designs and the art direction. The visuals are well suited for the subject matter, there are no bright colors, flashy special effects or comical cuts and trasitions. This is a very down-to-Earth anime in this respect, discounting the futuristic setting and the obvious giant mechas. There is also an absolute abundance of symbolism and visual metaphors for the keen-eyed, a really good addition that complements the story in various ways. Well done!A special mention goes to the music, especially the opening song, ""Uninstall"" from Chiaki Ishikawa. The very second I heard the song I fell in love with it. Such a beautiful song, beautiful voice, and the whole tone and the lyrics suit the anime so well, it\'s simply perfect.In conclusion, Bokurano is a pretty unique piece of anime. It\'s a little tamer in tone than NGE or Gantz, but exactly that\'s why it\'s so powerful. It doesn\'t need the shock value, graphic and psychological brutality and gallons of blood and tears to get it\'s message across. The devil is in the details. Make no mistake, Bokurano is a pretty dreary anime with lots of emotion, and if the belt catches you, you will go on a feels trip. It really all depends if you can connect with the characters and the source material or not. There is also a lot of symbolism, both in the narrative and in the visuals (and the title itself), so the literately and visually inclined will have a field day with this anime for sure.', ""Well i thought a lot before picking up Bokurano.I don't quite remember why, but i did have some doubts about it.I feared it would turn out just your everyday crappy mecha.And the previews of the story line suggested so.Anyway in one boring afternoon i decided to try out the anime.It tunred out very good.Way beyond my expectations.The story goes on and unravels into something that you haven't quite expected,becomes really interesting and complicated.The Art, well, what can i say about it.Some people find it quite ugly while others like it.As for me,it didn't bother a bit.It's true that sometimes the 3D can get under...your skin, and that sometimes the art gets rather simple.But at the other end, sometimes the art is really helping you get into the &quot;flow of emotions&quot; if i may say so.As for sound.Sound was so-so.It was there when you needed it and it wasn't sort of in the way.The opening was very nice.I personaly enjoyed it a lot.Pretty nice song.The two endings were nice both in visual and audio aspect.Characters.This is where the series excels.At the start i thought that 15 characters would be too much of a number for 24 eps.I feared that the characters wouldn't  be fully developed.All my fears were put to waste.Each and every one of the kids is so unique and different from the other.Each with it's own problems and toubles.And yet all of them bound by the same thing.Enjoyment.Hmm what can i say i enjoyed it.Hope you do too.Overall I'll give it an 8 because of the sound and art.And if you're looking for your everyday mecha,this is NOT for you.If you want to see how people interact with each other in interesting situations and you want to see how kids can feel and act in their darkest hour, this is the anime for you. your skin, and that sometimes the art gets rather simple.But at the other end, sometimes the art is really helping you get into the &quot;flow of emotions&quot; if i may say so.As for sound.Sound was so-so.It was there when you needed it and it wasn't sort of in the way.The opening was very nice.I personaly enjoyed it a lot.Pretty nice song.The two endings were nice both in visual and audio aspect.Characters.This is where the series excels.At the start i thought that 15 characters would be too much of a number for 24 eps.I feared that the characters wouldn't  be fully developed.All my fears were put to waste.Each and every one of the kids is so unique and different from the other.Each with it's own problems and toubles.And yet all of them bound by the same thing.Enjoyment.Hmm what can i say i enjoyed it.Hope you do too.Overall I'll give it an 8 because of the sound and art.And if you're looking for your everyday mecha,this is NOT for you.If you want to see how people interact with each other in interesting situations and you want to see how kids can feel and act in their darkest hour, this is the anime for you."", ""I wanted to watch a MECHA anime and saw this one, Bokurano, had very good reviews. Without spoiling anything, this anime is NOT ABOUT mechas.The CGI is badly implemented and stands out in a terrible way. The characters are poorly drawn too and the animation... Oh my...The one thing you should know is every episode more or less, ends with a mecha fight. But there's NO SATISFACTION. 90% of an episode is about the character's life and drama and it literally cuts / jumbs into the mecha fight which lasts 1min.The whole show is depressing from beginning to end. Would not recommend at all. "", ""I‘d like to start this review with this first thought.Gonzo fucks up everything.Now that this is out of the way let me explain why and how I mean it.Bokurano isn‘t a bad anime don‘t get my wrong. I just feel it could have been a better one, when done by a different studio and different budget.But I will cover this whole issue in the single segments of this review.Also note, this review will most likely contain minor spoilers, so please don‘t read it if you don‘t wanna get spoiled anything, even if it's just slight...ones.This is due to my comparison with the manga (but only superficial I don't mention any characters and what happens to them, just themes and some emotions that might come across)All I can say to you is, watch this show it‘s good, but bad presented.And now let‘s review this show:Starting with the worst first and then we gradually go to the better things about this show.AnimationLets establish what animation even means. It‘s not just moving pictures, it‘s also art and quality how it is presented.Some of you who know about Gonzo might have heard about it, but Gonzo likes to mix some bad CGI into their drawn shows, and Bokurano is a good example for this bad habit. I even go so far and say that the animation is almost non existent for the most important parts of a semi-mecha show but was replaced by boring CGI robo-fights.It looks so awkward to see 2 giant CGI robots fight slowly against each other, and is by far the most boring shit in the entire show.But when there is no CGI it doesn‘t shine either. Crooked faces, movements, quality loss. You name it. It‘s all there. Basically the show looks like it was made in the early 2000s or even late 90s.And it is especially sad when a show like Neon Genesis Evangellion from 1996 looks better than this show made in 2007! 10 years later and a show manages to do not even a half as good job in animating it as something else.Why are the Evas animated in NGE but ZEarth is not in Bokurano, and was replaced by some shitty CGI model?Despite that it doesn‘t offer anything else in return, no memorable, or especially well done moments, no great artstyle or amazing quality. The backgrounds look generic and forgettable, and the character designs (though very close to their original Manga version) are bland and forgettable.My verdict: 1,5/10 (I give it a 2/10 out of mercy)SoundMoving on from the bad animation, the sound-department did a quite well job.Starting off with the OP „Uninstall“ by Chiaki Ishikawa is by far the best piece of music this show has to offer. It‘s gloomy, melancholic and has a bit of a childish touch to it. It fits the show very well, the lyrics as well. I loved to listen to the song before very episode and never got bored of it.The EDs were good as well but couldn‘t hook me like the OP did.The rest of the OST fit well but wasn‘t outstanding. Decent tough but not worth mentionable or a good reason to get your hands on the OST.The voiceacting ranged from average to awkward at moments. The most outstanding job in my opinion did Akira Ishida, who voice Koemushi. Who did an infinite amount of rolls already, but to be honest I‘m not too familiar with his works.My verdict: 5,5/10 (rounded up to 6/10 because of it‘s overall fitting nature to the show)Overall the presentation of this show is lacking and could have done (and should have been!) better. A different studio (like Madhouse, Sunrise or even Gainax) could have made a better job (maybe) with some other people in the staff.Moving on to the content...StoryMohiro Kitoh, the original creator of the Manga Bokurano (ours) has some sort of weird fetish for shows with dark themes and children.He seems to be obsessed with themes like, death, suicide, rape, depression and apocalypse.Those are the themes presented in Bokurano. And not by adults, no by children. To be exact 13 year old middleschoolers.At first the concept might sound overused. A cast of teenagers/children ride a gigantic Robot to save the world against invaders. But after finishing the show, it wasn‘t really about that but more about the implications of death and sacrifice.Would you give your life for the world? Do you even think it is worth protecting? These concepts are in the spotlight and each of the 15 children reacts differently with these implications.It all start out as a game but becomes all serious right in EP2. And this is where this show shines. Tension, cliffhangers, and bit of pieces of information that are feed to you.There is every time something new that gets revealed and that is what gets you hooked.So many questions so little answers, but it all (?) makes sense in the end.It never feels boring (unless there is a shitty CGI fight but those never really drag on too long) and gets you truly involved with everything.Hiroyuki Morita (who didn‘t really direct anything besides The Cat Returns by Ghibli) did a great job here.Something else that is noticeable is the difference to the Manga. I have only read parts of it but the chronological order is very different in the anime, as well as some events and the behavior of characters are different. And I feel the anime might even be superior (even though the manga looks pretty good!). I will certainly read the manga and find out what is really different.It‘s a thrilling experience and goes to all sorts of emotions. Laughter (though little), Anger (a lot of hate towards some characters),  Sadness (some tears poured out) and also a sort of emptiness at some point.My Conclusion: 8,5/10 (rounding up to 9/10 for being a great show in regards to story)CharactersThe other strong points of this show were the characters.Though most of them not really relatable or likable in the beginning, become later much more interesting and even relatable.The show follows the LOST formula.What does that mean?Well if you‘ve seen Lost you might now what I mean, if now let me explain.Take a bunch of different people and throw them into a mysterious dangerous situation. And then show everyone backstory as they progress to the story, while building up a desired emotion for each given character.All of them have some sort of a dramatic or interesting background story. Some more dramatic than others but all are kinda dramatic.But in the end everyone is kinda interesting and different.Some characters change from unlikable to likable, while others make you wanna hate them even more, and then there are those you feel very sorry for. It tries to be realistic and not just makes you wanna love each one of them, or only hate the villain.And as I said, some stories brought me to tears while other let me scream at the screen „DIE DIE YOU PIECE OF SHIT!“.My Conclusion:  8/10The last segments talks about the Values and my overall enjoyment of the show, as well as my final Verdict.ValueThe show sure got me thinking, and now I even want to read a Manga. Me who doesn‘t read manga at all! (almost non)It‘s a remarkable anime and one of those shows that will leave a mark in my mind that will let me remember it.Though it didn‘t do anything groundbreaking, it sure is one of those shows that are talked about when you look for something mature, dark and sad.6/10EnjoymentAs Mentioned, my enjoyment almost only came from the Content of the show and not its presentation.A good show doesn‘t need good presentation, while a bad show with good presentation will still be a bad show, is the saying.But I disagree.Anime is anime because it‘s animated. If the animation sucks I feel as if it‘s a wasted medium and would have been better only as a manga or something else.It offered some visual pleasing moments but it overall was crap from a presentation side of view and that lowered my overall enjoyment quite a bit.That said the story, characters and overall experience was very much enjoyable and that‘s why I recommend everyone to watch it and bare with the shitty CGI and sometimes sloppy animation quality. The Manga is different and will not offer you the same experience as the Anime does.6/10My final verdict:Bokurano was a show that ended up being better than expected, had me gripped for 24 episodes and was a themepark of many emotions, though all mostly on the sad spectrum.It‘s something that makes you question motivation for your actions and your reason why you live.It‘s not an outstanding anime, but a very good story, so watch it with that in mind.6/10 Fair ones.This is due to my comparison with the manga (but only superficial I don't mention any characters and what happens to them, just themes and some emotions that might come across)All I can say to you is, watch this show it‘s good, but bad presented.And now let‘s review this show:Starting with the worst first and then we gradually go to the better things about this show.AnimationLets establish what animation even means.

Natural selection of parallel universes, this doesnt make any sense in any possible universe. Dont get me wrong, Im not mad because it doesnt make sense, Im mad at the constructed nonsense of this anime. Given the fact there are several parallel universes - How does them competing make any sense? It doesn\'t, like at all. Why can the creators of this system only leech ""energy"" from a world that wins 15 robot fights? No reason. In a world where there ARE parallel universes, wouldnt...there only arise even more universes? I.e. the ones that died in the first fight, the ones that died in the fourth fight etc.The dramaturgy doesnt work for me, we see a portrait of every kid for 20 minutes, then it dies. Too many times. What remains are shallow characters, boring predictable repetitions.This anime will bore people who arent easily influenced by tragic music and pretentious depth weaved through far fetching words. Overall its a rather expensively produced anime, but how can this fix this boring, stupid crap?Also awfullness-bonus points for the consant light hearted depiction of child abuse ( not only with kana and her brother but that one episode where one of the kids being beaten by her dad is used as a running gag).Avoid. there only arise even more universes?

The guy who makes these things, mangaka Kitou Mohiro, has a thing for shock value around children abuse. Narutaru was “Let’s have kids being tortured and miserable, with Pokemon flavor”, Bokurano is “Let’s have kids being tortured and miserable, with huge robots flavor”. It used to be a big deal at the time, until many other similar anime came out (Madoka Magica, Rainbow, Made in Abyss, Re:Zero) and made those shows to feel far less special. The sadistic pleasure many anime fans get from such anime though didn’t go away and to this day we get the same excuses of a...show being realistic or deep or mature because it tortures endlessly its characters.Anyways, you are not going to watch this anime for its animation, since it was made by the most lame Studio GONZO, and directed by someone who hated the source material and wanted to have his own twist. It was a disaster waiting to happen. WHO THE HELL GIVES PEOPLE TO DIRECT A SHOW THEY HATE? I’ll tell you who, GONZO does. They did their best to mutate the true meaning of the original manga as best as they could and to make the whole show as pathetic as possible. And yet a lot of people still liked it. There’s your maturity!Anyways, you are not going to watch this anime for its plot, because it sucks ass. Kids pilot mecha to save the world, yuppie duppie doo, where have I heard that one before. It has the twist of kids dying when they use the mecha which leads to the whole misery motif so many like. It’s basically “Wow, I will be dead soon; how will I spend my last hours alive?” That aside the plot is slow and stupid. So you can pretty much screw the whole battle for the salvation of Earth. Although losing the battle automatically means that Earth will blow up, it’s not really the point at all. You can take out the robots and the salvation of Earth and it will make almost no difference. The story could easily be remade to be the last moments of children with terminal diseases. The robot battles are flashy extras that offer little to the actual plot, which is non-stop suffering. Having negative consequences is not the same as having convenient moments of tragedy, since they are so extreme to the point they don’t differ from any other classic mecha show where the good guys always win and all the buildings get fixed in a few days. It’s why whenever a civilian is killed, he will conveniently be a relative of the kid currently piloting the robot.What ultimately ruins the premise is the simple fact that for most of the show the children will have no control over what is going on. They were tricked into a situation they didn’t know it had negatives and then they are expected to die one after the other for the greater good without again be able to do anything about it. Yes, if they disagree the world will be destroyed and all, but tricking the saviors into giving up their lives is not heroic at all. It’s evil. There is no way in hell I will describe the main characters as “realistic and sympathetic” as so many called them. They are typical kids with no control over what happens. I don’t want to be like them, they don’t inspire me, they are not heroic, and nobody with a healthy mind would want to be in their shoes. The only thing people remember about them is the tragic situation they are in, they don’t actually care about them as characters. If you don’t believe me, ask them if they can even remember how they are called. I bet you 90% of them won’t be able to mention a single name without looking it up. Also the director didn’t like the manga ending and changed it to a happy one, so all manga readers hated the anime for ruining the premise.Also, I need to repeat that the mangaka really loves to torture children in more than one ways. As if being chosen to die ain’t enough he also makes sure their parents are assholes, their house gets burned, their girlfriends cheat on them, and someone kicks their puppy. All at the same time. I fail to see the realism so many are yapping about. It’s as miseryporn as it gets. Being miserable does not make something realistic, much less better than cheery series. It only means the watcher finds pleasure in the most overblown, impossible to believe, ludicrous things, as well as in the suffering of innocent people.

Take that as you will.', 'So, what would you do if tasked with saving the world?  That’s the question each one of the fifteen middle school children are forced to answer after having been bound to a contract.  At first, they just believe it to be some computer game created by a man named Kokopelli that they encounter.  But, by the time the first episode ends, we, along with the fifteen children, realize that something far more sinister is at play.Bokurano starts out incredibly well.  The pacing is excellent, the hints and foreshadowing are all expertly woven to induce a sense of dread to the audience...and the children.  This is not a happy show.  It explores the psyche of each one of the children, their pasts, and how they deal with adversity, all before they are required to fight the next alien invader.Now, some of the issues I have, or issue, is that the stories of the first half or so of the children are more interesting than the rest.  They delve into some complex moral and psychological issues that many mediums tend to ignore or gleam over.  I won’t go into too much detail on exactly what the situations are, but they are definitely horrifying.  This leads to the first half or 2/3 of Bokurano being more interesting than the last third, which is a shame, but doesn’t discount the incredibly addictive nature of this show.I tend to put a lot of emphasis on shows with what I consider great endings.  I want the last episode to be one of the best in the entire series.  Sadly, that leaves me weighing a little too much on the ending and not giving enough credit to what came before it.  Not always, but it’s something I’ve realized. Bokurano is a strong show that explores a vast amount of psychological topics, I only wish that the final stretch was where the stronger episodes lied.  Still, the show offers an interesting look at how each one of the children react to their past, their present, and what they want for the future without being over-dramatic or apathetic.  A great show that was slightly let down by it’s final stretch.  Still, I’d easily recommend this anime to anyone looking for a melancholic, yet entertaining and addictive ride through the ups and downs of these tragically flawed adolescents on a grand scale.Verdict:8.5/10 and the children.  This is not a happy show.  It explores the psyche of each one of the children, their pasts, and how they deal with adversity, all before they are required to fight the next alien invader.Now, some of the issues I have, or issue, is that the stories of the first half or so of the children are more interesting than the rest.  They delve into some complex moral and psychological issues that many mediums tend to ignore or gleam over.  I won’t go into too much detail on exactly what the situations are, but they are definitely horrifying.  This leads to the first half or 2/3 of Bokurano being more interesting than the last third, which is a shame, but doesn’t discount the incredibly addictive nature of this show.I tend to put a lot of emphasis on shows with what I consider great endings.

It is not something you expect from a show about kids. It is well writen and almost scary. At the same time the author managed to draw me in with the sick story line. I found myself both appaled and atracted. He managed to take an old time dream of many children and twist it into a dark sinister thing. If you are looking for a good story to make you happy this is not it, but if you are looking for a deap story that makes you think than...this is one you should watch. this is one you should watch.', 'Spoiler free.I found this show by browsing through related anime of my favorite shows, and I\'m so glad that I did.Bokurano follows the events of a group of children who have inadvertently been thrown into a large scale event, thinking it was just a small game.  From there, they have to fight to secure the safety of everything they know.  About now, I imagine some of you are yawning.  Something like this is seen in so many different shows, and the concern I had was it was going to be another show just like that.  I was surprised to...find that wasn\'t the case.Bokurano had no problems with kicking off immediately.  I thought there were going to be a few primer episodes, but if I recall correctly, you\'re being introduced to the main plot point in the first episode.  This can either succeed or fail, in Bokurano\'s case, it didn\'t really do either, it\'s just how it was.  Another interesting thing Bokurano did well was not introducing the children alltogether.  For reasons I won\'t get into, their back story is introduced individually throughout the show, and I thought this was fantastic.  Everyone had their time in the light, and it\'s hard to pin down just who the main character really is.  After finishing it, you could argue who it was, but the point is I don\'t feel like it matters so much.  With that said, I really enjoyed how the characters were developed, if not for just a short while.Another interesting thing was the fight scenes were slow paced, and ended abruptly.  Half the episode wasn\'t spent sequencing robots hitting each other.  A couple of them were fast paced based on the pilot\'s ability, but generally, you could feel the weight of each machine.  This is another thing that could have bothered me if the show hadn\'t been able to pull it off so well.  I was actually more interested in the story than I was watching a couple hunks of metal hit each other.  That isn\'t to say it didn\'t have its great moments, in fact, it kind of presented a nice build up to the last fight, which was really good.This show is relatively older, so it doesn\'t look as \'clean\' as some of the newer shows.  I guess people care about that, but even with that aside, the overall design of the show was really great.  Some of the mechs had awesome designs, and I really enjoyed each of the environments presented.  I couldn\'t say this show was visually lacking at all.The only complaint I might have is I would have liked there to be a couple more episodes that really emphasized on the gravity of the overall situation.  As with any show, there\'s a point where you realize things aren\'t so black and white, and something larger is presented to you.  Bokurano had a nice set up, but unfortunately didn\'t have a lot of time to go deeper into what was going on behind the scenes.  I wouldn\'t say it\'s a huge downside, considering it was mostly just focusing on the story of the characters, but even so, I was really interested in the large picture.  But I suppose that\'s what the manga is for, right?Lastly, the music.  The music playing throughout the show was really good, but the main theme is amazing.  Few anime out there have a really good opening song, and I\'m overjoyed whenever I find a good one.In the end, this show is still kind of ""just another robot show"" in a small way.  I feel like some things could have been explored, but overall I\'m happy with how it played out.  It wasn\'t really a leader in terms of doing things differently, but even so, I really enjoyed every moment of it.  If you haven\'t tuned in, you need to.  It\'s a humble reminder that sometimes things don\'t need to be revolutionary, and sometimes something so simple can turn out really great. find that wasn\'t the case.Bokurano had no problems with kicking off immediately.

At first everything seems to be going fine but by the end of episode 2 it's fallen into the depths of heartbreak and it only gets worse from there.One of the reasons I adore Bokurano with a passion is the characters.I can say for certain that I enjoyed every one of them. You really learned about all of their lives and that only served to make it all the more painful as the show went on. Many of them have...a reason for fighting that makes it even harder to bear the pain of what's happening to these kids. And there's a huge amount of character development for a particular character that left me in tears by the end of the show.Note that characters do die- no one is safe. At all. If you're looking for something positive then this is not a good pick, but I would venture to say it's inspiring.Another reason I love Bokurano is because it's exactly the kind of anime I'm into. Call me an emotional masochist but I love feeling pain as I watch characters I've come to love go through hardships and death. If that's the kind of thing you're into as well, then let me tell you this anime is absolutely perfect for you. It's so easy to get drawn into and the pain never ends, even at the very last few seconds of the show.I won't go into detail about the resolution, but it was excellent in my book. I didn't expect it in the least and it did leave me in tears.Overall, this has been one of the best shows I've seen. I strongly recommend it to anyone and I'm very happy to have stumbled across it. It's one of those things that you're not going to forget and that haunts you when you're trying to fall asleep at night. 10/10, amazing anime. a reason for fighting that makes it even harder to bear the pain of what's happening to these kids.

Please read further at your own risk.Judging by the anime cover, Bokurano may look like every mecha anime ever, with giant robots in action against monsters. But do not be deceived. In reality, it’s a whole different story.Story: 9/10During summer camp, a group of 15 kids search a mysterious cave and discover that there’s a working computer and accessories inside. They meet a guy who claims that he is a game developer and just finished making a game in which a giant robot has to fight huge monsters to save the earth. He persuades them to make a contract first...in order to play the game. After they finish up with the contract, they’re teleported inside the giant robot. One of them gets chosen as the captain who gets to control the robot, while others sit beside him/her and watch. After each win, the captain’s life energy is taken by the robot, so the captain dies. The story has very little focus on the mecha fights. The thing to shed light on was the backstories of each character. It was very well written and never got boring. Each character had his/her own unique story.In my opinion, the episode directing was 'meh' during 2 or 3 episodes. When they won the first fight and Takashi Waku (Pilot 1) died, his friends didn’t even react to it. I mean like literally, not a single shit was given. They just stood there and watched him fall off a dam.Animation: 7/10Sound: 7/10Not gonna emphasize on the animation and sound, as they were neither bad nor too good. They were just right.Character, judging by character likability: 7/10Let me put the spotlight on the two extreme sides of the cast.Hated Characters.Isao Kako (Captain #3): Rapist piece of shit. My second-most hated character of the series. He can go to hell. He was your typical “Why is all this happening to me only?” guy. Before piloting, he tried to rape Chizuru. He died before even getting a chance to pilot Zearth.Chizuru Honda (Captain #4): Too naive for her own good. She got banged by her teacher and he leaked the pictures on the internet. Kinda feel bad for her but at the same time I hate her a lot. It’s her own fault for trying to get too comfy with a teacher.Hiroyuki Hatagai (Chizuru’s Teacher): Where do I even start with this guy? I hate his guts, down to the very core. I wish Chizuru had killed him when she had the chance.Liked Characters.Mako Nakarai (Captain #6): She was an average girl. She fell short of money and tried to resort to prostitution. Lucky for her, she unknowingly met one of her mom’s friends as her first customer. It felt good he guided her to the right path. After that, he drove her to the bar where she met her mom and her friends. All of them were really kind to her and she learned her lesson. She ended up fighting hard to protect what needed to be protected: her mom and friends.Kunihiko Moji (Captain #7): His dying wish was for his heart to be donated to his friend, who had a heart disease. Good guy Moji.Yoko Machi (Captain #13): She was at her brother’s side in the beginning, but thank god she shot that bastard, +1 for her.Jun Ushiro (Captain #14): I hated him at first. He treated Kana very badly. But in the end, he does care for her and becomes the pilot instead of Kana.Kana Ushiro (Jun’s sister): Liked her for being able to put up with her brother’s shit.Extras.The remaining cast was also good, especially the backstory of Misumi.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 7/10It was interesting peeking into the backstories and lives of so many characters in a 24-episode anime.

It\'s just a shame that this anime isn\'t very popular, because it very certainly deserves it. Also, i\'m more of the shounen/beat the crap out of your opponent animes, and i absolutely HATE mecha/robot animes. I totally forgot about my hate for mecha animes as i was watching this.The anime is about 15 middle schoolers who are put into a disgustingly terrible situation. Before i saw this anime i was thinking ""What, 15 main characters? That\'s retarded."" Wow. I want to...stab my leg off just for thinking that.STORY: 10My god. Dude. The plot of this anime is just golden. You just love seeing how these guys react to being put into such an unimaginable position. And as soon as your feeling it\'s getting kind of repetitive, they put in some random twist that just has you going ""Woooooowww.""Art : 8I didn\'t know what to think about the art. Sometimes it looks unique and sometimes it looks really weird. I have to say most of the characters are pretty ugly.Sound : 9The sound is awesome. It really adds to the mood and makes whatever\'s going on seem a lot more sad/messed up.Character : 10Wow, dude. There are 15 main characters and 24 episodes. I was thinking ""Wow the characters must not be though out very well or something."" But despite this, all the character\'s personalities and even their true selves are perfectly thought out.Enjoyment : 10I loved this anime. I literally could not stop watching it. Honestly I have not been asleep for like 2 days now because i\'ve been up watching it. And i could not help but write this review.Overall : 10I would honestly like to meet the guy who would think this anime sucked. It is just so awesome. I totally recommend it. For me it is top anime of 09. stab my leg off just for thinking that.STORY: 10My god. Dude. The plot of this anime is just golden.

For me it is top anime of 09.', 'Bokurano: Ever heard of it? Neither did I. Bokurano was an anime that was never licensed by an American company, so we don’t have a dub, nor do we even have an official sub. This really saddens me, as Bokurano is a gem that unfortunately went under everybody’s radar.Want to know why Bokurano is so great? Continue reading to find out.-Story & Characters-The plot of Bokurano revolves around a group of 15 middle schoolers hanging out at a beach together. One of the children notices a hidden cavern and suggests that they go in. Bored with nothing else to do, the rest of the children...enter the cavern, but find a bunch of computers and machinery inside, and they meet an old man named Kokopelli, who tells them that he is designing a game, and he asks them to be the testers of it. The goal of the game is to ride a giant mech, destroy other mechs, and save the world. Thinking that this sounds like a cool idea, the children enter a “contract.” To the children’s surprise, they learn that this “game” is actually very real after witnessing a giant mech appear out of nowhere, later named “Zearth.” The children then board Zearth as they see yet another mech appear out of nowhere. Kokopelli is piloting Zearth and tells the children the rules of the game: Each of the 15 participants take turns piloting Zearth as each new enemy mech appears. However, things are never that simple in an anime: They later meet a mysterious floating creature called “Dung Beetle”, who acts as their guide throughout each battle, and they soon learn that Zearth operates by sucking up the life out of each pilot, resulting in their immediate death after each victory.When one of the children is dubbed the next pilot, we are shown a brief arc, learning about their backstories.  I really enjoyed these, as they were incredibly well-written. While this setup may sound formulaic (New pilot, backstory, battle, rinse and repeat), the show starts to throw in many unexpected plot twists and shockers, breaking the predictability of it all. Seriously, Bokurano has more plot twists than there are stars in the sky. What is Zearth? Who is Kokopelli? What is Dung Beetle? You’ll get your answers, and be stunned learning them. Bokurano’s story is excellent and interesting from start to finish, and once you get into it, you won’t be able to stop.Unfortunately, I can’t lavish the characters with the same praise. The main problem with the cast is that there are WAY too many of them. As previously stated, there are 15 children, and that’s only the main cast. We have tons of supporting characters, such as the relatives of the children, as well as Dung Beetle. None of the characters are bad in any way, as their backstories provide some much needed depth, and help us care about them, but the fact that there are so many of them makes it hard to remember a lot of them. But then we have Dung Beetle, one of the most evil bastards to have ever appeared in any anime. He insults the children, lies to them, keeps vital information from them, and I hated him with every fiber of my being, but I suppose that was the intent. It’s pretty clear that the show was more about the story itself and not the characters.As a whole, Bokurano’s story is intriguing throughout, and while the cast is not the best, they’re not bad, either. The story more than makes up for the cast, anyway.-Animation & Sound-The second I started this show, it was obvious that this had Gonzo written all over it. I have only ever seen three Gonzo animes: This, Solty Rei, and Welcome to the NHK. While Solty Rei looks fine, both Bokurano and NHK have very inconsistent visuals. Sometimes the animation is great, while other times, it plummets into the “Kill it with fire!” territory. The scenes where the animation dips in quality make it hard to take those particular scenes seriously.As for the character designs, they look good, but they’re rather simple in design. This can be both good and bad, depending on how you look at it. It’s good because it makes the characters look like real people, but some may consider it to be a bad thing, because no one really unique. Personally, I fall into the former camp, as I prefer them to look just like normal people. Gonzo also decided to direct the mech battles in CG, which look decent enough.As previously stated, there is no dub, so I can’t critique the voice work, simply because I don’t speak Japanese.Musically, Bokurano sports a solid soundtrack. While only a few songs stood out in my mind, every song matched the situations that they accompanied quite well. Again, comparing it to the other Gonzo animes that I’ve seen, I would say that the soundtrack is better than Solty Rei, but not as good as NHK. It’s a good soundtrack, but nothing to write home to mom about.-Conclusion-Bokurano is an anime that I wasn’t expecting much from. Needless to say, not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was blown away by how excellent this anime was, and it’s very depressing to know that a lot of people have never even heard of this anime. I would say that Bokurano is better than Solty Rei (Which I did like quite a bit), but tied with NHK as my favorite Gonzo anime.If you’re looking for a mech anime with a great story, then you’re doing yourself a disservice by not watching wonderful anime.

Bokurano is a hidden gem that everyone needs to watch.+Outstanding story+Well-written individual character arcs+Many plot twists+Epic mech battles+Decent soundtrack-Inconsistent visuals-Too many charactersFinal score:9/10', ""this is my first review, I went all the way and make this because i feel like more people should know about this show. please please please don't watch this show if you're here for the mecha. But if you're looking for a deep and powerful story you're in for an emotional ride. Bokurano dives deeper into real word problems that is uncomfortable and rarely talked upon. this made the show so realistic and original some stories here might be able to connect with some of you on a personal level. there are no plot armors and fancy magic/power that helps the main characters overcome...their problem. bokurano made me think a lot more about life and to appreciate it better. this show will inspire you and left you with thoughts on who you are, who are you trying to protect, and what do you want to accomplish in life. you will not have any fun watching this show it's gonna be hard to finish this show because it will mess with your emotions. it isn't the best anime of all time, but the story that it's trying to tell is certainly worth watching. I gave this a solid 9/10 because i do think there are some parts that could be better if it were to be elaborated more. However, knowing they have 15 characters and only 24 episodes it is obviously not enough to go in depth to every characters' story so overall they did an amazing job making this anime.PS daichi is my favorite character his backstory and actions DESTROYED me. their problem. bokurano made me think a lot more about life and to appreciate it better. this show will inspire you and left you with thoughts on who you are, who are you trying to protect, and what do you want to accomplish in life. you will not have any fun watching this show it's gonna be hard to finish this show because it will mess with your emotions. it isn't the best anime of all time, but the story that it's trying to tell is certainly worth watching.

Okay maybe it sounds a bit like NGE and they have something in common, but the concept is new. 15 Characters who are in a contract to save the earth with a big Mecha and offering something really big to save the earth. The characters are all written really nice, everyone has a back-story and so on everyone gets a development. They aren't focused on someone everyone gets pretty much screentime. It's a good tragedy with nice plot-twists.GIVE IT A TRY!!!!!Overall it's a 8/10 , imo. "", ""I didn't watch this anime because it was recommended to me, or because it was hyped and I had to see what all the opinions were about. Bokurano was a relatively unknown anime to me, not that I watch anime all that much. Oddly, the reason I watched it was because it was one of several that had been left on my hard drive.I have to admit -- it was the intro that hooked me first about this series. Sometimes, I'd keep watching the show just so that I could see the intro at the beginning. The intro itself is oddly inspiring, if not very...characteristic of the show's nihilistic viewpoints. More than that though, it's catchy.It's difficult to not spoil Bokurano, but the main reason to watch it is to figure out exactly what it is that you're watching. The plot starts out simple enough. I heard from a friend that it's very similar to Evangelion -- 15 children pilot a robot and try to stop new, enemy robots who appear and challenge them, blah blah.But Bokurano is not Evangelion. It isn't even remotely close to Evangelion, despite the similarities in the exposition.The mecha wasn't the reason for my watching this. I've never been a big fan of giant robots, or at least that's never been the main reason for me to watch an anime.Bokurano is psychological. At times, it can be depressing, and if you have a simple frame of mind, I wouldn't suggest watching it. In many ways, the show questions the meaning of life itself, though I can't spoil how exactly. It takes a bit of patience to watch, but the show rewards you for your resolve.In short, Bokurano is inspiring and depressing at the same time. Watching it was an experience, to say the least. It's a good show. I recommended it to a friend, and he's glad I did -- he's on episode eight, and thanks me quite a bit for the recommendation. characteristic of the show's nihilistic viewpoints.

Not sure. I did read up on what happened later, and it just gets bleaker, and very apocalyptic--except on a cosmic scale. For a point of reference, the direction it goes in reminds me a lot of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica series--which I'd definitely recommend over this, because it's better in pretty much every way.Anyway, this is known as one of the MOST DEPRESSING ANIME EVAR!!!11... Yeah, it's sad, depressing, I'd even say affecting. There's something about Mohiro Kitoh's stories that...are compelling at first, but they never quite enrapture me. The characters always look so sad, there's realistic drama, and many of the scenarios are upsetting. I was similarly underwhelmed with his Shadow Star Narutaru, a series that's like an edgy wrist-slashing version of Pokemon.I like dark, depressing media, but something about Kitoh's work feels incomplete or superficial. I'll chalk it up to subpar, on the nose social commentary and weak scripts. I've never read much of his mangas, so it could be something lost in the anime adaptations.The concept here is that giant enemies are attacking the earth, and 15 middle school kids are forced to pilot a mech to prevent the destruction of the world. THEN THE MAIN PILOT DIES. Yup, so the formula is one character is focused on for 1-2 episodes, then they pilot the mech and, poof, they're gone. There's very little time for character development, and most of the other characters develop very minimally because the whole focus is on the character who will die. It just feels very shallow, and there aren't any surprises. I usually found myself yawning while I waited for them to die.Pretty much everything about the show is fairly mediocre. The art is okay at best, the animation is weak, the CGI fight scenes are pure garbage; I honestly wish they could have somehow explored these ideas without the combat. Ugh. The episodes were almost episodic, and I find writing has to be really strong or have flashy visuals and presentation to keep a viewer interested for a whole series--writing stuff like this effectively is not easy.About the best we get is a pretty good opening episode with effective character drama, a nice opening animation and song, and a few emotional scenes here and there. Yawn.Also, if you like seeing sadsacks moping around and staring off into space while they countdown the seconds till their impending doom, this is your show. are compelling at first, but they never quite enrapture me.

The only reason I'm not giving the series a 10 is because I feel that the finale was really lacking, enough for me to dock the overall score.Wthout revealing anything, all I can say about the story is that it is original, captivating, and at times downright tear-jerking.  My only beef is, like I said, that the finale did not provide the right kind of closure that I needed as a viewer.   I give the story a 9, at GREATI really like the drawing and art style in general throughout the...entire series.  A lot of the characters have similar coloring, whch is sort of confusng at times because of how many main characters there are- but I think that the drawing was supposed to be very realistic so naturally many of the characters, being Japanese, had dark hair. I give art a 9 at GREATThe sound is overall pretty great.  No lies, I was not a fan of the opening theme song.  Of course by episode five I was getting it stuck in my head.  There are also two ending songs, the first of which I find extrmely corny lyric wise and the second is so-so.  The music played within the show itself is fine, I love love love the violin and all the heavy vibrato during the really emotional parts. I give sound a 9 at GREATCharacters:  Great. One of my criteria for me to not drop a series is that the characters HAVE to be well developed.  Considering that there are so many characters,it's especially impressive how realistic they are.  I love the story arcs for each eisode that allow you to really get to know them. It's really great.

We thought we could do anything. We laughed, we cried, we got angry... We thought we knew all there was to life. But in reality, we were just kids, sheltered by our parents and by society. We\'d never experienced true sadness, joy, or anger. We found that out when the 15 of us got together... And when... We met IT.""Bokurano is as much your typical mecha anime as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is your typical magic girl anime. It’s dark and pretty depressing, but none the less extremely interesting.Story – 9The one major...question asked throughout this series is directed towards the 15 children, basically asking them what they would do in the face of a certain and imminent death. The basic setting is that 15 children during summer camp find a cave by the sea (I know summer camp it sounds awful already). Inside this cave they find a strange man who asks them the simple question “do you want to play a game?”, now having seen the saw movies I would immediately flee at this point but instead these children take on the challenge. Then they find out that this game requires them to control a 500 meter robot and fight other robots, the shocking twist to this is that it isn’t actually a game (wasn’t actually shocking though). The actually shocking twist is that since it isn’t a game if they lose, earth will be destroyed and the human race will be annihilated. During these battles there are lots of casualties and these children are left to reflect on the havoc their wreaking while their lives literally fall apart. Every one of the fifteen kids is given an immense back story which is a major plot point because some episodes are solely focused on giving each character their own exposition. Most mecha anime are similar to the multitude of Gundam series in the way that the storyline is more happy go lucky and bright and this takes that common idea in the majority of mecha series and rips it apart saying “fuck you and fuck your dreams”. Not only is this extremely refreshing getting something I like to call original, but the plot is built upon with a variety of twists which grabbed my attention more and more bringing my interesting factor to exponential heights.Sound – 8The OP for Bokurano “Uninstall” constantly chants for the viewer to uninstall and this reminds me of my days playing video games like League of Legends where other players constantly told me to uninstall the client because I was “trash” so this OP gave me a laugh the first couple of times I heard it. Eventually you’ll probably understand the symbolism between the very fitting Bokurano OP. The voice acting is well done on the Japanese Dub and I have nothing to complain about it. Also the very fitting sad violin music was great.Art – 6Ugh, the art and animation really fucking sucks. The art is so bad that it practically makes some parts boring and hard. This is the time when Code Geass was coming out, so I can’t make any excuses for the art, other than when I usually rate an anime it doesn’t tend to affect the overall rating I give it very much. Character designs are actually pretty refreshing because all the main characters look pretty normal and don’t have any unusual purple colored hair, you would feel like they could be side characters in another anime. After watching the anime I decided to check out the manga which has absolutely fantastic art in comparison.Characters – 8Some characters are really good and some are bad, you’ve got 15 characters who are the main character and for the most part get an equal amount of screen time, all have very interesting diverse backgrounds and diverse personalities, which brings up the interesting factor a whole new notch as you watch patiently how each character separately deals with the situation they’ve put in. You can’t really go into depth when talking about these characters because spoilers would ruin this show, because it’s much more story based than action based.Enjoyment – 8Fight scenes are meh, I’m sure the anime didn’t do them justice but the major factor that brings those down is simply the animation which I felt was choppy at best. I was looking forward to the fight scenes but I was so entertained by all the backgrounds of the characters that I was able to watch Bokurano in two days, and I was in the Florida Keys, this managed to keep me inside connected to the hotel WiFi until I finished the show.Overall – 8.4It definitely isn’t perfect, but it is underrated. There isn’t too much gore so if you can handle the extremely depressing psychological part of this anime I recommend it for anyone above the age oftwelve.Brb, while I read the whole manga for Bokurano to relive in the excitement.Watch anime and keep it chill my friends. question asked throughout this series is directed towards the 15 children, basically asking them what they would do in the face of a certain and imminent death.

A little-known sci-fi anime, yet undoubtedly one of the best and saddest I have yet come across.Fifteen children are tasked to protect the planet by piloting in turn, a giant mecha and battling a series of mechas from parallel worlds in a inter-dimensional 'natural selection' process. Even one loss means the annihilation of their entire universe, while each victory still requires the life of the pilot sacrificed to fuel the mecha.This fantastic premise merely serves as a backdrop however, against which each character is brought to life in wonderfully realistic complexity. The assigned pilot in each episode must come to terms with the...inevitability of their imminent deaths, finding the strength to sacrifice themselves for the sake of family and friends.While the animation and cgi effects may not be impressive to all viewers, Bokurano's strength lies in its characters as well as its story-telling. The intricate sci-fi plot is presented through the 24 episodes in bits and pieces, ultimately to form a coherent whole leaving behind no plot-holes and hardly any relevant unanswered questions.This show is definitely not palatable for all viewers, particularly sensitive ones. The antagonists who organised the death-matches remain unpunished till the end of the show, which is an otherwise emotionally satisfying ending. Moreover viewers are warned that by the end of the show, nearly every single major character will be dead.Score:8.5/10Highly recommended. inevitability of their imminent deaths, finding the strength to sacrifice themselves for the sake of family and friends.While the animation and cgi effects may not be impressive to all viewers, Bokurano's strength lies in its characters as well as its story-telling.

Only recently have I finally gotten around to it and it was well worth the wait. Each character went through some sort of ordeal in order to overcome the fate they were tricked into. Each and every story was interesting, displaying all kinds of human traits ad desires. While the ordeals were psychologically wonderful, this anime is far from what I would call epic. Instead, Bokurano chooses to present its story in a different  light which I personally think makes Bokurano just that much better.Bokurano is very character based with...1-3 episodes depicting the struggles for each character. It almost felt episodic with the way the episodes changed from theme to theme but I believe it rounded up very well in the end. The themes presented in this anime are a bit touchy so I would advise not to watch Bokurano after touchy issues or if you're particularly sensitive. The strongest theme in this anime is the well known quote 'one is all, all is one'. Take this quote how you wish and see if it changes your perspective on Bokurano. For me it definitely did and the theme well and truly rung out.Character development is major. It is a bit dfficult though as there are 15 characters that are needed to be tracked of. Unfortunately for some people, remembering the face and name of a character you met two episodes ago is quite difficult. This leads to the development of early characters feelingl a bit weak which is a shame really. Once you get a grip on the layout, then it becomes easier to remember who is who and who did what. For the later characters, they developed quite well along with a kind-of main storyline. This storyline is overshadowed by the characters. I don't find this particularly bad as it is an anime based on, well, characters.Where the character development was great, things fell through a bit with the art and sound. Did you know Bokurano was made the same year as 'The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' and 'Ouran high School Host Club'? You know, those really pretty and flashy anime? I had believed for years that Bokurano was made in 1995 or something like that. If you would like to analyse it, it could represent the reality of everything, where not everything is beautiful and flashy. I did enjoy the battle scenes where it was slow and sluggish. It really helped describe the heaviness and difficulty of moving Zearth (the big machine thing). While the art wasn't appealing, it did well to set the atosphere of the show. The sound of the show (BGM, seiyu, OP/ED) didn't really capture me. It was alright. Nothing great, nothing horrible.Overall, I really enjoyed watching Bokurano. I loved the ordeals the characters went through (yes I am slightly sadistic). I loved the atmosphere where things felt hopeless. I loved how Bokurano ended with a quiet realisation on what it was trying to say. It was cruel and heartbreaking but in the end, it didn't really matter. The characters were fantastic and so were the battle scenes but this lead to a not-so-important storyline. Again, this doesn't effect Bokurano that much; it's just obvious they want you to focus on the characters. And that's exactly what you get. 1-3 episodes depicting the struggles for each character.

And that's exactly what you get."", ""Damn you plushies!!Pros:- Giant awesome mech fights are awesome- There is weight to this anime, makes you feel they got something to lose . . . and by that i don't mean the weight- Half the characters I really enjoy, especially Daiichi and I call dibs on him if they make a video game about this- Tournament style stories make me all giddy- Rules and limits makes this anime that more intense- A lot of people die, it will make you sad it will make you happy but mostly it'll make you happy that it can make you sad...Cons:- The other half you will hate and be annoyed by making you hit your head on the wall and screaming in frustration- High school students always getting into deep shit yo- The premise of the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense- Bare bones character development, literallySummary:I found this to be a very enjoyable anime but I nearly gave up in the middle. Half of the characters made me so angry it gave me a tumor and that tis unforgivable. I feel that if we were to have more time with characters, cut out the bad ones and give us an even larger magnitude as too what there is too lose I could rate it higher. As it is right now I find it to be good but has the potential to be far better.

It\'s a Seinen, dark and twisted, a bit slow at times, has lot of dialogue, very complex and a mech show. I never understood the hatred for these \'mech\' shows. Ironically enough some of them are most popular shows like 86, Code Geass, TTGL and NGE. This show in particular is very different from the rest of them. It\'s more on the psychological and philosophical side like Evangelion and more so about the characters who pilot them.Story (9/10) :Initially the story is simple. 15 Children...meet a mysterious man who asks them to take part in a \'game\' where they pilot a gigantic robot (which they later name as \'Zearth\') in order to fight gigantic monsters. They soon realize that it\'s not a game but a real fight to save the earth. Sounds simple but of course it\'s more than that. There is a jaw dropping \'twist\' at the end of the very first episode, which gives us a feeling that it\'ll be something special and it is. One of the best aspects of this show is the mystery. Every episode they fight these monsters, new things are slowly revealed. Like why they fight, what happens if they lose and perhaps the secrets of the world. This turns bigger and bigger, the stakes go through the roof and by the end it turns into nothing short of a masterpiece. The direction\'s fantastic too.Characters (10/10) :The characters are the meat of this show. Each character, both the children and the adults feels very \'real\' and organic. Everyone has a unique back story, their relationships, especially with their parents feels very authentic. Every child is troubled in some way, and they find their own reasons for fighting. This gives each of their fights a much deeper meaning. Not to mention the adults are written very well as well with distinct roles in the story. I have to say though, it gets very Depressing, like REALLY DEPRESSING. It\'ll tarnish ur soul and u\'ll never be the same man again. On the other hand there are a couple of characters are made just to make your blood boil. Without spoiling it - a dude with glasses and a dung beetle. Also it\'s not afraid of killing Characters off.Visuals (9/10) :The animation is pretty good. I really love the artstyle. It looks natural. It makes the whole thing even more effective. The animation of the mechs are great. People automatically detest 3D/CG like 1 Dimensional nitwits but the animations here of the robots are very good. I\'m blown away that it\'s from 2007. The slow movements give everything so much weight. The fate of your earth depends on these fights and it\'s a HEAVY burden to bear. Quite fitting eh. Apart from a few slip ups, Gonzo did a good job.Music (9.5/10) :The opening song is very iconic I believe. ""Uninstall"" by Chiaki Ishikawa is super catchy and I never skipped it. It\'s easily one of the best ops ever. Both the visuals and the music are outstanding. When that chorus hits, Zearth stomping it\'s legs on the ground, shattering houses, shooting missiles and destroying more buildings. Sick scene. The OSTs maintain the tone and dark atmosphere, along with few sad ones so plus points for that. The 2 ending songs are both great. The first one is very calm, which\'s very much needed after seeing the shit that went down. The 2nd Eds nice too.Enjoyment (9/10) :I enjoyed it all the way through. I was glued to screen, I wanted to know more and binged 10 episodes to finish it off, even though I had a headache understanding Wtf is happening and getting it blown up simultaneously. Towards the middle section it turns a bit slow. It turns political and becomes more convoluted as the episodes go by. I had to pause at certain times since it was a bit hard to follow at times. Speaking of the actual ending, it wasn\'t that it was bad but I just felt Empty after it ended. Like it was missing something but I don\'t know what. It didn\'t explain few important things which was very disappointing. But it didn\'t hinder my enjoyment of the show as a whole.Overall : This show is underrated AF. As of now it\'s over 1100th position in popularity and I don\'t see many people talking about it. Seeing the poster it didn\'t look appealing to me as well. But as I said before this show is quite special. It\'s very different, deep, with great Characters and It will break u from the inside. The ending could have explained a couple of things or could have just neglected it completely.9 - 9.5/10 meet a mysterious man who asks them to take part in a \'game\' where they pilot a gigantic robot (which they later name as \'Zearth\') in order to fight gigantic monsters.

A shame there wasn\'t a higher budget, the art was lack luster and especially with the clunky robot scenes. However, the Mecha design themselves were cool and fairly diverse. With such a large main cast the way characters presented their back stories became predictable in terms of who was going to be the ""featured"" character or pilot. This also meant some minor cast members were left underdeveloped. The...ending itself was conclusive but unsatisfying.I\'d recommend going into this with patience. The emotional pay off is pretty worth while, but this isn\'t a mecha anime in the least. ending itself was conclusive but unsatisfying.I\'d recommend going into this with patience.

After the first 2 episodes, everything goes down hill all the stories are about ""troubled kids and their troubled pasts"" and after a while they are just so obvious.Art:Even though this anime was made in 2007 the Art looks like it was straight out of the 1990\'s, enough said....Sound:Everything about this show is quiet, even the fights are quiet. There is nothing memorable about any of the music except the opening is on the creepy side like Elfin Lied.Characters:Characters like I said before have 1 episode to learn about them and that\'s it only 2 or 3 exceptions.

not very well known anime but there must be a reason for this is it just not very good or was it overshadowed by a much bigger anime in this review i attempt to judge bokurano ours and lets find out if we can find out why this anime was not a massive hit (i have NOT seen the manga so i cant make a judgement if the manga is better or the anime)Story-10/10Okay to make this review as spoiler free as possible i cannot talk about the story at length due to the twists and turns that happen early on...all i can say is that it follows very much on the footsteps of neon genesis evangellion  with the kids having to save the world but with a darker theme going on and  i cant say why the story is amazing lets just say it a rollercoaster of a ride with twists and turns you will cry and cheer all the way though before an amazing ending which answers most of the questions unlike evangellionArt-5/10Okay as good as this anime is i cant defend its art its looks awful especially for a 2007 anime this came out the same year as gurren lagann and code geass so the art cant be excused the art just isnt it strongest point and it isnt god awful bad its watchable its just bad so if bad animation puts you off this show then lower your exceptionsSound 7/10Apart from the amazing OP and the Ending songs i cant remember any of the other music maybe because it was blended into the background so well i dont know so apart from the OP and Ending the music would be a 3/10 but the OP is one of my fav OP of all time and the ending songs keep you sticking around (something i barely do).The voice acting is great despite the big character of dung bettle i see why and the voice grows on me however i still would prefer a kuybay cute voice over the masculine dung bettle voice it just isnt as unsettling as kuybay which i think is a major miscast but overall great OP and Ending and good voice actingCharacters-10/10The show needs good characters to succeed so its good that it has them the main cast for this little show has 12 characters to start with and by the end that number is way over 20 for main characters (in more then 1 ep) and the show gives every single character a place and a time to grow none of the characters feel fake they all feel like real people that have real problems and different ways of coping with them and for that the anime succeeds in doing justice to them all.Enjoyment 8/10I cant say i enjoyed bokurno per say the fight scenes where slow (however i think they worked well) and most of the time the anime made me sad however unlike some anime i have seen an episode felt a lot shorter i was sucked into the world and ""enjoying"" every minute form the opening to the ending i cried though it i got sound at parts and questioned stuff and it gave me answered i woundnt say this anime is fun because its the exact opposite of fun you have to enjoy dark anime to enjoy this anime but if you like anime like Evangellion and Madoka magica then this anime is for youOverall 9/10Sure this anime isnt perfect as ive said it has major faults but its one of the best anime i have seen and was over shadowed when it was out by anime like lucky star and code geass and it one of the best anime i have seen and if you havnt found the time to watch it yet do becuase it is a masterpiece of an anime all i can say is that it follows very much on the footsteps of neon genesis

I really loved this anime.Please note that if you\'re here for action... Sorry this isn\'t the right anime for you.Short Main Idea: 15 Kids (ages 10-13) are forced to fight for Earth by destroying other mechs. After each battle, the pilot dies and a new one is chosen. There are a few other complicated rules, but it\'s simple enough to understand when you\'re watching. Much of the anime is focused on the past and present actions of these 15 kids. Their actions will impact their futures and their destiny. It\'s a very sad story, but in my opinion, very well written.Story -...10. The story is very unique in my opinion. This is definitely a masterpiece story. I honestly felt like crying after like every episode. I\'m pretty apathetic and run through mangas and anime without too much emotions, but this one really choked me up. Beautiful story and very entertaining.Art - 9. The art is nice and fits the story\'s mood. It\'s pretty cookie cut and straight-forward.Sound - 8. Decent sound effects. Nothing super special, but nothing terrible.Characters - 10. The backbone of this anime. Honestly, you learn about the characters and the families, you really want to connect with them. Me personally I enjoyed the characters more than any other from a tragedy anime.Enjoyment - 10. I won\'t lie, the beginning few episodes are a bit slow and confusing. But around episode 5, the story really comes alive. It becomes a lot more clear what\'s at stake. After that, all the way till the end, I find it really enjoyable. I\'ve watched episodes multiple times just because I think it\'s that good!Overall - 10. Easily a 10. I really think everyone should watch the anime, whether you enjoy it or not. There are some big life lessons and morals to learn in this anime. I was once told that ""crisis is needed for change to occur."" This is a great example of this. I can\'t say anything else. Definitely worth watching!!Pros: Excellent storyline, Lovable characters, Good Soundtrack, Short but meaningful lessons on life, death, and sacrifice.Cons: Slow start, Mech fights are very slow-paced, the storyline is different than the manga.Just an extra bonus, The opening theme was featured in one of Nico Nico Douga\'s medleys. It\'s become one of my favorite songs and I think that\'s just a huge bonus. 10. The story is very unique in my opinion. This is definitely a masterpiece story.

I will be spoiling an extremely major plot point that is explained during these episodes, and it is near impossible to discuss this show without mentioning these points. I will try to be as vague as possible, but you have been warned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Story:If you go into this anime expecting an epic mech series, you\'re looking at the wrong show. Yes, Bokurano has some pretty epic mech battles, but that isn\'t the real meat of the show.  What you get is...a myriad of short stories, if you will, about 15 children, their backstories, and the time they have left before their inevitable demise.The thing that Bokurano does that is very much unique is that there is no main character. I haven\'t seen all too many anime so far, but I can safely say there are probably very few if any at all that have done this. The thing I find so refreshing about this fact is how many possibilities open up for the story. Excluding many romance and slice of life animes, you follow a main protagonist. Most of the time he/she either lives and saves the world, dies and saves the world, or dies/ lives and fails miserably. With Bokurano, its much more difficult to figure out how the story will unfold because of this fact, and it\'s one of the major pros of this series.Keeping positive for a while, we have the stories of the individual characters. Each character has a backstory, most of the time with some kind of negative aspect attached to them. The stories all tackle what a lot of kids their age may sometimes have to deal with, ranging from teenage pregnancy, abuse, neglegence, and the list goes on. This anime touches on them in such a way that doesn\'t feel forced or offensive. The story never changes from its deep and dark tone, and is very serious when dealing with these kinds of subjects, which is something to always keep in mind.Of course, the story is not perfect. The actual ""overarching"" story is lackluster to say the least. There are some things the writers never bothered to explain ( I won\'t go into any detail because spoilers). And when you\'re trying to deal with a ""theres multiple universes"" plot point, it\'s very hard not to fall into plotholes large enough to sink the Earth into. There aren\'t too many of these plotholes, and they can be easily brushed away after due time, but they are there,and do hurt the show. I also didn\'t really care much for anything happening that didn\'t have anything to do with the pilots of Zearth; The whole government debacle just didn\'t grab me, and did nothing to really have a stance on whether what the government was doing right or wrong.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Characters:The characters are what make this show so unique. Each pilot has their own way of dealing with their fate, and what they decide to do with the little time they have left, which is, at least in my opinion, the best part of the entire show. There is no way in hell I would go explaining each character individually because there are so many.Each character, personality wise, have very realistic personalities, almost as if I could meet someone who was exactly like that character. Yes, many of the backstories are sad, but none of them feel to the point that they are borderline psychopathic. One comparison I will make is to that of Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Mirai Nikki has characters with backstories that are so unrealistic that you could actually say with absolute certainty that they were even human. All they tried to do is randomly throw seemingly sad shit in you\'re face expecting you to succumb to the absurdity of their backstories. The backstories in Bokurano are backstories that many middle school students could actually have in real life, and that genuine feeling of reality is truly powerful.Each character gets one or two episodes to focus on their life. I find it amazing how the writers managed to use their time so well to develop each character enough in such a small timespace. However, because of the small size of each character arc, you are unable to really grow to like that character and relate to that character, as they are never to be seen again after their arc. One more criticism I have are with the first three pilots of Zearth. They really did feel like no care of effort were put into their backstories, and were just put there just to fill in time. I mean, you have a guy who\'s ""compelling and heartbreaking story"" is that he used to play soccer but doesn\'t is kind of strange to say the least.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sound:Other than the Opening and first Ending, their isn\'t really anything that great soundwise in Bokurano. The soundtrack never intensified any of the dramatic or action-packed mech scenes this anime had to offer. To be fair, it never dragged those scenes down, but it does leave you with a wish that it could\'ve been so much better. I\'m nitpicking at this point, but I felt the sound effects were a little bit janky and strange. A really minor point, but something I felt needed to be said.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Animation:Ah, Gonzo. It\'s been a while my dear old pal o\' mine.If anyone has watched more than one Gonzo show, you know what I am gonna say. For whatever reason, Gonzo has this habit of not keeping a steady quality of animation. You can point out scenes in many a Gonzo show where the animation looks like it came straight out of a 5 year old colouring book. On the other hand, you have scenes that look like they could be from the future because they look so damn amazing. Thankfully, Bokurano doesn\'t have godawful animation, but it does have patches, mainly during the in-between scenes, that are fairly poor. However, the CGI used during the mech scenes were executed with brilliance. Many anime seem to fail when using CGI, but this does well in implementing it to good use.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For something I probably would never had batted an eye at, I am glad to have experienced Bokurano. In a way, Bokurano reminds me very much so of a Gen Urobuchi work, as it will readily make you sad and depressed to get it\'s point across. It knows how to tell aspects that some people have to deal with in their everyday lives with finesse. Although flawed in many ways, Bokurano is truly a gem in the rough, and should be regarded highly. It might  be a bit too tear-jerky for some, so be warned, it\'s not a Nichijou. a myriad of short stories, if you will, about 15 children, their backstories, and the time they have left before their inevitable demise.The thing that Bokurano does that is very much unique is that there is no main character.

A really minor point, but something I felt needed to be said.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Animation:Ah, Gonzo. It\'s been a while my dear old pal o\' mine.If anyone has watched more than one Gonzo show, you know what I am gonna say. For whatever reason, Gonzo has this habit of not keeping a steady quality of animation. You can point out scenes in many a Gonzo show where the animation looks like it came straight out of a 5 year old colouring book. On the other hand, you have scenes that look like they could be from the future because they look so damn amazing. Thankfully, Bokurano doesn\'t have godawful animation, but it does have patches, mainly during the in-between scenes, that are fairly poor. However, the CGI used during the mech scenes were executed with brilliance. Many anime seem to fail when using CGI, but this does well in implementing it to good use.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For something I probably would never had batted an eye at, I am glad to have experienced Bokurano. In a way, Bokurano reminds me very much so of a Gen Urobuchi work, as it will readily make you sad and depressed to get it\'s point across. It knows how to tell aspects that some people have to deal with in their everyday lives with finesse. Although flawed in many ways, Bokurano is truly a gem in the rough, and should be regarded highly. It might  be a bit too tear-jerky for some, so be warned, it\'s not a Nichijou.', 'Disclaimer: if you prefer pure action before story, go back to watching naruto, bleach or powerRangers mighty force XyZ!.............. else keep reading :)//for those who have never seen it:recommendation: try and watch the first 2 or 3 episodes in one go.go ahead, but don\'t form an opinion till you\'ve seen more than several episodes.if you like mangas, that is probably as good or better choice to start with....------------------- Read this only if you seen episode 1+ -------------------//for those who have only seen the first episode and plan on quitting or placing it on hold:the short answer: Slow at first, but surprisingly twisted and enlightening later on!The author is heck lots more twisted than the creator of ""Saw""!

Much of the shock value of the early episodes would be lost if I broke down the formula here – but what I can say is that this series displayed excellent, very well balanced storytelling. So many issues are dealt with over the course of this show as each and every one of the 15 children that the plot revolves around are completely different to each other, but somehow they manage not to be stereotypes. All of them are perfectly normal kids...with their own problems, family circumstances and ways of thinking – the fact that they are so normal really adds to the emotional impact that Bokurano has.As the story comes from the same manga-ka as Narutaru there are a lot of quite dark themes and issues highlighted over the course of the show, but unlike Narutaru it isn’t all depressing doom and gloom – there are also genuine heart-warming moments and touches of comedy. But the one thing that shines through is the realism – we see the political and military response to the fact a giant robot is destroying massive portions of the city and we also see the destruction this causes in terms of houses, businesses and of course, lives. The anime also has a very satisfying conclusion and for a change I’m not looking for more, nothing more needed to be said really, even though we never discover the complete truth about everything that happened. I was really impressed with this show as just when you felt it was getting a bit formulaic it throws a load of well-timed plot twists at you and reached a natural feeling conclusion.ANIMATION: This is an example of ‘Good GONZO’ and even the CG for the giant robots isn’t terrible – the fact that it doesn’t really mesh completely with the 2-D backgrounds adds to the otherworldly feel of the mecha. The mecha designs aren’t wonderful, but the fact that they’re so ungainly and oddly proportioned made for interesting fights. Character designs are very simple but this adds to the realistic quality of the children’s characters and they are animated consistently well over the course of the show. In fact the quality was quite consistent over the course of the 24 episodes, I particularly liked the backgrounds as there are a lot different locations covered and each manages to look unique even though its usually the middle of a city.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I loved the OP & EDs, but particularly the OP, however the BGM was fairly unremarkable for the most part. Excellent voice cast for this show, it’s hard to pick out particular characters as the show was quite an ensemble piece, but I can say that not a single character was poorly cast.Overall Bokurano was an excellent anime, I was surprised by how much I liked it. It is a bit on the heavy side though – I really would not recommend watching it in large batches as its really doesn’t pull any punches with the drama.

When i started watching it, it amplified the thought. It was heartwarming and tear inducing. (not literally but im not an easy crier- so for anyone else it would make them teary eyed). Unfortunetly, the only thing that truely threatened tears, was the plot. The beginning helped formulate the storyline and exposed how depressing and traumatic the experience would be for those kids. As you go through the episodes, there are some sad moments, but after you go through half the series, it's not as touching. The...individual stories are definitely heart breaking, but it never felt like the deaths of the children prior had any permanent or lasting effect to the kids that were left. The anime never emphasized how each one of them was TRUELY gone. As the anime progressed, i expected them to show how one more chair was empty, but when a character was gone, i didnt really miss them. It felt like once the characters died, it was like they never existed.I have conflicting feelings about how they progressed the story. Like i said above, they never emphasized how hopeless the situation is. After each episode, a kid would disappear. It personally didnt seem like the characters remembered them anymore. I would rather see how the kids were tormented about their hopelessness, but the story seemed to focus on acceptance and each individual kids problems and resolving them before they died. The anime focused more on individuals instead of friendship.I gave this anime a solid 8 because it was a great anime indeed, but it didnt focus on what i personally wanted to see. Like i said, i wanted to see a little more of how they reacted to the characters before them gone. The individual stories were amazing in itself, and maybe they didnt create character ties because they didnt have enough episodes. (24 is a set i think- ...) Maybe if they had more episodes they would have been able to emphasize how death amongst friends impacted the characters.EDIT:my gradebook is slightly different then most- but even if i gave it an 8, for most others it probably would have been a 9.im bad at explaining myself but to wrap it up and repeat myself for those that STILL dont understand what im saying:what i expected to watch was a little more trauma between the deaths of their friends- but the plot only expressed the trauma on their own deaths. The characters were heartwarming, but the ties between the characters were almost non-existant. individual stories are definitely heart breaking, but it never felt like the deaths of the children prior had any permanent or lasting effect to the kids that were left.

Firstly, I just don't understand why this particular genre (not mecha) but psychological drama has so many unanswered questions. Unlike &quot;Gantz&quot; the story was better explained and we at least know why they are fighting, and the ending was a lot better. However like &quot;Gantz&quot; an episode where everything was explained in it's entirety was missing. Even when one of the main characters explained how her and her brother ended up involved in this &quot;game&quot;, her story did not explain some of the more crucial questions like...(1) Who built the robots;...(2) Who was really the mastermind; and lastlySLIGHT SPOILER(3) If the robots can move remotely using the energy from &quot;Zearth's&quot; technology why do they need the pilots life force to function.

The psychological plot and unique twists create interest value. Sacrifice and courage are learned, while maturity is gained for the good of the people. The grim game of life and death is only half of the battle.Expect to fall in love with the opening song, as well as cry. Allow yourself to grow attached to the characters in such a limited episode amount. "", ""Bokurano is an anime I first heard of quite some time ago and I remember how intrigued I was when I read the synopsis. A mecha deconstruction with horror/psychological elements? Count me in.But does the show hold up to its premise or is it one of these cases where the premise is great but the execution falls flat?Let's start with the one aspect that started my interest in the series: the story.While at first it seems rather clichéd, the story soon turned out to be one of my favourite aspects of the show. Every two or three episode the focus changes from one...protagonist to another, which I think was very well done. The show keeps your interest by doing this and at the same time provides us with an continued storyline.While I found the first half of the series to be marginally better than the second one because it contains most of the surprises and turning points it was overall very well done and wraps up nicely. One advise I can give is that you should try to not get spoiled, simply because that would take away the tension.Story - 9/10Let's be fair - Bokuranos animation is not great. The mecha fights are well choreographed, the mecha design is creative and this is one of the very few instances where the CGI does not stick out but apart from the fight scenes the animation is fairly average. The character designs are nice but nothing special and can get confusing at times and unfortunately are off-model very often. The backgrounds are rather beautiful and there are some instances where the animation shines like the scenes inside the robot which have a nice choice of color but these are few and far between. Overall the animation and art do the job but nothing more.Animation/Art - 6The music is equally uninteresting. It never works against the mood and usually compliments the anime rather nicely but it is nothing to write home about. The OP is great and fits the mood of the anime perfectly. The EDs are nice to listen to but not nearly as spectacular as the opening.Music - 6 for the BGM, 9 for OPs and EDsBy far my most favourite aspect of Bokurano are the characters. Each of them gets there own little arc which usually do a better job then I expected. Not all characters are equally interesting and a few are pretty dull but overall I was immensely impressed how much I cared about characters I only got to know for two or three episodes. One thing I'd like to mention at this point is that while Bokurano is not very violent and sexual it contains some disturbing content that might put some viewers off.Characters - 9The most important aspect about anime is in my opinion the direction, and sadly this is one aspect I did not like so much about Bokurano especially at the beginning. My knowledge of cinematography is rather limited and I did not expect a work a la Miyazaki when I started this anime but it ended up bothering me more than I expected. In the first few episode everything seems to be shot in the same unexciting way that did not allow me to get a firm grasp of the surroundings. Maybe this was done intentionally - it creates a somewhat uneasy feeling after all - but I found it distracting.Luckily the direction improves in episodes 6 and 24 which share the same director but in my opinion it could have been better.Also this anime is heavily influences by Evangelion in case you could not already tell from the fact that it is classified as a psychological mecha deconstruction. This does not distract from the experience but I thought it was a bit much at times.So is this a must-watch anime you should not miss or is it just another anime rip-off of a certain 90s mecha anime?The answer to both these questions is 'no'.But if you are a fan of psychological, more serious anime and like deconstructions as much as I do I recommend to check this one out. At the end of the day I found Bokurano to be a very enjoyable experience.Overall - 8 protagonist to another, which I think was very well done.

These instances are not used haphazardly and advance characterization+ The mechs are a plot device, not the focus.  This is a pro if you prefer character driven narratives+ Bokurano acknowledges the gray area of morality and does not shy away from painting their protagonists as far from perfectCons:...- The anime suffers from deviating from the manga.  This leads to plot holes, unresolved answers, and changes in character motivations that greatly alter the series- The background music can sometimes be distractingly bad and melodramatic; especially in the earlier episodes- The ending felt totally disconnected from the series.  I do not know if this is because they opted for an anime specific ending, if it is the Gonzo effect, or a combination of both- Almost all adult characters involved in the military or government, except for those that become part of the main cast, act foolishly or as a caricature of a villain.  For a series that thrives on a character driven narrative this cookie-cutter behavior felt out of placeReview Summary:  Bokurano attempts to demonstrate what would actually happen if children were tasked with saving the world with a giant robot at the cost of their lives and the lives of others.  While the ending doesn't match the weight of the series the show is still worth watching for its realistic approach to character interactions and how difficult it is for humans to acknowledge their own mortality.

The catch is though, is after they defeat the alien enemy, they child in control of Zearth dies. And if they lose thier fight, the Earth dies. There’s a lot more to it than that, but anything else I could say would be a spoiler.I will say this though, it’s hard to pin down how I feel about this show.Initially I saw similarities to Evangelion, but I quickly let those leave my mind. The plot held my interest the entire show....Bokurano has a nice and steady pace, the plot  moves forward each episode and leaves you wanting to no more and more. Most everything gets answered and explained. The ending fits well with the rest of the series, there’s no sudden mood change or last second curve ball, it ends quite nicely. There was also this social commentary vibe I was getting about the “all for one” mind set Japan has. Bokurano spends a lot of time exploring the idea that individualism is just as important as a group mentality mind set.The characters are the stars of the show, specifically the 15 kids that pilot Zearth. Each of the kids gets fleshed out nicely, but at sometimes the impacts of their deaths seemed cheap. The structure of show is easy to catch onto pretty fast, so it becomes obvious real fast when someone is going to die. The character development the kids get right before they pilot Zearth is great, but to me it seemed almost to convenient. The writers do a great job with everyone’s back stories however. They all are believable and unique. I didn’t get tired of hearing about the characters or think that the backstories were to repetitive. The characters come to life and get a reaction out of you. There wasn’t one main character I felt indifferent about.The animation was nothing to out of the ordinary, very standard Gonzo anime production animation quality wise. Nothing that stopped me from enjoying the show though. The music was very plain which sometimes worked for the show, I was surprised by this because Bokurano is a very emotional show. There seemed to be very few pieces of music.Bokurano does a great job at showing how even through adversity or even in the face of death, there is a reason to going forward and to keep fighting. Bokurano is an anime I see myself looking back on to think about and discuss with people. It is an anime I think will grow on me more with time, something I can definitively see myself re watching someday.

Life is no longer a matter of choice, but neither is death meaningless.That's the setting of Bokurano.Each character had his or her own past and future, but the setting stripped them of that luxury and allowed each to have only the present under control. The setting becomes an ideal breeding ground for all kinds of weaknesses and strengths.Bokurano therefore is an anime...with fast yet strong character development. That for me is the show's greatest merit.I wouldn't call Bokurano depressing even though I did cry in a lot of episodes. It's rather enlightening, not in a philosophical way of course.For me who thinks emotions lead to greater wisdom than knowledge itself can, I think bokurano depicts this truth (or folly) really well. with fast yet strong character development.

Bokurano is something else for me, First i was not that excited to watch it but when i finished it i felt that this was something else than amazing, it was a masterpiece. To be honest writing a review for Bokurano was not in my plans but i knew that i have to do it. Simply Bokurano is all about 15 childrens which have to save the world from 15 different alien invasions with a robot which called Zearth. How they get into this situation is that when...they were in a summer camp they suddenly discovored a grotto. When they get in there there was a room full of computers and a man called Kokopelli. Kokopelli introduced himself as the owner of this place, and invited all of the kids to play a game.Yes, i am talking about that ""game"" which they have to defeat real 15 alien invasions with a real giant robot. Kokopelli told them everything about the game but not the Zearth\'s energy source. Kids will have to find about the energy source and also how to use Zearth and defeat those aliens by all their selves. As i said Bokurano is a 24 episoded masterpiece. The genre of the series are Mecha, Drama, Psychological, Sci-Fi and Seinen.Overall, Bokurano was a really strong series that makes watcher to think and question about it. As i said Bokurano wasnt a simple series, it wasnt like any others, its one of its kind and absolutely worth giving it a try.

İ want to end my review with a quote from the opening of bokurano Uninstall. “I have no choice but to act as a soldier who knows no fear.”', 'Bokurano Anime Review:TOP Advice to best enjoy this :1)GO BLIND!!!!!     you wont regret it !!!2)WATCH IT TILL THE VERY END!!!   or else you haven\'t watched Bokurano3)DONT JUDGE !!!  the art may be too realistic or turn off some but seriously give it a shot!4)THIS IS NO TYPICAL MECHA ACTION ANIME!   so don\'t go in expecting that5) BE PREPARED TO THINK!!! or else you loose half the fun6)BE PATIENT , & WATCH EP 1 TILL THE END !!   though i personally don\'t think you\'ll be in need of too much patience afterwards ,...it\'ll hook you by the end of first episode.Personally i started the show due to a youtuber\'s recommendation, and the man mentioned absolutely nothing about the plot , and i think it was the right thing to do,and thus i\'ll start my review from why i liked it, over the plot description.-Charming Points / Reasons i Enjoyed it:Going in Blind.

Thank you', ""Bokurano is a mecha series with a unique premise. As with Evangelion before it, it is the strength of the story and the interesting, broken characters that make this show worthwhile. Unlike Evangelion, however, the writers for this show don't write themselves into a corner and then abandon the plot entirely, although important plot points are left hanging by the end.GOOD- A variety of interesting, complex characters make for a lot of drama- Intriguing plot which combines fantasy, science-fiction, and government conspiracy into one satisfying whole- Due to a certain plot element in this series, which I won't reveal, the series could very easily have...descended into nihilism. It somehow manages to avoid this trap- Great opening and closing themes, and some good background musicCONS- There are some elements of the plot that are not fully explored by the end of the series. This keeps the plot from being a true 10/10.- The robot battles are mostly unremarkable, although a mecha series with slow robots was a bit interesting to see.- There are so many characters in the show's first half that the viewer has trouble relating to any of them. This is resolved in the series second half, when a good number of the main cast are no longer in the show.- Early episodes can sometimes become formulaic.- Some individual episodes with VERY rough animation quality (episode 7, I'm looking at you)- In general, expect a variable level of episode quality.There is no other mecha show really like this one. Another success from the creator of Narutaru.8/10 descended into nihilism.

Another success from the creator of Narutaru.8/10"", ""When I first heard of Bokurano, I was moderately intrigued, but I put it aside because it was a mecha and there other things I wanted to watch. Looking back, that was a poor decision. Now, Bokurano is one of my favorite mecha anime of all time. Because instead of focusing on the robot and the battles, they chose to focus on the development of each pilot and the Earth as a whole.Story: 9The anime starts out rather slow, introducing the characters, and of course, the giant mech. From the second episode onward, however, the tone of the series changes. While these children have...to fight off external enemies, they begin to realize that the battles themselves are the least of their worries. To give any more away would be a massive spoiler, but think along the lines of a sad slice-of-life moment in each episode of Bokurano. Not to mention the plot twists, which go to show how complicated the world really is.Art: 7Because it came out in 2007, I knew the art wouldn't be able to compare to anime now. That being said, a few episodes really should have been cleaned up more. Overall, I didn't really have a problem with the art. It was simple and got to the point.Sound: 10Oddly enough, the music was another reason I enjoyed Bokurano so much. From the opening, Uninstall, to the ending, I never felt like the music was out of place. Not to mention the meaning behind the opening and ending lyrics being so appropriate to the series. As I've said, Bokurano is more of a slice-of-life tragedy than anything else, so my favorite parts were always when the violin music started playing.Character: 9This is undoubtedly the strength of the series, though I will explain why I gave it a 9 later. Each of the pilots are troubled youths, who have their own stories to tell and problems to overcome. The coming-of-age backdrop of the series is well-executed with mech battles being more of a symbol of the characters growing up than defeating enemies. They all have to find within themselves a reason to fight for the world, whether it be for family or friends. And while certain episodes were very tragic and heartwarming (at the same time, though you'd find out why after watching the series), certain characters were not as memorable as the others, so I can only give this a 9.Enjoyment: 9A majority of the episodes had me on the edge of my seat, either because I wasn't expecting a plot twist there or because the backstory of one of the pilots was that good. Again, certain episodes were less powerful than others. Also, Bokurano is a surprisingly simple story about growing up. It doesn't bombard you with complex philosophical questions; it is much more subtle, describing the world of a child and letting the audience interpret for themselves the meaning behind their lives.Overall: 9Whether you end up enjoying Bokurano or not, I suggest you at least watch a few episodes. This is one of the hidden gems that I found, not even expecting to. This is basically the Madoka Magica of mecha anime. to fight off external enemies, they begin to realize that the battles themselves are the least of their worries.

The plot follows a group of kids that were tricked to pilot a giant mechanical robot and are forced to fight ""invader"" robots from another planet. The catch is, after every fight, the pilot dies because the robot steals the pilot\'s lifeforce away. This creates fantastic character drama situations, as these kids that have barely lived, are forced to cope with their impending doom.The characters are the real meat of Bokurano. I find it impressive how...the writer was able to create the different living conditions, moralities, and backstories of the children, that you could not help but sympathize, even if these character backgrounds only lasted an episode or two.As Bokurano is, however, an old anime, the CGI is mediocre by today\'s standards, and the opera music backgrounds will either be loved or hated by the viewer dependent on your musical tastes.Although I quite enjoyed Bokurano, the latter half of series was boring. This was because its predominantly character-driven drama was toned down by a substantial amount, in favor of a more political oriented drama that has been tackled to a fault by other series. The message of the second half that ""humans are bad"" was just too common that I had a hard time focusing because I felt the series had lost its most prized novelty (i.e. the top-notch character-driven drama).Overall, Bokurano had an amazing first half but burned out toward the end. I found this quite unfortunate because if it had stayed on its original track, it may have gone down as a masterpiece or close to one. the writer was able to create the different living conditions, moralities, and backstories of the children, that you could not help but sympathize, even if these character backgrounds only lasted an episode or two.As Bokurano is, however, an old anime, the CGI is mediocre by today\'s standards, and the opera music backgrounds will either be loved or hated by the viewer dependent on your musical tastes.Although I quite enjoyed Bokurano, the latter half of series was boring.

It supposedly had a lot I liked in Gantz, only with using characters instead of violence as it\'s way of telling the story. It should be something I like. And I guess it\'s worth a watch, if you have time to waste.The art is rather nice, but annoyingly standard. No exciting stylistic choices, nothing high-brow. The sound is rather nice, despite the fact that I disliked the opening theme, the editing and feel are great. The characters are not boring, but tend to be very cliche. If you\'ve watched enough anime, you already know all the themes...to all of them. The plot is sub-par. It\'s standard, throw-away, recycled mecha stuff; Kids get giant robot, fight aliens to save the world! Evil government, military involvement, etc. My gripe is not that this is bad. My gripe is that it feels the producers chickened out. This could have been so much more.As it is, this is a mix of Evangelion and Gantz, each of which was more daring because it went deeper into it\'s own thing, while Bokurano remains annoyingly neutral. It\'s shocking but doesn\'t dare to be disturbing. There is no fast paced fun, nor eery and deliberate atmospheres developing slowly. It just feels neutral. It focuses on a character each chapter, and excluding a few, none of them get enough focus for us to feel for them. This should have been an amazing show, I cannot stress this enough. And I\'m sure than in the manga form, this is a brilliant work.Yet at the end of the day, I have to sum it up as ""meh, wasn\'t bad"". to all of them. The plot is sub-par.

Basically every one of the 15 get an episode or two dedicated to them and them alone during which their personal story is fleshed out and they get their turn in the spot light. During these short story form character arcs the show will tackle a number of heavy topics, all the meanwhile the primary overarching plot is slowly fleshed out and the ""mainer"" characters (of the 15 ""main"" characters a couple are more centric and focused on harder) go through a bit more growth. It\'s an interesting concept and...whether or not you like it will depend largely on your personal tastes.Personally I found it hard to grow attached to many of the characters given how little time the show spends on each one of them individually. It tends to be very episodic and you get very little time to get to attached to each character during their brief spotlight time. Again it all depends on how you connect to it. The show does to a pretty good job of characterizing and fleshing out these characters in the short time they get and has very good \'short story\' form backgrounds for them. So if that sounds appealing to you, then you\'ll probably get a lot out of this show. Another huge complaint I have is the action/fight sequences. They basically don\'t exist. A couple of them have neat gimmicks or cool moments attached to them, but as a whole the fights are super short and bare bones. The overarching story is neat though.Overall I\'d recommend it to anyone who likes the concept of a collection of short backstories that explore a variety of heavy topics that all string together in an overarching story, but I\'d warn anyone expecting good action sequences or long term character development that those things are largely absent here. It\'s certainly unique, I personally prefer long term character growth over this short story format and found it hard to care about most the characters because of it, but I appreciate the uniqueness and I still think it makes for an interesting watch. whether or not you like it will depend largely on your personal tastes.Personally I found it hard to grow attached to many of the characters given how little time the show spends on each one of them individually.

The mecha in this isn't that great (poor CG galore) but the melancholic story and plight of the robot pilots who enter battle accepting their deaths is just something else. (Robots aside, the animation quality is great)For those who sampled the first two episodes and hesitated, I would advise that the real meat of the show comes in when it starts to explore each individual pilot's backstory - there's a lot of variety between characters and in some cases the plots are absolutely heart wrenching.If you...are like me and are into the more darker side of anime, this is pretty much essential.

As for my review, I'll have to be more vague than I would like, but such is the nature of the beast.Bokurano has a story virtually unrivaled in the entire genre. Being a thorough deconstruction of the mech genre, the immediate comparison is Evangelion, perhaps the most beloved anime of all time....However, Bokurano goes a step further in ripping the audience into emotional pieces. After the initial shock to the nervous system that one gets with the first one or two battles and the associated facts about the ramifications of piloting the robot, the series decides that the audience haven't been in nearly enough pain, and so proceeds to hit said audience over the head with every metaphorical chair it can find. By the latter half of the series, you'll likely find it a challenge to continue from how hard the series hits you over and over again. And it doesn't get any easier from there. The second half of Bokurano is one of the most painful portions of anime to ever be created. The emotional beatings of the first half are completely crushed under the new onslaught of painful revelations, and by episode 20 I threw in the towel the first time. I came back 6 months later with more genre experience under my belt and pressed on, and thankfully the series does lighten up before the end. By the end of the series, Bokurano has finally unveiled a message, and a positive one at that. Going from the bleakest anime ever seen to a series that suggests a brighter future is a mighty accomplishment, and Bokurano pulls it off.Despite the excellent story, Bokurano is the posterchild for why animation is important. Because the animation is really bad. Particularly noticeable is the fight animation, it's nothing short of dreadful. All the robots are done in really terrible 3D animation, their movements are unbearably slow and surprisingly choppy, and overall the fight animation, which is the place where animation quality is most important, ultimately falls flat.The sound is good, though it doesn't stand out particularly well. The background music is hard to notice most of the time and is mostly unmemorable. However, the OP and second ED are fantastic, and shouldn't be skipped at any point. The voice acting is very good, with notably great performances where it counts the most.I can't really talk about any of the pilots without spoiling the major elements of their backstories, though I can say the best characters in the roster are Daiichi, Anko, Kanji, and Jun. Overall, being vague enough to avoid spoilers, the roster of pilots is excellent, boasting memorable backstories and great personalities. Aside from them, the only character I can talk about is Koemushi,  better known as Dung Beetle. He's perhaps the most unlikable and rage-inducing character in any form of media. Throughout the entire story, the viewer grows to despise this thing more and more, and his backstory doesn't help the viewer like him any more. Clearly the audience is supposed to hate him, and the show does an excellent job making him the most horribly unlikable character ever.Overall, Bokurano is excellent. The great story and characterization make up for the poor animation, and earn the series a spot as one of the all time greats, and a must-watch for anyone with any experience in the mech genre. However, Bokurano goes a step further in ripping the audience into emotional pieces.

Overall, being vague enough to avoid spoilers, the roster of pilots is excellent, boasting memorable backstories and great personalities. Aside from them, the only character I can talk about is Koemushi,  better known as Dung Beetle. He's perhaps the most unlikable and rage-inducing character in any form of media. Throughout the entire story, the viewer grows to despise this thing more and more, and his backstory doesn't help the viewer like him any more. Clearly the audience is supposed to hate him, and the show does an excellent job making him the most horribly unlikable character ever.Overall, Bokurano is excellent. The great story and characterization make up for the poor animation, and earn the series a spot as one of the all time greats, and a must-watch for anyone with any experience in the mech genre."", 'It\'s in the vein of the whole ""kids suffer eternally for some existential threat"" trope and does it well to greater dread. In this case, they know full well that they\'re going to die and that in and of itself is just tragic. All in all the character development of all 15 characters was amazing, each with their own unique personalities, fears, problems, reasons for fighting - some selfish, some not so much. Certain characters pull through to the end while others end up dying for nothing. This is the strength of this anime. The weak point are the actual mediocre CG robot fights itself,...sound design that makes the robot\'s moving sound like braking 18-wheelers, and a jagged, jumpy, almost glitchy art style that just doesn\'t seem right. This is the first anime in awhile to make me feel dread for these characters.

This anime has a vast array of characters, all of them unique as a whole person, they have feelings and goals, and one of the best things about this series, they have to find a reason in themselves to keep moving forward.This anime is extremely emotionally heavy, If that's not your type of anime then you better turn away right now.The basic story of this anime is about a...group of kids that are tricked into signing into a 15 level death battle with giant mechs in order to ensure the safety of their universe. There is a lot of plot twists, and I really enjoyed that they never really let characters dissappear, their memories live on in the characters.The anime also deals with a LOT of issues of the modern world, and those issues are reflected perfectly on the characters they affect. From suicide to families destroyed by gang wars, this anime really does have it all, and it will expect you to figure out what has happened every once in a while.It's pretty obvious from the beginning of the show that Jun is going to be the main character, and the plot ends up focusing on him and cousin a lot,and I believe it is important to realize this is not a mech anime, it might have a giant robot but in the end the real focus is the one driving the robot.The lowest point would probably be the art style, but I feel like it didn't need to be a super fancy anime in order to get it's point across. The people are designed simply, like real people are, in order for you to be able to focus more on who they are rather then what they look like.The soundtrack is great, and Uninstall is an amazing intro that really captures the feelings the anime is trying to show, and while most of the time  anime that take scenes from their show and crop them together into an intro are not as good, but i feel like their ability to capture the moments of which each character is under the most pressure.The only thing about this anime that had me disappointed was the ending. While it was perfectly good and closed off an open character plot, it still makes you wonder if there is more problems yet to arise.Overall though, this anime is by far one of the best anime I have ever seen. group of kids that are tricked into signing into a 15 level death battle with giant mechs in order to ensure the safety of their universe.

With a lot of the same recycled plots coming out, this was a breath of fresh air. The basic plot consists of 14 7th graders, and 1 4th grader, that are tricked into piloting a mocha to save the world from aliens! Now, this may seem normal for a show, but Bokurano is far from that. The kids are told that it’s just a simple game and they act with that mentality for a while until they realize...that they did not sign up for a “simple game”. There’s a big twist with piloting this mecha, and that twist is the mocha runs on your life force. So, when you win your battle, you die (To put it simply). This leads to interesting psychological problems with the kids. Do they pilot the mecha to save the world? Or do they run the risk of keeping themselves alive in case their world is not destroyed? From the very beginning, the kids are set up with a dark future, and they deal with it in different ways. In the end, how many of them will have to die for the Earth to be saved?Art/Animation: 6/10So I’m very strict with the whole 1-10 grading scheme. 10 being it cannot get any better and 1 being it cannot get any worse and 5 being just average. Bokurano’s art and animation can only be described as that, average. Why it gets a 6 and not a 5 is because it’s lackluster character design actually works for them. Bokurano seems to pride itself on the realistic aspect of the show, despite it being giant robots fighting to the death. The cast, though different personalities, look realistic and act in a realistic way. Besides that though, there are times where the animation is great and others where the animation is horrible. So… Average!Music: 7/10The music suffers from the same fate as the art and animation sadly. The differences between the two are that the opening and ending themes to Bokurano are outstanding. “Uninstall” is a perfect opening theme for a show so dark and twisted, while the ending shows the more human side of the characters and calms you down. There’s nothing special about the insert songs. Actually, I don’t remember any of them…Characters: 9/10This is where the show needs to shine since like other survival anime, it has a huge cast. 15 characters (plus a couple more that show up later) that need time to develop and grow. The show does a surprisingly good job at developing its characters too. Not all of them had enough time to develop fully, but for the time they’re given, it was pretty impressive. As said above, the kids find out that to save their Earth, they need to die, basically become a martyr. A lot of the time in anime, you don’t receive realistic reaction towards situations like this. Maybe some disbelief and light shock at most. These characters cry, kick, scream because they are kids. It’s a good choice that the main cast is kids to because their views on morality and the situation they are in are mostly unfiltered. Overall, a great cast of characters (Especially Ushiro).Overall Score: 7.9/10 that they did not sign up for a “simple game”.

A lot of heavy stuff happens, so be warned. It is here that I find important to realize what is the primary focus of the series.While it is a mecha anime, it should be noted that, like many good mecha, it focuses a lot more on characters and their development while in difficult situations outside of combat. Though...some of the battles have nice moments and some enemies have creative designs (more IRL robot combats than Evangelion, mind you), they’re brief and not too flashy since they’re not the main point.Each character invites us to their backstory, revealing who they are and what reasons they find to fight.

However, one or two may come as forgettable due to having little time and not as striking personalities and points of view as their fellow pilots.

Now, it is a topic most important to discuss, and I don’t think it came out in a shallow way. It introduces new characters and we still see the development of the pilots. But the kids do begin to take the back seat a little, especially those whose stories intertwine deeply with the political events, and that subtle change was a little off.Finally, the technical aspects. The art direction is nice, having more natural designs to people and a softer, less bright color palette, but the simple aesthetics do seem a bit lacking in this instance. Animation is okay almost all the time, but some (heavy) slips will happen here and there. The mechas are full CGI, and it have aged (obviously), but it is by no means the disaster that many would presume. The sound never draws the attention away from the scenes and leaves a nice atmosphere all around, and the OP is god-tier.I haven't read the light novel, but can attest that the manga is pretty good too, so there is more quality Bokurano out there. In the end, it is a sad yet joyful ride. Even if the final explanations are kind of dense and unrelatable, the resolution of each story brings out the overall bittersweetness.

Well, Bokurano is a deconstruction of the mecha genre like Evangelion, however, it takes you into a completely different ride. Boys and girls from age 12-13 sign a contract to play a game where each pilot a mecha, and have to defeat 15 enemies. Each enemy for each child contracted.

None is really iconic, but if I had to chose one OST that stood out, I would tell you to listen to the EDs. The OP is really good aswell.Art: I can't judge 2007 animation because I mostly watch post-2010 anime, but I would say it's just alright, not bad but not outstanding. I did print some scenes with lazy eyes which just added in the fun. It took me a while to understand which girl was who because Komoda, Chizuru and Mako seemed pretty alike at first. The way I understood it was that Chizuru has a mole, Mako has a ponytail and Komoda's face is longEnjoyment: I do have a soft spot for dramas, and this was a pretty emotional one. I'm the type to get emotional and this was incredibly depressing. Bokurano is one of my favourite anime and it's pretty underrated. Best girls are maki and machi, best boy is kanji.

The show is good. If you are on the fence or you set out to just plain dislike the series, the show will provide you with plenty of ammunition to shoot it down as well. I\'ll go through some of my personal gripes, while avoiding spoilers.All the mecha parts are realized with the aid of some pretty dated 3D graphics. Even though the models themselves look rather rough, there...is still some proper weight to their movement and the environmental destruction feels tangible, even if the action and fight choreography ain\'t spectacular. I think the studio did the best they could with the limited time and money given to them, but if mixing 2D and 3D animation is something you absolutely cannot stand, there\'s your fist reason to pass on this.My first big gripe would be the soundtrack. I think they were going for something minimalistic and experimental, but it mostly just ends up sounding awkward and distracting. There are tracks that flow a little better, but they aren\'t anything memorable. Over all, a very mediocre soundtrack, which is a shame.Bokurano is a torturous psychological drama and that is where the emphasis lies. If you are looking for giant robot action that gets your heart pumping, this is definitely not for you... But I think most people are able to figure that out just by reading the synopsis. Bokurano is ultimately a show about the end of innocense and childhood and about coming to terms with death. About how extreme situations can bring out the best qualities in some people or dredge up the worst qualities in others. I was afraid that the show would have some childish message along the lines of ""everyone is shitty"" and all these kids would turn out to be terrible people, but that is luckily not the case. There is a lot of variety in how the characters end up dealing with the awful, awful situation that they\'ve wound up in. As the story progresses and the full gravity of what is going on dawns to these characters, I\'d be willing to bet some good money that in any kind of realistic scenario, these kids would absolutely break down into a weeping, useless mess (I know I would)... But that wouldn\'t make for a very good story, so I can let that one go.What bothered me more than some of the character reactions, was the way the government and the society were reacting to what was happening. A lot about the handling of a crisis of this scale just made me scratch my head in confusion. I did not feel like the adult world of the series functioned very logically or credibly. That being said, there is a pretty convenient story reason why the world of Bokurano doesn\'t necessarily operate along the same lines of logic as ours, so once again, I\'m willing to overlook this aspect.I have to admit that this show hit a very specific sweet spot for me. Once the merciless nature of the story started to fully dawn on me, I was hooked. I was simultaneously filled with dread and excitement with the reveal of every new pilot. Seeing the chair roulette land on a character you had really started to like - in the best way possible - felt like a punch to the gut.

I am absolutely blown away, at what I just watched. I\'d just like to give a quick shout out to GlassReflection, for introducing me to this show. 99.9% of the time, he introduces shows to me that become some of my favorite viewing experiences of all time, and BOY, DID HE NOT DISAPPOINT, THIS TIME! If I had to describe Bokurano, it would be if Madoka Magica, Attack on Titan, and Danganronpa all had a baby. Though, Bokurano actually came before ALL of those shows. So I guess it\'d be more suitable to say that...you can thank Bokurano for all those other shows and games. Madonna Magica actually even has a reference to Bokurano, in one of the episodes. So if Madoka herself recommends this show to you, then you NEED to see it. But here\'s the one thing that made me like this show FAR more than Madoka Magica and Attack on Titan. Unlike those two shows, Bokurano wasn\'t spoiled for me. I had both Madoka and AoT spoiled to high heaven, before I even went and watched them. And because of that, my experience with Madoka became a lot more underwhelming and unenjoyable than everyone else\'s experience, and I didn\'t even bother finishing AoT, because I was able to describe every single scene, before it even happened.So ya. Don\'t spoil things, people! It ruins shows! And don\'t use the ""They should\'ve watched it, already"" excuse. Not everyone was born at the same time as you and not everyone got into something at the same time as you. Nobody is obligated to experience something as soon as it\'s created, just for the sake of not having it get ruined by other people. If you know that someone doesn\'t want something spoiled, DON\'T SPOIL IT. Now that that\'s settled, let\'s write up a spoiler heavy review of Bokurano! But before I do, I\'m gonna give you all a fair warning. Bokurano is a show that is most enjoyable when you know literally NOTHING about it, going into it. In fact, it\'s one of those shows where simply mentioning anything about it can be considered a huge spoiler. So I\'m gonna warn you all right now that this review will have to contain spoilers, in order to be written. I try my best to keep all my reviews spoiler free, but for this show, it\'s almost impossible to do so. If you don\'t wish to be spoiled on anything, I\'ll just tell you right now that Bokurano gets my absolute highest recommendation. So go watch it. Like. Right now.Ok, then. Where do I even begin? So something that made me a bit hesitant to watch this show at first was that I eventually found out that it\'s a mecha anime. Personally, mecha is my least favorite anime genre that I\'ve watched. I don\'t think the mechs themselves are to blame, per se. But it\'s just sort of a fact that if a show has a giant robot in it, I don\'t like it. The only exception to this is iDOLM@STER: Xenoglossia, though I\'ll be completely honest and say that I probably only like it, because it\'s iDOLM@STER. So as soon as that opening started playing and that giant robot appeared, I was immediately worried. But now that it\'s all said and done, I am thrilled to say that Bokurano did not disappoint. Not only is this the best mecha show I\'ve seen, but it\'s also one of my absolute favorite anime series, or all time. The show does not follow any sort of rules or tropes that others mecha shows do. It\'s very unique and different. Like I said, it has a LOT of similarities to shows like Madoka Magica, AoT, and Danganronpa. Stuff like a bunch of teenagers being tricked into a life or death game that puts the entire world at risk of destruction, a demonic chibi creature thing who is the most despicable character in anime history, tons of plot twists that involve your jaw dropping 20 meters downward and your heart getting ripped out of your chest, literally every single thing you could possibly imagine going wrong happening, and MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING. Sounds fun!Now this show has a VERY big cast of main characters. 15, to be exact. And with only 24 episodes, giving each of them enough screen time to know about them is quite the challenge. Well if iDOLM@STER can do it, so can this show! And it most certainly did! One episode is all each character needs, in order for you to know what they\'re all about. These characters have two types. They can either be incredibly relatable and super likable, which leads you to being absolutely miserable when they end up getting put on the chopping block. Or they can be the lowest of the low, absolute despicable scums of the earth, where you\'re just waiting in anticipation for them to get put on the chopping block, and worried sick about how much damage they\'ll do, before then. You WILL know each and every single one of these characters, by the end of it. You may not remember their names, and possibly not even their faces, but you\'ll remember every single detail of their stories. The only thing a bit disappointing is that you won\'t really be attached to them as people, for long periods of time. Since each of their stories are only an episode long. They\'re fantastic stories, but the characters attached to them simply don\'t last long enough for you to fall in love with them, as much as you did with their stories.The reason I say you probably won\'t remember their faces is due to the animation. This show was made in 2007, by a company called Gonzo, which is made up of former members of Studio Gainax. When looking at all the other shows that came out in 2007, as well as 2006, Bokurano honestly doesn\'t stand out much, when standing next to its peers from that era. It\'s certainly not terrible, but if I told you that this show was made in the late 90\'s, you\'d probably believe me. The character look very plain, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. But for a show with 15 protagonists, it\'d be helpful if you were able to differentiate them from one another. Even the opening theme song doesn\'t have any stellar animation. In fact, the entire opening is made up of several clips from the show, itself! Usually the openings of a show are the most beautifully animated portion of the series. But not for this one. Though, I will give it credit for being one of those shows that has the opening become more meaningful, as time goes on.Another thing a bit lackluster in this show is its music. While its opening theme is very enjoyable, the show\'s soundtrack ranges from forgettable to nonexistent. Mecha shows at least have the accompaniment of big, epic orchestras, to enhance their fight scenes. But this show doesn\'t really have that. Though, considering the type of the show it is and what the characters are going through when piloting it, I could pose the argument that those scenes sorta benefit from a lack of music. And finally, the sub vs dub debate. Or rather, the lack of one. Because Bokurano actually doesn\'t have a dub, which is kinda shocking, honestly. The Japanese performances are all good, but I\'d definitely like to see this show get a dub one day, simply so that the show has another opportunity to be put in the spotlight.Now this show is incredibly dark. But not necessarily violent. Like I said earlier, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE!!! But it\'s not nearly as graphic as other shows are, such as Elfen Lied and Attack on Titan. A lot of the gruesome details are off screen or just done in an instant. In fact, I\'m pretty sure there\'s only one scene in the entire show where you see blood. And it\'s a very minimal amount, despite the events of the scene. So for the more squeamish people who are a bit nervous to go into such a gruesome show, I can assure you that you won\'t have to look at anything gory. Though, there\'s a LOT of despicable events and acts that take place in this show that can very easily make people uncomfortable, despite the visuals not being incredibly detailed on the matters. I\'ll just say that the show is rated R for a reason, and leave it at that.The fact that Bokurano is a hidden gem is an absolute crime, to me. Those who\'ve seen it love the heck out of it, but it NEEDS to be seen by more people. The show is all about things getting twisted in every possible direction, at first. Literally anything and everything can and will go wrong. Throughout the first three quarters, it\'s all about unveiling every piece of the puzzle. And once you finally do, it becomes kinda easy to see how it\'ll all end. But by that point, you\'re so hooked not eh story, that you absolutely NEED to finish it. The worst thing I can say about this show is that it probably won\'t have the best rewatch value. Since the most excitement is derived from being in suspense, waiting to see how long each character survives, as well as what happens to them right before they die. If you ever do rewatch this show, it\'d be best to do it with a friend who hasn\'t seen it. But for those of you who haven\'t seen it at all, and are ok with viewing a very gruesome series of events, this show will not disappoint. If you love Madoka, AoT, and Danganronpa, thank this show. Because its the reason that these shows came into being, and it definitely deserves some long overdue praise.Bokurano gets a 9.5/10 you can thank Bokurano for all those other shows and games. Madonna Magica actually even has a reference to Bokurano, in one of the episodes. So if Madoka herself recommends this show to you, then you NEED to see it. But here\'s the one thing that made me like this show FAR more than Madoka Magica and Attack on Titan. Unlike those two shows, Bokurano wasn\'t spoiled for me. I had both Madoka and AoT spoiled to high heaven, before I even went and watched them. And because of that, my experience with Madoka became a lot more underwhelming and unenjoyable than everyone else\'s experience, and I didn\'t even bother finishing AoT, because I was able to describe every single scene, before it even happened.So ya. Don\'t spoil things, people! It ruins shows! And don\'t use the ""They should\'ve watched it, already"" excuse. Not everyone was born at the same time as you and not everyone got into something at the same time as you. Nobody is obligated to experience something as soon as it\'s created, just for the sake of not having it get ruined by other people. If you know that someone doesn\'t want something spoiled, DON\'T SPOIL IT. Now that that\'s settled, let\'s write up a spoiler heavy review of Bokurano! But before I do, I\'m gonna give you all a fair warning. Bokurano is a show that is most enjoyable when you know literally NOTHING about it, going into it. In fact, it\'s one of those shows where simply mentioning anything about it can be considered a huge spoiler. So I\'m gonna warn you all right now that this review will have to contain spoilers, in order to be written. I try my best to keep all my reviews spoiler free, but for this show, it\'s almost impossible to do so. If you don\'t wish to be spoiled on anything, I\'ll just tell you right now that Bokurano gets my absolute highest recommendation. So go watch it. Like. Right now.Ok, then. Where do I even begin? So something that made me a bit hesitant to watch this show at first was that I eventually found out that it\'s a mecha anime. Personally, mecha is my least favorite anime genre that I\'ve watched. I don\'t think the mechs themselves are to blame, per se. But it\'s just sort of a fact that if a show has a giant robot in it, I don\'t like it. The only exception to this is iDOLM@STER: Xenoglossia, though I\'ll be completely honest and say that I probably only like it, because it\'s iDOLM@STER. So as soon as that opening started playing and that giant robot appeared, I was immediately worried. But now that it\'s all said and done, I am thrilled to say that Bokurano did not disappoint. Not only is this the best mecha show I\'ve seen, but it\'s also one of my absolute favorite anime series, or all time. The show does not follow any sort of rules or tropes that others mecha shows do. It\'s very unique and different. Like I said, it has a LOT of similarities to shows like Madoka Magica, AoT, and Danganronpa. Stuff like a bunch of teenagers being tricked into a life or death game that puts the entire world at risk of destruction, a demonic chibi creature thing who is the most despicable character in anime history, tons of plot twists that involve your jaw dropping 20 meters downward and your heart getting ripped out of your chest, literally every single thing you could possibly imagine going wrong happening, and MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DYING. Sounds fun!Now this show has a VERY big cast of main characters. 15, to be exact. And with only 24 episodes, giving each of them enough screen time to know about them is quite the challenge. Well if iDOLM@STER can do it, so can this show! And it most certainly did! One episode is all each character needs, in order for you to know what they\'re all about. These characters have two types. They can either be incredibly relatable and super likable, which leads you to being absolutely miserable when they end up getting put on the chopping block. Or they can be the lowest of the low, absolute despicable scums of the earth, where you\'re just waiting in anticipation for them to get put on the chopping block, and worried sick about how much damage they\'ll do, before then. You WILL know each and every single one of these characters, by the end of it. You may not remember their names, and possibly not even their faces, but you\'ll remember every single detail of their stories. The only thing a bit disappointing is that you won\'t really be attached to them as people, for long periods of time. Since each of their stories are only an episode long. They\'re fantastic stories, but the characters attached to them simply don\'t last long enough for you to fall in love with them, as much as you did with their stories.The reason I say you probably won\'t remember their faces is due to the animation. This show was made in 2007, by a company called Gonzo, which is made up of former members of Studio Gainax. When looking at all the other shows that came out in 2007, as well as 2006, Bokurano honestly doesn\'t stand out much, when standing next to its peers from that era. It\'s certainly not terrible, but if I told you that this show was made in the late 90\'s, you\'d probably believe me. The character look very plain, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. But for a show with 15 protagonists, it\'d be helpful if you were able to differentiate them from one another. Even the opening theme song doesn\'t have any stellar animation. In fact, the entire opening is made up of several clips from the show, itself! Usually the openings of a show are the most beautifully animated portion of the series. But not for this one. Though, I will give it credit for being one of those shows that has the opening become more meaningful, as time goes on.Another thing a bit lackluster in this show is its music. While its opening theme is very enjoyable, the show\'s soundtrack ranges from forgettable to nonexistent. Mecha shows at least have the accompaniment of big, epic orchestras, to enhance their fight scenes. But this show doesn\'t really have that. Though, considering the type of the show it is and what the characters are going through when piloting it, I could pose the argument that those scenes sorta benefit from a lack of music. And finally, the sub vs dub debate. Or rather, the lack of one. Because Bokurano actually doesn\'t have a dub, which is kinda shocking, honestly. The Japanese performances are all good, but I\'d definitely like to see this show get a dub one day, simply so that the show has another opportunity to be put in the spotlight.Now this show is incredibly dark. But not necessarily violent. Like I said earlier, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE!!! But it\'s not nearly as graphic as other shows are, such as Elfen Lied and Attack on Titan. A lot of the gruesome details are off screen or just done in an instant. In fact, I\'m pretty sure there\'s only one scene in the entire show where you see blood. And it\'s a very minimal amount, despite the events of the scene. So for the more squeamish people who are a bit nervous to go into such a gruesome show, I can assure you that you won\'t have to look at anything gory. Though, there\'s a LOT of despicable events and acts that take place in this show that can very easily make people uncomfortable, despite the visuals not being incredibly detailed on the matters. I\'ll just say that the show is rated R for a reason, and leave it at that.The fact that Bokurano is a hidden gem is an absolute crime, to me.

Because its the reason that these shows came into being, and it definitely deserves some long overdue praise.Bokurano gets a 9.5/10', 'This will be a spoiler free review. But will say that this anime reinforced a couple childhood lessons for me- ""don\'t talk to strangers"", ""don\'t fall to peer pressure"" and ""be grateful for what you have because someone ALWAYS has it worse than you""Bokurano is about 15 kids at a summer camp. They are playing on the beach and end up exploring a nearby cave. They find a cavern within the cave set up with computers and meet a man who refers to himself as Kokopelli. He claims this is a set up for his game, where multiple players fight using a giant robot....To play, you must sign a contract. He convinces all but one to sign the contract. Then they find themselves back on the shoreline of the beach, thinking it may have been something they all dreamed but soon realizing they have signed up for much more than a game.Bokurano is a deconstruction of the mecha genre... in laymen terms, it takes the robot genre of anime and does something different with it. Other mecha anime include ones like Neon Genesis: Evangelion, Power Rangers and even arguably, Attack on Titan (with a ""living robot). So if you like those or other robot anime, you will probably like this one. But like previously mentioned it does use the tropes of the genre differently- also being classified as psychological, drama and horror on MAL.Story: 9.5/10I cannot say much without spoiling the anime but it is definitely exciting, captivating, fascinating and tragic. The unpredictable nature of the anime is what really set it apart from others I have seen. Even if you do predict something, it may seem too extreme or sadistic to go that far...but sometimes they do take it THAT FAR. Also, if you\'re in the mood just to watch something, this may not be the anime for you as it will take some paying attention to follow along with the symbolic nature of some of the events. But the story will definitely draw you in and keep you through the 24 episodes and have you eagerly waiting to see how it all ends. I think you can also tell this is NOT a happy-go-lucky, funny anime and so maybe not for those in a sad or depressed mood...a lot of sadness and loss in this one. The themes they portray I cannot say, again in an attempt to keep tis a spoiler free review. But I can say they touch on mature themes and really show the psychological effects and mindsets of children, and man it was at times reply messed up. My only real complaint besides the characters (which i\'ll mention in a second) is the ending which I did like, but I felt left some loose ends untied.Character: 9/10Art: 6/10There are A LOT of main characters, 15 to be exact. Plus when you add some of the important supporting characters that are later introduced, its a lot to follow. The children definitely have some defining characteristics that set them apart from each other but it is really their backstories that will set them apart. They are heart-wrenching and at times very difficult to watch. There was not enough time for a lot of development for each one but the time they spent was, at most times, just enough to get you either sad, resentful and/or angry. Children are not always as innocent as they seem, and this anime depicted that VERY WELL. My biggest problems were that there WERE TOO MANY characters and the art/animation did not do a good job of making their faces memorable. You will definitely remember all their stories, but may have a hard time pinning a name and face to the story. They look like very average and normal children in extraordinary circumstances. Oh and I would be neglectful if I didn\'t mention that this anime has one of THE MOST despicable, sadistic and hateful characters I have ever seen, going by the name of Dung Beetle (Koemushi in Japanese). You\'ll see what I mean when you watch it. You\'ll either love his messed up attitude or like me, you\'ll despise him and hope his actions come back to bite him in the ass.The art like I said, not great. But the fighting sequences with the robots were pretty good. I think though, what the story lacks in art and animation, it almost fully makes up for with the story.Sound: 7/10The opening and closing themes are sort of catchy, and the music throughout the anime does a good job at setting the scenes. They really give you emotion trying to be conveyed. The musical pieces aren\'t all impressive but they definitely get the job done.Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 9/10Only a select few animes impact me to the point where I\'m thinking about them all day and getting swept up in the world they\'ve portrayed. Bokurano was an anime I couldn\'t get out of my mind. While I was at work I couldn\'t stop thinking about it and when I was falling asleep its all I thought about. The story drew me in and intrigued me that much....I think most of it just came from the genuine sadness and pity I felt for the characters. Although I did have some complaints, I would still recommend it to anyone willing to watch it and must say, in terms of story, it was so close to being a masterpiece, I really struggled giving it only a 9.5/10. It is a gem of an anime and one I think will be one you will never forget. To play, you must sign a contract. He convinces all but one to sign the contract.

How about a group of kids fighting for the planets survival? Trapped like a rat in something far greater than a simple kill or be killed world.Bokurano has a story that doesn\'t really make much sense with its ""rules of play"" until about half a dozen episodes into the anime. From there it finally opened more of the purpose behind the giant robots and why the battles in them must be won at all costs. The first three quarters of the anime are full on action intense. However as the government and researchers become...more aware of the situation, it slows with the action, takes longer to get through the explanations and reasoning behind a persons motives.Art styles are fairly disappointing for something made in 2007. Whether this is because of a low art budget or not, is unknown. Characters and non scenery items are very basically drawn and mouth movements could not have been done a lazier way. A few scenes depicting horror or large amounts of gore, are drawn extraordinarily well. However the 3D CG used in the robots is fairly well done and very smooth with its animation. It almost makes you question if this is where their entire art budget went.Major battle sequences, emotional character scenes and introductions to the current scene. They all seem to have their own music piece that is used throughout the anime. It\'s most times very soft compared to the voices and can sometimes no unnoticed. A few new music pieces pop up in the final couple of episodes but nothing too interesting. many generic stock sounds are used throughout and the few that sound unique, especially during the robot battle scenes, are recycled more times than you can count.Characters were sometimes bland and didn\'t get hype at all which can be disappointing but the character development for most is short and doesn\'t drag down on the mass amounts of action. Others drag on for far too long and can waste an entire episode filling in what can be explained in five minutes. This can occasionally kill the mood as it gets to starting action scenes, making you hype then drags on about a characters back story for over an episode.Despite these slow points dotted throughout the anime, it really is quite enjoyable for the first 18 episodes and the finale. The 5 episode gap between them makes you want to curl up and sleep through it, it waffles on that long. It does have a fitting ending battle, but it just doesn\'t quite make up for the mass stalling in the few episodes prior. A few times in the first half of the anime you question just how messed up they made this anime as well as a couple scenes that make you question how they got away with just the ""Violence and Profanity"" tags. more aware of the situation, it slows with the action, takes longer to get through the explanations and reasoning behind a persons motives.Art styles are fairly disappointing for something made in 2007.

Infamous for their cg skills and lack of consistency. So bad they managed to bankrupt themselves. They certainly had their fair share of flops but I feel like their good side is far too often overlooked. Back before their collapse Gonzo was an interesting studio willing to take risks and actually had a good number of great anime to their name. One look at the likes of Gankutsuo shows just how experimental they were willing to get. Bokurano is one of their golden age titles that I’d been putting off for ages....Now finally having gotten around to watching it how does it stack up? I had pretty high expectations going in and for the most part wasn’t disappointed. The story is about a bunch of kids piloting a giant robot to save the world, stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Although this is indeed a mecha series the focus is firmly on the characters. I promise you Bokurano is no standard fare.We start with a bunch of kids at the beach for a summer camp, 14 middleschoolers and one elementary student to be exact. One of the kids suggests they go explore some nearby seaside caves. Within they come across an out of place cavern full of computers and electronic equipment. The mysterious owner of said equipment shows up and claims to be developing a video game that he wants the kids to help him play-test. They just have to place their hand on a shady looking pedestal to accept the contract to play a mech battle game. In which they must save the world from 15 alien foes. What could possibly go wrong?One of the first things you’ll notice is the character designs. Fairly plain, but more on the realistic side compared to the standard flashy anime designs. Which works well with the very human portrayal of the characters. They behave like middleschoolers should, for the most part. When it comes to fighting deadly mech battles they did come off as a bit too accepting and cool headed though. No this is not a happy show. It is full of death, destruction, despair and even some sexual themes. But it isn’t played up for melodrama. In fact the show is somewhat emotionally subdued overall. With an atmosphere of bleak hopelessness reminiscent of something like Tehxnolyze. Whereas the monster of the week style mech battles coupled with introspective exploration of middle school characters channels Evangelion. But in a much more straightforward way and without the religious symbolism. Besides the children, one other character worth mentioning is an adorable little mascot thing by the name Dung Beetle… Kyuubei is that you? Quick kill it with fire! The cast is unique and varied and while you might not remember all of their names straight away the show does a great job establishing their distinct personalities right from the first scene. This fantastic characterization continues through the whole show as we get to know each of them in turn. Perhaps the best part of Bokurano is how it explores each individual character. How they react and develop or devolve through the events of the show and when psychologically cornered. They are just kids forced into an unfair and cruel situation with a heavy responsibility they should never have been burdened with. Seeing their struggle and the different ways in which they deal with their predicament is fascinating. As well as imagining how this all will affect the people around them, which unfortunately we don’t get to see much of. Each one of them must come to terms with themselves and their fate in a sort of coming of age, then put the world on a scale. Is it even worth saving? What really matters to them? If even one of them can't find their own reason to fight, the world might just be doomed.But this is where the show also stumbles a bit. Not in the characters, but in the structure. We get to know a character for 1 or maybe 2 episodes before a battle occurs then rinse and repeat for each character for the majority of the series. This structure gets predictable and repetitive after a while. Another point that left me wanting was how each character arc would just cut off and we would never get any kind of epilogue, with the exception of Daiichi’s family in the very end. And as I mentioned, actually being shown the effects of the story's events on the people close to each character would have made for even greater impact. The true masterminds behind the whole plot are briefly brought up and even shown but never expanded upon which makes it feel like a loose end. I would have preferred it to be speculated on by the characters or not even touched upon rather than what we got. The way it was done made it seem like we would get further expansion on it, but then was completely ignored in the end.While the first episode looks very good, with expressive character animation helping to quickly define each character in the beginning, animation quality drops off slightly afterwards. Characters sometimes go off model but it’s good when it needs to be. The robot battles despite being cg have weight to them, like a 500m hunk of metal should (is it even metal?!). Entire buildings and city blocks are crushed and destroyed with every move. The battles are somewhat lacking in tension as the kids don’t usually struggle too much to win, but the weight of the inevitable consequences help keep you invested. And when there’s a giant alien mech trashing the city you can bet your ass the military and the government wouldn’t stay out of it. So it’s funny how authority figures are conveniently left out of the picture quite a lot in anime. But not here. They get involved pretty early on and attempt to take control of the situation and keep the kids in check. Although some important questions are ignored until later, it’s nice to see this aspect acknowledged for once.The music mostly blends into the background and unfortunately not much stands out here. That is if you don’t count the opening by Chiaki Ishikawa of See Saw fame. One of Yuki Kajiura’s earlier projects well known for their Gundam SEED endings. And you can't go wrong with Yuki Kajiura as far as I'm concerned. But Ishikawa's solo work here certainly lives up to her See Saw days. Uninstall is one of those op’s that will have you watching it through before every episode unable to skip it.When the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of middleschoolers and there’s not damn thing anyone can do about it. Except maybe a certain little mascot character, who is a total asshole by the way, so he ain't doin shit. I was compelled to finish all 26 episodes in just 2 days so it must be doing something right. I’ve heard that the manga is superior (big surprise…) and various things were changed or omitted from the original, including the ending. However I have yet to get around to reading it, and therefore can’t judge based on comparison to the source. So as it turns out this is another one of Studio Gonzo’s underappreciated gems. Sadly Gonzo is now a mere shadow of its former self and it is unlikely that we will see this kind of quality from them again. I give Bokurano an 8/10 and my personal recommendation, as little as that means. Now finally having gotten around to watching it how does it stack up?

The cast is unique and varied and while you might not remember all of their names straight away the show does a great job establishing their distinct personalities right from the first scene. This fantastic characterization continues through the whole show as we get to know each of them in turn. Perhaps the best part of Bokurano is how it explores each individual character. How they react and develop or devolve through the events of the show and when psychologically cornered. They are just kids forced into an unfair and cruel situation with a heavy responsibility they should never have been burdened with. Seeing their struggle and the different ways in which they deal with their predicament is fascinating. As well as imagining how this all will affect the people around them, which unfortunately we don’t get to see much of. Each one of them must come to terms with themselves and their fate in a sort of coming of age, then put the world on a scale. Is it even worth saving? What really matters to them? If even one of them can't find their own reason to fight, the world might just be doomed.But this is where the show also stumbles a bit. Not in the characters, but in the structure. We get to know a character for 1 or maybe 2 episodes before a battle occurs then rinse and repeat for each character for the majority of the series. This structure gets predictable and repetitive after a while. Another point that left me wanting was how each character arc would just cut off and we would never get any kind of epilogue, with the exception of Daiichi’s family in the very end. And as I mentioned, actually being shown the effects of the story's events on the people close to each character would have made for even greater impact. The true masterminds behind the whole plot are briefly brought up and even shown but never expanded upon which makes it feel like a loose end. I would have preferred it to be speculated on by the characters or not even touched upon rather than what we got. The way it was done made it seem like we would get further expansion on it, but then was completely ignored in the end.While the first episode looks very good, with expressive character animation helping to quickly define each character in the beginning, animation quality drops off slightly afterwards. Characters sometimes go off model but it’s good when it needs to be. The robot battles despite being cg have weight to them, like a 500m hunk of metal should (is it even metal?!). Entire buildings and city blocks are crushed and destroyed with every move. The battles are somewhat lacking in tension as the kids don’t usually struggle too much to win, but the weight of the inevitable consequences help keep you invested. And when there’s a giant alien mech trashing the city you can bet your ass the military and the government wouldn’t stay out of it. So it’s funny how authority figures are conveniently left out of the picture quite a lot in anime. But not here. They get involved pretty early on and attempt to take control of the situation and keep the kids in check. Although some important questions are ignored until later, it’s nice to see this aspect acknowledged for once.The music mostly blends into the background and unfortunately not much stands out here. That is if you don’t count the opening by Chiaki Ishikawa of See Saw fame. One of Yuki Kajiura’s earlier projects well known for their Gundam SEED endings. And you can't go wrong with Yuki Kajiura as far as I'm concerned. But Ishikawa's solo work here certainly lives up to her See Saw days. Uninstall is one of those op’s that will have you watching it through before every episode unable to skip it.When the fate of the world is in the hands of a bunch of middleschoolers and there’s not damn thing anyone can do about it. Except maybe a certain little mascot character, who is a total asshole by the way, so he ain't doin shit. I was compelled to finish all 26 episodes in just 2 days so it must be doing something right. I’ve heard that the manga is superior (big surprise…) and various things were changed or omitted from the original, including the ending. However I have yet to get around to reading it, and therefore can’t judge based on comparison to the source. So as it turns out this is another one of Studio Gonzo’s underappreciated gems. Sadly Gonzo is now a mere shadow of its former self and it is unlikely that we will see this kind of quality from them again. I give Bokurano an 8/10 and my personal recommendation, as little as that means."", ""It wouldn't be too outlandish to say that Gonzo has a reputation of having its earliest works (pre-2007) being its best. But being as unique as it is, Bokurano doesn't have enough to call itself the best of Gonzo's early works, but its certainly good enough to be considered great in its own regards, and something that the studio can be proud of. With a brilliantly cruel and tiring plot, but an all-too-known moral standing, Bokurano can keep its viewers on the edge, while giving them something meaningful to think about.When it comes to animation and design, Gonzo has never been a great achiever, albeit...they've gotten better over the years. But being released in 2007, Bokurano doesn't have much to stand out amongst other shows when it comes to how well animated characters are. The characters through most of the show are a bit half and half when it comes to how unique they are, apart from other shows. But there is a distinct art style in the show, and all things considered, there are many scenes where most of everything on screen blends well together, and background characters are drawn out fairly well, and there are a good handful of moments of quality above the rest of its sub-par to par animation. But the most glaring problem is that Gonzo had to resort to CGI for the giant robots. However, the mecha fights aren't the highlight of the show, so it's not as much of a crime as it would have been had that been the case.Bokurano's backbone is its psychological perspective on its cast, but that proves to be its strongest, and its weakest point. When the main plot device is introduced at the end of its first episode, the entire course of the show changes from a heroic and brave battle anime to a horrific and cruel, and extremely drawn out psychological torture. But what happens is that the show turns to shock value, which is obviously lost the very first time it happens. What follows is the deteriorating psyche of the characters, who slowly begin to understand the circumstances they're forced to act under. Unfortunately, because of this, Bokurano's myriad of characters become a struggle to deal with. Knowing their fates that come episode after episode, it's hard to squeeze in development for them which can be literally considered as 'last-minute.' From this, at least half of the cast become fodder for the other half. It was almost tedious to have to sit through the third quarter of the show because of the fact that the viewers know what will happen, but it's only a matter of time before it actually happens. But given the length, and the use of flashbacks and numerous sub-plots and backstories, Gonzo is able to make the most of what they have. Some characters that never really stood out from the beginning end up having their moment in the spotlight, that can both give inspiration to the viewer, and a reason to have sympathy. Interestingly enough, the most hated, or rather the most 'evilly' portrayed character ends up becoming the most noble and developed character in the show.Nothing stood out in particular when it came to voice acting performances, but the casting itself wasn't too bad. The voices fit the characters, some fitting a more childish role, some heroic, and some that pretty much matched the personality. Dung Beetle's voice actor hit the mark on the voice that really sticks a thorn in one's side with a bad attitude.Among other things, there are numerous parts about the show that can't be explained very well. Most of it is straightforward, and easy to understand, but there are a few things near the end that seem to be glanced over, or vaguely explained. The show itself can be considered somewhat open-ended, and that there is no actual conclusion when looking at the big picture.Bokurano can be seen as something of a gem in the industry, as it seems to have some roots of inspiration for future shows such as Madoka Magica, while itself gaining its own inspiration from Evangelion. It's far from perfect, but it's a good look at the cruelty of survival of the fittest, with a bit of political criticism towards warmongering or trigger happy military. Most of all, it offers a real sense of the human psyche in all different aspects. they've gotten better over the years.

When I first read about it, a few of my concerns were that the story line would be emotionally toned-down due to the fact that the main characters are children, that the characters would be annoying and/or difficult to relate to, and that the central theme of the story would not be enough to hold the characters and plot together well. Well, I was wrong on all accounts.On the surface, the anime may seem like a redundant theme: depressing circumstances and endings for characters who didn't seem to deserve it (Evangelion, most notably, I'm sure) that melds science fiction with...a present reality. However, it was handled very well, with enough explanations to satisfy present and necessary questions (like the process of choosing successors and how he/she came to be there, why the end of each battle has the result that it does, etc) without attempting to answer every question and explain every aspect. The plot itself was engaging and unique with moments of happiness sprinkled among the numerous moments of sadness.The art is not overly detailed or flashy, but I gave the artwork high marks for doing what the average anime doesn't: making all of the main characters look different from each other. This is one of the first ones I've seen in which the main characters have unique facial features, clothes, and hairstyles that don't automatically remind me of another anime character. Every character is distinct. Another reason for the high marks was that the characters changed their clothes sometimes. It may seem a little strange as a reason, but in many animes, the characters never change their clothes even once (unless for a one-time event or some such). The final reason is that the mecha actually looked good in its setting. Each robot was different and every part of the robot had a purpose, no parts (other than the face plate) were just for show.As for sound, the OP is absolutely perfect in accordance with the series. It has a haunting melody that maybe didn't seem to fit with the first few episodes, but by the end it will become disturbingly fitting. The ending themes were also good, but definitely nowhere near as poignant as the opening one. I also appreciated the variance in voices between voice actors. None of the characters had annoying or unfitting voices.The characters are probably one of the best reasons to watch this anime. There are initially 15 main characters (all of which are children), but others are introduced in time. Each character has different secrets and problems to deal with and overcome (or in some cases, crumble beneath) before they can face their challenge. Many of the problems are ones that are common in today's society such as bullying, depression, familial tension, and the bonds of friendship. Most if not all of the characters' stories deal with at least one other main character, too. Seeing the characters struggle against their problems is heartbreaking and usually changes your opinion of the character while making you re-evaluate yourself and your situation. Such a variety of characters and the depth that the viewer will see of them makes it nearly impossible for anyone not to connect with at least one character throughout the series.If you are a person who cries easily, you will need to keep some tissues nearby, but I can guarantee that you'll be moved by it even if you aren't crying by the end. I loved this anime, and I recommend it to anyone. a present reality.

I just want to have it mentioned that they're there.This review contains minor spoilers (mainly things you will find out pretty early on).The plot was quite promising as it would deal with people reacting on their certain death while sacrificing themselves for their family, friends and, well, the entire earth but it always felt empty, especially...when it becomes apparent that everyone is behaving in the most primitive ways - if their loved ones don't have a reason to live might as well let the entire world be destroyed. If they're happy, wellp, then there's a reason to fight for it. It's a matter of interdimensional wars and they all act on the smallest levels of morality.

They never get any closer to the discussion of WHY this brutal game has started. I mean weed out weaker dimensions? What ever for? Why do they have so much more power anyways?The moral question of killing other dimensions while maintaining your own is scratched but they decide not to think about it and just kill away anyhow. Sometimes in even more brutal ways than necessary. Even after revealing the interdimensionality and a slight uprise for a change of behaviour they will fall back into their old patterns simply mostly fighting or giving up because of personal issues.As to the systematic review:95% of the battles were decided in only one punch.Considering the enemy is the same as them, humans, you would think that most of them would have as much force power as them. But for some reason the studio decided to make it a boring one punch battle every single time. And if it isn't one punch it will mostly  look as dramatic as a sequence of 3 year olds punching eatch others heads.The music is rather boring most of the time and not very elaborated or memorable.There is close to no character development in anyone over the course of the entire show.There is so much more I'm furious about but this would spoil too much.However if you think that an extremely low moral system is fine, huge unexplained questions don't bother you and you tolerate toxic relationships  while watching a bunch of poorly animated kids one punch giant robots int he most unespectacular way please go ahead and give Bokurano a shot. when it becomes apparent that everyone is behaving in the most primitive ways - if their loved ones don't have a reason to live might as well let the entire world be destroyed.

I also thought it’s interesting for an anime to not have a central protagonist; rather, all fourteen of the kids are the protagonists. Then I thought “Oh, I get it: this the male version of ‘Madoka Magica’!” What do I mean? Well, both stories are about being tricked into a cruel destiny and then discovering the system is completely corrupt— “Bokurano” simply inserts robot fights instead of magical girls and witches.All that to say, Bokurano fits into several genres such...as mecha, survival game, mystery, psychological, and sci-fi. It contains themes such as the difficulties of growing up, the reality of death, the loss of innocence, the sacrifices that come with battle, and the evil of corrupt systems. If you’re looking for a happy anime or something with uplifting messages, don’t watch Bokurano. However, if you love dark anime like I do, then by all means give it a try! Some of the best elements of the series are noted below.Considering how much of the animation budget was probably allocated to robot fights, the rest of the art is fairly good, especially if you like slightly more realistic and less cutesy animation. Instead of being over-the-top like most fight scenes in anime, the impressive robot battles were refreshingly realistic. The music scores were fair, and the opening and ending songs are beautiful. Although the central plot felt somewhat unoriginal to me at times, it’s the variety of characters and their own stories that saved the series for me.Overall, “Bokurano” proved quite enjoyable, and I would give it three and a half stars out of five. Personally, my favorite thing about “Bokurano” is the discussion of parallel universes. I cannot elaborate, however, without giving spoilers. I will point out that many sci-fi and mecha series contain discussion of other planets, but relatively few deal with parallel or alternate universes. In that sense, “Bokurano” is like a rare gem.

It\'s a somber and introspective tale that captivates viewers with its unflinching portrayal of the human condition. While it may not be for everyone due to its heavy themes and unrelenting emotional weight, those willing to embark on this melancholic journey will find a thought-provoking and haunting experience.The premise of Bokurano revolves around a group of children who are unwittingly forced into a game that determines the fate of the world. Each child becomes the pilot...of a giant robot, known as a ""Zearth,"" and must engage in battles against otherworldly creatures. However, there\'s a cruel twist: for every victory, a personal sacrifice must be made, as the life of the pilot is extinguished. This central premise sets the stage for a bleak and emotionally charged narrative.One of the strengths of Bokurano lies in its character development. The series takes its time to explore the intricate psychological struggles faced by each child, delving into their fears, hopes, and insecurities. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent that Bokurano is not a typical mecha anime; it\'s a character study that examines the profound impact of impending doom on young minds.The animation style perfectly complements the show\'s somber tone. The muted color palette and subtle use of shadows create an atmosphere of melancholy, emphasizing the weight of the character\'s predicaments. The battles themselves are gritty and intense, but the focus remains on the emotional toll they take on the children rather than flashy action sequences.Bokurano\'s greatest strength also doubles as its biggest weakness. While the exploration of despair and human suffering is undoubtedly powerful, it can be emotionally overwhelming for some viewers. The unrelenting nature of the series may leave some feeling drained or even depressed. It\'s essential to approach Bokurano with caution and prepare oneself for the heavy emotional toll it exacts.Despite its somber nature, Bokurano leaves a lasting impact due to its introspective approach and willingness to confront difficult themes. It forces viewers to confront their own mortality and the fragile nature of existence, leaving them with a profound sense of reflection. However, it\'s important to note that this anime is not for everyone, particularly those seeking lighthearted entertainment or escapism.In conclusion, Bokurano is a masterful exploration of despair and the human spirit in the face of imminent doom. Its introspective narrative, well-developed characters, and poignant art style create a somber and thought-provoking experience. However, potential viewers should be aware of its heavy emotional weight and be prepared to face the depths of despair alongside the characters. Bokurano stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in challenging our perceptions of life, leaving an indelible mark on those brave enough to traverse its dark and sorrowful path. of a giant robot, known as a ""Zearth,"" and must engage in battles against otherworldly creatures.

I am not gonna give away the storyline but it is pretty much a tragedy so...... Yeah there will be tears .This is the anime I will say that I felt the most attached to the characters cuz their fates are inevitable .It is really good and bases most on how children(or rather how humans ) handle being faced with an inevitable death so...... Yeah it is kinda dark but I really enjoyed it...and YES !!! I cried several times .All in all it's a really good anime so just struggle past the first few episodes okay. and YES !!!

With a big cast, it is unlikely that all of their backstories are good and this show is no exception. Some are very good, some are okay, and some are so boring you completely forget about them. I liked the initial character back stories but somewhere past the half way point, I had more difficulty keeping up with the story and characters because I sorta stopped caring. First half is more character driven and the second half becomes slighty more plot driven while still focusing primarily on the characters.ArtIts okay I guess.

I thought it was unique in the sense that it was made up of fifteen people, and they each had their own good qualities about each other. It's a tear jerker in some parts, but yeah, I actually enjoyed it, and the animation style of each character make up is something I noticed quite quickly. I thought the named they used to call it was sort of bad ass actually. "", ""This was an odd watch for me. While at one hand, it had a really interesting idea and good excecution in the first half but it completely violated its own setup.The story is basically what would happen if teenagers got giant robots and it was a matter of life or death. While it certainly had a good start, it had so many wasted moments aswell. I later on went to read the manga and vastly prefer the manga ending over the anime. The reason the anime changed its ending was because the director was not a fond of the original author's ending and changed it...to give us a kind of happy ending? Imo any director who changes the author's intention is doing a disservice to them but thats another topic.The mecha designs are good, Soundtrack is good and the first 12 episodes were really good but then the events of the latter half left me feeling somewhat confused. I actually prefer the manga ending to the anime ending.Think of it like this, both the anime and manga offer a different ending. One has a hopeful ending and the other has a bleak ending.Without spoiling, this is the most I can tell you and its certainly something which you should experience for yourself. Which you like is upto you, but definitely do checkout the manga because chances are you'll like it more as that is the author's original intention (his vision is better than the director's imo). I dont know the exact reason for the director's choice to change the ending and final parts of the anime but oh well. To each their own.This was a good, although dragged out watch but it was good nonetheless. to give us a kind of happy ending?

The story seems very simple fifteen children explore a cave and inside  there they meet a mysterious man who tell them to play a game where a robot protects the earth from enemies the kids agree and while they have fun at first they realize...the shocking truth about the situation they are and the cost of it.Now I have to say that while the anime is mecha it doesn't focuss that much but instead it focuss on the children and their everyday routine but I will talk about this more later. The whole atmoshere the anime has is depresing and heavy it helps you to understand how the children feel now who are bind with a big delima and they can't ascape from it also there are some amaizing plot twists which makes the whole situation even havier and you can understand the motives of their opponents.To sum up is a really dark and sad plot which doesn't wants to entertain you but it wants to show you something deeper than what it seems to be. The art is just fine but cg is really well made. The opening [uninstall] is great and espesialy the lyrics which fit perfectly whith the whole theme of the anime the first ending is a bit forgetable but the second is the as good as the opening now the voice acting was just fine. And now let's talk about the greatest part of the show the characters. As I said above the characters are the core of the anime.Each child haves a different personality and by each episode we are watching their lifes and their problems which some of them are really serious and sensitive themes also their reactions are realistic and you can feel the fear and the despeir they feel because of the situation they go through each one of them have their reasons to fight and you can see this from their reactions and their way they fight.To conclude the characters are great and you can understand what they feel. Bokura no is one of these shows which doesn't created to entertain the viewer but to show you something a lot deeper it shows you that sometimes you have to do sacrifises to protect the people you care and that you should never lose your hope even in the most difficult situations. All in all Bokura no is a great anime yes it has faults but they doesn't ruin it and it gives you more than just entertament. 8/10 the shocking truth about the situation they are and the cost of it.Now I have to say that while the anime is mecha it doesn't focuss that much but instead it focuss on the children and their everyday routine but I will talk about this more later.

It is often referred to as Narutaru mk2 as both share a common theme. In Narutaru, children face torment and misery with a Pokémon-like twist, while Bokurano introduces the same distressing elements with colossal robots.Initially, this approach garnered attention, but subsequent releases like Madoka Magica, Rainbow, Made in Abyss, and Re:Zero have diluted the uniqueness of such shows. Despite this, a subset of anime fans continues to derive sadistic pleasure from narratives that relentlessly subject characters to suffering, using justifications of realism, depth, or maturity.The plot of Bokurano fails to impress, with children piloting...mechas to save the world presenting a tired trope. While the unique twist of the pilots dying upon mecha use adds a layer of misery, the overall plot progression is slow and unintelligent. The battles for Earth\'s salvation become secondary, and the story could easily be adapted to focus on the last moments of children with terminal diseases. The flashy robot battles contribute little to the narrative, overshadowed by the constant theme of suffering. Negative consequences in the series become overly convenient tragedies, reminiscent of classic mecha shows where the heroes always triumph.The central flaw in Bokurano lies in the fact that, for most of the series, the children have no control over their predicament. They were deceived into a situation with undisclosed drawbacks, forced to sacrifice themselves for the greater good without any agency. While the stakes are high, manipulating saviors into sacrificing their lives does not align with heroism; instead, it borders on malevolence. Describing the main characters as ""realistic and sympathetic"" feels inaccurate; they are ordinary kids with no influence over their circumstances. Their tragic situation becomes the only memorable aspect, as we struggle to recall their names.Furthermore, the mangaka\'s penchant for subjecting children to various forms of torture goes beyond the mere act of choosing death. The narrative layers additional hardships such as dysfunctional parents, burned homes, infidelity, and even harm to pets, creating an exaggerated sense of misery. Contrary to claims of realism, such elements contribute to a form of entertainment that revels in extreme, implausible, and sorrowful scenarios, suggesting a peculiar taste among viewers. mechas to save the world presenting a tired trope.

Notable episodes such as Scars and Family really hit home on some heavy existential and emotional themes and are two of my favorite episodes. This chunk of the anime ends right around episode 13 with Earth. The episode wraps up Maki's story (which was one of my favorites) and reveals a lot about the reality of the children's situation as pilots of Zearth.The second chunk of the series kind of loses me. The episodes...that follow Earth are centered mostly around the political conflict occurring around Zearth. I often found myself more confused than I was before during lengthy dialogue scenes that really had no bearing on the main plot of the series. This chunk ends with episode 18, Reality, where one of the main characters is unceremoniously killed off.The rest of the show is mostly very strong, but it still falls short. The last episode didn't feel very conclusive, and Kokopeli's backstory was very underwhelming.As I said before, the show was slated to be a masterpiece IF it continued its formula. Instead, it got lost in the sauce and dicked around until the final episode.

I do feel there's some bled potential here and there, but overall it's pretty good. The story is interesting and it the twists it presents are pretty good. I'd say this show could have the potential to be really, really good but it suffers a few drawbacks. Ultimately it still comes together quite nicely.Since there's 15 main characters, plus a handful of recurring side characters, and only 24 episodes you can probably guess at the pacing. It's fast. Each character's personal story arc gets about one episode. One episode doesn't seem like enough to fully flesh out a character, but...Bokurano does a pretty good job of it honestly. Each individual character's story feels like a complete little package. I am personally a bigger fan of a slow burn approach where characters develop and grow gradually over the course of the series, but the way Bokurano handles it's characters to introduce and explore so many characters in a short amount of timeworks quite well.I think the biggest gripe that comes to mind is the action sequences. Granted shows like this are more about the characters, the plot, and the drama. It's not about the action. But you can have both and other shows have had both. That's not to say Bokurano's action sequences are entirely awful, but the mecha battles are done with CGI and don't have much interesting choreography to them. This isn't a huge deal breaker because the main draw to the show was never mecha action, but it would've been nice to see more interesting battles especially since I think some of the mecha designs in this show are actually really unique and interesting. This what I meant by bled potential, there are some very unique and interesting mecha designs but the battles are often very short and simple.Ultimately I feel if action is a low priority for you and if you enjoy the sort of short story approach it has to introducing and exploring it's characters this show could easily be a 9/10. Personally I do like action a lot and the action felt too lacking for me. I also found it hard personally to get invested in the characters since I was given so little time to get to know them individually.

Just in terms of how much i enjoyed it i think this one tops that show. But its close.But yeah its a very characterdriven story. Theres...not much plot. And the plot thats there never goes deeper or explains some of the more intriguing parts. It just kinda drops it.

Timeless Medley Kizuna is what it is: a compilation movie of the TV series. Before I watched this movie, I was expecting much more from it. I expected to see new content from the creators since their last work was High Speed! Starting Days that was released in 2015. However, the movie pretty much skipped through the first season of the anime and mainly focused on the second season (Free!: Eternal Summer).Almost 80% of the movie was reused scenes from the second season of the anime, and a few snippets from the prequel movie. The movie's own soundtrack were also used in the...reused scenes and basically replaced the original music from the TV show. I did, however, liked the opening of the movie. If a person were to watch this movie before watching the 2 seasons or the prequel movie, it would lead to a lot of confusion to the viewer as the movie did not do a great job explaining the events of the prequel movie and the first season, as well as the characters. Aside from that, we only got 3-4 nice bonus scenes, although I expected much more. As a Free! fan, I kinda enjoyed the movie, but I expected more than reused scenes since there was a 1 year gap since their last work.TL ; DR: Free!

The story itself is and always will be outstanding, and so it deserves a 10. However, I\'m going to compare it to the rest of the Free! series because I think that\'s what most people are curious about.I\'ve seen anime do this before where they\'ll sum up a season of the anime with a movie. That\'s exactly what this movie is. You will get a few new scenes in this movies, which is the good part. For example, you\'re...gonna see a little montage of when Haru and Makoto first met. Are the added scenes necessary to understand the main story? No, but I actually thought they were pretty cool. There\'s another scene where Asahi walks behind Rei at a tournament while he talks about this ""glasses kid"" that recommended some mental training books to him in middle school. Rei recognizes his voice and stares at him as he walks away. So, it\'s those cool little Easter egg things that make this movie worth at least a skim through. You do need to have seen Starting days to get that last Easter egg, though.Other than that, don\'t watch this in place of the actual series. You\'re going to miss a lot of the details that you\'d get from the main series. It really does just focus on the main parts of Free!: Eternal Summer. That\'s another thing: it skips right by season one. You basically get a montage of Rin and Haru, and that\'s about it. Even if you watch the first season and then this movie, you\'re still missing a lot of supplementary content that you get in the second season.Personally, my recommendation is to watch everything else associated with Free! and then skim through this movie to look for the extra scenes. That\'s what I did, at least. Again, I rated this like I did because the actual main story of Free! is great (you can read my other reviews on Free! to find out why), but this movie is very much a summary and not a replacement for the series. Just keep that in mind if you decide to watch it.P.S. You do get some new Style Five music in this movie, so that\'s a bonus. gonna see a little montage of when Haru and Makoto first met.

That\'s another thing: it skips right by season one. You basically get a montage of Rin and Haru, and that\'s about it. Even if you watch the first season and then this movie, you\'re still missing a lot of supplementary content that you get in the second season.Personally, my recommendation is to watch everything else associated with Free! and then skim through this movie to look for the extra scenes. That\'s what I did, at least. Again, I rated this like I did because the actual main story of Free! is great (you can read my other reviews on Free! to find out why), but this movie is very much a summary and not a replacement for the series. Just keep that in mind if you decide to watch it.P.S. You do get some new Style Five music in this movie, so that\'s a bonus.', ""I watched this movie, hoping it would recall my memories of Free before I started the 3rd season. It didn't really work, because it recapped the 2nd season and skipped over the 1st season. What I did then was read Wikipedia summaries. Actually I should've just read all the summaries and jumped right into season 3. Yeah, that was a whole 1h30min gone. For the extra scenes, the other reviewers have commented on them. I forgot 90% of what happens in the original series so I don't really know which ones were the extra scenes and how significant they were.Overall the movie was pretty...warm and fuzzy. I don't know how well it stands on its own but it felt very complete. It's just a simple story of the swim club swimming in the tournament and also a coming-of-age story, basically the second season condensed. The movie didn't really help me with my initial goal of recaps but I liked it, if not just for the new Style Five songs. warm and fuzzy.

Hakuouki Movie 1: Kyoto Ranbu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13117/Hakuouki_Movie_1__Kyoto_Ranbu,"[""It is like the anime, just a review or summary. There is some changes, like you get to see Yukimura Chizuru use her demon power, but other than that don't waste your time watching this. I regret buying this, and watching it. It is basically the same to the anime  but it is split shorter and have some few new moments that have nothing really to do with the main part. You will get to see her brother more but it is not worth it. "", 'First of all, it\'s very important that you have already watched the TV serie before you watch this movie. This is NOT a recap movie, it DOES has some elements of the anime, but it\'s a RETELLING of the first story, with a completely different setting.As a brief summary, our story start when our heroine, Chizuru Yukimura, decide to go out and looking for her father, which had disappeared. As things go, she discover in the worst way that the streets hide more strange things that she have imagined: bloody creatures, ready to take her blood, as well as a group of young, good looking...and mysterious men that protect the peace on the streets. She\'s saved, but what\'s the cost? Now she knows too much, and it\'s taken as a ""hostage"" by the famous Shinsengumi.Here we discover that those men are surrounded by mysteries, and with a long war extending around the country. We have then 3 different stories: the Shinsengumi, fighting for their country (based on the original story of Japan); the furies, the mysterious bloody creatures that have a direct connection with Shinsengumi; and Chizuru, who\'s going to discover lot of things about her past and who she really is.CHARACTERSThe characters are very unique, especially the guys from Shinsengumi. They have very distinct personalities and for me it was impossible to hate any of them, even having my favorite. The villains are also very nice, it just feel they always go away in the most important part of the fights, but they still play their roles; I absolutely love Kazama and I loved how in the movie they showed his demon form not just in the end, it made him seems more interesting as a villain during the story than in the first anime. Chizuru is a thing for me, I don\'t like heroines from reverse harens because they\'re weak and stupid, and that\'s exactly what Chizuru is, she\'s just useless in all the stuff that happen around Shinsengumi imo, still, there\'s a very specific part in the movie where I loved her, it\'s an event that didn\'t appear in the TV serie and it\'s amazing, when you see, you\'ll definitely remember of this part here, \'cause it\'s where Chizuru shines in this movie. And well, secondary characters are also enjoyable, although they don\'t have much screen time here, since the movie is way more focused on the Shinsengumi.ANIMATIONThe animation is simply gorgeous. Studio Deen made an amazing work in this movie, everything seems so well made, a thing that didn\'t happen in the anime, where the animation is poor, without details and even the characters eyes seems without life; in the movie no, their hair and eyes are always shining, and I love it. Also the sceneries are beautifully done, the cherry blossoms and the moon, even a scene where it\'s shown a river it\'s perfectly done. I like to reinforce because Deen isn\'t one of my favorite studios, especially because they don\'t have quality in their animation, but they put all their effort to make this movie, it definitely seems something very expensive and well detailed.SOUNDThe background songs and the music for this movie are ok. I\'m not a fan of the sound for the anime but it\'s really enjoyable, and it fits for the scenes; in the movie, things aren\'t different, very similar background songs that fit with the fight scenes and all that old Japan atmosphere.Overall, this movie was amazing. Even without following lot of events from the original visual novel, I really liked to see a ""new route"" being created once more for this story, but also some scenes we didn\'t have in the previous TV serie. I guarantee this new retelling of the Hakuouki series is amazing! I dare to say is more enjoyable than the TV one, may be because of the new animation, may be because it\'s more focused on the main guys, or even because the main character got more attention this time, it’s perfect in many ways! So if you enjoyed the anime, you\'ll probably enjoy the movie too. and mysterious men that protect the peace on the streets. She\'s saved, but what\'s the cost?

Because both the television series and the movie are based off the otome game, there are many similarities between the two, but also many differences. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. The movie can be watched by itself, however, watching the series would help you better understand the characters.I really enjoyed both the series and the movie. The tones of each are complete opposites. The movie has a very serious undertone, with almost none of the comedic relief of the series, depending on your taste. The main thing...that made me love the movie was that it stuck pretty close to the otome game plot. With out spoiling the endings of either I was more drawn to the movies ending. It wrapped everything up very nicely and did not leave me with the disappointment the series did.The art in the movie is definitely softer then the television series. It is very easy to look at, and really allows you to into the movie with out any eyestrain.Overall, I have give the movie a solid 8 for entertainment. Even though I knew what was going to happen the movie still managed to keep me enthralled. It kept the most memorable parts from the game/television series, but still was able to throw fresh scenes so it did not bore the audience.  I would definitely recommend this movie to those who are fans of the franchise. that made me love the movie was that it stuck pretty close to the otome game plot.

I didn't connect with any characters like I usually do so I'm not taking that as a good sign and most of the movie was dull in my opinion.Nothing really eventful happened but I guess that's why there's a second movie - to put everything that should be...shocking into the final installment.It also kind of bothered me that Chizuru was only capable of calling out people's names over and over again...almost until the point where she sounded like every other whiny ass female out there.But with all that being said, I'm going to watch the second movie and hopefully I'll like that better than this one. shocking into the final installment.It also kind of bothered me that Chizuru was only capable of calling out people's names over and over again...almost until the point where she sounded like every other whiny ass female out there.But with all that being said, I'm going to watch the second movie and hopefully I'll like that better than this one."", ""What I enjoy about adaptations from otome games is how you can change things slightly and it still turn out true to the story and flows well. There is already an anime version that follows mostly Hijikata's route with story snippets of other characters. The movie is similar and follows the Kyoto Winds game where there is little romance, and purely story development. What makes the movie and anime different is the action scenes they included (I loved the sword fighting scenes especially). I won't deny that at first I was hesitant to watch the movie since I've already seen the anime, but I am...glad I did. You even get to see the extent of a demon's power. The timeline is slightly askew since they are only allotted a certain amount of time for a movie, so things may feel slightly rushed. I don't think it had a negative impact on the overall flow of things though. If you are a fan of the game or anime, definitely give the movie a chance as well. glad I did.

Free! Dive to the Future,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36704/Free_Dive_to_the_Future,"['If Free\'s second season was an improvement for the series, its third season is its all-time low.Free, in its best moments, may not have been anything more than mildly enjoyable (if teetering the line between \'fanservice\' and outright pandering), but in this case it has fallen below even being tolerable. Nonstop, incessant melodrama, focused not on the main characters but split between the dozens of irrelevant side characters around them who nobody watching the show actually cares half a dingdong about. Any humor or relaxing little moments are gone, with an endless barrage of melodrama from opening credits to ending credits. Yes, if that sounds...interesting to you, by all means, have yourself a blast.There are so many bloody characters in Dive to the Future that you will often forget who is who. KyoAni also assumes that everyone who watches Dive to the Future has also watched the prequel movie, High Speed, so you\'re also expected to care for characters you have probably never seen, or hardly remember. Depending on the way you divide things up, there are at bare minimum three different sets of characters, all largely doing their own thing for most of the season (one of these groups even living on a completely different side of the damn planet), with few important, and mostly minor connections holding them together. The high school group in particular is almost entirely irrelevant to the rest of the plot, them still existing only to appease fans of their characters who wanted to see more. Even by the final episode, there were still new characters being introduced, and by that point I had long since lost my patience. The ludicrous amount of subplots going on between Dive to the Future\'s seven million characters means there is so little time spent on each character that the viewer cannot get emotionally invested in any of them. It\'s like being given fifty dishes to sample, except all you get to taste from each of them is a tiny, minuscule amount on the tip of your tongue: would anyone actually feel full after that?To say I had any fun at all watching Dive to the Future would be a lie. Whereas most anime at least try to intersperse the drama with a light-hearted scene here and there, the melodrama in Dive to the Future is all there is. It is the entirety of the show, with not a single moment to breathe. By the time I had finished watching even one episode, I would already be fatigued enough to want a damn break. While the first and second seasons of Free also had plenty of the \'ol melodrama to go around, it was nowhere near the onslaught it is here. Ikuya is waxing philosophical about not being able to see the stars, and I think, well, gee, you live in the most urban country in the world and somehow the word \'pollution\' doesn\'t exist in your head. Hey, maybe I\'m just dead inside, but I think it has more to do with how it is impossible to empathise with any word the characters utter. Dive to the Future is processed through your ears and your eyeballs, but never through your brain or your heart.Some of the characters (Nagisa, for one-- boy, would I love to strangle this little dickweed at times) are infuriating as hell and do not even behave as actual people do. There\'s the flashback with Ikuya in the hospital, for example, where he smiles and giggles like a little schoolgirl whose mommy just bought him a new dollie. I suppose KyoAni believes that male characters should act \'moe\' in the same way that female characters do, as if men and women in Japan somehow have the exact same mannerisms and behaviours (breaking news: they don\'t). Oh, and the white-haired foreign-dude\'s voice actor was such an awful match for his character that it was actually laughable. I think KyoAni had a grand slammin\' total of one English voice actor available, and just handed him the job as their token foreigner, because, well, to be fair, Japanese people have no clue how white people actually speak.I guess if you like gay stuff, Dive to the Future is pretty gay. There are scenes like when Hiyori tells Ikuya to forget about other dudes (and look only at Hiyori), as he towers over a submissive Ikuya laying on his back. Cue rockin\' dupstep. Buuu-wuu-wuu. Everyone in this show is rainbow-ass-coloured gay, but KyoAni is only interested in teasing and playing pretend, for better or for worse, depending on how you prefer your gayness served.Unsurprisingly, there is no real conclusion to the story, with your sole reward for watching the show being a ""See you again in 2020!"" announcement in the final few seconds. Um, thanks, but rather than more seasons, I\'d have been much happier to see an actual ending to this one, which would have been possible if the show just focused a wee bit more on Haru\'s and Rin\'s central struggles and rivalry with one another, rather than all the superfluous rubbish surrounding the other forty-billion characters.I fail to see the purpose in Dive to the Future, in 2018, five full years after the first season, when hardly anyone except the most hardcore of fans still care about Free. And another sequel in the works? For what purpose, exactly? They cannot do anything of value with such a massive cast of characters by throwing another measly twelve episodes at it. Surely there\'s better creative and monetary endeavors that could be pursued instead, and, well, I guess there are, what with the coming of their next fangirl-friendly series, Tsurune, this fall.KyoAni always envisions these grand ideas on paper, but then give up midway when it comes to actually realising said idea. Were there twice or thrice as many episodes, a decent story might have been feasible, but with a cast this large and only twelve episodes, it makes you wonder if KyoAni is only capable of thinking in dreams, with reality somehow a distant concept to them. As long as they give the appearance of being something, so too do they believe they will truly become said thing. It\'s a bit like cosplay: if you\'re pretty and you act the part well enough, some who don\'t know any better might just assume you are the real thing. interesting to you, by all means, have yourself a blast.There are so many bloody characters in Dive to the Future that you will often forget who is who.

Eternal Summer was what it was called and it was H O T just like the name suggests. However, it was much more than that and left several different factors unanswered, for example, In s02e09, Haru said: ""What dream? What future? I have nothing of that sort!"" Other questions it rose were: The traumas behind our transfer student (not wanting to swim on the behalf of team, only on individual level), Haru\'s lack of motivation, and the disappearance / solitude phase of the best boy. Essentially, this 3rd season is exactly as the title promises: Dive towards...the future of our characters and that\'s pretty much how the story goes.The selling point of this season among its light hearted drama are the cast who are yet again showing what being a bro to your bro truly means. This is like all those cute girls doing cute things anime series except the cast focuses on boys (bros) doing cute (bro) things and they all are rather real characters (bros) instead from the moeblob side because these are real manly men. The single best part is how natural these bros act in every situation be it them spooning in bed or hanging out naked. It\'s only possible and #nohomo because they are real bros and so manly. It\'s rare to see male friends achieve this level of broship and that\'s pretty much why I like this show because all the other manly and bro shows (I really like manly and bro stuff) center around GAR Jesuses and muscle Moseses who are often also Gary Stu and practically immortal superhumans all muscles and spreading masculinity wherever they go. Free\'s cast is realistic and fragile, but it don\'t matter because they are so bro and support the shit out of each others, always.However, I don\'t think this series is especially good anymore because it only has few things going on and most of what it had to offer was already seen in the first 2 seasons anyway. I.e. it got old. Worth of watching, but really I could have personally lived without this season. the future of our characters and that\'s pretty much how the story goes.The selling point of this season among its light hearted drama are the cast who are yet again showing what being a bro to your bro truly means.

Partly that is due to the vast expansion in the main cast and obviously because of that, not all characters got to have the screentime needed for their characters to develop or to do much with the characters. However overall I feel like what has been accomplished, was done pretty well.This season's major flaw however is the slow pacing of the first half of the season. The first couple episodes felt so so slow and I also understand that time is needed to introduce new characters and establish what is happening with all of them,...but it just felt too long. On the other hand the pacing in the latter half was fast, which in a way mirrors competitive swimming and it makes you hyped up for the races. I feel like most of the fanbase feels the same way and it's so unfortunate that that happened and might have turned off some people from watching more, because the latter half is done really well and feels exciting and is immensely enjoyable.Ikuya and Toonu's drama felt... I guess it was needed, but it felt too similar to previous Free! seasons, so that almost undermines the whole point of this season, which is the characters are growing up. I guess because they grew up the drama only lasted half a season now, instead of a whole. I understand that a lot of attention was needed to develop Ikuya's and Toonu's characters and story arch, but I can't help but feel like TOO much time was spent on their drama, when it could have been spent on, ya know, actual swimming.Long time fans of Free! will love seeing all the characters come together (I myself teared up quite a bit when that happened) and it is lovely to see so many bonds form between characters. The new characters are pretty good (however the girls are all very unfortunately underdeveloped (then again, the story doesn't really focus on them anyway, but it's still sad that that is still the case)) and they are introduced quite well.Tonally, the series truly feels like the main characters are slowly growing up, but that does not mean that they are suddenly fully fledged adults either. I feel a ridiculous amount of pride for these fictional characters and seeing them grow up, but still remain their same personalities and quirks and characteristics. Especially Haru feels like he has finally reached a point in his life that might have been unimaginable to him a couple years ago. He has come a long way from the 'I only swim free and I by twenty I will be ordinary' guy.Could this season have been made better? Definitely. I feel like this season should have been 24 episodes long, so there would be more time for all the characters to be relevant and develop. I hope that the next season will keep the pace from the last episodes. (2020..... ㅠ ㅠ )In the end, I still love Free! dearly and the characters are all very precious to me, so I will always be biased. However I can still see the major flaws in this season and I can only hope that next season will be handled better. The things this season did well however, were done really well.

We get to see Haru and Makoto lives after finishing high school, which we don't see a lot of, as they face new challenges and problems that come with the higher competitive world of swimming.This season we get introduced to Ikuya, a childhood friend of both Haru and Makoto, and he is shown to be very cold to others at the start for certain reasons which are then told later into the series, Haru, Makoto and everyone else has to help him get over his past trauma and worries so he...can become the lovable kid he once was. Now that is pretty much how the first half of the series is in simple and non spoiler-ish way.Now the second part is Haru training for the All Japan invitational Tournament. We get briefly introduced to some other competitors to see what kind of opponents Haru and Rin will have to face in this tournament. Although it's not has drama heavy as the first part it is more intense and exciting, and then we get to the tournament and then the final episode were it leaves off finishing the qualifiers (kind of) and then teases us with sequel to come soon.Overall to say if this was better then season two I would have to say no as season two was was absolutely fantastic. Compared to last season this was a little bit rushed at some parts and some things just sort of worked out for the sake of it having to work out but it didn't happen to much so it did not degrade my love for this season at all. can become the lovable kid he once was.

First, I don't believe anime should be judged by their fanbase as they have nothing to do with the show itself. It's not like whoever produced the show asked their fans to ship characters etc. Second, I believe in objective reviews, which is why it pisses me off that so many of the top reviews on this site are just memes but doesn't say if the show is actually good or not. If I wanted meme reviews I would just go to gigguk's channel as he does them far better than people here.Overall, I...believe Free! is a genuinely a good show tho somewhat flawed. If you want intense sports show I wouldn't recommend watching this as Free! is mainly a slice of life and more about its friendships/rivalries rather than intense matches. This season, in contrast with the other ones, has more than one story going on and constantly goes back and forth between scenes, which is why I think its inferior to the other seasons since it always felt like there is too much going on but is still good nonetheless.Plot (7/10): This season starts with Haru and Makoto going to the same college, Rin going to America, and Nagisa and Rei managing the new team back in Iwatobi high school. Like I said earlier, there are too many things going on, so it sort of leaves a mess rather than focusing development on a single story like what they did in previous seasons. The drama introduced in the story does seem to take an interesting turn with the appearance of Haru's middle school friend, Ikuya, and his new change in attitude in swimming, making the audience want to find out more about what make him cold and distant. There are several other interesting parts to the story but I don't want to spoil them.Animation (8/10): The animation in Free! looks amazing, clean, and pleasant to look at, as expected of KyoAni. Although its not as good as hyouka, the water scenes are still breathtaking to look at, so no flaws here.Sound (8/10): The opening sounds lit but the ending...a little eh imo. The soundtracks they played were awesome tho.Characters (6/10): Biggest problem in this season. There are way too many characters introduced and none of them felt well developed. They all felt like the same person to me. Ikuya is just basically Haru (cold, quiet, a good swimmer) but forced into being his rival. Still tho I'm interested to see how the show will develop them later on in the story and hopefully we'll understand them better later on.Enjoyment (7/10): So far I'm enjoying this season although its not my favorite one.

With all our old favorites, and new characters, the plot is more dramatic than ever. Now that Haru, Makoto, Rin, and Souske have graduated, we get to see what their future holds and what the future has in store for the swim club without their older members.Dive to the future is my favorite season so far. With a perfect mix of humor, drama, and swimming it takes everything to a new level. Obviously, if you are new to the series watch the first two seasons, Starting days, and Take your marks first....(A prequel movie to the first season, and a movie that leads up to season three)Story 10/10: The story is filled as many twists and turns as always, with new characters being added, and old characters reappearing. A lot of gaps of what happened to characters are filled, and everything slowly comes together. It's excellent.Art 10/10: From the cherry blossoms, to the water, to the eyes of the characters when anything dramatic happens, the art of Free! Is superb.Sound 10/10: The Opening and ending themes are fantastic, as well is the general background music during the show, often adding a powerful effect to dramatic scenes (of which there are many)Character 10/10: Every single character in this show is unique and wonderful with interesting back stories and personalities that add different aspects to the show. From the main characters, to side characters, all are perfectly crafted characters that I guarantee you will fall in love with. Seriously. It's a problem. I have to many swimming children.Enjoyment 10/10: Free! has always been by far one of my most favorite anime's of all time, and this season is no different. I find myself counting down the days for the newest episodes, and terribly sad when they end and I have to wait another week for the next. This anime is truly a creation lots of people could enjoy. With it's themes of friendship and swimming, and incredible plot twists, it's not just a show for people who like muscles to watch, as some seem to believe.  I fully enjoy this show, especially this season, and everything it has to offer. Swimming, friendship, drama, humor, great music, fantastic animation, unique and wonderful characters, Free! has it all.Overall this season is a solid 10/10. So Free! fans rejoice! It doesn't get any better than Dive to the future! I can't wait to see what the rest of this outstanding season brings us!

I love it as much as anyone, but you have to admit the title fits. More now than ever.One of the best parts about watching anime is seeing a series you loved get another season. The characters you spent so many hours getting to know, the scenery you spent admiring *cough*, the thrilling parts that made you sit up in bed to get a better look, and the emotional parts that made you cry.Free! Dive to the future is a great example of that.I’m not saying it’s perfect, because it’s not. Heavens knows there were far...too many characters this season to fit in any real screen-time for most of them. The show ends on a heart-warming but annoying cliff-hanger as usual. Nagisa’s voice is still far too high to ever be believable for a 17 year old guy. And Gou is still just there to harp on about how fabulous muscles are. I will be amazed if someone finds me a line where she doesn’t mention either Rin or muscles.But watching everyone get back together again was just fantastic. The world of competitive swimming is a small world, and most people seem to know each other. Heck, most people are friends, and have to struggle to cheer for each other and strive to beat each other at the same time.Despite not having much screen-time, most of the cast have grown a lot. Most are in Uni or older, and it shows. They can be more honest with each other. They support each other’s way of life. They’re patching up broken friendships, maintaining relationships, and focussing on their careers more and more.Rin, Nagisa, and Rei had their main development in S1. Sousuke and Nitori had theirs in S2. Makoto’s and Haru’s are spread out all over the place – both get featured a fair bit in S3. But the main source of development, at least in the first half, is Ikuya.[Note: Here’s where you’re gonna want to have watched the movie, because it provides some very useful background information. If you’ve watched ‘Starting Days’, you’ll know who Ikuya, Asahi, and Natsuya are. You’ll be able to compare their kiddie selves to their adult selves. And these three are quite important in S3, because of how they interact with each other and the rest of the group.]Ikuya, along with Asahi, is a member of Haru and Makoto’s old swimming team (no, not the one with Rin in). His story is surprisingly similar to Rin’s, but his personality is more similar to Haru’s. Add in a loyal but rather possessive best friend (who himself is quite well-developed and stops being irritating after a while), a concerned older brother, and a ‘chance’ encounter with the former team, and you’ll get some pretty gripping drama. It’s nothing we haven’t seen before in Free!, but you don’t need to fix what’s not broken. I was eagerly waiting for the next ep every week.Finally, the swimming tournaments are still exciting to watch, but in a different way to before. It’s less a question of ‘will they qualify or won’t they?’ and more a question of ‘who will be first?’ Because we all know by now that the mains qualify in at least one race each.Watching them swim just means watching them spend some quality time together, training hard and having fun. This is a slice of life, after all. Relationships are what we’re here for.(Well, that and the swimsuits 😉)Let’s put it this way.

So far, though, I have to say that everything about this first episode makes me think that Free!: Dive to the Future will be amazing, and exactly what the fans of the anime would expect (this is definitely a compliment) and had been hoping for.We get to see our main characters back in action but this time all grown up and in a different context (which I think is pretty great, as we rarely get to...see high schoolers actually leave high school in animes) and, at the same time, we finally get to see some old characters and how their lives look like today. This is a testament to Free!\'s ability to present new characters and make the audiences get attached to them with only a couple of episodes, which then gives the writers room to explore these characters in future installments of the anime such as Free!: Dive to the Future.I think most of us would openly admit that Free! is sort of a guilty pleasure. How could you reasonably explain to your friends that an anime about some guys swimming and competing against each other is SO good? It is difficult to explain, yes, because this show is SO MUCH MORE than that tagline. Free! and all its sequels have been consistently entertaining, emotional, intense but never overly dramatic, and simply fantastic. The story about this group of friends, with their problems and hopes, all wrapped up in this context of ""sports anime"" that keeps it all the more exciting, makes Free! (and all its sequels and prequels) an excellent anime, much better than you would ever imagine when you first read its synopsis.Free!: Dive to the Future, just like its prequels, is the perfect summer anime, as it is ideal for these summer afternoons where you just feel like laying on the couch and enjoying a good time. However, it would be a mistake to label it only as a ""feel good"" anime, because even if it definitely qualifies as one, it is way more than that.With all the above I want to really get the point across that Free!: Dive to the Future is as good, if not better, than all its predecessors. The creators of the show know what we fans want, even when we ourselves don\'t, and they gave it to us in the perfect package. So if you\'re a fan of the series, what are you waiting for?

The first 2 seasons exceeded my expectations… as if half-naked, dripping wet bishies weren’t enough, there was also solid plot and character development. These swimming boys endeared themselves to me and I was beyond excited for their return years after Eternal Summer.However, as much as I’m reluctant to admit this, I don’t find the new season anywhere near as good as its predecessors. I have many gripes about Dive to the Future, such as:- Not enough intense swimming races- Not enough Rin (isn’t he supposed...to be the deuteragonist)- Too much Hiyori (he is so meddlesome and annoying… I have never disliked any character from this series until him)- Not enough Rei and Nagisa (they get even more shafted on screen time than Rin)- New iwatobi members aren’t interesting enough for me to care about them- Don’t care about Ikuya (most of the season is devoted to his development and I don’t find him to be a compelling character… his personality is somewhat reminiscent of season 1 Haru except more boring)- Not enough college lifeLast but not least, my main problem with the show is how it tries to cram in way too many new characters. With only 12 episodes, the show is unable to spend much time on each person and give them proper development. None of the new characters made an impression on me or made me care about them in any way. What really made the first two seasons shine was the camaraderie between the central characters, which is something that is lacking in the third season since they’re all in separate places and don’t have heartfelt interactions anymore. Their development was nicely wrapped up in the first two seasons, so it seems as if KyoAni didn’t know what to do with their characters anymore. Still, I would have preferred less focus on the new characters and more focus on the boys I have come to know and love. to be the deuteragonist)- Too much Hiyori (he is so meddlesome and annoying… I have never disliked any character from this series until him)- Not enough Rei and Nagisa (they get even more shafted on screen time than Rin)- New iwatobi members aren’t interesting enough for me to care about them- Don’t care about Ikuya (most of the season is devoted to his development and I don’t find him to be a compelling character… his personality is somewhat reminiscent of season 1 Haru except more boring)- Not enough college lifeLast but not least, my main problem with the show is how it tries to cram in way too many new characters.

Instead, what fans got was more of the Starting Days characters and new characters to look forward to in the 2020 project. Of course, you didn\'t know that when you started watching but you have to have faith, ne?  Haru and Makoto are very together in Tokyo,  contrary to what S1&2 Director Utsumi said would happen, a big plus for Makoharu shippers, of which I am one. Rin got sassy with Sousuke, which was also a good deal of fun...to watch. Reigisa didn\'t get enough screen time, but neither did the new Iwatobi crew, though it\'s good to know they have new members with Gou Matsuoka, Miss Amakata and Goro Sasabe all reprising their supportive roles. The Samezuka boys returned to keep the friendships lively and the brand new characters were intriguing and sure to return in 2020.Personally, I enjoyed the season from start to finish. The drama brought on by the reappearance of Ikuya Kirishima and his best friend Hiyori Toono was solid, if frustrating, since it gave us a view into what a dysfunctional Makoharu would have looked like instead of the supportive relationship it is and remains.  Natsuya\'s brief visit with Rin in Australia was a hoot as it forced the swimmer into examining his obsession with Haru and his friendship with Sosuke in the funniest of ways. The new pro coaches brought into the picture were delightfully quirky and Haru\'s competition on the global stage was truly phenomenal and threatens to remain so.What stands out, as always, are the bonds of friendship between these characters, especially between the Iwatobi crew with Haru and Makoto reuniting with Asahi Shina and Kisumi Shigino, along with Ikuya, Hiyori (eventually) and Nao Serizawa; and the Samezuka crew with Rin, Sosuke, and their former schoolmates. It\'s broship at its best.  If you want to cry ""gay baiting"" you can, but why not view it as a positive spin on the queer community? I don\'t need to see fornication in het shows to feel the love and friendship between couples so why do I need to see it between gay couples? I don\'t, but I know when it\'s there and recognize it.As a ordinary viewer, the sports anime aspect does fail a bit as there isn\'t much swimming as I\'d hoped to see. I love Kyoani\'s water animation. As a shipper, especially a Makoharu shipper, I couldn\'t ask for more. It\'s clear Haru and Makoto are already ""together"" or on the verge of a serious relationship. Thank goodness the ""love triangle"" facing off Makoharu and Rinharu was ditched with the change of directors after Eternal Summer. Rinharu shippers are still hopeful for a miracle, but they\'re just in denial at this point.In summary, DttF was a wonderful S3 and I thoroughly recommend it. Those who disliked it are probably disgruntled fans who either were hoping to see hugs and kisses or a continuation of a RH vs MH online feud. Or they realize that their 12 y.o. self is going to be in their 20\'s by the time the next segment is out and they\'re not likely to care at all. Me?

The studio did a wonderful job of combining all previous seasons and movies into this show in such a short period (12 episodes). That being said, if you have not recently watched the movies/anime it might be hard to keep track of which character is which as this season incorporates many more characters compared to previous seasons.As someone who has participated in sports in High School, a lot of themes were very similar and I often found myself reminiscing about past sports experiences. They did a good job of balancing what actually...happens between friends and people who are not necessarily close but are acquaintances due to playing the same sport while also dramaticing some parts to make it more interesting.I'd like to end off that I prefer this style of focusing on the races and competition than the friendships/rivalries that previous seasons/movies had. This season still had that but included many more races and explored different styles of swimming as opposed to the typical medley relay that we often saw in previous seasons/movies. happens between friends and people who are not necessarily close but are acquaintances due to playing the same sport while also dramaticing some parts to make it more interesting.I'd like to end off that I prefer this style of focusing on the races and competition than the friendships/rivalries that previous seasons/movies had.

It is based on a bunch of guys involved in the sport, a protagonist of course, & their path towards going professional starting from their childhood. Efforts matters, and their skills, experience, luck, surroundings, friendship, passion, motivation,... will be significant to define where & how fast they progress. The show is 'slice of life', drama.Highlights :- Hot,...ripped (lean) guys.- Fluid animation during swimming, especially when they swim.- Slice of Life movements- Information on the sport.Someone interested in sports (physical activities), particularly swimming must surely check out this one.

Just wow.I never expected an anime like Free! to be one of my all time favourite anime I've watched ever, but it did.The first two seasons were great and season three did not fail to impress me, even more than the two first seasons.Story:I've enjoyed the story more than I could say and there were always so much drama and that was great, the anime is very dramatic and of course season three had to have it as well.Art:...The expressions of each unique character also had their own unique expressions and they were all so beautiful.Sound:The voice actors did one amazing job, both the english ones, and the japanese ones.They were so well fitting with the characters each and everyone and I quickly pointed out my favourite voices.I hope there are more amazing actors to come in the next season.Character:I'm not sure what MYA means by that but everything was on spot either way.Enjoyment:I enjoyed it, from start to finish, amazing work and I'm so thrilled to know that there will be a fourth season.Overall:Outstanding, perfect, amazing.I love the Free! anime, and season three is by far my favourite one.New characters, characters that we know from the movies, are gathering together and I have been waiting a long while to see how it would turn out.Thank you so much for making this anime that easily reached my top 3 list of all time anime that I have watched.(Partly because of the hot guys mwaahahah)Thank you for reading and may you enjoy this show and support it!

We get to follow him and several other characters with their respective problems. I’d say the main focus is identity - who you are as a person and what you want to be.We get to see characters like Makoto trying to find his own path in life and Sousuke, who is concerned about a surgery that may or may not be the end of his career as a swimmer. Rei, Nagisa and Gou are studying their final year at Iwatobi. We get to see them with new recruits for the swim team.These are only some...of the sub-plots in this season.“If these are the sub-plots, then what’s the main plot?” you ask?To be frank, they should’ve just named it “Free! Two Lovers’ Promise” because about 65% of this season focuses on Haru and Ikuya’s *Cough*romance*Cough* friendship.Although I’m overjoyed to see so much of Ikuya and seeing him (and Haru) develop as a character, it doesn’t give much time for the other characters and events. In the end, episode 11 and 12 feel a bit rushed, which is why I’m giving the story 8/10. The way the guys are trying to find their own identities and lifetime goals is not only inspiring but also touching.Characters (7/10)I’m very proud of Haru this season. Everyone who has watched the previous seasons or at least Starting Days are well aware of Haru only swimming free and nothing else.In episode 7 and 8, we get to see Haru practice for- and participate in the individual medley just to keep his promise to Ikuya. The fact that he stopped swimming only free for a moment shows how far Haru is willing to go for the people he cares about.Makoto and Rei share a similar dilemma. Neither of them knows what they want to do with their lives. With some help from Nao, Makoto realizes what he wants to do in the future.Rei on the other hands never got this realization. He does think about his future, but never mentions his options.As for Nagisa, we don’t get to hear much from him at all, which is a bit disappointing. His ‘major’ development was in the first season and his character has been a bit flat since then. Yes, he has become a better swimmer and has a charming personality, but he hasn’t changed much, has he? Does he still want to become an astronaut or an adventurer?Rin is doing fine. He’s still aiming to become the number one swimmer in the world.Sousuke has an interesting scenario. His doctor suggests a surgery if he wants to continue swimming. The problem is that this surgery may or may not end his career. The problem is that we don’t get to see much about this.Natsuya also gets some development. In the beginning of this season, he swims and participates in races just to get money. He uses the money to travel to another country in the world, races, wins money and then the cycle just repeats. As the story goes on, he eventually stops swimming just for the money and starts taking swimming seriously again.Even Nitori - the only character who I couldn’t stand in the first two seasons - was okay in Dive to the Future. He didn’t do anything outstanding, but he didn’t annoy me either.I’m also happy to see how much Ikuya has grown since childhood. Especially his swimming.Now for the newer characters. First we have Ikuya’s “best friend” - Hiyori (Seems a bit one-sided from Hiyori’s part). He and Nitori are the only two characters in Free! that I dislike. Like I said earlier, Nitori was much more bearable in this season. Hiyori wasn’t. In my opinion, Hiyori is a selfish, illogical, rude and manipulative control freak. He’s far too judgmental towards Haru and the others despite never meeting them, he makes decisions for Ikuya without Ikuya’s consent and goes out of his way to prevent Haru from talking to Ikuya. “Maybe he just doesn’t want Ikuya to get hurt again” Nope. After his race against Makoto, Hiyori clearly states that the reason why he won’t let Haru and the others approach Ikuya is because they’re too weak, not because he wants to protect Ikuya from getting hurt again. He also seems to be rather delusional as he considers himself as the little mermaid who saves the prince (Ikuya) from “sinking” (depression). Where did he get that idea from? According to Ikuya, he has been feeling like this for years. Hell, Hiyori (unintentionally) made Ikuya’s depression even worse. He also never apologizes to neither Haru nor Ikuya for his behavior. Hiyori's entire purpose in this season is to be a pain in the ass. That’s literally it.Then we have Haru’s new “challengers” - the world record holder in freestyle Albert Wåhlander and the mysterious swimming prodigy Kaede Kinjou. The anime makes such a big deal about them (Especially Albert), but we never get to find out much about these two except that Albert has a coach named Ralph (Or is it Ralf?) and is a world record holder from Sweden. But Kaede? Nothing. Then only time we see him in action is in the very last episode where he participates in a race.This category gets only 7/10. Hiyori single-handedly removed one point, one point off from the lack of development for Rei, Nagisa and Gou and lastly, one point off for showing close to nothing about Albert and Kaede.Designs and animation (10/10)As expected from Free!, it has beautiful animation. And somehow, the anime managed to make the guys even better looking.Am I the only one who thought Nagisa looked a bit more…mature this season? He used to look younger and rather child-like compared to the other guys. Now he’s starting to look like a man. They grow up so fast…I didn’t see any (major) flaws with the animation and the character designs look good. Even the clothes the characters wear for the ending look good. The hat Nagisa is wearing gets a bonus point.Therefore, I’m giving this category a solid 10/10.Voice acting and music (10/10)The ‘older’ voice actors were good, as always while the ‘new’ actors also did pretty well. Kudos to the voice actors of Ikuya, Albert and Hiyori.Despite despising Hiyori, I think Ryouhei did a good job with portraying the character and making him sound like a real piece of shit. Especially the first five episodes.After hearing Rin’s broken english despite living in Australia for years, I’m surprised Albert spoke perfect english. No stereotypical Nordic accent, no awkwardness. And if he has always lived in Sweden, I’ll be even more surprised.The opening theme Heading to Over and ending theme Gold Evolution were both catchy and suited the anime. Though, I wish they could’ve “tossed the rock a bit further” with the opening theme as it resembles the opening themes of the previous seasons - Rage On and Dried Up Youthful Fame - a bit too much. Still, I must admit that I never skipped the opening or the ending of Dive to the Future. Actually, I listen to their full versions often.Once again, I’m giving out a full score. 10/10 for the voice actors’ performances and the kick-ass music.Ending (7/10)As I’ve already stated, this season focuses a lot on the bond between Haru and Ikuya for the first 8 episodes. After episode 8, they’re rarely seen together, let alone talk to each other.Why would the staff put so much time and effort into their relationship and then just be like “Their drama is over now, so let’s completely move on and make them interact as little as possible because Ikuya is completely irrelevant now”. Of course, I didn’t want Ikuya to get all of Haru’s interactions, as characters like Makoto and Rin are also important. However, I think it was rather disappointing and lame how they almost completely ignored Ikuya for the remaining episodes when they made a such big deal about him (and Haru) earlier. Most of his appearances in episodes 9-12 are just cameos with the only exception being his race in the individual medley. He doesn’t say much. He’s just standing there to show that he still exists.I’m also a bit disappointed that the only three characters succeeded with their races. The others failed and the final race was left on a cliffhanger.To be frank, if it hadn’t been for the character development of Haru, the Kirishima brothers and Makoto, I would’ve given this category a lower score. Most of the other characters’ developments stand still during the season. The only (other) characters who came close to a good development but tripped right before the finish line were Hiyori and Sousuke.Either a new movie or season was confirmed at the end of episode 12. Hopefully, the newer characters (Hiyori, Iwatobi rookie-trio, Albert and Kaede) will get their proper developments.Episode 11 and 12 felt a bit rushed. It was almost as if the staff was trying to test themselves regarding how many things they can make happen in just one episode. Because of this, it made episode 12 lack charm. Yes, there were meaningful moments. However, those moments were a bit less effective than intended, which is the result of what happens when you try to make too many things happen in a 20-minute episode.For that, Dive to the Future gets only a 7 for its ending.Summary (42/50 - Great)Although a few things about this season left me a bit disappointed, it was overall a good season and I’m glad I watched it.I don’t know whether their next project is a fourth season or a movie. Regardless, the bar has been set pretty high since I’m expecting the next movie/season to provide with everything Dive to the Future lacked:- Goals in life for Rei, Nagisa and Gou- A continuation of Hiyori’s character development- Character developments for Albert and Kaede- Haru interacting with his parents- And most importantly - More of Steve the CatAnd that’s my review of the third season of Free!.I’ll be looking forward to the next project.Just two years left… of the sub-plots in this season.“If these are the sub-plots, then what’s the main plot?” you ask?To be frank, they should’ve just named it “Free!

But for me Dive to the Future was something special, something unique, something i would\'ve regretted not experiencing. One of the main reasons i love this show is because of the fact that it is a sports, slice of life anime. As a matter of fact this is one of the only animes i have seen, which had a combination of sports and slice of life. Every other sports anime you see is just this : there is a <sport> club which has mediocre members and a...charismatic captain, and the freshmen who join the ""underdog"" school\'s team take the team to nationals, and along the way meet a few rivals. Don\'t get me wrong, there are also shows which are great even though they are generic, but Free!\'s story was much more than just a bunch of weak individuals getting ""stronger"", and that made it far from what makes an anime generic. The anime in some parts of the story took a philosophical approach in overcoming problems. I wasn\'t really involved with the characters or the story when this series started, i mean like i previously mentioned... i have already seen the ""sports anime template"" that most of the sports anime portray, but as time passed i started loving the show. At the end of the day it isn\'t an anime that i would recommend someone to watch because like i previously mentioned the opinions that you get for this anime is very decisive and controversial, but personally i enjoyed it a lot.         : )*This is my first review lol, forgive me if it wasn\'t what you wanted to read or if i wasted your time charismatic captain, and the freshmen who join the ""underdog"" school\'s team take the team to nationals, and along the way meet a few rivals.

Our dose of the old boys, swimming, and of course, delicious abs. What more can we ask for? I was expecting the novelty of the whole sports element to wear off for me at this point (after all, most of what I can recall from the first two seasons was just really enjoying the beautiful characters and tension between the them) but I found myself pleasantly surprised. Apparently, the makers have not lost their ability to make swimming interesting.Let's begin by discussing the story-- this is a spoiler free review,...so I won't reveal much other than yes, as the title states, this takes place a little bit after the second season. If you haven't seen both seasons, I would highly recommend that you watch them, but if you have seen them but just forgotten most of what happened (which happened to me, unfortunately), worry not! The story is very clean and current, and so far, not confusing at all. Even with the basic background knowledge of the five main characters from the past two seasons, you should be able to enjoy this thoroughly.Next is the art--- oh boy, it was breathtaking. So many times I had to rewind because I had literally zoned out staring at the gorgeous art. The water, the cherry blossoms at the beginning of the first episode, the character designs (and abs, dear god) are all gorgeous and it's easy to see how much effort went into this.As for the sound, the opening theme was pretty fun, but I preferred the closing myself. Perhaps I was a little biased by the beautiful, hot characters dancing their hearts out... regardless, closings for Free! have never disappointed.The characters have all changed but haven't changed, if that makes any sense whatsoever. They all retain their main elements (so far, anyways) but they also have this new maturity to them that I'm really appreciating. However, I can't say they're really what you might call 'deep' characters, so I'm not sure about that yet. But then again, in my opinion, characters for Free! have never been all that deep.As I mentioned earlier, this review will be updated as I watch more of this, but as of now, I'm really happy with the direction its going.Have a great day everyone!UPDATE: To those who feel like this review comments about the boys' looks a little too much... sorry! It's hard to not mention how beautiful our boys are :) so I won't reveal much other than yes, as the title states, this takes place a little bit after the second season. If you haven't seen both seasons, I would highly recommend that you watch them, but if you have seen them but just forgotten most of what happened (which happened to me, unfortunately), worry not! The story is very clean and current, and so far, not confusing at all. Even with the basic background knowledge of the five main characters from the past two seasons, you should be able to enjoy this thoroughly.Next is the art--- oh boy, it was breathtaking. So many times I had to rewind because I had literally zoned out staring at the gorgeous art.

It's hard to not mention how beautiful our boys are :)"", ""This may be the best season of Free! yet. I'm going to start off by telling you what you should watch before you watch this season of Free! Obviously, the first two seasons are a must, but you also need to watch Starting Days and Take Your Marks to fully appreciate what you're going to get in this third season.Now, let me tell you something that may make the decision for you regarding whether or not you should watch this season. Free! is not a typical sports anime. It's main focus is not the competition but the relationships and journeys of the characters. In this...season, that is not the case. In beginning of this season, you're going to get something very much like the previous two seasons because the first half of Dive to the Future focuses on Ikuya and the characters from middle school reestablishing a friendship with him. From then on, you're going to be focusing a lot on swimming competition and preparation. You're still getting the wonderful character work that you've seen previously (some of the best ever), but you're also going to dive deep into the world of competitive swimming.Moving on to the character work I just mentioned. Obviously, as I said, you're going to get a lot with Ikuya as he's the main focus of part of the season. With that, you're going to get some development with his friend Hiyori. Makoto has a small bit of important development as well which is beautifully showcased. The biggest difference in character you'll see this season, though, is-- you guessed it-- Haru.Because Free! focuses on it's characters, since the anime decided to start highlighting the competition aspect, you'll see Haru's character take a big shift. In my opinion, it's the best change we've seen for Haru. You're going to see him get much more competitive, and you'll see him hone in on what it is he wants out of competitive swimming, even more so than before. The storytelling of this season allows Haru's character to grow and change quite a lot, and it's done very nicely and realistically.Beyond that, this season has the best nail-biters in the series. Storytelling is this anime's strong suit alongside it's characters, and it doesn't disappoint this time around. Many characters are introduced and reintroduced this season, a couple of which are insanely talented swimmers. Because of that, you not only get great suspense in the races, but you get a brilliant amount of tensity. If you thought that Rin and Haru were the fastest swimmers around, this season will make you think otherwise, and that's a really good thing.It's very smart for this story to expand it's world by adding in strong opponents for Haru and Rin. Instead of risking their development flat lining by continuing to promote them as the strongest, this season of Free! will throw in a few wrenches. Because of that, this anime has the potential to extend on for a very long time, which is also helped by the fact that the anime made a slight switch into the competitive viewpoint.One last thing to mention here is that this season doesn't cover as much ground as the previous two seasons, and the ending is definitely not the same. In the past, Free! has covered around one school year and it's always ended with the promise of the next year. Meaning that time would skip in between seasons. However, in this season, less time is covered overall and it seems like there is going to be a cliffhanger that'll either be picked up directly or will pick up a few days or weeks in the future. In other words, this season doesn't end cleanly. Again, that isn't a bad thing. In fact, I think it's a really good move to keep interest in the story.There is so much more life in this anime that we will get to see come 2020, and I have never been more excited to be a fan of this show. I 100% recommend that you watch this season if you enjoyed the rest of Free! The character interactions and meetings are like no other, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for most of it. You'll probably even cry here and there, too. Give it a go because this season will show you what Free! can really do. season, that is not the case.

But that\'s solely because the anime focused on drama...Oh, the drama. Let\'s talk about the drama....If Free managed to grab attention on its first seasons, this one used past cliches and plot lines repeatedly but with other characters. Half of these 12 episodes are spent in something that we already saw in past seasons, trying really hard to make the spectator care about a particular problem, but already making it clear how it will end.Formulas are repeated over and over to a point it looks like Saint Seiya. You have 2 to 3 characters in each category and the character whose name is screamed the most, will win. If their name is not screamed that means it will lose, just to plot device the next episodes into a huge drama to be unfolded to some sentences you take from your luck cookie. You can almost take those shounen lame quotes from any anime out there and place on Free!:DF and it will work.Some people complaining about fanservice and fujoshi bait: The anime never advertised otherwise, so if the characters look gay or something and that annoys you, you aren\'t the target audience. It\'s simple as that. I myself love a good fanservice with boys, but even that is lacking in Free and the drama stole everything. I admit there are some good shots here and there, but it\'s lackluster compared to the 1st and 2nd seasons. Dive to the Future is lackluster not because is gay, but because the actual drama is cliche, overused, repetitive and obvious.Oh, and there are coincidences all over the place. All. Over.No action whatsoever. Of course, I speak metaphoric because its an anime about swimming, but almost no swimming happens, and when it happens the result is so obvious that isn\'t worth it to watch it.And last... That cliffhanger.When I speak about this cliffhanger I\'m not only speaking about the final scene, I\'m talking about a lot of characters that were introduced just to make any difference in the next season in 2020. We spend 3 episodes learning about these characters, a little bit of their personality traits and one or two dialogues, only to be left with nothing and hang to the next season. The season finally just brags about more cliche drama until its over and can end on a ""?"" note.--Art:If you are in for the fanservice, you are going to have a fun time. Art-wise this anime is absolutely great and definitely a level up from previous seasons. I have yet to say that no one has a better water than Free!. Some shots are fun to look and some reactions are the little sugar in this journey of boredom.--Sound:What the hell happen to the sound? There\'s a particular OST that plays in some scenes that feels completely out of place. One of the scenes - night, in the park and two characters - which was supposed to be taken seriously, has its atmosphere broken by this techno-like song.And...We have actual English in the anime. Even though they don\'t have a strong accent, it feels out of place to a point that I believe they used a third party company to make those sentences and only sent the audio, since even the sound quality is disconnected. One English character has a voice so weird that is unsettling.--Conclusion:All in All, Free!: Dive to the Future is a huge filler that doesn\'t add anything to the story, holds itself into obvious dramas, and makes the main character way more important than he deserves to be. To an anime that introduced so many characters, why they even exist if everyone keeps focusing on Hakura like he\'s this untouched entity? There are one or two plot points that could have been explored way better, but instead they are holded by formulas that worked on the past and are used again in the same fashion.

Being a swimmer myself, I could really relate to the excitement of a race and how devastating some of their seemingly small errors were. I\'ve also seen many, many animes in which the main characters belong to some club in high school and they create long lasting bonds that get broken as they leave high school and whatnot. Basic stuff. But season 3 of Free! is the first time I\'ve ever gotten to see how the characters fare after high school, and I thought this was really interesting! Now onto the particulars:Story (6): Bruh, the first...half was all about a new character named Ikuya and his obsessive and borderline creepy best friend Hiyori. I couldn\'t care less about either of them, and I got really frustrated seeing Haru worry over and dedicate himself to basically a bitchier Rin. However, after their ""conflict"" gets resolved, the second half is quite enjoyable. Seeing Haru\'s ambitions grow as he realizes what he actually wants from swimming and what he wants to work towards really shows how much he\'s grown from season 1. We also see Makoto find his career path and make something of himself while still supporting his lifelong best friend, which is really heartwarming. The races are action-packed and exciting, so I have no complaints.Art (10): There really isn\'t much to say. This is one of the best-looking animes I\'ve ever seen, and I think their water animation got even better from season 1 (if that\'s even possible). I think Haru looks a bit more buff, which is realistic, and the other characters all have really reasonable proportions. I just loved looking at the water and the backgrounds.Sound (8): I loved the opening. I listened to it all the way through for every episode. The ending\'s pretty good too, and the race music fits the atmosphere and builds the excitement.Characters (7): Ok ok ok. There were a LOT of new characters this season, and I\'ve seen many people say that there were in fact too many and all under-developed. I disagree. I grew to adore Asahi, even though we don\'t see too much of him. Besides Ikuya and Hiyori, I loved all the new additions, especially the monstrous swimmers with the record times. The introduction of characters much, much faster than Haru that truly dedicated their lives to swimming and almost lost their humanity in the process is honestly extremely realistic and called for. It doesn\'t make sense for Haru, who is described as being mostly ""naturally gifted"" with the ability to swim, to win every single race, so giving him some serious competition and seeing him struggle is very interesting and different. Makoto is still the same sweetheart, but we see him mature and find a path in his life, as I stated before. The only truly irrelevant characters are those back at Iwatobi High school. The new members aren\'t memorable, except the girl that likes pudgy men, and they distract from what I would consider to be the main storyline in Tokyo. I wish they had just popped up for one episode instead of being given so much screen time with little development.Enjoyment (8): The only reason I didn\'t put this at a 10 was because of Ikuya and Hiyori. I just couldn\'t wait for their part in the story to end, and I was surprised to see that it actually did stop abruptly halfway through the season. I loved looking at the art and it made me miss swimming more than I can express (I\'m writing this in quarantine). I wish there had been more about Haru and Makoto\'s college lives, and maybe some real and developed female characters, but I was more or less fine without them. I liked watching Haru and Rin get coached and compete for more than just a fun experience with friends. This turned into the real deal.Overall (8): This came from just a culmination of all the bits I just talked about.If you loved the characters and you love the art, just persist through the first half of the season and you\'ll see some great friendships strengthen and some real life goals arise. half was all about a new character named Ikuya and his obsessive and borderline creepy best friend Hiyori.

Just when I sort of perked up when it seems like some plot finally started to unfold, the season ends. The main issue I had was with the subplot to repair Ikuya's relationship with Haru and co. that basically went around in circles for no reason other than to waste time. The resolution felt like a cop out and only happened because the plot needed shift focus.The story further hurts itself by stretching too thin as it attempts...a failing act of juggling an expanding cast of characters, none of whom get properly fleshed out to the point where I actually care about them. Either the new characters contributed nothing to the plot or they were introduced for plot points only (and therefore felt flat and bland). The coaches only made an impression on me because of their association with Rin and Haru. I loved Isuzu but why did we meet her?? And there were some international swimmers. That's it, that's all the information we get on them. I only remember them because they showed up in the opening and I kept wondering when they would make an appearance. I assumed they would play a much bigger role, since they were uhhh, in the opening.KyoAni animation is gorgeous as ever though. a failing act of juggling an expanding cast of characters, none of whom get properly fleshed out to the point where I actually care about them.

From one place to the next and so much drama that really was not needed as it as...all seen before. The beginning was slow, which was okay, but it kept on being slow even halfway through the season and it was simply a drag to watch. Some moments in the series really were not needed and could have been used for developing more on the characters. It picked up towards the end, but then everything just went too fast with too many missing plot holes, ending in that manner as well. It just didn't give that same vibe as the previous two.Art (8, Very Good)There were so many nice things to look at in the anime and everyone looks really nice too. Very appealing to the eye and certainly upped the game in the art department this season.Sound (8, Really Good)The soundtrack really upped itself this season, there were many nice tracks playing in the background, and it feels like it really builds on the previous seasons. Fresh and energetic to say the least.Character (3, Poor)There were way too many characters, some of them honestly were not needed. Then there were some characters that felt like carbon copies of ones in previous seasons, the same drama ensuing between the two of them. It was really repetitive and drawn out, infuriating almost. Then just when you feel like you get to know the characters (roughly 3/4 through the season), there are more characters thrown into the batch and they just stir up even more unneeded drama.Aside from the original few from the first two series, the other characters were not nearly as fleshed out and they really did feel like extras simply sitting on the sidelines for cheering purposes. I guess they were nice to look at for the most part.Enjoyment (4, Decent)Apart from all the drama, it was really nice to see everyone again and how their lives are fairing. There were some instances in the show that I looked forward to for sure, but it didn't win over the fact that there was a very long period of senseless drama.Overall (5, Mediocre)It was okay for the most part. To some degree, the music and art made up for the lack of story and character. Still, considering Free's previous seasons, I was expecting much more. all seen before.

I guess they were nice to look at for the most part.Enjoyment (4, Decent)Apart from all the drama, it was really nice to see everyone again and how their lives are fairing. There were some instances in the show that I looked forward to for sure, but it didn't win over the fact that there was a very long period of senseless drama.Overall (5, Mediocre)It was okay for the most part. To some degree, the music and art made up for the lack of story and character. Still, considering Free's previous seasons, I was expecting much more."", ""Well, after waiting four years for a season 3 (which I did not see coming) the boys are back for another season of epic pool battle.Usually, I won't be watching this show any further, as it is a yaoi show, but what lead me to give this show another shot was because it takes place at a University competitive environment; and I can see how Haru and Makoto adapt to this new environment.STORY (8/10) - As much as I love swimming, Kyoto Animation never stops to amaze me with the build-up of dramas with more of middle-school dilemma surrounding Haru.

On the bright side, we get to see Makoto progressively develops his coaching skills over time.Enjoyment (7/10) - I did not enjoy this season as much of the previous two seasons because it reminded me of season 1 drama, and I sort of expect much more focus on them to train for world level than to national level. I would say I enjoyed more of the second half of the season since it finally refocuses on training for national competitions than solving life problems.

It is much gayer than the previous seasons that it becomes intolerable. It has far worse animation and relies on cheap CGI too often. A lot of interest characters are pushed to the sideline with the college setting. The new characters for this season are uninteresting and feel far too tropey to be believable characters. If you were a fan of the previous seasons, don't watch this one. There is a lot of unnecessary drama that would never happen in male circles. It is woman-level drama that does not belong in a sports show.Avoid this...show, it will make you angry if you like the franchise. show, it will make you angry if you like the franchise."", ""This is my first ever review so please go easy on me. I'm too late to even review this but, i absolutely loved this anime despite all the other reviews. It's something i rewatch whenever i'm feeling down or some sort. It's my comfort anime and LOVE HARUKA NANASE the amount of screenshots i have of him from every scene he looked cute at.(His cute already but yk) Now lets get to the point. I don't really love the story nor hate it, a neutral maybe it's kinda bland and stereotypical and i'm not gonna deny that. But i didn't really focus on the part...of the story i more or less focused on the characters personalities, the art and my enjoyment of it. It's not everyday i'd find an anime like this.  And I love how they don't make someone the main attraction and they give out all different back stories like Haikyuu but even then i'm pissed off at the Haikyuu fandom for giving all the attention to Hinata and Kenma, like they can like what they like but they better stop telling me that Kageyama is gonna be the one to cheat if they ever get into a relationship. Now lets go back to the main topic, the last season was also one thing i absolutely love. I don't really mind the imperfections because of it but i REALLY loved the way they do this and that. Maybe i'm just bias, but the amount of comfort that this anime gives me is literally amazing. I'm looking forward to the movie sequel and i'd love to pay for it to watch it in theaters.

The creators of this anime must have thought we watched the movies, but most of us skipped from the 2nd season to the 3rd. Even in the first 5 minutes of this show started off with showing us all of these random characters we didn't know, and honestly don't care about.They really focussed on the backstories and subplots having to do with these newer additions to the show, which took the fun out of it. I just wanted to see what...was going on with the main characters (e.g Haru, Rin) and not these random people that have nothing to do with the storyline and don't effect it in any way.

At one point I had to ask myself if the story had just gotten too bloated with characters.  Why is more than half the season so focused on Ikuya when the resolution of his arc does nothing to further Haru's swimming?  Did Free forget who the main character of the story is?  Honestly could have skipped the...Ikuya stuff and just done the whole season on the last 3 episodes.I'm I going to stop watching Free?

I got a glimpse of what I wanted to see and what will hopefully follow in the next seasons. Im not talking about the friendship drama or the muscles, but about rivalry and Competition of athletes that want to win no matter what. They even indroduced characters I really have high expectations about. God was I hyped about the last episodes released, cause the patients I had over the previous seasons finally paid out.  Im just genuinely happy, that even Haru developed ambition and will to win.

I was surprised when a third season of Free! was announced, as I'd thought that Eternal Summer had wrapped up the series nicely, but here we are. Before I spew my multitude of criticisms about this season, I'll start with the positives of Dive to the Future.At the very least, Dive to the Future succeeds in still creating that nostalgic Free! atmosphere that reminds me of when I picked up the series in my early high school days. Kyoto Animation, of course, continues to animate beautifully. I still think there are a few quieter moments...of friendship and meaning that Free! has always managed to portray well. And of course, all the main characters are back (and when I mean all, I mean ALL. We'll get into why this is an issue in a little bit).One of the first issues with this season is its clever marketing scheme. Free! Dive to the Future relies on the viewer to have seen Free! Starting Days (which I have), but if you haven't, tough luck knowing who some of these characters are and feeling any sort of connection to them. They're only briefly introduced. For those who have failed to watch these Free! side stories, prepare for confusion, especially because the characters from that movie tend to be the stars of Dive to the Future.The biggest issue, I think, with this series is the number of characters and subplots. When you include every single character from past seasons, as well as new ones, you have a very clunky anime with too many side plots for a 12 episode season. Perhaps making this season 24 episodes rather than 12 could've balanced out all these characters and stories well. For the most part, you won't get to see a lot of action from any of your favorite characters, and significant character development? Forget about it. Nagisa and Rei are barely a part of this series. Rin really only pops in at the very end. And Sosuke? He has a SUPER small sideplot. That's how many plots the show is balancing this season. Many of the new characters appearing in the OP weren't even introduced until the very END of the season, where they were given limited introductions and significance to the plot.DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THE HIYORI/IKUYA ARC. You want to know how many episodes this petty drama took up? Eight. EIGHT episodes. In a 12 episode anime. That's two-thirds of the season! It's probably the only characters that get development, and these characters aren't even present in past seasons. In addition, I still dislike Hiyori's character. In a sense, I believe the writers were trying to compare him to Sosuke from Eternal Summer. Though Sosuke comes off initially as unlikable, the viewer quickly understands his struggles and comes to sympathize with him. By the end of Eternal Summer, Sosuke is likable. Hiyori is not. And once this arc is over, he becomes completely irrelevant in the series, which is strange for a character that took up, you know, 8 episodes of the season.The ending lacks all of those heartfelt moments and contentment that one often feels finishing a Free! season. It is sloppy and unemotional, with a cliffhanger to end on (to make way for a movie announcement).Free! Dive to the Future was a completely unnecessary season. The season turns its attentions to characters that were from a 2 hour film rather than the characters that viewers have spent two seasons growing to know and love. I don't know what is planned for the Free! movie, but all I can say is that if it's as sloppy as this season, then I really don't want to waste any more time on this franchise. of friendship and meaning that Free! has always managed to portray well.

I guess it's not the type of show I would expect to be popular enough to get this much attention from a studio like Kyoto.This season was a huge step up from the previous season. Comparing this season and last season, I felt that the second season lost some of the energy the first season had, which the third season was able to revive. The story was also more engaging. At least in the second season, Haru doesn't really...do much until end, which doesn't make the conclusion feel all that satisfying. He also doesn't say anything, which makes it harder for the audience to get a read on his character. I know that's his whole shtick and as someone who generally tends to be quieter, I get it, but I felt the writing failed a little in conveying who his character was in the second season. The third season definitely succeeded in making him a more interesting character though. I really liked the dynamic of having Haru confront the effects his swim career has had on those around him. It made for some interesting drama.This season was really interesting to me as well because of how busy it was. There was so much going on throughout the show with so many character arcs going on simultaneously, which was only compounding with the increase in the cast. Despite all the new characters and storylines, the season somehow works when it shouldn't, but I'm not really sure how. Like, after Ikuya's problem was solved, we don't really see much of him until the last episode, but somehow his race with his brother worked and landed the impact it needed to.I guess a large part of why I enjoyed this show was also because of how cathartic it was for me as I just finished my competitive swim career yesterday. I don't see myself quitting swimming for good, but the team aspect is something that this show does a good job at conveying and it's something that I won't forget in my own life.

I'll start by saying what I disliked about s1 and 2, and what I love about s3.Season 1 and 2 of Free are very solid but I would often be hit by a brick wall when watching it. I wasn't able to fully emotionally connect to the series due to its melodrama, fillerish strides, and lack of stake. I should clarify I didn't dislike the drama itself, rather the execution that made it overdramatic and sappy at times. This in...combination with the episodes that felt somewhat like filler(despite having purpose) and the lacking stakes of the series. To elaborate on the point about stakes, the matches simply didn't have much tension or excitement for me because there was nothing major at stake. I feel season 3 minimized all of these issues while playing to the strengths of its cast, well-constructed character arcs, and small moments that raise your overall enjoyment.Season 3 from the start was meant for me. I really liked the Free Prequel movie(starting days) and was a MAJOR FAN of the cast; I loved Ikuya and Asahi and was a fan of Nao, Kisumi, and Natsuya. I was hoping for their eventual return and got that in full with season 3, even better, I got that with a solid character arc for Ikuya, tying up a loose thread left from the gap between the prequel and everything up to season 3. Ikuya's involvement in itself led to growth on Haru's part and spurred further change in the story. Following this, several plot lines such as Sousuke's surgery, Makoto's career path and part time job, Rei and Nagisa's current team - Samezuka cameos, Natsuya finding his path and its relation to Ikuya, Asahi growing with Haru and Ikuya - his sister's cafe which provided many wholesome moments, and still more going on. I loved every second of it but I can understand if someone else didn't. It focused on the movie cast and even some side characters outside of it, MANY people haven't seen the movie, so they have little connection to these characters but I think that's something fundamental for Free, especially season 3. If you like the cast up to this point, and the movie cast, you'll love season 3. Season 3 is exactly what it says, a dive into the future, and we see a majority of our cast make decisions pertaining to their future, making strides towards old and new goals.Season 3 did all of this while having the least melodramatic feel, excluding ep 2-4. We also see more growth and accumulative payoff to Haru's development up to this point. The end of the season had a specific clip, the scream at the sunset, that is symbolic of the growth he's made.Other small things like adorable or wholesome moments such as the movie cast reuniting, Ikuya confiding to Haru in the pool, Asahi's sister and the baby cheering on Haru, Ikuya surpassing Natsuya in the All Japan IM, the crew helping out at Asahi's sister's cafe, Misaki's little rivalry witnessed by Makoto, and so much more.

Jokes aside, I enjoyed Dive to the Future. The drama was pretty good, the characters were likeable, and the humor was spot on. But, when it ended I couldn\'t help by say: ""That\'s it?""While not a bad season, Dive to the Future felt weaker than the previous ones. There wasn\'t much for it to say. I mean, Eternal Summer had already did a heartfelt discussion about the fear of the unknown and what it meant to fulfill one\'s dreams. Here, it felt stretched too thin at this point. So instead, they...did another childhood drama and while it was engaging I couldn\'t help but thought that the show already did this before and much better. What\'s even more sad is that they cut that drama short (in the quickest character transformation possible) to focus on the nationals which to be honest I don\'t really care about.Free! doesn\'t seem to be about tournaments, but rather about a group of friends who has been through a lot and learn from their mistakes. Their new resolve would then be reflected in their performance. In this season, the show tried to juggle the nationals and character drama, only to not say anything substantial for any of them. They didn\'t even end with the overall results. I don\'t know if everyone ended up qualified for the nationals.Speaking of which, let\'s talk about the characters. Free decided to expand the cast and while their way of doing it was creative through its pacing, I don\'t see the relevance of most of them--even the OGs at this point. New characters who were framed to be rivals were only introduced last minute into the series, and others seem to be just there to fill dialogue. Most of the original cast have already reached their character arcs since Eternal Summer so with the larger cast, I sometimes don\'t see why they are still present unless it\'s to keep the fans watching. While I do enjoy their company, sometimes their presence interrupts the main story. For instance, there\'s this main drama between Haruka and this other childhood friend and in the middle of that drama, there\'s an episode about Rin in Australia. It felt kind of jarring to be honest.The production is still great with well drawn characters and finesse in the swimming scenes. The OST is good.Dive to the Future was enjoyable, but I felt unsatisfied. There\'s nothing much it could say, and it\'s a shame because maybe if they focus on one thing over another then maybe it would\'ve feel more full. I hope the series one day addresses what happens after Dive to the Future because I really want to know more. did another childhood drama and while it was engaging I couldn\'t help but thought that the show already did this before and much better.

There\'s nothing much it could say, and it\'s a shame because maybe if they focus on one thing over another then maybe it would\'ve feel more full. I hope the series one day addresses what happens after Dive to the Future because I really want to know more.', ""If you're not constantly getting bashed over the head with The Little Mermaid symbolism, you're not watching Free! Dive to the Future. Seriously, it's going to be a huge plot point for the first half of the season, so buckle up and enjoy the rollercoaster of emotions.Look, art is subjective and I appreciate the representation that two different people can pull two different connections to their own experiences out of the same story because that's what makes literature so beautiful... but only one of these kids understood the assignment!The first 7 episodes of this season largely focus on the drama between Ikuya and the rest...of the kids from the Starting Days movie, which is where the main point of contention for fans of the series comes in. Because this series loves to give everyone who even so much as looks at the boy a Haru Complex, Haru is once again the center of another emotional character arc - but in order to keep Ikuya from talking to his childhood friends and resolving the issue within two or three episodes, Hiyori was introduced to the story as the emotional cockblock that keeps them apart until the dramatic climax. Someone in that writing room discussion must have realized that they couldn't risk making Hiyori too unlikable lest the shipbait not hit its mark in a sea of angry shippers, so they opted to give him deep-rooted psychological trauma as well because that's how Free! writes sympathetic and relatable characters. If you were to ask a large portion of the fandom at the time this season was airing, they would loudly tell you that this did not have the desired effect, but Hiyori's complex internal struggles sure did distress my maternal instincts!Episode 8 and onward finally shifts the attention back to the competition everyone has been training for up to this point and, as the full cast reunites in support of each other, the show finally settles back into its familiar pace - friends enthusiastically cheering each other on, swimming with friend and rival alike being a more sacred bond than matrimony, and much talk and contemplation about what the future holds. Most of the new cast is interesting, but it's the returning cast from the previous installments that are the real highlight. As always, the deep-rooted character bonds are beautifully written and offer a lot of touching moments to tug at the heartstrings.Overall, if you loved and wanted to see more of Kisumi and the Starting Days boys, this season will probably interest you like it did me! But if you're only here to catch up with the original cast, you'll probably still get some great moments out of their appearances even if you end up skipping around just to find them. of the kids from the Starting Days movie, which is where the main point of contention for fans of the series comes in.

They are milking a cash cow without a single iota of understanding of what made the series successful or what the fans liked about it. Everything that it has going for it now comes down to sound and visuals, and even though the animation continues to be impressive it isn't enough to make this season worth suffering through.This was twelve episodes of obnoxious melodrama punctuated with only a few short cute moments with characters I've grown attached to. Humor is gone. Fun is gone. Having coherent character arcs with motivations that make sense and...that have satisfying resolutions: Gone.I also have to express how absolutely bonkers it drives me that a bunch of college age young men are still angsting over drama they experienced in MIDDLE SCHOOL. It's completely laughable. Or it would be, if this series was still funny. that have satisfying resolutions: Gone.I also have to express how absolutely bonkers it drives me that a bunch of college age young men are still angsting over drama they experienced in MIDDLE SCHOOL.

A few shortcomings of the predecessors are removed.The plot took a rather surprising turn. As you could see from the second season, the team broke up because Haru and Makoto graduated from school. Everyone went their own way and several different stories were formed.Among other things, many new characters were introduced and solidly incorporated into the series. Can't say much about it.It also got better on the conversation side. There was a lot more character-related humor. There was no longer talk about the same subject for minutes. And the characters actually...focused on something else. The development of some characters was also much more successful than the predecessor.But apart from the positive development, there were a few new areas of focus. The new characters were pretty irrelevant and unloving, since they were not given enough screen time. Too many new characters have been introduced in the first 2 episodes.The third season had much less of a main story. She practically dealt with a new pubescent problem of the characters. Unfortunately, this was also completed quite weakly.Personally, I really have to admit that this season had the most creativity. And finally some characters were able to develop better. Gar Haru, was less negative this season than before.The animations also got stronger. However, much more was cut away from swimming and CGI was used for some scenes.As mentioned, there was still no real main action. Except for introducing and incorporating the characters, this season served almost nothing. But the implementation was simply much better here and there was much less fan service.ConclusionIn the end, Free is a title that you can watch if you can keep your demands very low.

Dive to the futre was all of these things.Plot:For haru and makato, after high school came college and for makato that came with figuring out what he wanted to do next.  Once again the iwatobi swim club made it to the nationals, so that's what rei and nagisa were up to, though this time around we get much less focus on them. We also see what happens to friendships when a facture hits and no one explains anything which is the first half of the show.

This session felt out of context somewhat. Including what I just said it also just stopped showing the close relationship between the whole swim club and they kind of just went their separate ways. I also found...the whole subplot around this new character Ikuya kinda boring. They also barely showed or introduced the new Iwatobi members at all...I still sort of enjoyed the theme of the show and the main characters nonetheless, but I'm still disappointed as it wasn't anything like the first two seasons. the whole subplot around this new character Ikuya kinda boring.

There are too many things happening at the same time and they all excite me in the same way. The characters from the first two seasons, the OVAs, Take your marks and High Speed all come together in the same season and the connections between them intertwine and come to life.Even having seen it so many times, it never bores me, especially the first chapters, which focus on Ikuya. Ikuya is my favorite character on Free and one of my favorite characters overall and I really like how his dilemmas come to life...in this season and also how they\'re resolved. Little by little, the rest of the conflicts of each of the characters are resolved or they find a solution in the future, as is the case of Natsuya or Sosuke (a character that I didn\'t like at all in the previous season, but that I liked a lot in this season).I was very happy to meet Mikoshiba Izusu, the only female character in Free who is also a swimmer. You could say that Izusu is a tomboy and I think she refreshes the series a lot. Also, I really like her friendship with Gou and Ayumu, mainly because the three of them are very different from each other and complement each other very well.The only character I didn\'t like (and that no one likes) is Hiyori. He is a Sosuke 2, but even more unbearable. And this is my problem with the season: that, despite the fact that I love it and everything I already mentioned, it recycles the same plot of the first and second seasons, but together: an old friend of Haru returns to the scene (Rin /Ikuya), and they have their conflicts to see if they swim together, if they\'re friends again, why they swim, and so on; and, that old friend, also has a possessive best friend who only wants the best for him (Sosuke / Hiyori) and that is, from his point of view, getting away from Haru, with whom Rin and Ikuya are a little obsessed.Around all of that there are incredible characters like Makoto (who is living his new adventure very well), Asahi (a character that I love and I really like to see again), Natsuya (the love of my life, although a little silly at times, luckily there is Nao to make him see it), Nao (very much in the chill vibe of Makoto), Kisumi (another character that I love and the only one who isn\'t a swimmer. Also, his friendship with Asahi is very cute) and the rest of the characters of Free that we already know.Towards the end, the season introduces us to two ""enemies"" that Haru must face in the movies.KyoAni\'s animation is wonderful, as always. You could even say that this season it shines even more.As I have already said in other reviews, I love Free for its slice of life and dramatic content, more than for its spokon content (which is secondary in the series), and there is a lot of that in this third season.Recommended? 100%. I am constantly quoting and thinking about this season....Dive to the future es mi temporada favorita de Free. Hay demasiadas cosas pasando al mismo tiempo y todas me emocionan de la misma manera. Los personajes de las dos primeras temporadas, de las OVAS, Take your marks y High Speed se reúnen todos en una misma temporada y los vínculos entre ellos se entrelazan y cobran vida.Incluso habiéndola visto tantas veces, nunca me aburre, sobre todos los primeros capítulos, que se centran en Ikuya. Ikuya es mi personaje favorito de Free y uno de mis personajes favoritos en general y me gusta mucho cómo sus dilemas toman vida en esta temporada y también cómo se resuelven. Poco a poco, el resto de conflictos de cada uno de los personajes se resuelven o estos encuentran una solución a futuro, como es el caso de Natsuya o Sosuke (personaje que no me gustaba nada en la temporada anterior, pero que me gustó mucho en esta temporada).Me dio mucho gusto conocer a Mikoshiba Izusu, el único personaje femenino de Free que también es una nadadora. Se podría decir que Izusu es una tomboy y creo que refresca mucho la serie. Además, su amistad con Gou y Ayumu me gusta mucho, principalmente porque las tres son muy diferentes entre sí y se complementan muy bien.El único personaje que no me gustó (y que a nadie le gusta) es Hiyori. Es un Sosuke 2, pero más insoportable aún. Y este es mi problema con la temporada: que, a pesar de que me encanta y de todo lo que ya comenté, recicla el mismo argumento de la primera y segunda temporada, pero juntas: un viejo amigo de Haru vuelve a la escena (Rin/Ikuya), y tienen sus tiras y aflojas para ver si nadan juntos, si vuelven a ser amigos, por qué es que nadan, y demás; y, ese viejo amigo, tiene además un mejor amigo posesivo que sólo quiere lo mejor para él (Sosuke/Hiyori) y eso es, desde su punto de vista, alejarse de Haru, con quien Rin e Ikuya están un poquito obsesionados.Alrededor de todo eso hay personajes increíbles como Makoto (quien está viviendo su nueva aventura muy bien), Asahi (un personaje que amo y me gusta mucho volver a ver), Natsuya (el amor de mi vida, aunque un poco tonto a veces, por suerte está Nao para hacérselo ver), Nao (muy en la onda chill de Makoto), Kisumi (otro personaje que me encanta y el único que no es nadador. Además, su amistad con Asahi es muy linda) y el resto de personajes de Free que ya conocemos.Hacia el final, la temporada nos presenta dos ""enemigos"" a los que Haru deberá enfrentarse en las películas.La animación de KyoAni es maravillosa, como siempre. Incluso podría decirse que en esta temporada brilla aún más.Como ya he dicho en otras reviews, Free me encanta por su contenido slice of life y dramático, más que por su contenido spokon (que es algo secundario en la serie), y de eso hay mucho en esta tercera temporada.¿Recomendado? 100%.

Hanhua Riji 3rd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50401/Hanhua_Riji_3rd_Season,"[""Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (10)The story is about a woman who is very lazy but She found herself involved with Godly matters where her parent is actually God. After that, She can see all items and pets are becoming human forms and transforming into other forms too. In this anime, there are a lot of comedy scenes that make me laugh in every episode. This is 3rd season, so it's a continuation of the story where She got an evil dragon egg.Art (10)The art in this anime is great! I love the simplicity that they use to make the animation....Not only that, But I also love the ending animation where they are mixing reality making that. The opening scene that they make are using sketchbook animation which matches their animation art. The animator and editor really should be appreciated since almost every ending is different.Sound (10)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation. They are making custom songs too where adjust to the episode. If the episode is in kung-fu vibes, they adjusted the ending song with a melody that matches the vibes XDCharacter (10)The main and supporter character is very memorable. I remember how hilarious the MC and supporter characters on this anime.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (10)It's recommended to those who love comedy!*This is first Chinese anime that was hidden gems!!Anyway, it's similar to Gintama but a short version.

Aikatsu Stars!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32717/Aikatsu_Stars,"['Before I started Aikatsu Stars (AiStars from now on), I was kind of worried. I’ve heard from multiple places that it ruined Aikatsu, that it turns to crap at a certain point of a show, stuff like that. Since I’ve heard those things about the 2nd season of Aikatsu and I ended up very much liking it*, I said, okay, how about watching it and finding it out yourself? It was indeed a disappointment, but in a positive way. In the end, it became my favorite show of all time second only to Ichigogen, also known as the first 2 seasons of the original Aikatsu...(OGKatsu from here on). And after marathoning OGKatsu, especially after Akarigen, it felt refreshing.Those who seek out the same kind of writing as in OGKatsu: you’re going to be disappointed. AiStars is a much more plot-driven show with a darker theme, even though it’s still a character-centric show at heart. If you outright hate drama or drama-centric episodes, this show is probably not for you. Friendly rivalries aren’t gone, but they’re much more serious, especially in the 2nd season; characters can be outright hostile to each other, with deep ideological differences. Idols no longer have to cater to each and every whim of the brand designers in order to acquire new dresses: they’re the brands themselves this time around, designing their own dresses. This goes hand in hand with the show’s main theme, self-producing. Special appeals, which were a big thing in OGKatsu, do exist, but they never get explained; this actually makes the story better, as it has other priorities. Yume is a much more expressive protagonist compared to Ichigo (or even Akari), not hiding her frustration, even capable of tantrums when things don’t go her way – she’s 12 years old after all. That doesn’t make either of them less of a great character (Ichigo is still one of my favorite characters of all time), just make either of these shows different. It has a much more modern feel to it: while OGKatsu felt like I’m watching a show from another decade (not that there’s anything wrong with it), AiStars has a much more dynamic feel to it, feeling very much like an anime from 2016. All in all, it ended up being its own thing without being unapologetic about it.AiStars is not a perfect show, that’s not how I give out scores. Perfect shows simply don’t exist. It’s especially impossible for a show with 100 episodes. The CGI for the stage events is a stepback, for example. Characters who would’ve deserved to have their comeuppance ended up being redeemed without much of an explanation. Plot points ended up being abandoned and never much mentioned again (and don’t let your nostalgia goggles fool you: this was the same case in OGKatsu as well). Some side characters would’ve deserved their own stage events *cough*Haruka Luka*cough*But there are plenty of other things making up for it. The characters are well-written and have complex motivations. You’ll end up caring for them, investing in them. The music is catchy as hell. The show is looking beautiful and as I’ve said earlier, dynamic. The voice acting is stellar, especially Yume’s  – she’s voiced by Tomita Miyu, the same VA who voiced Riko in Made In Abyss; remember this name in the future.If these things ended up convincing you, watch Aikatsu Stars. You’re not going to regret it.*yeah, I’m a DreAca apologist, and I’m not sorryPS: Koharu is best girl (OGKatsu from here on).

If you prefer that this is a big bonus towards trying out Stars, while not really being a negative if you liked the original and...you're thinking about watching this one since in my opinion it was well handled through the whole run.Outside of two fantastic crossover episodes with the original (which are perfectly skippable if you haven't watched it) this is a stand-alone story set in an idol school which focuses on “self-producing” (finding your way to stand out and shine, encouraging the search of what makes each of the students unique and great).There are four classes, each specializing on different things, like singing and performing, with the best student of each becoming part of the S4 (best school uniforms in anime btw), the top members of the school that everyone admires and wants to become a part of. The protagonist of the story, Yume, is one of the tons of fans they have and she joins the school wishing to reach the top, will she succeed?With the people behind Aikatsu having more experience with the franchise, there comes two quite strong positives in comparison to the original:- The dances are great from episode 1. The CGI of the original at the start of its run was… mediocre to say the least, but at this point of the franchise things are way different. If you can't stomach the performances at the start of the first series, Aikatsu Stars (or the also awesome Aikatsu Friends) is there for you.- The story is more compact and less repetitive: While the original has a ton of positives on what happens during the episodes, it's clear that they were just trying stuff at times and ditching them later on to do other things instead, or some parts were like doing 2-3 episodes in a row of the same thing but with different characters, Aikatsu Stars handles this way better and presents a well paced story while keeping the quality and the character development that the original shines with.The strongest part of the Aikatsu franchise is its fantastic characters, and Stars is definitely not an exception to the rule. Before touching on the main characters, I will talk a bit more about the S4 girls, who are some of the best role model characters I have seen. They are at the top of the school and it's well deservedly so, being extremely good at what they do and always there to help the others to improve. They also get focus and development through the series, and the interactions between them and the main characters are some of the best moments of Stars. My own favorite character of this anime is the cheerful Yuzu, there are so many favorite-worthy characters even outside of the main ones!Now let's talk a bit about the main characters:- Yume Nijino is our protagonist of the story. She's a cheerful girl with strong determination and her talent for singing is incredible. You will see yourself cheering for her success and the smiles she wants to give to everyone.- Rola/Laura Sakuraba she's Yume's rival (and therefore best friend by Aikatsu standards) and one of the strongest characters when it comes to their drama and development. She doesn't like losing at all, and in a world full of competition like hers this proves to be a problem.- Ako Saotome, usually looking calm and confident, but actually quite hot-blooded, our (cat)girl loves acting and has a talent for it. She also has a massive crush on Subaru (a member of the M4, basically the S4 of the boys and source of lots of awesome interactions with the main cast) which leads to a lot of fun moments.- Mahiru Kasumi, the most mature girl of the main cast. She shines at modeling, and while her strong aura makes her look difficult to approach (her karate skills don't help with that), she's actually pure kindness.- Koharu Nanakura, a quiet girl and Yume's childhood friend. She joined the school together with her due to her admiration towards the S4, and they are always helping each other.This is just a part of the whole cast and it's definitely missing other characters you will probably get to love as much or even more as them (looking at you Lily!)As mentioned above, unlike the original, Stars has quality performances right from the start, that together with the great songs the series has makes for such a fantastic experience and a filled playlist. When it comes to the visuals, this anime is always on point, with some of the most important episodes delivering crazy good animation to add to the impact of the moment.Keeping strengths from the original, presenting another fantastic cast, and giving us more awesome songs that will go to our playlists, Aikatsu Stars delivers a fantastic story full of both fun and emotional moments that, together with the solid character development, makes for a very memorable experience.Thanks a lot for reading! I hope this review convinced you to at least put Aikatsu Stars in the endless void that is the plan to watch from your list, now that I'm up to date with this franchise I feel so empty, a feeling I wouldn't be surprised if you felt as well after watching it! you're thinking about watching this one since in my opinion it was well handled through the whole run.Outside of two fantastic crossover episodes with the original (which are perfectly skippable if you haven't watched it) this is a stand-alone story set in an idol school which focuses on “self-producing” (finding your way to stand out and shine, encouraging the search of what makes each of the students unique and great).There are four classes, each specializing on different things, like singing and performing, with the best student of each becoming part of the S4 (best school uniforms in anime btw), the top members of the school that everyone admires and wants to become a part of.

Many of the songs are reused numerous times, even in the same episode.  The dress maker transformation seems to happen every episode as a filler.  The predictability of the plot and the characters being your basic shoujo/idol main characters does not make me want to finish the series.  This is your typical  'cute girl' anime while the live performance costumes ruin the 'cute.' I would not want to continue watching this anime to see if it gets better.  In conclusion: if you watch one...School Idol anime, you have watched them all. School Idol anime, you have watched them all."", ""I have watched aikatsu since the first original one and the first season of aikatsu itself is really good in my opinion.Though, it become more 'weird' and having no clear direction of the story, after it ended, I have quite high hopes for aikatsu stars.Still, Aikatsu stars has some similarities with the original aikatsu which some makes me happy and some not.For the characters for instance, I don't know why but I kinda think that they are kind of running out of ideas in making new characters? because in my opinion, almost every main character are like fusion of two characters from the original one.Like...Yozora, its really obvious that she's a fusion of Ran (appearance) and Sora (name partly and personality). Then Yuzu, fusion of Kii (appearance and most of the personality) and Aoi (some personalities). Hime is like some part Maria (surname and personality), Ichigo and Mizuki (both are like the adored senpai's). Ako is like Otome (appearance and surname) and Yurika (personality). Sakura has some Aoi vibe (both good at many things before) and added with Seira (rivalry). And as usual, Yume, the main idol is soemone who was not very good in idolhood like ichigo and akari.It's kinda disturbing in my opinion though.But, I love how they made few changes in the card system and the arts are actually pretty good.What I love the most is the story is more.... intense, darker and romantic than the original one. I love how there's actually some mysteries about idols itself and its not just any plain boring mystery in my opinion. I also love the fact that it has some romance to it. It makes the story more interesting to watch, I think. Yozora, its really obvious that she's a fusion of Ran (appearance) and Sora (name partly and personality).

For an anime aimed at kids, this was particularly well done, but I did notice that unlike in the original, this one had a slightly more mature tone that the original lacked, which made it enjoyable for the older audience. I won't say anything more to avoid spoiling but the drama in this was definitely heavier than its predecessor.Art: 10The art is one of the strongest points in Stars!. Everything is so detail-focused that it's hard to say anything bad about the art...at all. And I'm talking character and dress designs, and even backgrounds! The animation was also smooth and the 3D performances have definitely improved in quality since the original.Sound: 10Like the art, sound is one of the strongest points in this anime. No matter how many opening and ending songs there were, you remember each of them vividly as they were continually sung by the characters throughout the series at different times. Also, every single episode had a performance, so that was something to look forward to, especially if it was a new song. There was a multitude of songs in this, and that was typical for an anime about idols. Overall, the sound is just amazing.Character: 8Not much to say about the characters. They weren't poorly written but they weren't particularly special either. The characters' personalities are reminiscent of the original's, which is where everyone sports this positive attitude towards their activities most of the time. But unlike in the original, we actually get to see some antagonists pop up in the first and second half of Stars!. Elza Forte was especially memorable for her prominent role in the second half and I was surprised to see how that second half actually developed with her arrival in Japan. Other than that, the characters did their job of representing the themes of this anime well.Enjoyment: 9Despite my liking for action, horror, mystery and romance, this kind of genre puts me at ease and makes me excited at the same time. It's always refreshing to watch this anime, despite the repetitiveness. In other words, I enjoyed this, A LOT.Overall: 8Bringing everything together, Aikatsu Stars! is one spectacular anime to watch with kids and adults alike. I'd recommend this anime and this franchise in general, to people who are looking for something refreshing after a binge-watch session of Hellsing or other heavy anime, to get that balance back in place, especially if they don't mind this genre. Or just for anyone who's looking for a long anime to escape a bit of reality. at all. And I'm talking character and dress designs, and even backgrounds!

The first season 1-50 was really enjoyable as we got the growth of all the characters who were more than just background characters.  I tend to classify characters in to 3 groups.  Main, Main Supporting, and Sub Supporting.  Sub...supporting being characters that show up but don't have any major impact on the story.  S2 though is where I take major issue the story and it faces demerits in my book.  S2 story pushes an antagonist with some very clear issues and this detracts as a whole the further you go into s2.Art: 8It's more of a 7.5ish just because you can tell times when they cut corners to save for bigger moments within the ep/arc.  Only other issue is certain contrasting design aspects in a couple crossover EP.Character: 7.7Main character and Main Supports do get a lot of attention as you would hope in a 100 ep series.  My only real complaints is a certain character and then how they seem to be more than willing to do other characters dirty in my opinion.  There were a good few ep I watched where I felt they dunked on characters for the sake of it.Sound: 9 as a wholeOne of the things a friend kept going on about in previous Aikatsu was how the songs were more varied than in Friends.  I can agree and disagree.  They largely used the same formula as what I saw in Friends but we have a more varied cast in Stars.  Music as a whole was great though.Enjoyment: 8.5 in reality but again MAL rating system only allows by whole point intervals.S2 has some really solid moments but again is drug down by a character and to be honest initially those around her but they all get their own great moments.Overall: 8I said what I had in each section.  Would I recommend this? Depends to be honest.  It's a franchise technically aimed at little girls on top of being an idol anime on top of being 100 ep.

This anime was able to correct lots of shortcomings from the first anime while at the same time being unique enough that it doesn't look like a copy of Aikatsu.However, it still isn't perfect. I found that there was a shift in the style of songs employed, or should I say a lack of diversity. Every song is mostly popesy-cutesie or EDM oriented which isn't that bad in essence but there's a clear lack of diversity in the first part that is more or less corrected by the end of the anime (I loved the last pool of songs).

Right from the start, it's clear that only one character can ever achieve their goals, and it's going to be the lead. At least in previous Aikatsu seasons, the lead wasn't always - in fact, rarely was - the winner.Then, there's the second season....Hoo boy. The ONE arc the fans unanimously hate - *cough* DreamAca *cough* - from the OG series, they basically went and repeated, only this time there was an active villain rather than a cast of competitors. More on that later.Another major issue is the ridiculous amount of contradictions within the show's lore. I understand it was an attempt to make a system that stood out from it's predecessor, but instead, it's confusing, bizarre, and they regularly break their own so-called 'rules'.CHARACTER: 5What starts as Yume and Koharu - two best friends forever - following their dreams, soon becomes Yume and ... not Koharu? Maybe it's Rola/Laura? Honestly, I don't know any more. This show just kept throwing extra characters into the plot with no real sense of purpose - in fact, their characterizations are so generic and barely fleshed out, it's difficult to get attached to even the recurring and regular cast.Only the most exaggerated and OTT characters are remotely memorable and original, but they get very annoying, very quickly - especially given their total lack of backstory to explain their weirdness.Remember the evil villain character? She's got a whole 'evil plot to steal everything from everyone for selfish gains' thing going on. Only, she just sucks at it, and comes of as obnoxious rather than threatening or mysterious. In fact, her antics do nothing but distract our poor heroines from the actual plot! Aikatsu has always been about positive competition, but this addition in the second season tries- and fails - to throw that  out the door.They did, however, introduce full-time boy idols, and a boys-only Idol part of the school. I thought that was a great change, and brought about some interesting and dynamic relationships between various characters.ART : 6.5Aikatsu s1-2 had bad CGI. 3-4 was tolerable. And Stars? Well, they try darn hard on a relatively small budget. The dresses are gorgeous, the scenery is spectacular, and there's so many cool aesthetic moments. But the dancing scenes are nothing short of awkward, and the 2d movements are actually terrible, which is a shame.SOUND : 7.5It's Aikatsu, so the music is as great as you'd expect  - there's so much variety, from pirate jives to gothic ballads to pop princess bops. And they're all really, honestly, fantastic to listen to! The OP and ED songs are all catchy and thematic. I just wish they'd had more team- and unit-based songs! Hoo boy.

This series are somewhat inferior to original Aikatsu but it is pretty worth watching.Aikatsu series describe friendship well. Also this series do that well.I like Yume and Raula's friendship, Yuzu and Lilly's friendship, Yozora and Mahiru's family relationship.I like older S4 especially Yuzu and Yozora.Yuzu is quiet tolerant person and she is always worried about someone, she has warm heart.Yozora is always worried about her younger sister Mahiru. She is ideal sister, I think....I wonder Yozora failed against Mahiru on purpse or not??Yozora tend to think that.Anyway, all of older S4 are pretty wonderful people.I wanted such person as my senior people.I want to transfer to Yotsuboshi Academy XDfrom now on, I am going to watch next season.I'm looking forward to watch that too!!

Previously I was watched a few episodes of Aikatsu friends when it debuted and it was very alright. It was honestly a surprise to be a lot more engage with it. With Stars, there\'s a focus given by the story and world building. There wasn\'t an episode where it felt force because the general plot help give the characters some focus, even if said episodes had nothing to do with the story.I really appreciate the constant theme of having the girls lose, being able to grieve for their failures before trying again, usually by changing their...goals. It\'s hard to describe but it\'s really comforting to see.Despite how very generic the first half looks conceptually, I think it\'s better than the second half. There\'s a lot of new elements in the second half that aren\'t really explained well as the first half, like why there\'s even a moon star coord (and how Hime even got it) when Elza and the other girls busted their ass for their star coords. Elza also seems unnaturally cold. Maybe I had a different perception of what her was but once her backstory was revealed it was like ""oh..."" She\'s understandably very cold and goal driven but she\'s never really criticized by people outside the main group. I also wish Rei had more of a goal outside of Elza.The 3D segments takes some time getting used to, my real gripe with them is how wide the mouths can get. I\'d say the songs in the later half are better than the first half but mostly since I remember and enjoy those more. goals.

Ashita no Nadja,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1946/Ashita_no_Nadja,"[""(Introduction)Nadja was one of my early childhood anime back in the early ’00s but I don’t seem to remember how it ended or how the story progresses. What I remember is the main plot itself when it aired on my local television network. It's been more than a decade since I watch it, so I decided to finally pick it up and make a full series rewatch on it last year. I was happy that I did. Because I am surprised the anime gave me a sort of diamond of the ruff impression about it. A good TV series for what it is...from start to finish. This review will discuss further why this show is a hidden gem of its time and what makes Nadja a good show.(Story/Plot/Writing) (7/10: Good) (Spoiler Free)Starting off the Review Ashita no Nadja or commonly known as Tomorrow's Nadja for international audiences, the story follows the Adventure of Nadja Applefield. Traveling around European Continent in search of clues of her mother’s whereabouts while meeting friends and learning different cultures along the way. Nadja plays out like your classic late-century adventure stories where the protagonist needs to travel to new places to progress the story. We have lots of story like that in animes based around western literature that is aired during the 80s and ’90s.But sadly starting around the 2000s this type of story in the anime medium got a steady decline. In 2003 anime releases Nadja is the only show that uses the formula, thus making it very unique alongside the other series that was airing at the time. 2003 is flooded with a lot of shows with a variety of genres, with different target demographics ranging from adults, teenage and younger audiences. Nadja aims for much more younger viewers but it cannot compete with the more rule of cool focus shows that even younger kids want to watch. It's quite common that nobody actually remembers or talks about this show even today. This is where my review comes in.For an Adventure Story, I shall confidently say it’s well written and good. It has a beginning and an ending. Everything feels connected and consistent until the end of the show. Usually, for a children-oriented series, a lot of shows will make a lot of unnecessary filler episodes, especially if the show is around 50+ episodes. But in Nadja, the writers took an effort in connecting each individual episode. It makes each episode important in Nadja’s journey.The story has a rather slow exposition, pacing and each of the first episodes only give small fractions of information for the main plot. The main story doesn’t kick start until around episode 33. The initial episodes are all about establishing the characters and structured world-building by introducing various regions in Europe. The episodes focus on exploring the people in the region and cleverly describing people's lives. Nadja is also a very good example of a slice of life series. But for its credit, it gives us enough time to breathe and digests the characters and story overall.The Setting is set to place between 19th and 20th Century Europe. It's lovely to see that this anime has a lot of educational content that feels natural for the plot. As Nadja learns new things as she explores new places, the audience learns from it by simply watching this show. Feels like a fun tour of 19th or 20th Century Europe. As if the Audience is also tagging along with Adventure. There is a sense of connection and pay-off. As Nadja travels around each country, new characters and new stories are introduced that complement the setting and the entire story feels layered in a way.(Characters/ Main Supporting) (8/10: Very Good in My Opinion) (Contain Some Minor Spoiler)When it comes to characters the show shines the best. Nadja is a dancer of the Dandelion Troupe, a Small Group of Circus Entertainers, which makes a living by moving town to town to provide entertainment for the locals in the area. Each Troupe member has their own unique personality and appealing side story to share. Some are ok while others have some really good back story to boot. Aside from Nadja and Her Troupe Family, there are also some supporting characters that have their own appeal, own story, and ambitions that shape the entire narrative. Some characters, for the most part, reappear in later episodes. Revealing their own character growth and development in the process made the show even more exciting as it continues.There is some antagonist in the show that moves the story forward but there are some very despicable moments in the show that might ignite audience emotion into the wall. If you wondering how nasty are the so-called villains? I recommend you guys to check it out from start to finish to understand what I am talking about. This show knows how to give a really bad time experience for our main heroine.Now moving to our main heroine, “Nadja AppleField”, for a classic late-century female protagonist, there isn’t much anything special to say about her. She is good for what she does in her role, serving as a mediator for the character's conflict, the voice of reasons, and the eyes and ears of the audience in exploring the world surrounding her. The only gripe I have for Nadja as a person is that she sorts of lacks an interesting personality. Sure, she got the looks of the main character, she is very beautiful, but she is very reactive in a lot of situations. There are moments in the show that her kind-hearted nature sometimes results in people taking advantage of her kindness. I consider this annoying. Luckily her flaws are corrected by supporting characters that compromise her weakness and save the day.But Hey that’s what makes her likable in the first place. An innocent pure-hearted maiden that only wishes the best in a person. To me, I refer more proactive and dynamic heroines that plan ahead and knows when a person is taking advantage of her good intentions.(Technical Stuff) (Art & Animation 7/10)( Music and Sound Design 7/10)In the technical aspect of the show, for a 2003 anime, it's good and well polished. Given that this a 50 episode series where the art style and animation remain consistent. The aesthetic is pleasing though some character designs are rather dull. The only character that stands out, when it comes to design, is Nadja's design and the clothes she wears.Fun Fact:If you are wondering why it seems like the Key Art Style and Animation have heavy resemblances to some very cutesy style common in 2000’s magical girl series like example: Precure or Doremi look so similar. Then you are not wrong in making that assumption. Seeing in was made by Toei Animation Studio. Toei has a habit of making specialized departments to work on specific aspects of their other shows. In Nadja’s case, they used their magical shoujo division to create Nadja’s Design and other characters.Music I think it's good for what it is. But wouldn’t say it's worth saving in your MP3 song list. The OP and ED are good for what they supposed to function. When it comes to the background music and sound effects it's Ok. Nothing special but classical music always works on the show set in the late century so it’s a pass.(Enjoyment/ Bias Personal Opinion)(7/10 Good and Memorable, But Doesn’t Give a Hard-Hitting Impact for Me as Person)This is the section I will say both my positive and negative personal comments about the show base on my own flawed reference. There are things that I found amazing in the show that I don’t see much on other shows and at the same time, there are some very boring and jarring moments in the show that I wish the show will continue giving me that magic. The show has some very cheesy cliché and a number of plot conveniences but I know myself that Nadja is a simple show that has its own strength and weaknesses. And to be fair there are more good moments in the show that far out weight the bad ones. And for an anime aim for kids. It far exceeded what I supposed to expect it to be.Back then when I was a kid, Nadja was like another Saturday Morning Cartoon for me. Now as an adult I see it as one of the good series the 2003 era has to offer. It has far more meaningful moral content that can be applied in real life. I can appreciate the people who made this has some good intentions in mind. Personally, I think it’s a good show that worth recommending to everyone that shares the same interest as me.(Final Thoughts) (Overall 7.4/10 A show worth recommending to a few)In summary, the show is all about Nadja Apple Field's life story but magnificently built upon collective stories of unique individuals from distinct places, cultural traditions, and social standing. You are given a variety of viewpoints to create a moral ground of what is good or bad with an added heartbreaking plot twist I wouldn’t expect on a show for kids.I like that the anime's main moral lesson teaching follows the Japanese tradition of teaching children “omoiyari” or showing empathy to others, the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. In short caring for others. Which by the way, mature adults in the show teach Nadja when she creates a one-sided opinion on a person.In a simple line of dialogue.“Not all people are 100 percent good or evil. Everybody has their reason”This line really hit me hard. Because this idea remains steady throughout the entire show. Most kids teach the younger audiences what a good guy and a bad guy look like but in Nadja. It teaches you to think and understand a person's situation. It encourages people to not draw out selfish conclusions in defining what a person is. A lesson that is more relevant today because of the advent of social media spreading wildfire of conspiracy about groups and specific individuals.I might add, I didn’t expect this show to have complicated romances, social class conspiracy theory, and critical commentary about 19th and 20th Century mentality that seemingly controversial if ever talk about or look upon during that era.I like the charm of the show is a mixed bag of sharing meaningful moral content and unnecessarily wackily looney quirks. Huge respect for this anime-original where the studio is making an effort to write a complete story entertainment for people to enjoy.I hope when people watch Tomorrow's Nadja, the Inner “Noblesse Oblige” will surface in their hearts.“With great wealth comes the responsibility to give back to those who are less fortunate than oneself”“But Noblesse Oblige is not always giving material wealth”“Everyone can give back in different ways, on any shape or forms that will truly help people to stand up in life”Thanks for Reading. from start to finish.

This anime is a rough diamond and it’s a shame not as many people have seen it as one may like.The story involves the backdrop of Nadja trying to find her mother. As she travels with a troupe of entertainers she encounters many different personalities, stories, dances and gains clues on who her mother maybe. The story is also comprised of many testing factors for...Nadja such as friendships, betrayals, love triangles, greed, noblesse oblige and loss- all of which keep the episodes interesting and entertaining until the very end. The story really develops and gains pace after episode 35 though, before that’s its mostly character building.The animation is the only technical aspect in my opinion which is a slight let down but after a while I got used to it- maybe that’s how it was intended to be; to be unique from the other animés?The characters are charming in their own way. Expect some vile female characters though and some dodgy suspicious men. Most of the characters have at least an episode to themselves but of course development is more one the main ones than the supporting characters.It was an enjoyable series for me.

It’s a good watch: Ashita no Nadja ~', ""A modern television masterpiece is what this show is. Very few television shows, let alone longer than 13 episodes, are so well built, thought out and whole as this one and to top it all even the animation and sound production values are on a par with today's standards.A very recommended show to everyone, and a must watch for lovers of epic dramas, romances and adventure.Nadja is a young orphan girl who sets out of her orphanage to seek her family origins around europe of the early 20th century, armed only with her mother's party gown, journal and heart shaped brooch. She joins a traveling...performance group and mutually falls in love with a young nobleman whom she meets along the way.Nadja's personal and private journey is about to end up as an affair to fascinate all of europe, royalty and working class alike. But two steps back - as opposed to the later half of the series, it begins in a rather light note which seems to be radiating, easy going, cheerful and impossibly optimistic - all flows out of the titular character's beliefs and way of view.Some of those episode might be misleading as the show's main core is very hard, almost ruthless intense drama. Some viewers might need to hold themselves down while the show sets up its world and premise, but they would be rewarded beyond compare.The writers, and voice actress Ami Koshimizu, made an excellent work with fleshing out Nadja's character. I found her fascinating and a character to look up to, she is very strong willed, brave, thoughtful, humble and kind hearted. I was surprised at how deeply her ideals and beliefs are tested and challenged as the series progresses.While Nadja is the most examined character throughout the show, she is accompanied by an impressively large cast of unique characters from different countries, social classes and economic levels.There are almost no stock characters or stereotypes, each background character stands by its own right and almost all of them are being treated as seriously as a main character in a every other show. They have strong dilemmas and a distinctive take on life, they easily receive amazing closures, conclusions and catharsis.Other than the excellent writing, the direction is also very precise. Each frame is carefully crafted and there's an impressive weight to light, shadows, colors and compositions. Takuya Igarashi (Ouran High School Host Club, Soul Eater) is the one to be thankful for and now everything he touches is automatically in my watchlist.To sum it up i can not stress enough how amazing this show is and how important it is for it to be more known and popular. If you're thinking even a little about trying it out then by all means GO FOR IT.Thanks for reading, and enjoy your journey. performance group and mutually falls in love with a young nobleman whom she meets along the way.Nadja's personal and private journey is about to end up as an affair to fascinate all of europe, royalty and working class alike.

Before I go on with my review let me tell a short little story. A couple of years back, my brother and I started watching this anime not knowing what to expect. But before you know it we got so hooked that we saw that last 8 episodes in Spanish not understanding a word they were saying and with no subtitles just to see what will happen. This anime becomes an emotional roller-coaster maybe unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's a masterpiece and it's sad that most people don't know about it giving it's from 2004 and...the fact that it was so rare to find anywhere. But maybe now if more people see it they will spread the word because anime fans need to see this!Now on with the review!Story 10/10: Not spoiling anything, the story revolves around Nadja, a young orphan who finds out her mother might still be alive and her adventures around the world in the company of the Dandelion troupe, a travelling group of street performers filled with colorful characters. It's a magnificent tale of discovery, wonder and awe. The story starts and keeps a rather cheerful tone until the third act when things get serious. You will get so invested in this after the first half that you will have to see all of it in one sitting. And I'm not saying the first half is bad by any means it's just the tone of the overall plot that differs. Starting with a revelation and a quick departure on an adventure, continuing to explore the joy of travelling around the world and ending with intrigue and emotional conflicts.Art 9/10: The art is very good for 2004 being colorful and elegant. It's joyful, intense and refined getting you really immersed into the anime. You can definitely see the effort put into this.Sound 10/10: The sound in this anime is excellent! Starting from the wonderful intro to all the other songs that accompany Nadja's performance with the Dandelion troupe, the themes and the ending, the sound is perfect in this anime. Everything you hear is like an year massage, it just sounds great.Characters 10/10: Oh the characters. There are allot of colorful characters in this anime and you will enjoy each and every one of them for their role, from the over the top villains to the joyful warm Dandelion members that make Nadja feel like family and the seriousness of the heroes. Nadja herself if very enjoying to watch because you can see her grow and mature throughout her experience around the world and also you really want to cheer for her seeing how she tries her best never to give up and works hard towards her goals. The male lead or leads which are also the love interest are really interesting as well. They are equally determined in their goals and interest for Nadja and feel the need to help her in every way possible. Their ways of achieving their goals is very different and their view of the world is also different but you will find yourself rooting for one or another or both nevertheless. The villains are great as well rating from silly to charming and over the top or to diabolically clever and maleficent. But they are not villains just for the sake of it, they all have their reasons, be them good or bad and they play a big part on how much you will get invested in this anime.Enjoyment 10/10: If you can't already tell I've really really enjoyed this anime. I consider it a masterpiece, and although subjective as this opinion might be I think everyone who will see it will think of it as either good or excellent if they are being honest. Like I said earlier it becomes so griping that you will skip a night of sleep with having to go to work the next day just to see it to the end.Overall 10/10: I can't rate this lower than 10. It's just such a great experience which I wish on everyone. This anime will make a permanent mark on you and you will never forget it. Give it a try, disregard the fact that it's a little old or longer than your average 12/24 episodes running shows today and watch it! You will not be disappointed! the fact that it was so rare to find anywhere. But maybe now if more people see it they will spread the word because anime fans need to see this!Now on with the review!Story 10/10: Not spoiling anything, the story revolves around Nadja, a young orphan who finds out her mother might still be alive and her adventures around the world in the company of the Dandelion troupe, a travelling group of street performers filled with colorful characters.

You will get so invested in this after the first half that you will have to see all of it in one sitting. And I'm not saying the first half is bad by any means it's just the tone of the overall plot that differs. Starting with a revelation and a quick departure on an adventure, continuing to explore the joy of travelling around the world and ending with intrigue and emotional conflicts.Art 9/10: The art is very good for 2004 being colorful and elegant. It's joyful, intense and refined getting you really immersed into the anime. You can definitely see the effort put into this.Sound 10/10: The sound in this anime is excellent! Starting from the wonderful intro to all the other songs that accompany Nadja's performance with the Dandelion troupe, the themes and the ending, the sound is perfect in this anime. Everything you hear is like an year massage, it just sounds great.Characters 10/10: Oh the characters. There are allot of colorful characters in this anime and you will enjoy each and every one of them for their role, from the over the top villains to the joyful warm Dandelion members that make Nadja feel like family and the seriousness of the heroes. Nadja herself if very enjoying to watch because you can see her grow and mature throughout her experience around the world and also you really want to cheer for her seeing how she tries her best never to give up and works hard towards her goals. The male lead or leads which are also the love interest are really interesting as well. They are equally determined in their goals and interest for Nadja and feel the need to help her in every way possible. Their ways of achieving their goals is very different and their view of the world is also different but you will find yourself rooting for one or another or both nevertheless. The villains are great as well rating from silly to charming and over the top or to diabolically clever and maleficent. But they are not villains just for the sake of it, they all have their reasons, be them good or bad and they play a big part on how much you will get invested in this anime.Enjoyment 10/10: If you can't already tell I've really really enjoyed this anime. I consider it a masterpiece, and although subjective as this opinion might be I think everyone who will see it will think of it as either good or excellent if they are being honest. Like I said earlier it becomes so griping that you will skip a night of sleep with having to go to work the next day just to see it to the end.Overall 10/10: I can't rate this lower than 10. It's just such a great experience which I wish on everyone. This anime will make a permanent mark on you and you will never forget it. Give it a try, disregard the fact that it's a little old or longer than your average 12/24 episodes running shows today and watch it! You will not be disappointed!"", ""A true masterpiece and one of my all time favorites.Nadja is not just some cute 'ow no, my footsie is stuck' damsel in distress.she's cheeky and feisty and takes her destiny in her own hands.The art is so beautiful and detailed and it's always a  joy to see a traveling anime appreciate beautiful landscapes and cultures.The characters are all lovable and grow as the story progresses.Though the badguys are practically old men forms of jessie and james, the story is not without dangers.The tears and laughter are completely maxed out!A young girl full of life, a charming prince, a dashing thief, a warm homey...circus groupIf you're searching for a fairy tale story similar to Nobody's boy Remi, Anastasia and Town Musicians of Bremen, don't search any further! circus groupIf you're searching for a fairy tale story similar to Nobody's boy Remi, Anastasia and Town Musicians of Bremen, don't search any further!"", 'Oh, Nadja. Where do I begin?Set in a story that takes place ""a hundred years ago"" which is basically the twentieth century, and they do tell you this a lot if you do not skip the opening and closing parts of the anime, this story tells of a spirited blond filled with brimming light, and nothing less, simply known as Nadja. And, something that will also be incredibly muttered throughout the entire anime, she is on a mission. What is it? To seek her dear mother, of course.Ashita no Nadja is one of the very few anime I have seen where I can not say...it feels like an anime. Heck, I could compare it to the Dragon Ball franchise in that regard. I know very well what I am watching is anime, but it looks like it takes a style of its very own.Humorously enough, Toei Animation did indeed animate Ashita no Nadja as well, which was something I literally just discovered well writing this review and it made me laugh quite a bit since I made this example before I found this out. Life sure does throw things at you unexpectedly.Anyway, this anime quite obviously has all of the commonplace themes you will find in an anime. All the girls have big eyes, all the boys don\'t, comedy will exaggerate their bodily portions; you get the idea. But, as you watch it, sometimes, you might consider it something else due to how uniquely it presents the world around it.Nadja has a bit of what you would call ""protagonist syndrome"" but with the most generic trait of all: she is kind to everybody around her and only wishes for goodwill among all. It certainly was not gearing up to be one of my favorite anime at all with such a character, and I honestly believed I would grow tired of her very quickly. But, surprisingly, after about a dozen episodes (yes, you really do have to dive into this one before it gets good), I grew to actually love this character. I would go so far as to even rank her in my top five favorites.As I said before, she is indeed a spirited blond. Nadja has nothing BUT unwavering spirit! Her character very rarely becomes despondent, and it becomes very admirable as you watch her go. A bit similar to most journey anime, she will indeed meet a lot of people along the way. Her determination for her unique idealism, her compassion among her loved ones and her cheerful, bright outlook on life will never leave you in anything but awe.The anime calls itself a ""romance,"" but I feel it should have clearly put itself into the ""comedy"" genre as well, since I laughed at a vast majority of the episodes a lot. The visual gags are what will really set you ablaze if you are not one that gawks down at your phone the whole time you\'re watching; and if you are, please stop reading this right now and go watch something else. This anime demands your unbridled attention if you want to get the best out of it.This anime is quite silly! Most of the time, Nadja will puff up when she is angry or show one of the most adorable expressions you have ever seen. One thing I can say for sure is that Nadja\'s design is something you may never see again for a while, as far as unique flavor goes. Despite how adorable she is, her design is pretty simplistic to look at. And this is especially surprising, considering the time this anime aired.Of course, this anime is also a drama and it does this very well, too. Some of the more intense moments will leave you in tears, but the intensity level is usually not all that high most of the time. It will really warm you up to the adventure and characters before you come across any seriousness throughout, which is a very good thing since, at the pace this anime goes, it does indeed thrive with this kind of story progression. And, as it is also a romance, expect some pretty deep lovers\' quarrels to occur throughout. Some of them grow rather intense, well others are much more lighthearted.But, the strongest quality about Ashita no Nadja does not fall in just its characters, the journey or even Nadja herself. No, it is the scenery; more specifically, the environments they travel, the places they see and the soundtrack that compliments. This anime would not have been nearly as enjoyable if it was not for how rich the art style looks. It gives off a plain look if you are a pessimist, but to any art lovers out there, this one will sweep you away with its simplicity in detail. And the soundtrack is something that any anime enthusiast could enjoy. I am still looking for it myself! But, you know how anime soundtracks are. If they are unreleased, you will never find them.So, if you are still with me, you may now you ask ""great, you told me the characters, the unique landscapes and all that, but what make this anime so great that you give it such accolades"" well, it is just that: everything I mentioned. That may not be the answer you were looking for, but I genuinely mean everything I said with a passionate heart. This anime thrives from its unique flavor in the art, story and soundtrack choices. Every now and then, they will dip into the public domain as some characters do learn commonplace music and play it, but the soundtrack you hear whenever the natural scenes occur usually have something original in place. It will certainly not be a soundtrack that you can forget. It is one I never want to forget.This anime is also quite long for being an adventure journey about a more realistic setting. Normally, these ones take place in fantasy settings or are action anime, so it is quite interesting to see one where the setting is still a journey, but not really about fighting a bunch of baddies or anything extreme like that; rather, about a girl that simply wants to find her special someones. An anime like this is certainly hard to jump into knowing this information, but if you do like comedies, dramas, romances or all of the above, then this one is the one you should watch. Oh, and it most definitely has shoujo in it, so it is something you would feel a bit embarrassed to watch when a friend walks in the room. Or, better yet, they might fall in love with it too.Oh, and you better be sure to watch this one with a full night\'s rest, because this one will bombard you with historical facts at times. If you are a fan of literature, this anime will not disappoint you there, either. You will learn more of the ancient civilizations, rural landscapes and their history. Of course, this is not heavily prioritized, but in some episodes, it plays a major role in the story.I want to say more, but I feel I should end things here. It is an anime that I want to make sure you see as brand new if thou hast never lain thy eyes upon it before. And if you have, show it to the world, show it to everyone that loves anime. This is one that I can say would for sure show to you all of the positives about anime, well also showing some of the negatives every now and then and even some of the cliché every now and then. But, the last one will definitely not really apply for newcomers.So, what are you waiting for? Are you ready to ride on a long journey with Nadja? Are you ready for all the comical mischief that awaits you and Her, alongside the seriousness, the wonderful places and the beautiful melodies? If so, then stop reading this right now, go boot up your favorite anime website and give it a go! Just note that, as I said before, despite all the optimism I show towards Ashita no Nadja, I did admit that it took me quite a while to really dive in. It might be the same for you, too. Maybe it will take more. Or, perhaps, maybe it will take less. Either way, do not leave it without giving it at least an hour of your time with a few episodes.Despite how comical I was with this review, I, again, mean everything I said with a burning passion. I love this anime a lot and it was an experience that reminded me why I have never stopped watching the stuff after so long. Truly one that, despite it having embarrassing moments alongside the comical and sorrowful ones, where you would feel a bit abashed if watching with a friend, is most indefinitely worth it to see it all the way to the end.Indeed, it has achieved a lot of impressive feats, despite being an anime before a manga. it feels like an anime.

The several dance choreographies that she learned in her journey were a great addiction to this show: they were cute and catchy, emphasized Nadja's  bright personality and were a good stepping stone to differentiate this anime from the rest of the shoujo.The story is overall simple, but the plot becomes more...complex whenever Nadja's two love interests are brought into the spotlight. As they represent opposite sides of the same coin, they often create an internal conflict in Nadja, as she not only  tries to sort out her feelings for each of them, but also tries to find her own answers to define what is morally acceptable: in fact, can a wrongdoing be justified if it's done for a good cause?That being said (SPOILER ALERT), the finale was somehow surprising to me, when Nadja prioritized her wish of traveling and having adventures with the troupe over her romantic relationship or spending more time with her mother. However, it was also that same adventurous spirit that allowed her to find her lost mother, so we can say that the ending is surprising but consistent with Nadja's personality.Finally,the OST was amazing: I rarely skipped the extremely-addictive ending song. complex whenever Nadja's two love interests are brought into the spotlight.

Diamond no Ace OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25341/Diamond_no_Ace_OVA,"['Diamond No Ace OVA covers the backstory of the Kawakami, Kuramochi and the Kominato brothers.  It\'s really nothing special at all.  It\'s just three filler episodes.  The first episode covers the Kominato brothers and pretty much retells the same story as you already got in the main series, about Haruichi following in Ryousuke\'s footsteps.  There\'s literally nothing new here except a little extra footage showing how Ryousuke ended up at Seidou.The second episode is more entertaining, as it follows Kuramochi\'s path from a delinquent who was rejected by all the high schools he wanted to attend because of his...behavior, to being chosen by Rei to join Seidou.  This was the funniest of the episodes.The third episode was kind of a snoozer like the first episode, as it shows Kawakami struggling to believe in himself and Miyuki, Azuma and some of the management and staff helping him to believe in himself.  I\'ve never been a huge fan of Kawakami, as he\'s more of a ""Yamcha"" character to me, so I wasn\'t really all that interested.  Besides, Kawakami\'s character arc in the main anime is still pretty much the same.  A guy with decent talent, a fourth-stringer, struggling to believe he belongs.  But, let\'s be real here, the guy is a supporting character playing the same position as the two main characters in Sawamura and Furuya.  He\'s pretty bland, nothing much stands out about him, and he\'s easily overshadowed. He\'s Yamcha behind Goku and Vegeta. He\'s Kiba behind Naruto and Sasuke. He barely matters, which is evidenced by the fact that most of the time he pitches in the main series, the episode just skips past it and let\'s you know he closed out okay. Even they know you don\'t care.  But, he got his own episode in this, so that pretty much lets you know how crucial this filler is.You don\'t need to watch it and you won\'t miss anything if you don\'t.

Full Metal Panic!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/71/Full_Metal_Panic,"[""When I first started watching this series, I had very high hopes for this, due to many of my friends saying great things about this series. You can safely say that I was not disappointed.This series follows a member of the Mithril organization, Sousuke Sagara. He has been assigned with the task of protecting a high school girl, Chidori Kaname, from terrorists and other bad people. To do this, he has to enroll in her high school. Of course, when Sousuke is a stiff with no experience or knowledge whatsoever when it comes to socializing with other people, trouble is predestined to arise.The story...of this anime series is pretty good. In one moment, you're watching an intense and serious battle situation, where giant robot fights it out with futuristic technology, and in the next, you're watching a really good high school comedy. This series changes between those two a lot, and it's done well, because you get a mix of genres, varying from mecha to high school comedy at its best. This makes the story really enjoyable. There's one flaw, however, and that's the all to open ending of the series. But then again, it has a sequel, so I'm okay with that.I really loved the animation style in this series. It didn't have a lot of unique features, if any at all, so I can't and won't give it a top score. There was however no noticeable flaws, and some very cool CGI at times (usually I'm not a fan of CGI in anime, but it was done pretty well here).The soundtrack of this anime was, well, pretty average. It can boast about good OP and ED themes, but aside that, it's not very much to listen to at all.The series feature a lot of various characters, from the un-killable bad guy to the stiff, no-experience-in-socializing military kid and the ever so normal teenage girl. There's a lot of other various characters (like a pacifistic girl who's the leader of the good guys' organization (at least she's the captain of their main submarine)), and the woman-loving, easy-going guy. Yes, the characters can seem very unoriginal, but I still enjoyed watching them. There was not a lot of character development present; aside a teeny bit on Chidori and Sousuke's part.All in all, this was a very enjoyable anime series, and I'm keeping my hopes up for the sequel, as well as the spin-off. If you enjoy some good action as well as high school humor, you should definitely watch this series.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) of this anime series is pretty good.

I was expecting a compelling story, jaw-dropping action scenes, and decent humor. Those predictions went zero for three.Instead, I got a series which seems to have no clue what kind of story it wants to tell. Is it a romance story framed around action and comedy? Or is it an action series with comedy and romance thrown in? This synthesis can work, as long as the director is talented enough, and as long as putting these...different elements together actually makes sense. Here, it doesn't.It's ridiculously contrived; there's no logical reason for a secret military organization to protect a Japanese schoolgirl, there's no explanation for why they would do so by any means other than kidnapping her, and there's no attempt at justifying a valuable military agent being used for that purpose.  The whole pay-off here is supposed to be the humor in a naive member of the Special Forces going undercover in a Japanese high school.Now, if this set-up was treated as something absurd in its own right, with the fourth wall being broken, it could work.  But therein lies the problem.  It's treated seriously, just like a 14 year old, pink-haired, cute girl with giant eyes and a soft voice being the supreme commander of our secret military organization is treated with stone-faced sincerity, also.Then, the viewer is suddenly expected to care when the show takes a serious turn, and our Japanese schoolgirl heroine Chidori is kidnapped by an evil terrorist.  It just doesn't work together; either stick with a humorous, light-hearted comedy approach, or go with a suspenseful action series instead.Worse still, neither the comedy, action, nor the romance in this series is particularly good.The humor was bland. A lot of canned, frequently repeated jokes from live action films, and too much of it based on a clueless military protagonist who doesn't understand civilians, a running gag which wears thin quickly.  Most disappointingly, the show at no point mocks its own absurd premise.The cast is filled with shallow, cliche characters, stereotypical and retarded anime conventions (high school girls beat up a highly trained military operative), and perplexing and unreasonable events. One can't make a solid romance in such circumstances, either.The action was marginal at best, and an awful, mailed in job at the worst. The hand-to-hand fighting was stiff, awkward, and is worse than at least half the action anime from the nineties, let alone this decade. The mecha action was worse than any Gundam series from the mid 90's onward.The positives of the series is that it has good pacing and at least tries to inject some comedy into the work. The animation is also nice. That's about it. Don't believe the rest of the hype. different elements together actually makes sense.

The mecha action was worse than any Gundam series from the mid 90's onward.The positives of the series is that it has good pacing and at least tries to inject some comedy into the work. The animation is also nice. That's about it. Don't believe the rest of the hype."", ""STORY8/10Basically, Sargeant Sagara Sousuke, from the anti-terrorism organization Mithril, goes undercover to protect Chidori Kaname, a girl who holds the key to &quot;Black Technology&quot; and is targeted by a terrorist and mastermind criminal. The twist is that Sousuke is socially retarded and he enjoys using his military knowledge in everyday life which causes all kinds of problems and hilarious situations. This definitely was not one of the more believable shows I&rsquo;ve encountered.  How could one of the world&rsquo;s most feared and professional military units have a 16 year old commander who tolerates abuse from her peers and subordinates?  If you can get past...this (I did), the storyline was pretty good.ANIMATION7/10As expected from GONZO, the animation was good. The character and mecha designs weren&rsquo;t the most original I&rsquo;ve encountered. One good point worth mentioning was the contrasting choices of colors. The battle/war scenes were expectedly dark and brooding, whilst the na&iuml;ve and cheerful school environment was vibrantly bright. It was very nice and clean, and very colorful with the variety of characters' hair colors.The unimpressove cg for the submarine was the only thing that bothered me though. Most of the animation was pretty good, but it didn't really leave a big impression on me.MUSIC8/10The OP and ED were extremely pleasant songs. The ED was especially serene. Even though I didn&rsquo;t listen to it in full after all 24 episodes, it definitely was near to that. The voice actors also really fit their characters. From the emotional Chidori to serious Sousuke.CHARACTERS9/10This is the forte of FMP. Each and every character is distinct and very likeable. It would be hard not to find a character in this show that you would not like. Also, the chemistry between Chidori and Sousuke really drives the plot forward. My favorite characters have to be Chidori, Sousuke and Testarossa. Chidori looks like an angel but can be a tough opponent the next moment. Enter Sousuke the professional teenage soldier who has no clue how to live as a normal student. Hence he keeps seeing a terrorist in almost every person, leading him to save her many times from things harmless. It was a joy to watch their relationship develop. I can't quite put my finger on why I like Testarossa but her being there added something to both Chidori and Sousuke characters that would otherwise be missing. She is also a solid character by herself, caring for her crew and trying to do the right thing but she is clumsy to the core and I suspect a hopeless romantic.ENJOYMENT9/10Great series and theres still more! Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid still awaits and it has a bundle of surprises just like this series. I couldn't stop watching this series even if my arms were cut off. Pretty grotesque but thats how fun this anime was. I loved the bipolar nature of this series. One episode a light-hearted high school comedy, the next a serious action adventure.I would recommend this without any hesitation.

It's a very good mixture of humour, action and suspense. In fact, it balanced everything very well so that the anime is neither too heavy, nor too light. It's serious, without being too serious, if you see what I mean. Well, there aren't many things to criticize about Full Metal Panic (FMP), rather there are many things to compliment. Up to now, I found nothing particularly bad. Save perhaps for the lack of details here and there. But if you...think a bit, or rewatch it, everything becomes clear. In brief, Animation is great. Sound is very satisfactory. Story is great. Characters are very detailed. And the enjoyment is ever present! What more to ask for? Let me start the detailed review then.- [ Animation = 9 ] -FMP was one of the first animes I saw. It must have been like 5 years before. But when I started watching, I found the animation extremely good. The colours were vivid, the play on lights was well made, the choice of colours rendered the moods well, and the overall animation was fluid. FMP is about mechas and other machinery. These were well detailed and very well designed, in terms of futuristic ideas and components. The characters too were well drawn, the eyes a bit too big sometimes which ruins the realism. However, they are cute, specially the girls. There are hardly any frame-reuse or things like that. The scenes too were good, although they are hardly animated (if you compare to the likes of Black Lagoon). However, FMP has a good standard. And also, note the use of CGI here and there, specially for the Dannan submarine and underwater scenes. For once, the CGI is good, and not bizarre like some animes portray. There are hardly any glitches in the animation, earning FMP a 9 for animation.- [ Sound = 9] -Sound rarely gets my attention. Here is was worth it. The music used is lively and suits the moods well. They can switch from heavy to lively in an instant, and through the use of sound effects, the transition is smooth. They did a good job on the soundworks for FMP. The OP and ED are good, although I have a preference for the OP's music. There are not much in-episode music, but when they come, they are good!The voice actors too did their job, and did a great work at displaying the various emotions of the chracters, from the stern Sagara to the lively Chidori. It might just be me, but sometimes, I found the tones just slightly exaggerated. (However, this seems normal since all of Chidori's moods are exaggerated!)- [ Story = 9 ] -FMP packs a great story. I've seen animes revolve around mecha, displaying a wide array of fights and explosions, without a really good story. However, FMP did well again here.The story is that of Kaname Chidori who is one of the Whispered, but who lives as a normal schoolgirl, unknowing of her own powers. The Whispered have special abilities that allow them to interact with machines and possess enormous amounts of knowledge on various things. They can design extremely complex machinery with their knowledge. Now, other organisations are after the Whispered to gain access to their knowledge, for the development of weapons and such. Sagara Souske is given the mission to protect Chidori, along with his comrades Melissa Mao and Weber Kruz. Sagara is a millitary expert and extremely proficient at his trade. He works under the command of Mithril, a high-tech mercenary organization.The mission seems simple, but for Sagara who is foreign to normal school-life, things can get pretty dirty. Chidori things Sagara is stalking him, whereas he thinks he's protecting her. Expect lots of humour, ecchiness and fan-hits. Yes, paper-fan hits!As you see, the story is quite complex and lively, and it ends beautifully. Not only that, there are 2 sequels afterwards, and 3 OVAs! If you want more FMP afterwards, check out FMP: Fumoffu (Joke episodes and fun) and FMP: The Second Raid (The second volet of FMP). The OVAs are pretty much humouristic than story-oriented.I gave it an 8 because sometimes, the plot can be just a bit difficult to understand due to a lack of clear details.- [ Character = 9 ] -The characters in FMP, although not many, are very diversed. Sagara is too stern. Chidori is extremely lively. Weber is too relaxed. Mao is a perv. Tessa is an all-out Sagara admirer. Sagara? He lives in a nutshell like a hermit! :PThe characters and their behavior are very varied, and through interaction with each other, they evolve (no they are NOT pokemon!) and become better. It's quite fun to see this evolution, specially the haphazard one of Sagara!Their respective backgrounds are also well introduced. Nothing is rushed and we are given enough details about them. Not too much (since the rest comes in the sequels). We also get to see the strange behavior of Sagara, like carrying a big arsenal of guns wherever he goes, and being over-protective of Chidori, who doesn't know she's protected. All these add to the fun!- [ Value and Enjoyment = 9 ] -FMP is really funny sometimes. The constant blunders of Sagara will always get you laughing. However, if you are looking for suspense and mystery, you'll also find it in FMP, when the stuff about Whispered comes up. If you are looking for mecha action and fights, you will be satisfied too!There is also a fair bit of ecchiness for those who like it.. Also, expect violence and fights.The rewatch value lies in going back to the fun parts of FMP, and also to check the mysteries again, just to get a better understanding.- [ Conclusion ] -FMP deserves a watch. It's a good anime, and well balanced at that. It's sequel too are good. So give it a try and you will not regret it IMHO... think a bit, or rewatch it, everything becomes clear.

So give it a try and you will not regret it IMHO..."", 'Full Metal Panic is a series that tries to please two kinds of viewer, and as a result, succeeds at neither.The problem with it, in general, is that Full Metal Panic is both a serious militaristic action series and a high school comedy at the same time. Now, I\'ve seen quite a few things over my years that should not go together, but do anyway. This, however, is not one of them. The two of them are essentially a massive clash, rather than a well-mixed combination.The premise of Full Metal Panic is this: Kaname Chidori is one of the ""Whispered"", a group of people who...have the power to generate information... or something along those lines. The details are kept vague, for the most part. As a result, terrorist organisations are after her, leading the military superpower Mithril, belonging to no particular government, to send Sosuke Sagara, our main character, into her school disguised as a student to watch over her. Hijinks ensue.The high school comedy side of the series is lacking, to say the least. It\'s mostly the standard material you would expect to see in that kind of series, mainly humour based around comedic misunderstandings, very little of which is really funny at all. Played for laughs most of the time is Sosuke\'s complete maladjustment to normal society, which is usually more cringeworthy than it is entertaining.The military half of the series is considerably more interesting, and are very true to a military style of series, and certainly fit the scene, whatever it may be. They use the perfect blend of dialogue, action, drama and realism to keep those episodes afloat. One of the things I like more about the series is the antagonist Gauron. The pure nihilism of his actions is always entertaining, if questionable. While the questionableness of his actions is, in one way, a good thing, what I refer more to is that you really have to wonder why in the hell he\'s doing them. One does not simply kidnap, murder, maime, hijack and possibly rape just for the fuck of it, and his reason for doing so isn\'t given passing mention in the series. The sequel, Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid clears a bit more on the subject, though it is still annoying to watch the first season without his motives brought into question.A big problem with the series is the pacing. As one might expect, the constant switching every other episode from wacky comedy to serious action doesn\'t really work very well. Interesting parts of the story are kept few and far between, and a large number of the episodes in the show are thoroughly pointless.Finally, my biggest complaint is the characters. Sosuke Sagara, as of the first season, is a character some enjoyed and others hated, and I have to say that I\'m in the second boat with this. His actions, as said before, are generally quite cringeworthy for the comedy side of things, and in the more serious parts of the series he is as much as you would expect of the perfect soldier: a complete tool devoid of personality. Thankfully, the series that follow the first fix these problems and then some, but in the first season he can be really painful to watch. The supporting cast is also horribly one-dimensional. Kaname Chidori is the tsundere, Kurz Weber is the handsome lecher, Melissa Mao is the action chick, and Teletha ""Tessa"" Testerosa is the moe-girl. While Gauron is an excellent antagonist, he really doesn\'t outweigh the bad cast on show here.In technical terms, Full Metal Panic isn\'t terrible, but not particularly great. The animation is OK, but there\'s a lot of CG scattered around the place. The music is unremarkable, and the voice acting isn\'t particularly great in either language. I wouldn\'t particularly recommend either track over the other. I\'d say this kind of show works better in dub (the military side of it, anyway), so that would probably be a good choice, but if you generally prefer subs then you really aren\'t missing anything.Overall, despite being pretty clearly flawed, it\'s hard to call Full Metal Panic outright bad. It\'s watchable on its own, in particular with the help of Gauron, and the series that followed (Fummofu and The Second Raid) are more than excellent enough to make this season worth watching just for the sake of watching those.Final Words:By no means a bad series, but very hit-and-miss.

It takes an interesting universe and an interesting political situation which would later be modified and evoked by Gundam 00, and then doesn\'t quite know if it wants to be a real robot show, a super robot show or a high-school comedy.My main problem with the mech combat is the ""gimmick"" of the main units - the Lambda Driver. Essentially it\'s a thing which makes the impossible possible, acting variously as a force field, an energy weapon, a TRANS-AM style turbo boost and more. It doesn\'t work too well in my opinion....Take it out and you\'ve got the potential for exciting mecha fights ala Front Mission or Armored Core, which is an angle not really explored. Leave it in and fights tend to devolve into shouting, clashing barriers and stalemates.The main villain for much of the show is an easily hated psycho in the vein of Yazan Gable, Ali Al-Sarshes etc, (female equivalents of course being Anemone, Cynthia Lane and Marida Cruz) with the added bonus of him being smug as hell and very powerful. The parts where he\'s scheming and fighting are generally very good, although as mentioned before the Lambda Driver makes the fights a little predictable by removing any chance of it being a fair fight.However, for a roughly equal amount of the show FMP is a romantic comedy about a socially inept boy and a tsundere schoolgirl in the vein of Asuka Langley Soryu. It\'s not as funny as it thinks it is (it takes the second series, Fumoffu!, to really make the comedy work by removing the mecha parts) and it sometimes seems interminable, relying on a couple of jokes that don\'t really go anywhere.If you really like high school comedy, you\'ll probably like these parts. I found they went on a bit long and ultimately weren\'t as funny as they could have been - and when the comedy mixes with the serious plot it simply leads to characters acting in completely ridiculous ways that sometimes make horror movie victims seem smart.What does make FMP enjoyable are the side characters on the mecha half of the show. Tessa and the submarine crew, as well as Sousuke\'s wingmen, are consistently awesome. There\'s a good character dynamic set up and I found myself looking forward to their screentime more than the main plot until the very final arc, in which all hell breaks loose.I think if FMP better balanced the Kindergarten Cop-esque high school parts with the mecha fights, and got rid of the Lambda Driver\'s ludicrous capabilities in order to make fights more interesting, it would be a good show. However, for me, the slightly dodgy pacing caused by the inability to smoothly mix the two genres and the at times uninteresting mech combat make it only an above average show.

The story mostly revolves around the two characters Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori.Sousuke I-got-a-stick-up-my-ass Sagara is a mercenary working for the top secret military organization MITHRIL who has been assigned to protect Kaname from a host of terrorists and governments who want to...kidnap her. Part of what makes the comedy in this story is the fact that as a hardened military veteran at the age of seventeen Sousuke's understandably unable to cope with civilian life in a High School setting. Though when it comes to social etiquette and cues he seems so dense that light appears to bend around him. Not only that, but his military discipline seems to make him so uptight he'd shit diamonds if you fed him enough coal for a week. The writers on this series tend to overplay these two aspects of the character way too much unintentionally making him the most socially retarded protagonist since Shinji Ikari.Kaname I-just-did-a-line-of-coke Chidori is the ala cart Tsundere girl in the series. So high-maintenance that she crosses into total-bitch territory a few times, her job is to adjust Sousuke to the peaceful life of Japan while making sure both of them don't get killed in the process. She is selfish, vain and very self-conscience. So, basically your typical high-school girl. Her manic behavior would be a major turn off if it weren't for the fact that she is also extremely good looking. Like Sousuke, the novelty of her character runs out of steam quickly and almost makes you wish Sousuke would just throw her to the wolves so as not to deal with her incessant harping.Though I do give this anime a lot of shit I will concede the fact that the concept is pretty decent as well as the terrorist sub-plots throughout. I'll also mention that I do in fact like the manga which is what got me to watch the anime in the first place. However, Sousuke and Kaname, two of the major pillars that make Full Metal Panic! an action-comedy both fail to deliver on the comedy part (no thanks to the writers). The jokes eventually become self-referential and go from being the selling point to the crutch of the show, much like a dog gnawing on it's own leg to get out of a bear trap.I give this one a five out of ten if only for trying to combine mecha, romance and high school comedy into one show, despite in my opinion failing at doing both and unfortunately creating a total mediocrity as a result. This also is because it falls into the category among anime fans of either being totally awesome or a bag of shit. Truth be told it's somewhere in the middle. Love may bloom on the battle field with this one, but watch out: it's a flower that comes with thorns. kidnap her.

However, Sousuke and Kaname, two of the major pillars that make Full Metal Panic! an action-comedy both fail to deliver on the comedy part (no thanks to the writers). The jokes eventually become self-referential and go from being the selling point to the crutch of the show, much like a dog gnawing on it's own leg to get out of a bear trap.I give this one a five out of ten if only for trying to combine mecha, romance and high school comedy into one show, despite in my opinion failing at doing both and unfortunately creating a total mediocrity as a result. This also is because it falls into the category among anime fans of either being totally awesome or a bag of shit. Truth be told it's somewhere in the middle. Love may bloom on the battle field with this one, but watch out: it's a flower that comes with thorns."", '""Full Metal Panic"" and its sequels are a couple of my friends\' favourite anime. But to be perfectly honest, I really don\'t see what all the fuss is about. Although the presentation is pretty shiny (it\'s GONZO after all), and the execution competent, for me, this is mostly just a bog standard action anime with some comedy moments (only some of which are funny) and some nice gripping scenes sprinkled over it. But the key word there is ""mostly""... and more on this later.You\'ve probably seen the type before. You have a military organisation, and they go on the various missions, always running into this...seemingly unkillable boomerang of a bad guy who happens to be a bit insane and wants to destroy the world or something. At the end of the show, you get the obligatory final show down between the hero and that insane villain. Most of these missions are enjoyable at the time of watching, but ultimately forgettable (in fact I have actually forgotten them), but one does stick out. It\'s where they go on a desert mission that takes place in the the main character Sagara Sousuke\'s homeland. The internal conflicts within the mission team and Sousuke\'s meeting with an old acquaintance managed to spice up the flavour quite a bit and put that extra edge of tension as well as emotion onto the story and the action.The story in ""Full Metal Panic"" is kinda incomplete, with a lot of it involving the ""Whispered"". The problem is that they don\'t really explain much about the Whispered, so by the end I was still kinda clueless about what they are. My first instinct is to blame it on GONZO, since throwing out ideas without thinking/developing/explaining them through properly is exactly the kind of thing they usually do. But now I think about it, this time the blame is probably with the manga source material rather than with the studio. I was kinda hoping ""Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid"" would be able to provide more answers, but now that I\'ve seen it, I\'m disappointed to say that it doesn\'t.The cast of ""Full Metal Panic"" are also mostly templates taken out of their respective genres. You have the usual cold blooded, evil, ruthless and insane main villain taken from a typical action movie, and the loud mouthed, aggressive female lead taken from the school life settings. Admittedly the latter did fall into the likeable side of the fence rather than the annoying (I\'m thinking of Asuka from Evangelion here). The sniper guy is a bit more interesting though, and no, not because he\'s a bit of a perv. What struck me was how useless the guy is at close combat. We\'re so used to seeing the generically all round elite soldier type who so commonly feature in today\'s media that it makes a refreshing change to see someone who\'s got clear strengths and weaknesses that reflect his role in the squad.You\'ve most likely seen the captain somewhere before. Tess - an innocent, ditzy teenage girl playing an important role on a warship, as a captain no less. Sounds familiar? [Hint hint: ""Nadesico"", ""Vandread""]) In fact I hated her more than most, for some reason she just gets on my nerves sooo baaadly. Probably because she sticks out like a sore thumb when they\'re trying to sell the story off as more serious oriented as opposed to comedy oriented like in ""Martian Successor Nadesico"". Sure she\'s a genius that has ""special abilities"", but special abilities and brain power alone doesn\'t make a good captain - that\'s why you never see a complete geek playing the captain role . The primary traits required for the job are leadership and presence... and it would be too kind to say that she has zero presence... she has bloody negative presence. Small, clumsy, pretty teenage girl with squeaky voice who often looks to her second in command for reassurance whilst commanding a ship full of hardcore mercenaries? Sounds like recipe for rebellion to me. Are all these hardcore mercenaries really gonna stomach taking commands from someone like her and do no worse than wolf whistle behind her back? I have a hard time imagining it. She\'s pretty much a purely fanservice character. And if there\'s one thing I hate more than a fanservice oriented character, it\'s a fanservice character that plays an important role and ends up distorting a more serious storyline. But the worst thing is that is that the anime plays up this cuteness thing during the character interactions so you can\'t even claim that it\'s all superficial - notice all the guys in the mercenary group goes around saying how cute/hot Tessa is as though that\'s her defining characteristic. Maybe I\'m the crazy one here, for thinking that the defining characteristic of a 16 year old captain should be something other than ""cute""! *rolleyes* I wonder whether the full version of her name - Testarossa - is based off the word ""testosterone"", as it seems her whole fan-servicey design is geared towards stimulating the production of that particular hormone from the male viewers...Luckily, there is one character that truly shines - and the bonus is that he happens to be the main character. Yes, it\'s that infamous Sagara Sousuke. In fact, he pretty much carries the anime on his back. He provides the extra spark that distinguishes this action/comedy series from its peers. Without him the anime would be a lot more dull and unremarkable. Unlike Tess, his comedy attributes doesn\'t ""clash"" with the settings very much because the jokes that involve him comes from the fact that he does his job not incompetently, but rather TOO competently. He doesn\'t know anything OTHER than doing his job. And this is clever because this one defining aspect of his character enables him to fill both the comedy role and the serious role perfectly. When it comes to comedy, he shines as it\'s mainly his inability to get out of his military mindset when in school (along with Chidori\'s reactions to his antics) that provides most of the chuckles for the show. When in serious mode, his hardcore military side allow him to play a believable and key role in the serious missions. In contrast, Tess is a complete failure - her comedy bumbling scenes just makes me grimace and her unignorable presence on the serious missions makes me grimace even harder.For a while I was undecided whether to label this as good or very good... but Sousuke probably tipped the scales in the anime\'s favour. Still, this anime owes a lot to ""Full Metal Alchemist"". If it wasn\'t for people searching for ""Full Metal Alchemist"" and accidently stumbling across this show (like my friends and I did), I doubt it would have gotten so popular. On its own merit, it\'s an anime that has out performed its mostly unremarkable potential.

Mostly.', ""IntroductionFull Metal Panic doesn't do anything new, it just does everything betterA lot of mechas alternate between school and action trying to be two different animes at once but were always lacking in one respect.  Full Metal Panic is the exception.  True, the young Sergeant moonlighting between school and working as a mercenary seems cliche at first, but there's something different about Sousuke and his personality that makes him interesting as a fighter as well as a student.  Full Metal Panic does the best job of balancing the two so it never feels like the school episodes are fillers but are necessary...and entertaining.Story 8/10Straightforward, easy watching action comedy but has a good balance of suspense and fun.The story is simple and straightforward.  A young sergeant becomes the bodyguard of an important high school girl while also piloting the most advanced mech unit for a secret mercenary organization whose mission is to stop terrorism.  The story never tries to extend itself so far as to explore the philosophy of life or the human condition.  There are various devices used such as the secret advanced technology called &quot;Black Technology&quot; and a group of natural born geniuses called &quot;Whispered&quot; that exist merely to move the original plot along.Unfortunately, for those hoping for a series like Code Geass where there are many twists and turns, they may become disappointed.  However, the series does become more intense and more secrets are revealed during The Second Raid.  The current series, however, focuses purely on entertainment.So what makes this anime so good?  It's the style.  The pacing of the anime is fast during the action sequences and slower and more mellow during the school sequences.  The transitions between civilian life and military battles are seemless. They come at appropriate times and contrast well with each other.  Sometimes the contrast is done so perfectly that it can be considered artistic.  For example, in one scene, during a heated battle the camera pans on Sousuke's look of intensity during battle and then flashes back to the quiet and relaxing beach with Chidori looking off in the distance as if she could see a wonderful future with Sousuke.  Scenes like that vividly and subtley communicate the thoughts of each character without verbal expression.In terms of action sequences, the series is good but not spectacular. The main problem is that some action sequences end very abruptly.  The battle ensues for quite awhile but then at the last second they pull out their ultimate move (Lamda Driver) and it ends 5 seconds later when one person is left standing.Despite that, I think the action sequences are still entertaining to watch because of its simplistic nature.  The battle strategy is not as elaborate and mental as they are in animes like Code Geass and the fight scenes aren't complicated with a lot of special power moves.  Instead, the action relies on Sousuke's decision making abilities and superior combat reflexes to win each battle as well as Kurtz Weber's accurate sniping ability.  Both are legitimate abilities that are not only entertaining but are a solid basis for determining the outcome of each battle.Characters 8/10Simple but likable and entertaining.Sousuke Sagara looks like your typical strong, justice-seeking shounen lead.  He is simple, straightforward, honest, and courageous and during action sequences he reminds you of characters like Ichigo Kurosaki. However, something strange happens when you take a typical shounen character and place him in everyday situations without changing his tone and personality.  Where his strengths were once desired, they become cumbersome and akward, and all that was once typical about his character dissipates in the cheerful, relaxed environments. He become's like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarden Cop.  His do-or-die, everywhere is a battlefield personality conflicts with a normal person's perspective of common sense.  This makes Sousuke's serious personality the butt of most of the jokes and one of the most entertaining characters to watch.Opposite to Sousuke, Kaname Chidori is a typical, strong tsundere character whose main target of aggression is Sousuke Sagara.  Most comedic moments stem from Sousuke's mistakes and Chidori correcting him, sometimes with a harisen.  Fans of tsunderes such as any of the characters played by Kugimiya Rie will love Chidori.  I'm not a tsundere fan myself, but I found Kaname Chidori's character be tolerable since she is somewhat more open and obvious with her affection towards Sousuke.Fortunately or unfortunately, this anime lacks characters who overcome grave character flaws such as weakness and arrogance.  If you are looking for character development similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion then you will not be happy with Full Metal Panic.  Full Metal Panic tries its best to make characters likable and strong from the beginning to the end.  This lack of depth and development may make the anime less realistic for some, but in terms of entertainment the characters leave nothing more to be desired.Animation/Art 7/10Good art and animation from that time period but nothing ground-breaking.My view towards mecha is that once you've seen one, you've seen them all so I may not be the best judge when it comes to judging how cool the designs are.  That being said, I've always felt that the fact that Gauron's mecha had hair was a bit odd and out of place and that the Arbalest looked very similar to the other M9s and wasn't distinguished enough as a special unit.  However, I must say that they definitely look better than the mecha from animes like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann since they are more professional and more realistic.The use of CGI was well integrated and I didn't feel like they went overboard which seems to be a common problem with Mecha animes such as the other Gonzo mecha series Kurogane no Linebarrels.As for the characters, they seem to have a little old fashion style to them indicative to anime from the 90s and early 2000s but I enjoy the fact that their proportions are realistic.  The men aren't too bulky and muscular while there aren't any women with unrealistically big breasts.  In addition, they vary a lot of the facial features for the men such as eyes and bone structure so most characters differ by more than just hair color.  However, if you take away the hair, most of the women look exactly the same.Sound 9/10Great utilization of music and talented voice actors enhance the realism and accurately portray each mood.The background music for the action and suspense sequences are chosen well and timed to perfection.  I couldn't help but think that if John Williams was doing background music for anime, it would be similar to instrumental background music used in Full Metal Panic.  Great use of brass crescendos to build the suspense but even more important was their use of pauses and silence right before an explosion to create the added tension during crucial moments during battle.I was a big fan of the OP music.  Mikuni Shimokawa has such a soothing and beautiful voice and does the theme song for all three Full Metal Panic series. In addition, they synchronized it with the animation very well.The voice acting cast does a good job of portraying the characters accurately.  Masahiko Tanaka's voice is very suited for villains like Gauron with his deep voice and sinster laugh.  Also, Tomokazu Seki does a great job of making a character like Sousuke believable and amiable.  As for Chidori, Satsuki Yukino does a great job utilizing her vocal range to express every bit of emotion expressed in her character's face.  She really feels alive and three dimensional rather than just a stereotypical tsundere.Enjoyment 10/10It has a certain charm that you can't find anywhere else.Full Metal Panic is a series that draws you into its pace and never gives you the feeling that it drags on too long or ends too quickly.  Instead, it keeps pushing forward every episode so there is always something exciting to look forward to at every turn.  In terms of comedy, this series is the best of the mecha genre and perhaps one of the best comedies ever.  The laughs were neither cheap nor overplayed but felt fresh and unique to the series itself.  In addition, they were neither hard to comprehend nor overly reliant on obscure parodies. Most of the comedy stems from Sousuke and his lack of common sense but oddly enough you never get tired of this scenario since it seems to be unique to the series itself.  Whenever I am laughing at Sousuke, I always feel more like I am laughing with him than at him, and this makes all the difference since male leads need to seem reliable during serious moments.Conclusion 9/10If you like mecha action and comedy and aren't looking for something thought-provoking and ground breaking then Full Metal Panic provides just the right amount of pure entertainment value. and entertaining.Story 8/10Straightforward, easy watching action comedy but has a good balance of suspense and fun.The story is simple and straightforward.

HILARITY. Absolute hysterics, rolling on the floor laughing at the insanity of such a crazy combination of weird characters. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this odd mix of personalities.Sagara Sousuke, a merciless killer and professional guerilla soldier, finds himself in the worse situation possible: protection of a high school girl in a civilian life he has never lived. His emotions, frayed and destroyed from constant warfare since childhood, are nonexistant- until he meets Chidori, that is. The story ranges...from the unique bond that develops between these two characters, the hilarity of their conversations, and the seriousness of high school romance sprinkled with drama and a military background.Character development was rather static; though things tended to happen and the characters realized something, I think the developers of the anime knew they were making a second season, so the first season was sort of a prequel, a taste of what was to come. They wanted this season to be sort of a teaser of what really is to come.I originally did not think this would be a very good story. The idea was far-fetched as it is! But Full Metal Panic left me wanting more and more, endlessly ceasing to surprise me with a convenient plot twist or a brief moment of humor. It was a pleasant anime, one with the ""good guys"" always win sort of macho attitude, but it was rather surprising, because the plot advanced rapidly once certain key events happened.Overall, I did enjoy watching this little anime even though it\'s rather old. I liked how the characters personalities tended to clash, but when they meshed, a new sort of storyline emerged, one that you knew would be continued in the sequel. And though I initially had my reservations, I loved this little anime, and I heavily recommend it. Remember, the Tuath De Dannan needs you! from the unique bond that develops between these two characters, the hilarity of their conversations, and the seriousness of high school romance sprinkled with drama and a military background.Character development was rather static; though things tended to happen and the characters realized something, I think the developers of the anime knew they were making a second season, so the first season was sort of a prequel, a taste of what was to come.

Remember, the Tuath De Dannan needs you!', 'I began watching this anime after reading a lot of very positive reviews on the internet, with many people saying it\'s one of their favourite anime of all time. But none of these reviews was  well-argued, now I understand why.Story: 3/10That is the only good-point of the anime: Full Metal Panic have a story that is not original, but it have the merits of permitting to have both action and humor, and why not an thrilling fight for the sake of the world. But up to episode 15, i saw none of these.The very firt episodes were okay, but...rapidly the jokes began to be less and less funny, and I started to notice that the author(s) did not knew what to do with this anime and more important were incapable of writing a story that is coherent. The story soon became ridiculous, with the mysterious power of Kaname which serves no purpose (at least in the 15 first episodes), the MITHRIL organisation that have no reason of existing, is not associated with any country and which financing seemed to be popping out of the void, and there is A LOT of things like theses...Each episode is filled with blatant incoherences, but the worst is the characters and organisations that never act realistically. As an instance we have the militaries who in an episode are told to obey Sousuke because they face an ennemy (Gauron) that nobody but Sousuke can compare with in fighting skills and who is well-known by the latter. But these militaries, who are supposed to be well-trained professionals and even veteran warriors don\'t give a shit about their superiors orders and don\'t seem to have the minimum of intelligence required to know that on a battlefield you don\'t fucking do what you want, because it can make you and your comrades killed. They don\'t listen to Sousuke\'s advices and they go all-out on Gauron and his henchmans, i think Gauron then beat the crap out of them but I\'m not very sure because I saw this anime quite some time ago.This lead me to another very bad aspect of this show: the characters.Characters: 3/10Again, there is no character that his credible in this show. We are told a lot of things about these characters but we never see these affirmations being confirmed by the facts.For instance Sousuke and Teletha are supposed to be respectively a skilled and experience warrior and a genious, but they are just two brainless idiots. I understand that it can be used fo comic situations, but for me it was just impossible to appreciate this show with so enormous incoherences. For instance, in the episode where Kanade and Teletha are taken hostages and snipers are aiming their rifles at them, the so-called professional soldier make the worst choice possibleKanade is as bad-written as the others, it\'s like the author read the definition of ""tsundere"" on the japanese wikipedia and decided to do a character like that, her mood swings are never explained neither justificated.All the characters are like living and breathing robots, with no personnality, the voice actors (in the japanese dub) don\'t help, with Satsuki Yukino more shouting than acting and Tomokazu Seki who put in his acting as much emotion as a brainless zombie.Secondary characters are no better, like Melissa and Curz whom I thought at first could be quite funny and likable are finally totally useless and irritating.Art: 2/10As expected from Gonzo, it\'s absolutely horrible, it\'s really hard to watch, the backgrounds are empty, the animation is poor, the characters move jerkily, the 3D and the colourisation are of very bad taste. I thought I was looking at a early-90\'s (or late 80\'s) anime show. Too bad that Gonzo animation quality started improving in the late 2000\'s with Saki and Strike Witches, just a moment before the studio dissapeared.Sound: 5/10Absolutely not good, not truly bad, I just didn\'t notice the music most of the time and at times I found it even a little irritating. The opening was also quite bad, both the song and images seemed to be taken from some cheap bishoujo game.Enjoyment: 3/10Beside the first episode, it was really boring, and every episode I was wondering how is it even possible to make a show that is so crappy. I watched up to episode 15 out of curiosity for this anime which was so acclaimed by many people, and hoping that the quality will improve, that the show will suddenly become interesting and funny, bu it didn\'t happened. And I\'m amazed I made it this far. I think in fact that after I had watched some episodes, I was just watching it for the lulz, like when you watch a very bad movie.Overall: 3/10I think at Full Metal Panic as one of the worst anime I have ever watched, there is no redeeming feature for this show. At the contrary of, for instance, Lost Universe, which is bad but where there is good voice actors ( Megumi Hayashibara!), some quite funny episodes, and charming characters.Also, sorry for the poor english, I\'m not a native speaker, I\'m french and it\'s currently 3 am in France, so I\'m tired and I have difficulties reading over my text. rapidly the jokes began to be less and less funny, and I started to notice that the author(s) did not knew what to do with this anime and more important were incapable of writing a story that is coherent. The story soon became ridiculous, with the mysterious power of Kaname which serves no purpose (at least in the 15 first episodes), the MITHRIL organisation that have no reason of existing, is not associated with any country and which financing seemed to be popping out of the void, and there is A LOT of things like theses...Each episode is filled with blatant incoherences, but the worst is the characters and organisations that never act realistically. As an instance we have the militaries who in an episode are told to obey Sousuke because they face an ennemy (Gauron) that nobody but Sousuke can compare with in fighting skills and who is well-known by the latter. But these militaries, who are supposed to be well-trained professionals and even veteran warriors don\'t give a shit about their superiors orders and don\'t seem to have the minimum of intelligence required to know that on a battlefield you don\'t fucking do what you want, because it can make you and your comrades killed. They don\'t listen to Sousuke\'s advices and they go all-out on Gauron and his henchmans, i think Gauron then beat the crap out of them but I\'m not very sure because I saw this anime quite some time ago.This lead me to another very bad aspect of this show: the characters.Characters: 3/10Again, there is no character that his credible in this show.

The story is ok but not well presented.Art & AnimationThe animation sometimes can be good, but it has something that i didn't like, and i don't know what it is, the mouth and sound sync was weird, almost all of the time there were weird camara angles and unrelated shots for example when Sagara was fighting other AS mechas and all of a sudden shots of Chidori in the beach (?) but i think overall is ok.SoundThe VA is good but sometimes sounds bad, maybe because of the animation of the mouths being looped to do the same movement, the OP is bad and skippable just like the ED and the background music wasn't fitting at the beginning but after 10 eps. it gets a little better and good and to mention that one song reminded me of an A-Team song, overall it was fine.CharacterMost of the characters you don't care if they could be taken away from the anime and never appear again, because you won't miss them.-Chidori Kaname is a meh character at the beginning but with her attitude becomes a bad one, she is useless and doesn't stop to be angry at Sousuke for some reason; She all of a sudden gets angry or gets angry at stupid reasons and even gets angry at him just because he's working on a mission where people die and that affects him but she doesn't ask him how he feels rather than that she gets mad at him, she doesn't have a background of any kind, what a bad character.-Sousuke (Isegar) Sagara is a person that doesn't have social skills and that can be conflictive most of the times, but he's like that because he's a soldier since he was a kid, he has little background, just flashbacks; He's a good character but nothing amazing, i liked that he finally got angry at Chidori and somehow at the end he had more social skills.-Tessa Testarossa is a sweet girl that wants to save everyone and she in fact is the captain of Mithril or was it just the Ship with the weird name? i don't remember, i liked her more than Chidori who in fact falls in love with Sousuke too and is more open than Chidori about it.Then there's the rest of the cast that are meh, nothing special worth the mention, i thought the characters were ok jus for Sousuke and the Cap. Tessa.EnjoymentThere were good eps. that i enjoyed but the enjoyment was just fine for me, i wanted to finish the anime already, too much eps. and no explanations. a military job, poor Sousuke, he's sent to protect her because she is somehow special she's a ''Whispered'' and they explain a little what they are, but not what we want to know and they didn't explain how and why they exist, a lot of unexplained topics and the problem of the why wasn't explained is that there are a lot of filler boring eps, a lot of inconsistencies are found in this anime and again Kaname is really annoying, i hate that kind of characters, i like tsunderes but to the extent of being stupids, no thanks; There's a guy also, Gaul (whose reason of being a bad guys isn't explained) he's hard to kill even when he explodes, it's stupid how he always survive without any hint on to how he did it, i don't know why people are saying this is romcom, i don't see the romance in here, an attempt, yes but i don't get why people say they liked that aspect of the anime, makes no sense.

You're in for a treat.Story: (9) For the story, I'd say originality is a key term for FMP. It is a brilliant, well layed out plot and to say that it's nearly perfect is an understatement!The story goes about a  young, yet skillful 17 year-old MITHRIL sergeant, Sousuke Sagara. In his bare nature, he is  military-obsessed and also clueless of normal civilian conduct. As a sergeant under command of the military, Sousuke is instructed to look after and protect Ms. Kaname Chidori. Kaname, for one, is very unique. As one...would prejudge that she would be a timid, typical school girl, she can be almost the exact opposite. Kaname is clever, daring and also very beautiful, but what you don't expect is her impulsive and slightly obnoxious personality.As part of Sousuke's mission, he is to relocate and transfer into the same school and class as Kaname. This is when the series takes off to be more enjoyable.As i've mentioned, Sousuke is military obsessed and does not take his job lightly. So you can see how what conflicts are being set out; both internal and external and to a great extent, often humorous. (:BUT, being the great anime that it is, that is not all that goes on. I will not disclose this information, but I can tell you that BIG things will happen (quite literally aswell) and you will be glad that you've watched this anime.____________________________________________________________Art/Animation: (10) The animation quality of this anime is quite a looker! I mean the animation is astounding! Vast, vibrant colors with perfect saturation. I know there has to be some CG animation in this series, though I really don't remember seeing it. Know why? Because the CG is so perfectly blended with the animation! (; All in all, this is some Top-Shelf animation.____________________________________________________________Sound: (9) To be honest, the opening song, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is one of my favorite tracks of any anime soundtrack. It is a very nice Japanese-Rock and the voice is just beautiful! As for the sound in the series, like the animation, it just does wonders. Both the Japanese and English audio are incomparable, and if you're an English dub kind of person, the voice acting for english is very well acted and the sound quality is at it's finest. (unlike some emotionless dubbing I've heard) boom. Top-Shelf audio. All I can say.____________________________________________________________Character: (10) When you have a good anime, you have a good cast of characters aswell. I can credibly say that there is outstanding character development throughout the series (which can prepare you for the next series) You will definitely 'feel' for all the characters in the series even if they're just supporting. I strongly believe that you will enjoy and accept the characters. (except for the bad guys, duh.) boom. Top-Shelf cast.____________________________________________________________Enjoyment: (10) As for the enjoyment, I GUARANTEE you will absolutely enjoy this series. This is one of those series that you just can't go wrong with. It's story, art, sound, and cast is just so perfect. I certainly enjoyed watching every second of Full Metal Panic. I STRONGLY recommend you watch this series. For people who don't watch anime, I'd say FMP is the best start. After completing this series, all the other anime will just seem sub-par. Again, you will definitely enjoy this anime to it's fullest potential._____________________________________________________________Full Metal Panic is ultimately my favorite anime of all time. Why you ask? Well in my personal opinion, I'd say that FMP is a masterpiece that has integrated a vast variety of genres into one. It has aspecs of Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Military, a little Romance, and a hint of Ecchi! What is not to like about this series?

Again, this is my first time submitting a review and I am certainly glad that I have started with Full Metal Panic!"", 'Full Metal Panic is a pulpy Cold-War era story that has been run through the Anime-machine. From the cold-war story side we get conspiracies to start World War 3 involving Soviet scum with gloriously evil villains and high-tech weaponry fighting guerilla warfare. From the anime side we get the heroes not being pumped full of testosterone faultlessly nationalistic Americans, but instead a teenage boy and a paramilitary force with terrible CG submarines captained by a cute teenage girl. Also giant robots. Because there is not a single story than cannot be improved with the addition of giant robots.Full Metal Panic has to win some kind...of award for having its main character, Sagara Sousuke, come from Afghanistan. I know they say Sagara is from the non-existent Helmajistan, but let’s not kid ourselves. That’s just so the author could avoid having to deal with real politics in his nonsense cold war story. He’s got darker skin than the Japanese and had a really shitty childhood torn apart by war which he’s only been able to get over by immersing himself so much in military knowledge and protocol. When you take a step back and think about it for a second, that’s kind of crazy that this dumb anime had the balls to cast such an unconventional protagonist.Sagara’s military-obsession is usually played for jokes, and it does get a bit tiring. Well, the tiring parts are mostly Chidori’s reactions. Sagara is so straight faced and meticulous about the way he pulls off these actions that it still cracked me up, much more so when the show made nothing of it. It’s such simple things too, like snapping his feet together when addressing someone new. It’s like they had a laundry list of things Sagara must do at all times to ensure they keep this image. Whenever Sagara enters a room, his eyes must dart to the four corners. Whenever he’s got over his initial introduction, he must stick his hands behind his back in his ‘at ease’ pose.It’s because they keep up this image of Sagara in the dumb school segments that it’s really damn cool when he’s called into actual proper military action. What makes it satisfying is that, through his actions earlier on in the show, we know he’s competent but just not in this environment despite him clearly trying his hardest. I’m half tempted to call it moe, but it’s not quite that. You want to root for him when he’s sucking, and you get that emotional release when he’s finally put into a situation where he can be awesome. It’s a different sort of play on the emotional satisfaction you get from watching someone kick ass after going through training. The bonus here is that the non-awesome parts are still charming and funny in their goofy anime way.Tessa plays to this strength too. Her shtick is that she’s frail and clumsy physically, but she’s a tactical genius and military expert. The way they play into this is kinda neat too, because they tease us with the idea of how the hell could this moeblob command the highest technologically advanced submarine full of buff macho military dudes when she’s so outwardly useless? They particularly play into this when, in her first real scene with Sagara, she deliberately plays to dunce in front of Kaname because she knows this will get on Sagara’s nerves.Tessa’s story, or more accurately the slow reveal of her competence, is the secret best thing FMP does. Through the course of the show you slowly start to understand why it is she is able to command that submarine. The moral guardian, strong will, hard work, tactical genius and a whole load of various other strengths she has come to the fore so that by the end you totally understand why everyone listens to her. It’s a strange sort of command, where you get the feeling people follow her orders because they don’t want to let her down. But it works. I know that if I was on that sub and I was called into her office for not following orders and she had that hurt look on her face, I would be devastated and vow never to let her down again.But anyway, Tessa is a badass and I weep for those of you who consider Kaname a better character.I think the moment that sealed my dislike of Kaname was when Sagara was doing his first badass military action hero shtick. He dashed in and rescued Kaname from the research facility, only for Kaname to then yell “eeewww you pervert get away from me”. It’s not necessarily Kaname’s character that makes her bad, although she is a pretty boring person. It’s how the show treats her as well.Like pantyshots. Full Metal Panic is in many ways a product of its time, and much of the shit it pulls that I don’t like are outdated anime tropes. Random upskirt pantyshots in otherwise serious scenes of generally serious anime appear to have gone from anime nowadays, and thank christ for that. The most egregious example is when Kaname is going through a mental breakdown, and they decide to have a little peep up her skirt. Great, because that’s really the time I feel like perving out over a girl. When she’s going through a mental breakdown. Tessa gets treated to this perv-cam sometimes too, albeit mostly just caressing her legs. With Kaname though, it seemed to be in perv mode the entire time.Speaking of dumb shit that’s finally outdated, abusive girlfriends punching their men because it’s so funny when the violence is reversed! The it’s never funny because the joke is entirely Kaname hitting Sagara. It doesn’t evolve as a gag. We’re just expected to laugh because she hit him. It’s not going to evolve either because Kaname doesn’t have much of a personality to speak of. She is Ordinary High School Student Mark 591245. You can tell she’s a boring person because any scene with Sagara not around simply consists of her talking about TV and shopping and homework and tests and every other thing boring teenagers talk about.Her saving grace is that her relationship with Sagara is genuinely charming. Their relationship is used to different effects through the show. Sometimes it’s about establishing trust, or how Sagara has grown to care for a person. The strangest, and I’d argue most surprisingly effective use was the surprisingly dark and gritty trio of episodes where Sagara goes back to his home country of Afgani-I mean Helmajistan. While they’re excellent episodes, they’re so tonally different from the rest of the series that it barely feels like the same anime. But how it draws attention to that is quite marvellous too, using the almost alien calmness of Sagara’s return to Kaname as a really effective bookend to the harshness of that arc.I was not expecting Full Metal Panic to hold up, but it turns out I still love Full Metal Panic. It’s got its problems, almost all of them centring on Kaname, and I’ll whole-heartedly admit that it is totally My Kind of Anime, but it does what it sets out to do really well. It’s a huge amount of fun with great characters and giant robots.Also, to re-iterate, Tessa >>>>>>>> Kaname. of award for having its main character, Sagara Sousuke, come from Afghanistan. I know they say Sagara is from the non-existent Helmajistan, but let’s not kid ourselves. That’s just so the author could avoid having to deal with real politics in his nonsense cold war story. He’s got darker skin than the Japanese and had a really shitty childhood torn apart by war which he’s only been able to get over by immersing himself so much in military knowledge and protocol. When you take a step back and think about it for a second, that’s kind of crazy that this dumb anime had the balls to cast such an unconventional protagonist.Sagara’s military-obsession is usually played for jokes, and it does get a bit tiring. Well, the tiring parts are mostly Chidori’s reactions. Sagara is so straight faced and meticulous about the way he pulls off these actions that it still cracked me up, much more so when the show made nothing of it. It’s such simple things too, like snapping his feet together when addressing someone new. It’s like they had a laundry list of things Sagara must do at all times to ensure they keep this image. Whenever Sagara enters a room, his eyes must dart to the four corners. Whenever he’s got over his initial introduction, he must stick his hands behind his back in his ‘at ease’ pose.It’s because they keep up this image of Sagara in the dumb school segments that it’s really damn cool when he’s called into actual proper military action. What makes it satisfying is that, through his actions earlier on in the show, we know he’s competent but just not in this environment despite him clearly trying his hardest. I’m half tempted to call it moe, but it’s not quite that. You want to root for him when he’s sucking, and you get that emotional release when he’s finally put into a situation where he can be awesome. It’s a different sort of play on the emotional satisfaction you get from watching someone kick ass after going through training. The bonus here is that the non-awesome parts are still charming and funny in their goofy anime way.Tessa plays to this strength too. Her shtick is that she’s frail and clumsy physically, but she’s a tactical genius and military expert. The way they play into this is kinda neat too, because they tease us with the idea of how the hell could this moeblob command the highest technologically advanced submarine full of buff macho military dudes when she’s so outwardly useless? They particularly play into this when, in her first real scene with Sagara, she deliberately plays to dunce in front of Kaname because she knows this will get on Sagara’s nerves.Tessa’s story, or more accurately the slow reveal of her competence, is the secret best thing FMP does. Through the course of the show you slowly start to understand why it is she is able to command that submarine. The moral guardian, strong will, hard work, tactical genius and a whole load of various other strengths she has come to the fore so that by the end you totally understand why everyone listens to her.

But I wrote it so here it is. Don\\'t bitch if you think it\\'s shit.Plot Summary: Based on the Japanese Novels of the same name, Full Metal Panic! is a series set around Souske Sagara, a member of the Anit-Terrorist Organisation \\'Mithril\\', and Kaname Chidori. Souske\\'s mission is to act as a bodygaurd to Ms. Chidori by becoming a fellow High School student.ReviewStoryline: The story line towards the beginning relies on alot more of a comedic approach but quickly shocks you away with Terrorist Hijackings, Mecha battles and deep details of...characters pasts. There was only one real \\'Side-Story\\' which really didnt need to be there and wasnt much fun as they tried to break up action between one story arc and another. After this minor setback, the story flows completely and you will find your Playlist will be full of FMP.Characters: The characters have depth, from Souske\\'s deep teenage military past to Kaname\\'s secrets. Souske is usually a complete dumbass when it comes to teenage life and its his mistakes that make the show funny, with the sugar being Kaname\\'s reactions, sometimes with a dreaded Paper Fan. Kaname is more headstrong and smart, and her Love/Hate relationship with Souske is like one massive tub of Marmite.Animation: The animation is some of the best in recent years, definately one of my favourites. Both character and mecha designs fit well into the series.Voice Acting: Awesome. I liked the VA-ing so much when I watched episode 1 dubbed, I hunted everywhere for the series dubbed. It was definately worth the time as it has one of the best casts. I wouldnt expect any less from ADV.Ending: Climactic battle between arch enemies both piloting Arm-Slaves(The Mecha of the Anime).Oh, so thats what Kaname can do stuff. Guy gets the girl.....kinda. Definately leaves you wanting more. Good job theres a few sequals then.Conclusion:This series had hype, and I follow the hype, damn good thing too. The anime will always be close to me as a fav, I started off thinking it would be a nice relaxing comedy for me and boom, I get hit with all these storylines from no-where. Great anime. characters pasts. There was only one real \\'Side-Story\\' which really didnt need to be there and wasnt much fun as they tried to break up action between one story arc and another.

Great anime."", 'Story: This anime is about a highly trained military commando/mecha pilot with no social skills named Sagara. He gets assigned to pose as a high school student to protect a large-breasted female student from being abducted by terrorists. As silly as the plot is, it creates room for interesting challenges. How will he blend in? How will he avoid suspicion? How will he protect this girl without blowing his cover? Etc. Well this anime chooses to brazenly ignore all of those concerns and have the Sagara act about as conspicuous as possible. It really requires that the audience suspend all disbelief. Example: What’s a normal...reaction when you see a student holding a submachine gun on school grounds? Run? Warn the students? Call police? Nope. It’s to scold him playfully and then forget about it. Well that’s the way it works in this anime at least. It’s hard to build suspense when the audience isn’t sure what’s supposed to be taken seriously and what isn’t.However, if you decide to beat yourself over the head with a snow shovel until logic stops being important, FMP does become kind of endearing (it took 106 consecutive hits for me). The story has a lot of relationship/romance undertones which gives it quirky but cute feeling. Sagara is like a retarded Terminator sent to protect the prepiest and most volatile girl in school. It’s a recipe for a lot of odd and funny (often ecchi-related) misunderstandings. Over time, the audience gets to watch these characters interact and evolve…albeit very slowly. Unfortunately, they do tend to throw in useless arcs which distract from the overall plot and stall character development. I’ve read good things about the sequel so I watched S1 with that in mind.The action isn’t bad. There are some intense scenes that I think are pretty well done. At the same time, I finished the anime without a good sense of how the mecha worked, why certain (let’s call them mecha techniques) were used in some battles but not in others, how some characters managed to cheat death, and why the mecha insisted on fighting with little chode-like chainsaw daggers. To each his own but these were problems for me.Art: I’ve seen a lot better but it’s still pretty decent. I don’t have anything against it.Sound: Soundtrack wasn’t bad…they’re not going on my ipod but they weren’t bad.Characters: As much as I hated the simplicity and stupidity of the cast, it was that exact flaw that allowed this anime work. Instead of building a narrative based on complicated characters who have multiple layers, each character in FMP basically represents the extreme of a single, very simple concept. We as the audience get to see what happens when these extremes come together. It’s not pretty but it does get the job done.Sagara: He is essentially an Unsullied from Game of Thrones. No real personality, curiosity, sex drive, independent thought…nothing except an unwavering devotion to duty. Of course, one of the main conflicts in the series (evident from the TITLE of the first episode) is whether he is capable of forming human feelings and relationships. Narrative-wise, it’s not the worst place to start; it lets him be a blank slate. Who knows what sort new things he’ll learn and experience. Wouldn’t that be fun and sweet? Like watching cyborg Arnold bond w/ John Connor. The problem is that the pacing was off. I’ll say that in S1 his character evolution is generally plodding, erratic and subpar.Chidori: She was actually the most likeable character in my opinion despite being 100% anime cliché. Basically the chirpy, sassy hot girl who does the whole tsundere thing. I can think of half a dozen characters from other anime who have the same personality. As a main, she stands out only because she contrasts so heavily with Tessa…*sigh*.Tessa: She’s a 16 year old attack submarine captain in charge of most of the military operations. Maybe it’s a sign of watching too much anime but I’ve gotten completely used to seeing teens in super powerful military positions. The impossibility of it doesn’t even bother me anymore.  What did irritate me was her personality and the way she interacted with the other characters. It’s just really inconsistent. FMP wants to have a teen genius plan a military assault? No problem, L and Lelouch were awesome. But a crying, meek, swooning, scatterbrained little girl? That’s just pushing it for me. It also gave FMP a weird ecchi vibe…like they needed to insert a shapely female somewhere to hit a quota but didn’t know where to put her so BAM she’s the captain.Overall: Overall it was watchable. I am looking forward to S2 in hopes that it can pull things together more.Blood/Gore: Sagara actually shoots people lol. It’s a weird mix of goofy high school antics a violence.Love/Romance: It’s a little disappointing. I think it’s the love triangle dynamic. I’m still trying to figure out what the appeal of LTs are. School Days was the only one that made sense to me. In order to make them interesting or plausible the guy/girl being fought over has to be either really dumb/oblivious or extremely indecisive and douchey. I guess I’ll find out in S2.Sex/Nudity: non-nude shower scenes, panty thieves, unintentional awkward sexual situations… reaction when you see a student holding a submachine gun on school grounds? Run? Warn the students? Call police? Nope. It’s to scold him playfully and then forget about it. Well that’s the way it works in this anime at least.

A little less concrete, yet informative.See, Full Metal Panic! didn't have much to offer me. I don't like Mecha's too much, I enjoy watching them, but I don't like the genre most of the time. I don't like stories with a slow plot for a story that doesn't makes much logical sense (unless it is random comedy). But still, even though Full Metal Panic! could be considered both of these, Full Metal Panic! proved me wrong.It started off with more comedy and romance one...could ask for; however, this was a positive thing. It was a build-up, a good one by that. It is a fair amount of episodes long; so it is expected to give us at least some development. The story was worthwhile and got me seated at the end of my seat.Despite having a not too creative concept; the whole thing was creative?Correct. The cast especially made me laugh 'that' many times on 'that' many occasions. This is one of those Anime you keep on watching one after one another, episodes after another until you realize it's way past the time to quit. Because it's that enjoyful.Screw not liking Mecha's, screw not liking a slow-plot. This Anime is awesome!That's what I thought. Mecha's don't appear too much, the plot isn't bad, just a little slow and predictable. Either way however, it's fun.It's like being a kid and being let to win by your mom, despite not being a retarded kid and knowing she set this up, you laugh and enjoy winning. This is one of those moments, just enjoy the card game even though the cards are played into your hands.I know I'm not making much sense now, but that's what Full Metal Panic! does to me. It's that awesome. If I could, I'd give it a 10+!But I can't. The story is so - so, the art is ok, nothing particularly bad, yet not exceptionally good. The characters are awesome, fun and quite interesting. The concept is also so - so. But overall I definitely enjoy this series.It also has a second and a third season; both being timidly themed a little different. The second season would tend more towards comedy, whilst the third season tends more towards romance, mecha and action. However, all three of them are great (including this one).The animation gets better in the third one; and the second season is definitely something unusual that makes you laugh out loud or giggle like a little schoolgirl (though, I hope that if your a guy you won't laugh like a li.. well, you get the point).So really, just watch this Anime, just watch the series. Sit back, relax, laugh and just have fun watching it. Even if you don't like it's genres, watch it!And if you do like it's genre's, well.. what're you waiting for!P.s: I actually liked the second and third season the most; those should have gotten a 9 from me if I would have written a review about them. Oh wait, I did write a review about those other two. Well, even more reason to check this entire series out. Have fun! could ask for; however, this was a positive thing.

Have fun!"", 'Synopsis:Sagara Sosuke may look like a high school boy, but he is anything but your average teenager: hardened by years of battle, he is now one of the most skilled (and humorless) operatives of the secretive and powerful paramilitary MITHRIL organization. All this changes, however, when he, along with the lecherous sniper Kurtz Weber and ornery commander Melissa Mao, are assigned to protect pretty young Chidori Kaname, who may be one of the mysterious and sought-after ""Whispered."" Trained assassins, mech-piloting psychopaths, and booby traps, Sagara can deal with... it\'s infiltrating a Japanese high school and trying to blend in that\'s the real challenge....And he will learn that an enraged girl can be the most lethal opponent of all.Review:Full Metal Panic takes the well-traveled genres of high school comedy and mecha war drama, mixes them together in the same series, dresses them up in beautiful Gonzo animation, gives them a gritty twist, and wraps them together in a plot hinting at unearthly technology and dark organizations at work. Unfortunately, none of that can hide the fact that in the end Full Metal Panic is just another anime series, never breaking from the cliches of its two genres--the girls still club the hero in a berserk rage at the slightest perception of lechery, even hardened military professionals take time out for a soak in the bath, and you can never, ever use your ultimate weapon until the last possible second. That the plot ends up going nowhere at all (at least until a sequel series) and the two genres feel somewhat uncomfortable next to each other doesn\'t help, either. It\'s still well made and a lot of fun, but it isn\'t half of what it could\'ve been.Full Metal Panic is definitely at its strongest in the comedy department. The premise--a young soldier who knows nothing but battle forced to try and blend in at an average Japanese high school while undercover--has loads of potential, and Sosuke\'s deadpan determination and brutal practicality contrast perfectly with a lively cast of more standard anime characters to capitalize on it.Sosuke is hilarious in his awkward attempts to fit in, and the series also takes the time to put his normal classmates into his world on occasion, providing a satisfying role reversal. Sosuke\'s foil, Chidori, is equally likable for the opposite reasons--a slight sidestep from your standard high school cutie, she\'s got a vicious temper and isn\'t afraid to loose it on Sosuke, but also has an earnest sweet side for balance. Chidori is something of a realistic caricature--you know the role, but something rings true about the way her exaggerated personality traits fit together, making her a particularly appealing character.The quality assortment of supplemental characters include Sosuke\'s far livelier (and more mature, a nice departure from formula) military compatriots who themselves have some amusing interactions with Sosuke\'s classmates. Those classmates range from Chidori\'s snapshot-obsessed best friend to a shy military geek (ironically, and amusingly, the only one who Sosuke can manage a conversation with). There are also a variety of more hardened military types who make appearances, and they are generally treated relatively realistically.Unfortunately, those times where the fun characters in the series overlap with the serious ones are one of its weakest points. The biggest problem is that Chidori behaves more or less like your standard anime schoolgirl even in the face of life-or-death situations, cheapening the drama at the gritty end of the story. Complaining about her lack of decency in the middle of a firefight, for example, showed little of the sense of reality or self-preservation you\'d expect from her character. There are a few stronger points (a great reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, for example), but for the most part the more humorous characters severely hurt the realism and sense of danger of the more serious parts when they interact.That brings me to my second big problem with the series: the drama. On the positive side, the serious sections of the story aren\'t bad by anime standards--they\'ve got a gritty feel, Sosuke is if nothing else a competent warrior (a welcome change from all those kids uncertain of their worth), and the handheld-style camerawork gives the action a sense of reality. In a couple of places the tragedy of war also crosses briefly from action movie cliche to something a bit more affecting.On the negative side, it still feels much more like a cheesy action movie than the military drama it seems to be aiming for (particularly in the grittiest story arc, a desert mission in the middle of the series). In contrast with most of the well-developed characters, the caricatured military folks working with Sosuke feel hollow, and after all the talk about planning, strategy, and loyalty, having Sosuke inexplicably save his ultimate weapon until the last possible second is downright silly. The fact that the giant robots, for all their clunky ""realistic"" design, end up sporting emotion-powered ultimate weapons (and of course a big mane of hair on the evil mech) struck me as rather silly as well.That Full Metal Panic is a better comedy than a drama perhaps isn\'t surprising, but what is is how the two are combined. Or rather, how they aren\'t: The series is composed of roughly equal parts schoolyard comedy and military action, and although the characters overlap, the two parts have absolutely no interaction. One episode will be a rather silly comedy, and the next will try for straight-faced drama and action. The transitions are a bit jarring at best, and leave the series as a whole feeling somewhat scattered.One more big complaint before I move on: the plot goes absolutely nowhere. It starts right off with hints of powerful clandestine forces at work, mysterious technology and its connection to the Whispered, and a creepy villain (a worthy rival for Sosuke\'s dry sense of duty thanks to his cheerful contempt and unstable persona) who seems to be working behind the scenes as part of some dark conspiracy.Sadly, though the villain comes back again and again as a part of various nefarious plots, there is never any explanation of where he keeps getting his extraordinarily nasty toys or who\'s backing him. There\'s also no meaningful connection established between the story arcs, no details about what the Whispered are or where the mysterious technology comes from are ever revealed, and there isn\'t even an end more satisfying than ""We got the bad guy. Yet again.""All the hints of mystery in the story and the creepy villain felt like an afterthought tacked on to try and cover for the fact that the plot as a whole has absolutely no substance, and doesn\'t go anywhere.Fortunately, action fans will probably be more than willing to overlook the generic parts thanks to the gorgeous Gonzo animation. As with most of their work, they give even classic mech-vs-mech action scenes a sense of gritty realism by combining shaky camerawork with a lot of perfectly-executed digital effects (motion blur, glows, and various shockwave distortions). The mech fights aren\'t quite as down-to-earth as I was hoping (there are a disappointing number of energy blasts and flying jumps), but it still ranks among the best in the genre.The quality art and animation don\'t stop at the action scenes, though--all the art is detailed and attractive, and the character animation is topnotch. Chidori in particular is amazingly expressive--her face and body language make her character truly memorable. The fancy action techniques aren\'t limited to the big fights, either--plenty of creative stuff around school, as well.Last is the vocal part of the series, which is on par with the visuals--very good (at least in Japanese--I can\'t speak for the dub). The standout performances are easily Sosuke, for his unwavering deadpan delivery through both drama and comedy, and Chidori, for her endless reserve of energy and mix of ornery and sweet, all while staying believable as a character. The minor characters are just as good, though; Mao and Kurtz both have likable voices with a touch of playful realism that breaks them out of their respective molds, the villain has a smarmy evilness in his voice, tinged with just enough crazy to make him scary, and the collection of minor characters all work well. The music, though generally good (including the catchy if unoriginal opening theme), isn\'t nearly as memorable, but it does the job.In all, Full Metal Panic is an enjoyable series. It is not without flaws: It\'s not nearly as original as it initially appears, the transition between war drama and schoolyard comedy doesn\'t work terribly well, and all the hints at a larger plot go nowhere at all in the end. Still, the collection of likable and creative characters and comedy with an edge are enough to make it memorable and fun. It\'s definitely worth a shot if the idea sounds at all appealing, and those less picky about details will probably love it. And he will learn that an enraged girl can be the most lethal opponent of all.Review:Full Metal Panic takes the well-traveled genres of high school comedy and mecha war drama, mixes them together in the same series, dresses them up in beautiful Gonzo animation, gives them a gritty twist, and wraps them together in a plot hinting at unearthly technology and dark organizations at work. Unfortunately, none of that can hide the fact that in the end Full Metal Panic is just another anime series, never breaking from the cliches of its two genres--the girls still club the hero in a berserk rage at the slightest perception of lechery, even hardened military professionals take time out for a soak in the bath, and you can never, ever use your ultimate weapon until the last possible second. That the plot ends up going nowhere at all (at least until a sequel series) and the two genres feel somewhat uncomfortable next to each other doesn\'t help, either. It\'s still well made and a lot of fun, but it isn\'t half of what it could\'ve been.Full Metal Panic is definitely at its strongest in the comedy department. The premise--a young soldier who knows nothing but battle forced to try and blend in at an average Japanese high school while undercover--has loads of potential, and Sosuke\'s deadpan determination and brutal practicality contrast perfectly with a lively cast of more standard anime characters to capitalize on it.Sosuke is hilarious in his awkward attempts to fit in, and the series also takes the time to put his normal classmates into his world on occasion, providing a satisfying role reversal. Sosuke\'s foil, Chidori, is equally likable for the opposite reasons--a slight sidestep from your standard high school cutie, she\'s got a vicious temper and isn\'t afraid to loose it on Sosuke, but also has an earnest sweet side for balance. Chidori is something of a realistic caricature--you know the role, but something rings true about the way her exaggerated personality traits fit together, making her a particularly appealing character.The quality assortment of supplemental characters include Sosuke\'s far livelier (and more mature, a nice departure from formula) military compatriots who themselves have some amusing interactions with Sosuke\'s classmates. Those classmates range from Chidori\'s snapshot-obsessed best friend to a shy military geek (ironically, and amusingly, the only one who Sosuke can manage a conversation with). There are also a variety of more hardened military types who make appearances, and they are generally treated relatively realistically.Unfortunately, those times where the fun characters in the series overlap with the serious ones are one of its weakest points. The biggest problem is that Chidori behaves more or less like your standard anime schoolgirl even in the face of life-or-death situations, cheapening the drama at the gritty end of the story. Complaining about her lack of decency in the middle of a firefight, for example, showed little of the sense of reality or self-preservation you\'d expect from her character. There are a few stronger points (a great reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, for example), but for the most part the more humorous characters severely hurt the realism and sense of danger of the more serious parts when they interact.That brings me to my second big problem with the series: the drama. On the positive side, the serious sections of the story aren\'t bad by anime standards--they\'ve got a gritty feel, Sosuke is if nothing else a competent warrior (a welcome change from all those kids uncertain of their worth), and the handheld-style camerawork gives the action a sense of reality. In a couple of places the tragedy of war also crosses briefly from action movie cliche to something a bit more affecting.On the negative side, it still feels much more like a cheesy action movie than the military drama it seems to be aiming for (particularly in the grittiest story arc, a desert mission in the middle of the series). In contrast with most of the well-developed characters, the caricatured military folks working with Sosuke feel hollow, and after all the talk about planning, strategy, and loyalty, having Sosuke inexplicably save his ultimate weapon until the last possible second is downright silly. The fact that the giant robots, for all their clunky ""realistic"" design, end up sporting emotion-powered ultimate weapons (and of course a big mane of hair on the evil mech) struck me as rather silly as well.That Full Metal Panic is a better comedy than a drama perhaps isn\'t surprising, but what is is how the two are combined. Or rather, how they aren\'t: The series is composed of roughly equal parts schoolyard comedy and military action, and although the characters overlap, the two parts have absolutely no interaction. One episode will be a rather silly comedy, and the next will try for straight-faced drama and action. The transitions are a bit jarring at best, and leave the series as a whole feeling somewhat scattered.One more big complaint before I move on: the plot goes absolutely nowhere.

(FMP) 5 years ago and at the time I had thought it was a nice watch.  Then during summer of 2007 I decided to rewatch FMP.  I had marathoned the series instead of watching only 2-3 episodes a day.  As I was watching I thought &ldquo;wow, was FMP this entertaining/fun to watch back then?&rdquo;  I guess the reason for this is because FMP is a fun show to watch, especially one to marathon.By &ldquo;fun&rdquo; this also means the anime is pretty light hearted and doesn&rsquo;t have too much complexity.  The story...itself contains several plot holes, inconsistencies, and a flat villain.  What annoys me to no end is that FMP uses a few resets.  Ahh! wasted so much character development only to reset things.  However, it really isn&rsquo;t that noticeable until you start looking at it more deeply (ie not marathoning it&hellip;).  In addition, the structure of the series also lends to this marathonable nature.  The series is divided up into arcs, similar to anime with no predetermined episodes count.  Each of these arcs are pretty self contained, however this leads to pacing/flow problems.  First you have the start of one arc, a serious military story and once that&rsquo;s over you have light hearted high school comedy.  Next, you reset and repeat for the next arc.  Also, some episodes were simply out of place and really broke the flow of the series.  For example, the episode devoted to how Mao recruited Sousuke and Kurts.  For an anime series with no preset episode count, yes this can work, but not with one that&rsquo;s set for 24 episodes.  This can simply be due to the source material, a series of light novels.  Perhaps it could have been better if they had simply animated one arc per season.Most of the characters are pretty interesting and fun to watch.  This is part of what made the show for me.  I personally like the interaction between Chidori and Sousuke.  Not much else to say here, just remember to accept things like a 16 year old as a captain of a nuclear submarine and whatnot.As for the animation, Gonzo did a pretty good job and had very little inconsistencies.  In addition, the CG work was pretty nice as it blended in quite nicely.  Of course the action scenes did not disappoint.  The BGM was ok, nothing that really stood out for me.  Voices for both the Japanese and English had their strengths and weakness however, nothing really worth going into.  Hmm, actually, I was quite annoyed by Tessa&rsquo;s voice in the English.  Mamiko Noto as Shinji in the Japanese dub just didn&rsquo;t work for me, she still sounds like a girl.My only other complaint is with the very open nature of the ending.  What I mean by this is not the story is left unresolved it&rsquo;s the relationships between the character that left quite open.  However, there is a sequel, Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid done by Kyoto Animation and hopefully they will release another FMP soon.Despite all the flaws FMP remains a solid enjoyable watch without too much complexity.  It may appear as if I didn&rsquo;t like FMP, as I talked about many of the negatives but, taken as a whole I found it undeniably entertaining.  Just remember not to think too hard and you&rsquo;ll probably get plenty of enjoyment out of it as I had. itself contains several plot holes, inconsistencies, and a flat villain.

It's filled with cliched characters and scenarios, the animation looks horrendous by today's (2011) standards, the voice acting is extremely hollow with only a couple exceptions, the writing is unintentionally laughable frequently, plot threads are started but never resolved, there's pointless filler episodes, etc, etc.Never has the urge been so strong to stop watching an anime half way through, that exact point being a confoundedly stupid episode in which men in giant robots compete at table tennis and tug of war. Don't get me wrong, this show is...actually best at its most lighthearted. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where the goofiness and seriousness are so awkwardly juxtaposed, that it ends up feeling like idiocy that takes itself very seriously.Maybe there's something I'm missing here, but I can't find anything redeeming about this series. If it were older, I might be able to see as an influence to the giant robot genre, but 2002 really wasn't that long ago. It really kind of feels like a relic that would have been more at home in the early days of the genre, with the likes of Gundam, and Gunbuster.I realize that maybe I'm being overly critical of something that is just meant to be casually enjoyed and not dissected and analyzed like the best anime can hold up to, but if every step of the way, you are wondering why you are bothering to watch, it's not worth it. actually best at its most lighthearted.

There was no nostalgia at all while I watched this: it\'s an actual review based upon the anime itself.FMP! is guilty of many offenses despite hailing form the towns of ""Generic City"" and ""Who Gives a Fuck, It\'ll Make Money-topia."" There is not one original idea in this entire anime. And sure, you could argue that most animes don\'t have an original idea, but at least most accomplish something. Enough ranting, I\'ll actually review the aspects of the show.First...off, the story was plagued with several issues. The most egregious being the balance of action and FMP!\'s idea of comedy.  I would not be surprised to find out that the writers simply designated each episode as ""a funny one"" or ""a fighting one."" There is absolutely no balance. Also, don\'t confuse my use of the word ""comedy"" as an implication of FMP! being funny in any way. The series\' idea of comedy revolves around this:- ""I do not know much about social situations, so I will completely throw any form of common sense out of the window and do the first thing I think of.""- ""OH MY GOD YOU PERVERT IDIOT! YOU CAN\'T DO THAT!"" *hit him in the head*Fucking awful slapstick humor.I don\'t want to waste more time writing this so:Art: Same shit as always, blah blah.Sound: See above.Character: Every character in FMP! is either shallow as fuck or just an idiot.

The main character Hero Sagara Sousuke was a really dump at love sense, he has no clue about others feeling especially womens. The Heroine Kaname Chidori has a short tempered and also cute for some reason. Supported by energic and pervert character that really makes me crazy named Kurz Weiber, and sexy officer Mao who take care of Sagara and Kurz, and also their Commander Teletha Testarossa who\'s makes loli fans will love her.The story it self is telling about Chidori peacefull school life that been ended because she was...being targeted by terorist organization who after her ability\'s called ""whispered"". Sousuke and his team was being order from Mithrils (an organization that has purpose to stablize a peace of the world) to guard Chidori from enemies.Some romance happen between the two main character, and also Tessa (Teletha nick name) who makes triangle romance better. And like I said before, some action involve too in this anime, there was a good scene where\'s great mecha or combat battle makes FMP more worthed to watch.I really recomended this anime and the secuel series for you who seeks a great anime story. being targeted by terorist organization who after her ability\'s called ""whispered"".

The comedy was bland and unoriginal usually resulting in Chidori getting mad at Souske and then hitting him. Are your laughing yet? NO.... well get used to it because that's at least half of the series. The other half is a military mech fighting show that barely scratches the surface of what it could be because it decided it wanted to focus on highschool comedy too. The writers did a terrible job with these two concepts because they don't mesh together at all. It doesn't help that the music is limited at well it has...like 4 soundtracks and they're generic.I put this as background noise after episode 4 and I'm glad I did because my instincts were right. This anime is boring at straight up 5/10. Sousuke and Chidori are terrible main characters. Chidori is annoying and useless. Sousuke is as bland as flour. It took him 20 episodes to show genuine emotion where he wasn't taking like an unsalted cracker. The show also had a weird fascination with showing panty scenes in the first 7-8 episodes, ruining any serious moments.The only reason people ever liked this show was because they're was literally limited options on what they could choose to enjoy. Times have changed we have like 50 new anime to choose from each coming season. Not to mention the internet gives people quick access to better older anime whether its from a legal or illegal site.

A more detailed one may appear at some point in the future. I wont give a synopsis cause there\'s already one provided. Spoilers ahead so be warned. With that out of the way, grab a seat. let\'s have a chat.*Infinite Ryvius OST- nowhere plays*Full metal panic tries its best to mix an overarching militaristic plot with SOL comedy antics. However the later is a lot more poorly handled than the former. I will say this, it can potentially be a way for us to delve in the...dysfunctional psychosis of our protag and also have him endear us to those around him, but not only are the jokes generally unfunny(only about two ever are) and are too big and overplayed to the point where it somewhat undermines his plight and also the lengths where this show wants you to take it seriously when it decides to not be grounded by reality. One minute its metal gear solid, the next Ranman 1/2. Couple that with the school cast being generally simplistic and cliche compared to the guys over at the Tuathe de Dana and you have a show that mostly has somewhat of an identity crisis. Which is especially disheartening seeing as how this is the shows MAIN SELLING POINT. It would be better if that stuff was a bit more downplayed, the jokes were more clever/subtle, and if it was coupled with clever dialogue to helps us get endeared to the characters in Sosuke\'s school life and how they impact his character, *inhale* but we got what we got. We\'ll come back to this later.Now with the SOL aspects out of the way, how does the plot stuff stack up? Pretty alright. Most of the ""arcs"" in the show have to do with the MC dealing with terrorists threats and keeping bitch queen Chidori safe almost episodically over the course of a few or more episodes each and they are pretty tense and high energy. They pretty much are the best parts of the show. In fact the third arc of the show is the one that gives us a good understanding of Sosukes identity and why he is the way he is better than the comedic shit does and puts him through certain struggles that make him develop as the show goes on. However the one flaw i see is that a couple of them are mostly rather pointless in terms of how they develop the characters creating somewhat of a pasing issue. But these are at least somewhat effective and largely inoffensive.*Gun X Sword OP*I am a simple man who loves his mech battles. While many of the fights in the show are mostly passable, i wouldnt lie to you if i say id rather see gundam F91 for its action than this(as much as i hate that movie). The animation is fine, but not detailed enough to give you the sense of battle most of the time and can be quite janky in certain places, making it seem like some corners were cut in the production value in the mech fights. Especially in times when the MC and villain uses the Lambda driver, showing mostly unmemorable particle effects. They dont really get better until the half way point, where startegy, use of environment and militaristic tactics are used. Not to mention generally better fight choreography. The designs of the characters and mechs arent bad though(my fave being the main mech Arbelest).Now we move to the characters and since i\'ve already stated how the school side characters are practical pointless, uncharismatic and add nothing to our main duo, we\'ll move on to the guys that matter.*Big O OST- Sure promise plays*Sosuke Sagara is a boy who spent most of his life as a mercenary and knows practically nothing of domestic life, which causes him to have sporadic instances where he mistakes something normal for a time where he needs to ""YOOOOOOO JOE!"". This is the fundamental driving force for all his SOL antics, which i remind you is the least good part in the show for the reasons i stated above. I understand that those moments are design to showcase this aspect of his character and maybe have him go through a mid life crisis deal where he questions his own purpose and existence in life and if he can even be his own person let alone a force for good(a la Guts from berserk) and to be further enveloped by the new life he has made and the non combat experiences to creating a sort inner struggle within him. However his plight gets played too much for comedic effect and escalated a tad too much for us to take it seriously and since those moments barely advance his character at all, those moments are rendered pointless. When the show takes him out of the role of a highschool student, he might not become the most complex protag, but he\'s a lot more competent seeing as how he is in his element. Of course the fact that you become so comfortable within that state kinda goes against the general purpose of taking him out his comfort zone. And like i said, things do get revealed about in the later part of the show, which gives us an opportunity to show us whats in this G.I.jokes head. But the way he develops overall is mostly subpar and sporadic. He still has some moments that are pretty endearing despite how much of a socially inept straight faced hick he is. Just wished that showed off more often.Now he does have a super special awesome mech (cause why wouldnt he) which has a hidden system that when activated can produce energy powered by Sosuke\'s will, and if your\'re wondering yes this does deus ex save his ass a couple times in the show. Of course Sosuke himself has a sort of love hate relationship with the machine that only works when it wants to. Kinda hard for someone as stiff as he is to rely on a machine that almost unscientifically powers you with your inner mojo, so he doesnt use it other than his important battles. He aint OP like Kira Yamato or nothing but it does make fights lack tension seeing as how all Sosuke needs to do is awaken his chakra G Gundam style and use shining finger. Overall Sosuke is an alright protag.*Undertale OST Dummy Gooseworx cover*Kaname Chidori ladies and gentleman. She\'s the main female lead of the show. A popular above average high school chick. She\'s the target for the terorists who want the secrets of super technology and psychic prowess in her head; as well as the target of my discomfort. She\'s basically every bratty teenage tsundere you can find in anime. Now admittedly i will say that her attitude towards our local MC is somewhat justified seeing as he somewhat is responsible for all the dumb shit happening around her and generally flipping her whole life upside down despite his aims to protect her from harm. This would be fine if the jokes were funny and... well you know the drill. So it kinda makes her come off as irritable at times. I get its only natural for her to be this way in this case but there are times in the show where its too overplayed and she makes outright dumb decisions where it does not justify her being a petulant cunt. She does use her hidden mcguffin powers to help the heroes and she does get a chance to understand sosuke better later on, including one charming scene in the last episode. Other than that, general personality isnt all that endearing and neither is her interactions/relationship with Sosuke. So yeah, this chick who looks like the descendent of Marth from Fire emblem is unlikable. Dabu Dee dabu die, bitch.*Nadesico OP*On to the characters who are a part of Mithral. Tessa is a pretty good supporting character. She\'s clumsy but still very charming. Despite her young age and demeanor she is a very effective captain of her group and made pretty sound decisions throughout the show(if you can ignore the probability of it). Other than that one pissing contest she had with another female character Mao in one episode, but it was mostly to have her understand the hardships and struggles her subordinates go through when they enter battle. She also has a crush on Sosuke (oooooh love triangle. Drama~) for actually understandable reasons. Given how somewhat of an awkward person she is and her environment and the fact that Sosuke is the only other person her age around, it would make sense for her to gravitate towards his military charm. She admires him for his strength and resilience which contrasts her own doubts about herself as well as the respect her crew gives her. And she doesnt come off as someone who exists soully for his sawed off shotgun, if you catch my drift. Plus she\'s a mcguffin like chidori so she\'s helpful in that area too. Which probably explains why she wouldnt have chidori put in a safe house somewhere under surveillance to keep her safe from the terrorists after her, cause she sympathizes with her plight to be a normal girl. Of course maybe sending Sosuke to protect her wasnt the best move. But overall she is a fun and effective character.Others like Kurtz and Mao are fine. Mao is the no nonsense valkyrie bitch who has some okay dialogue and Kurtz is the charming pervert with very little actual charm. They both act as sort of besties to Sosuke in his soldier life and are very useful throughout the show. They\'ve done little to damage their characters, but not too much sticks out. they do have some funny moments though despite not really changing throughout this season of the series.*New Getter Robo OST- Deep Red*The main big bad is Garam and he is a pretty entertaining villain to a point. He is a constant threat throughout the show, rival and nemesis of Sosuke, and has some pretty endearing dialogue that lets him shine. He\'s kinda like Kenpachi Zaraki from Bleach but evil and in a mech. Also he acts as a parallel to Sosuke\'s identity, him being mad and battle hungry and Sosuke trying his best to appear as less of a savage like him despite his upbringing. Although the one thing i have an issue with him is that he always has a severe case of the not deads throughout the show and it only took the last ep for the heroes to finally ""kill"" him. The unstoppable killing machine angle can work but its too overdone here. Seeing the same guy die over and over mostly cause of the Lambda driver thing protecting him is kinda tiring to see. If he had only appeared in two arcs in the story preferable the first and last , he wouldve been much better handled and his final fall would have more impact. But he is entertaining and formidable villain throughout the show overall.So overall Full metal Panic season 1 is an alright semi-real mecha show that is kinda bogged down by its main gimmick that being its SOL aspects and occasional fanservice. If the show managed to integrate both of these aspects seamlessly it wouldve improve a lot and there wouldnt be near constant tonal whiplash. But the action is okay, plot inoffensive, and has a few likable characters. So I\'d recommend it.If you liked this review, ill be making one for Second Raid soon. Its been cool. Kaiser Shounen, LAUNCH!*Mazinkaiser OP* dysfunctional psychosis of our protag and also have him endear us to those around him, but not only are the jokes generally unfunny(only about two ever are) and are too big and overplayed to the point where it somewhat undermines his plight and also the lengths where this show wants you to take it seriously when it decides to not be grounded by reality. One minute its metal gear solid, the next Ranman 1/2. Couple that with the school cast being generally simplistic and cliche compared to the guys over at the Tuathe de Dana and you have a show that mostly has somewhat of an identity crisis. Which is especially disheartening seeing as how this is the shows MAIN SELLING POINT. It would be better if that stuff was a bit more downplayed, the jokes were more clever/subtle, and if it was coupled with clever dialogue to helps us get endeared to the characters in Sosuke\'s school life and how they impact his character, *inhale* but we got what we got. We\'ll come back to this later.Now with the SOL aspects out of the way, how does the plot stuff stack up? Pretty alright. Most of the ""arcs"" in the show have to do with the MC dealing with terrorists threats and keeping bitch queen Chidori safe almost episodically over the course of a few or more episodes each and they are pretty tense and high energy. They pretty much are the best parts of the show. In fact the third arc of the show is the one that gives us a good understanding of Sosukes identity and why he is the way he is better than the comedic shit does and puts him through certain struggles that make him develop as the show goes on. However the one flaw i see is that a couple of them are mostly rather pointless in terms of how they develop the characters creating somewhat of a pasing issue. But these are at least somewhat effective and largely inoffensive.*Gun X Sword OP*I am a simple man who loves his mech battles. While many of the fights in the show are mostly passable, i wouldnt lie to you if i say id rather see gundam F91 for its action than this(as much as i hate that movie). The animation is fine, but not detailed enough to give you the sense of battle most of the time and can be quite janky in certain places, making it seem like some corners were cut in the production value in the mech fights. Especially in times when the MC and villain uses the Lambda driver, showing mostly unmemorable particle effects. They dont really get better until the half way point, where startegy, use of environment and militaristic tactics are used. Not to mention generally better fight choreography. The designs of the characters and mechs arent bad though(my fave being the main mech Arbelest).Now we move to the characters and since i\'ve already stated how the school side characters are practical pointless, uncharismatic and add nothing to our main duo, we\'ll move on to the guys that matter.*Big O OST- Sure promise plays*Sosuke Sagara is a boy who spent most of his life as a mercenary and knows practically nothing of domestic life, which causes him to have sporadic instances where he mistakes something normal for a time where he needs to ""YOOOOOOO JOE!"". This is the fundamental driving force for all his SOL antics, which i remind you is the least good part in the show for the reasons i stated above. I understand that those moments are design to showcase this aspect of his character and maybe have him go through a mid life crisis deal where he questions his own purpose and existence in life and if he can even be his own person let alone a force for good(a la Guts from berserk) and to be further enveloped by the new life he has made and the non combat experiences to creating a sort inner struggle within him. However his plight gets played too much for comedic effect and escalated a tad too much for us to take it seriously and since those moments barely advance his character at all, those moments are rendered pointless. When the show takes him out of the role of a highschool student, he might not become the most complex protag, but he\'s a lot more competent seeing as how he is in his element. Of course the fact that you become so comfortable within that state kinda goes against the general purpose of taking him out his comfort zone. And like i said, things do get revealed about in the later part of the show, which gives us an opportunity to show us whats in this G.I.jokes head. But the way he develops overall is mostly subpar and sporadic. He still has some moments that are pretty endearing despite how much of a socially inept straight faced hick he is. Just wished that showed off more often.Now he does have a super special awesome mech (cause why wouldnt he) which has a hidden system that when activated can produce energy powered by Sosuke\'s will, and if your\'re wondering yes this does deus ex save his ass a couple times in the show. Of course Sosuke himself has a sort of love hate relationship with the machine that only works when it wants to. Kinda hard for someone as stiff as he is to rely on a machine that almost unscientifically powers you with your inner mojo, so he doesnt use it other than his important battles. He aint OP like Kira Yamato or nothing but it does make fights lack tension seeing as how all Sosuke needs to do is awaken his chakra G Gundam style and use shining finger. Overall Sosuke is an alright protag.*Undertale OST Dummy Gooseworx cover*Kaname Chidori ladies and gentleman. She\'s the main female lead of the show. A popular above average high school chick. She\'s the target for the terorists who want the secrets of super technology and psychic prowess in her head; as well as the target of my discomfort. She\'s basically every bratty teenage tsundere you can find in anime. Now admittedly i will say that her attitude towards our local MC is somewhat justified seeing as he somewhat is responsible for all the dumb shit happening around her and generally flipping her whole life upside down despite his aims to protect her from harm. This would be fine if the jokes were funny and... well you know the drill. So it kinda makes her come off as irritable at times. I get its only natural for her to be this way in this case but there are times in the show where its too overplayed and she makes outright dumb decisions where it does not justify her being a petulant cunt. She does use her hidden mcguffin powers to help the heroes and she does get a chance to understand sosuke better later on, including one charming scene in the last episode. Other than that, general personality isnt all that endearing and neither is her interactions/relationship with Sosuke. So yeah, this chick who looks like the descendent of Marth from Fire emblem is unlikable. Dabu Dee dabu die, bitch.*Nadesico OP*On to the characters who are a part of Mithral. Tessa is a pretty good supporting character. She\'s clumsy but still very charming. Despite her young age and demeanor she is a very effective captain of her group and made pretty sound decisions throughout the show(if you can ignore the probability of it). Other than that one pissing contest she had with another female character Mao in one episode, but it was mostly to have her understand the hardships and struggles her subordinates go through when they enter battle. She also has a crush on Sosuke (oooooh love triangle. Drama~) for actually understandable reasons. Given how somewhat of an awkward person she is and her environment and the fact that Sosuke is the only other person her age around, it would make sense for her to gravitate towards his military charm. She admires him for his strength and resilience which contrasts her own doubts about herself as well as the respect her crew gives her. And she doesnt come off as someone who exists soully for his sawed off shotgun, if you catch my drift. Plus she\'s a mcguffin like chidori so she\'s helpful in that area too. Which probably explains why she wouldnt have chidori put in a safe house somewhere under surveillance to keep her safe from the terrorists after her, cause she sympathizes with her plight to be a normal girl. Of course maybe sending Sosuke to protect her wasnt the best move. But overall she is a fun and effective character.Others like Kurtz and Mao are fine. Mao is the no nonsense valkyrie bitch who has some okay dialogue and Kurtz is the charming pervert with very little actual charm. They both act as sort of besties to Sosuke in his soldier life and are very useful throughout the show. They\'ve done little to damage their characters, but not too much sticks out. they do have some funny moments though despite not really changing throughout this season of the series.*New Getter Robo OST- Deep Red*The main big bad is Garam and he is a pretty entertaining villain to a point.

Shinji (Sagara's nerdy classmate) is light touch on Shinji himself with a bit of sanity and a phenis control.

I would just like to say why I liked this anime very much.First, it's has a good story. It has both serious plotlines and light moments, action and comedy - which were well balanced. One minute your heart is pounding with excitement then you're laughing over Souske's &quot;army fanboy-ism.&quot;Second, the characters are interesting: from the playboy sharpshooter to the teenage captain and even to the villain. My favorite, of course, would be Sagara Sousuke. I would describe him as sort of like Jack Bauer (of 24) or...John McClane (of Die Hard), simply because he just.won't.die! LOL. But as a teenage sergeant who grew up on different warzones, he still has a lot to learn about living a normal high school life. He comes out like an insensitive rock, but he is a charming insensitive rock. If that makes sense.Overall, I think FMP is really well done (art, music, etc.) and I'm interested in watching the rest of the series. I would gladly recommend it to any anime fan.

Whether this is because the show is actually extremely incredible or because it was the first thing I watched is unsure, but I am going to proceed to give it an amazing review just because of my love for the show.STORY  9  : The story of Full Metal Panic! (a guy named Sousuke Sagara, who works for an elite military like group, is put on a mission to watch over an extremely attractive blue haired female high school student named Kaname Chidori)....Since Sousuke knows nothing of a high school student's life, he acts somewhat insane around her and her friends, so the show has some serious action and some hilarious humor.  The reason I like the story so much is because it has a little bit of everything.  It stretches from good mech fight scenes to humorous scenes about high schoolers living normal lives to romantic scenes with relationships between characters.  I know other shows do this sort of thing, but I think this show does is quite well.ART  8  : As far as the art goes, I really like the art style used in the show.  I think the characters look believably real, which helps with the plot of this show.  I also think the character's looks are fit their character types quite well, especially Sousuke, another great thing about the style is that it makes some of the characters rather hot (Tessa).  I understand that the animation itself is nothing to cream a ton over, but I mean for when it was made I think it is at its A game.SOUND  8  : The songs in the show are some of my favorites, the opening is still probably one of my favorite opening songs. I also think the sounds in the show are believable as well and some of them are hilarious.  I watched it dubbed, so I'm not sure about the japanese voices, but I think the English dub is done well also.CHARACTER  9  : Okay this is where the show really pushes out what it has to offer.  The characters are done so well that it makes you feel like this could actually happen.  You have Sousuke, a military driven guy who thinks every little thing is a threat to the entire world.  He does some insane things that made me laugh out loud watching this, which is weird because other people were probably in my house when I watched this with headphones on.  Kaname is a more typical teen, athletic, somewhat popular, kind of tough, and kind.  Oh yea and lets not forget what i said about her earlier.  The third main character, Tessa, who acts as a somewhat timid person, who also happens to be Sousuke's captain is probably one of the best, if not the best character.  She is extremely nice and likeable.ENJOYMENT  10  : When I started watching this show I was like okay I'll give anime a try again, I had tried to watch Fullmetal Alchemist at one point, but had trouble getting into it.  DON'T HATE ME FOR THIS, I HAVE NOW WATCHED THE SHOW I THINK IT WAS JUST BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE ABOUT ANIME, I NOW KNOW MY MISTAKE, AND I ALSO THINK FMA IS INCREDIBLE.  I also watched a lot of Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ when I was young but I'm talking about more recent, less popular anime.  But like I was saying earlier I began watching it and after a while I got extremely hooked and I became the somewhat otaku I am now.  I enjoyed this show so much because it opened up anime for me by pushing a little of each genre out like I said earlier.OVERALL  10  : Overall Fullmetal Panic! is sexy.  I mean it has something most everyone can enjoy and it is done extremely well.  Now if you havn't seen it I would extremely recommend it, I will say the pilot is not perfect, but it at least sets up Sousuke for you.  Just keep watching and enjoy.  The show will have you on the edge of your seat at points, pissed off at points, rofling at points, among other things.  The show is just fun to watch and is just a great mix of things.  So get to watching!And also -- Fumo! Fumo!

These particular mecha are called Arm Slaves and are characterized by their generally bulky shape and protruding forehead (although the more power ones are, of course, pretty sleek). The story mainly revolves around Sousuke Sagara and his girlfriend (but he won't admit it) Kaname Chidori. At first glance, the bright, happy coloring of Full Metal Panic! belies the serious tone of this series. Sousuke and Kaname are involved in numerous twists and turns and intricate relationships with others.The action scenes are frequent and very engaging. Fast movement combined with all the wonders of mech warfare are...present and freely used. In a way, Full Metal Panic!'s combat is more interesting than the combat in the Gundam series, probably because conventional weapons (tanks, helicopters, mines) pose a sizable threat to Arm Slaves as well. Some of the battles are also used to advance character development.And character development itself is very well done. While at as subtle and permeating as Death Note (well, not many anime are), one can definitely see the conflicting desires and motivations of the characters. Sousuke is one-of-a-kind in his stiff military-man mannerisms while being oblivious to others' feelings; he frequently ends up being in the center of a comical situation. Kaname is most similar to Rosette Christopher from Chrno Crusade with her energetic way of speaking and acting, but is more violent (especially with the paper fan).The art style, when compared to White Album, Gundam 00, Ef: A Tale of Memories/Melodies, and other recent anime, seems a little dated. However, it is more than adequate, and one will no longer even notice the art style once the bullets and missiles start flying. The girls still look great, facial expressions still pull through, and explosions are still brutal and fast. The development team also made use of some computer animations, especially with Tuatha De Danaan.Overall, this anime is a gem among viewers who wish to watch a more mature and dark anime. The action alone makes it worthwhile. Highly recommended for both casual and hardcore anime watchers. present and freely used.

If you're wondering why I gave the Art such a high rating go look up when this series was made. Also, this is a long ass review--don't deem it as unhelpful or crappy because it takes more than 2 minutes to read--I warned ya!!Its always rare to get absolutely hooked on an anime, it usuallyhappens early in the series or in a heated event. Well, FMP will haveyou addicted from the very beginning(and that's a promise). I'd have tobe honest saying that within the first 7...episodes this anime was one offavorites and is probably in the top five most entertaining ever.The Characters: Although Weber and Sagara are somewhat typical fortheir personality-type... this show uses them to their most enjoyableextent(yes, there will be laughs). The girl is random, realistic,clever, and really makes this title easier to relate to - Definitely one of thebest eyecandy female characters in anime history. Sagara willdefinitely surprise you here and there - his spontaneous-ness doesn'tgo with his persona... but it grows on you and makes him lovable.Sousuke & Chidori... did you ever notice that?Even though this show is funny and 'kawaii' it stillmanages some of the best dramatic love, shootout, and loyalty scenesI've seen in ANYTHING. The amount of action is good and it's not thatmuch of a tear-jerker. Basically; it has all the right ingredients.Now I'm not just gonna rant about only the good parts 'cause I'mecstatic over it right now - here are some downsides to the show:Animation is good/standard, but if was only a little glossier thisseries would be a diamond. -  Not enough romance, it just seems that thesexual tension provided and the little bit of actual romantic scenesare just not enough... given I'm saying that because they WERE so good!  Things really should've gotten a little steamier between Sagara andChidori considering a lot of the time she was half naked.All my claims in this review can pretty much be summed up to theHospital scene. If you don't believe me that is.Throughout the series the show will go back to its old lovable roots!!And also, Sagara & Chidori's romance grows more adorable.Another problem with this show is the battles; often confusing andthere's just not enough emotion considering what's going on(especiallythe old-friends battle).This show is practical, romantic, exciting, and interesting enough tokeep just about anyone tuned in. A true landmark title. 9/10 In thesense of overall(considering this anime isn't perfect I just had aperfect time watching it). But as far as personally: 10/10. - It's just so enjoyable, and in my opinion--that's all that really matters. It's kinda like that really really greasy piece of generic pizza that tastes better than anything... there is better out there, but you're fine with this.In the final episode you'll find yourself anticipating a disappointingor unworthy ending, you will not receive it however.The biggest problem with this anime is that it's very much dragged out,but thank God it is!!

After re-watching it again sometime last year, I realised that perhaps I was wrong, it's in no way the best anime ever, however, I still consider it to be one of the funniest anime I've seen. I'll base this review on the re-watch of the anime.I'll start with the story. It starts off strongly, and continues with its strong introduction throughout the first ten or so episodes. Then it gets to the filler episodes, and they are truly terrible. Well, when I say 'they' I'm...actually referring to one in particular, which features a carnival and tries too hard to blend the robots with comedy. Only one of the filler episodes is really worth watching, as it expands the relationship of two of the supporting characters, but besides that the rest are watchable only once. The wave of filler only lasts for about three episodes, then it gets back into the quality of the first ten episodes right until the end. The second (and only other) problem I have with the story is that there are some rather stupidly illogical decisions made in the last episode or two that could have allowed the entire last battle to be avoided. Besides those flaws, the story really works well, fulfilling all of the elements of action/comedy nicely.The art, considering when the series was made (2003) is great to behold, with the animation during fights remaining fluid, while characters are detailed and backgrounds are consistently well-designed and nice to look at without detracting from the scene at hand.The music is fitting and fulfills the required role to match each scene, however none of it really stood out to me as anything outstanding. None of it's unlistenable or annoying though.The characters, for the most part, are likable and well developed throughout the series. The main character, Souske Sagara, hardly develops over the course of the series, which isn't such a bad thing considering his circumstances, going from the battlefield to a high school in which he has no experience whatsoever. His personality contrasts with that of the female lead, Kaname Chidori, the popular high school student who is easily agitated at seemingly every action Souske exhibits. Despite this contrast, the two characters have an undeniable chemistry that develops over the course of the series, which makes their banter rather amusing. The supporting characters all fill their roles, providing ample comedy relief when needed, and filling the archetypal action role when the series hits its more serious stages.So yeah, overall the series mixes the action of mechs with highschool comedy incredibly well, allowing enough of a blend without one ever being overbearing. Full Metal Panic is thoroughly enjoyable, and is well worth the time invested.Sorry if this was a bit sketchy, it's my first review on here. I'm sure I'll warm to it shortly! actually referring to one in particular, which features a carnival and tries too hard to blend the robots with comedy.

The only one I can remember is Chidori, because her name reminds me of Naruto I guess.I can't say much because it just bored me too the extreme. After 1 week or so after I completed watching this, I couldn't remember what the whole plot was or how it looked like, OR who the characters were. The only reason I watched was because of the high ratings. BullShit.This show is a plain piece of crap wearing a...hat. Dunno, just sucked. hat. Dunno, just sucked."", '[REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS]Full Metal Panic! is a particular anime in every aspect.Is it a robot/mecha anime? I expected so, after all there is a ""Full Metal"" right in the title, cover images show you those robots, so it has to be a mecha title.Well, yes and no.Mecha\'s are present and are a good part of the action, you will find battles and strategies and more. Yet, that is not the primary focus of the anime.What is it about then?It\'s really all about the final part, ""Panic!"": mind the exclamation mark (""!""), because that\'s the most important part. Let\'s see better.THE FULL METAL: STORY, ART, SOUND...(8)The story is rather interesting, although it is not particularly complex. It flows well, there are good and evil ones, battles and more, but don\'t expect particular twists or surprises. Art is also good, with very nice drawing and an entertaining color palette: this is a nice anime to watch. The soundtrack does its job: it has a set number of themes that are repeated on and on, but they are spot on and nicely shape the atmosphere.THE PANIC!: CHARACTERS and ENJOYMENT (10)That\'s what makes this anime special and different from the many others: the characters, and the enjoyment level they bring in. This is really an anime about people and their reactions. Sure, sometimes it\'s exaggerated. Sure, sometimes it is strange. But oh well, it is just pure fun. It takes people (like the two main characters) and sets the stage for a human comedy. A comedy of fun, passions, thoughts, social interactions. It fills your heart and your soul, and succeeds in what an excellent anime should do: make you wonder what happens next. Not so much for the mecha\'s and the battles, for the technologies or the mysteries: the plot line is just the background behind, because it\'s the actors that fill the stage. This anime is addictive, and grows within you. It\'s like an exclamation mark after a word: it\'s not just words that matter, but how you say them.And so at the end of the ride you will be left with those sensations that only the best anime leave: enjoyment for the show, and sadness because it\'s ended. Until the moment you go on with the sequel, that is, when that ride of emotions will start again to roller-coaster, and capture again your heart.Always with an exclamation mark!

Maybe after 13 years without a continuation, I would have lost interest or lost hope that it would ever continue. It was unusual for me that I, who have already watched a lot of anime (503), somehow discovered this beautiful anime only very late. But now let's get to my first review ^^Story - clear and understandable until the point where...you hear about Whispered, black technology, or Lambda Driver. Nevertheless, it was fun to watch. 7/10Action - yes, there is, but it's not overwhelming. 6/10Comedy - mostly when Sousuke and Kaname are in school life. 7/10Romance - not so much, even though there are hints from both sides. 4/10Mecha - solid Mecha designs, although most are just copy and paste, and only a few stand out, like the Arbalest. 7/10School - is present, but unfortunately, in my opinion, too short. 6/10Character - Sousuke/Kaname 10/10, Thessa 8/10, Kurz/Melissa 7/10, Gauron 7/10, Rest 7/10 Conclusion 8/10Animation - it was definitely solid for its time. 7/10Anime style - i loved it, for many it may not look special or outdated, but as someone who grew up with anime like Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Naruto, Pokemon, or Digimon, it's pure nostalgia. 10/10There were good as well as bad phases in the first season. Sometimes I really wanted to know how it goes on, sometimes I almost fell asleep ^^ All in all, I was satisfied, and especially Sousuke and Kaname, both are just divine! A plus point for me was also the art style. As I said, for me, it was just nostalgia, as if I were back in old times.Conclusion: 8/10I will also give a review for Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid and Invisible Victory. Those who are interested can also read them :) you hear about Whispered, black technology, or Lambda Driver.

shit.So FMP! what has it brought to our little world of moe and cute and huge eyes with glitter in them?Well it brought chaos and death and blood pooring from the screen and.....What?Wait a minute?Did i get this wrong?School?Romcom?What the fucking hell?What is this?Mr Jimmy and Dr Jim?I should point out that i\'m not in any way unfit to write a review it\'s the anime itself that is bipolar.One min it\'s a romcom another min it\'s an all guns blazing...military mecha punch in the fez.How\'s this for a story?A top secret top of the pops unit has been assigned the protection of a high school girl(my my what a surprise)who yada yada doodly has info in her head that is top secret and terrorists want them and so the 3 of the best guardians of the galaxy venture to protect the blue haired hottie.Sagara,Kurtz and Melissa are the chosen ones.They\'re the best,the deadliest the most fearsome team.And not only that,they can also handle the so called ""arm slaves"" mechs.So you expect at this point to hear me saying that all hell breaks loose right?Nope...They send Sagara the military nut,as we\'re kept reminded through the series,to fuckin school so he can be close to Chidori,his protectee.This was supposed to be funny cause Sag has no concept of real life much less school life.But take it from me this ends up just like any other ecchi harem anime you\'ve ever seen.Everyone ""hates"" Sagman but also loves him big time..That\'s women for ya right there:""I want him,no i don\'t,maybe i do i don\'t know leave me alone i need time to think""...This also holds true for our little Tsundereness Chi.After some seriously bad attempts at comedy we stumble upon the strangest transition known to man.They thought:""We have this military nut,we have mechs...Why don\'t we use them?"".....And in an instant the anime becomes an Arnie Schwarzenegger-esque one.Where bullets fly like there\'s no tomorrow and shit explodes and blood poors from your hard drive.Or that\'s is exactly what they wanted you to think..The thinking behind the scenes was well thought of,the planning,the execution all that stuff was good...But the on screen result was a bit lifeless.It didn\'t grab me by the balls and make me stand up and sing songs of praise.I can summarize it like this..They wanted to please 2 audiences and in the process failed at both.Comedy was cheap,action was mostly an afterthought and the switch between the 2 was as unnatural and disgusting as seeing Weinstein jerking off!The indecisiveness between action and comedy ultimately is the main issue with FMP!.It feels like two separate shows with a weak connection between the two.Had it focused on Sousuke and Mithril and kept to being a mecha military anime,that would be fine.Or if it instead concentrated on Sousuke\'s inept attempts to adapt to a normal high school,that too would have been fine.But given the separated layers of mecha action and high school comedy,the result is a half great parfait.Animation was for the most part good.Nothing outstanding but still pleasing to the eye.The characters were nicely done as were the mecha and the military stuff like choppers and jeeps and shit.As for the movements they were jiddery at best,especially when it counted the most.In the fight scenes.There were some details that were absolutely sweet,make no mistake,but the actual scenes themselves were not quite as good as i expected.As for the use of CG,it isn\'t as bad as most people say they are.They are comparable or even better than modern ones.Or at least they feel like so,maybe the dark tone of the anime helped a bit there.Soundwise nothing stood out i\'m afraid.The songs used were not fit for the tone of FMP!.In any other anime they would be fine but that was like using kids music in a porn film.VA was subpar.It could have been tons better,but like the anime itself it was medium.Onto the chars.Most of them are there just to fill the space.No apparent reason why the exist and when taken off screen you don\'t really miss them or even remember who they were.That\'s 70% or so of the cast rendered useless and one trick ponys.As for the main cast..Sagara is a man on a mission,an emotionless robot.Granted it is fixed later on but it wasn\'t anything to celebrate either cause the way it\'s done is stupid beyond belief.I mean this is a merc who has killed countless people from the sweet age of 8,he has witnessed the death of many loved ones.But that doesn\'t show in his attitude.It only shows later on in the series where some people in his team die.So we\'re led to believe that all of a sudden he went from I-Robot to Ms Robinson by the deaths of people he met some days ago?Then is her Tsudereness Chidori.who somehow falls for the robot and wants all the attention to herself.What do you mean you\'re off fighting terrorists who want to kill thousands of people?I want some Sagman candy and i want it now...Oh what?You are sad people died?I WANT MY ATTENTION!Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch  like someone famous said once.As for other aspects of her personality..She also switches from missshelteredtoLaraCroft in an instant.Must be the drugs she took.Kurtz is the womanizer of the series.That\'s it..Melissa as i can recall smokes more than a VW and drinks like a fish and has a hot body.Then there\'s the Cap...Tessa...This was the one character that didn\'t contribute almost anything trivial to the story.And she was the fuckin captain..I had to wait until the very last eps to see some signs of life or personality from this one,to see as to why she has the title of genius.She also has  a crush on Sagman for no apparent reason other than we needed a love triangle.So a failure at romcom,a failure at action and in between some very very good moments.But i can\'t stand here and say it\'s all bad.I really enjoyed it,i don\'t know why and i can\'t explain it but the damn thing is good.The eps really flew by and it didn\'t feel like it overstayed it\'s welcome even though it was 24 eps long.Sure there are better animes out there that can deliver much much more but still i do recommend watching it.Also i\'m really sorry if this review was a mess but the whole anime is a mess of idon\'tknowwhatiwanttodoorbe.This is the best i could do with the things presented to me.But watch it for

anyone.the characters are so perfect, they got every character done perfectly. In my opinion the first season is the best out of all 4...of them.this series has everything you would want to see in a good anime.Not once in this anime did i get bored which is another reason i gave this a 10 out of 10.For me this is a must watch anime for everyone. of them.this series has everything you would want to see in a good anime.Not once in this anime did i get bored which is another reason i gave this a 10 out of 10.For me this is a must watch anime for everyone.', ""Wow.

Full Metal Panic! greatest accomplishment is how it blends these two genres together: even if the mecha plot line has more screen time, the rom-com parts are at the same time fun and essential for the development of the main characters.The plot itself is quite simple, and the obscure mysteries around the mechas’ technology keep the viewer’s interest high.Art [7]In the first place, the character design of the main characters is very good;...despite this, the animation is not always on point, and even if it’s never really bad, it’s not great either.Besides that, even if the action scenes’ choreography is not that great, they are exciting due to their high stakes.Sound [6-]The weakest part of the show. The OP is okay, but it’s not really special.The most part of the OST of Full Metal Panic! sounds like a mediocre copy of an 80s action series soundtrack like The A-Team or Hazzard.Character [7-]The main characters of Full Metal Panic! are quite good. They’re not super-deep or anything, but they fit very well in their role, especially Testarossa and Kaname.The side characters are very enjoyable at times (for example, most of the soldiers of the Mithril are really interesting), and very bland at others (the main antagonist is really unbearable and flat).Enjoyment [8-]Even if the series itself is not that great as a work of art, I really enjoyed the series as an entertaining mecha show.It’s not as deep as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Bokurano, or other psychological mechas, but it’s a funny and thrilling way to spend your free time watching giant robots fighting and beautiful waifus being badass.Overall [7-]To sum up, I won’t recommend this show to you except if you are a huge mecha fan and can stand early-00’s mediocre animation.In conclusion, I personally enjoyed this show and I’m really looking to watch other entries of the Full Metal Panic! universe. despite this, the animation is not always on point, and even if it’s never really bad, it’s not great either.Besides that, even if the action scenes’ choreography is not that great, they are exciting due to their high stakes.Sound [6-]The weakest part of the show.

I've nothing to complain about. Action scenes are very enjoyable.The sound is very good. Music and effects suit very well scenes.

For Full Metal Panic I will start on the main flaw of the show as it has a major impact on its enjoyment.What may it be? Full Metal Panic has something for everyone, mecha, romance, action. A good story with a real bad ass, I love to hate him bad guy, great characters, animation that is standing the test of time and a great sound track. Well the problem is the presentation. It is clear from the start that the...key to the show is the relationship between Sousuke and Chidori yet we don't see it develop and that just drove me mad. The Full Metal Panic story really needed to merge with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu and the Second Raid so their relationship could develop in between missions and not affect the plot.The story pits Sousuke Sagara on his toughest mission yet, protecting Kaname Chidori one of the whispered who have the key to black technology. And this means infiltrating Chidori's school. Unfortunately Sousuke, a former child soldier, isn't a natural for the mission as he as somewhat difficulty adapting to high school life and is unable to differentiate between high school, the beach and normal life and the battlefield and to make things more confusing Chidori is not the kind of damsel in distress that constantly needs rescueing from the dangers of normal life providing many a comedy moment.Full Metal Panic is has an enjoyable and gripping story, great characters with with great chemistry including a bad guy who you can really love to hate, good and colourful animation, I especially liked the lines under Sousuke and Chidori's for some reason, a well written script with great comedy, the voice actors did a great job and an enjoyable sound trackIf the series merged with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu and the Second Raid in to a 50+ series allowing Sousuke and Chidori's relationship to develop then Full Metal Panic would have been a potential classic instead it is an anime which is great but........ key to the show is the relationship between Sousuke and Chidori yet we don't see it develop and that just drove me mad.

Unfortunately Sousuke, a former child soldier, isn't a natural for the mission as he as somewhat difficulty adapting to high school life and is unable to differentiate between high school, the beach and normal life and the battlefield and to make things more confusing Chidori is not the kind of damsel in distress that constantly needs rescueing from the dangers of normal life providing many a comedy moment.Full Metal Panic is has an enjoyable and gripping story, great characters with with great chemistry including a bad guy who you can really love to hate, good and colourful animation, I especially liked the lines under Sousuke and Chidori's for some reason, a well written script with great comedy, the voice actors did a great job and an enjoyable sound trackIf the series merged with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu and the Second Raid in to a 50+ series allowing Sousuke and Chidori's relationship to develop then Full Metal Panic would have been a potential classic instead it is an anime which is great but........"", 'Full Metal Panic is for those who want action with mechs, but not have the show only revolve around war and battles, and FMP accomplishes that flawlessly.FMP is about an Organization called Mithril that are something like celestial being from gundam 00 for those that have seen it.  They intervene in things so that wars dont happen.  But they are also out to protect certain people with the natural gift of knowledge of advanced technology called Whispered.The main character is what makes this show so interesting.  His whole life he has known nothing but military life and now he tries to adapt...to japanese high school life in order to protect a certain girl.  Of course all the other characters are a great enjoyment to have in the show as well.The art work in this pretty good, and the use of CGI is integrated well.  The mechs and battles as a whole always look top notch.although the story is based on the idea i stated above, it evolves as it goes and you get lots of back story which leads to a really nice overall plot.This show is always a joy to watch because of the hilarious things done by the characters that are ingeniously intertwined with an excellent story of war and the like.This is actually one show i recommend the dub over the sub (which is extremely rare)  because they just did such an amazing job on it.Amazing show, a must watch. be sure to watch the OVAish type sequel Fumoffu and the direct sequel TSR. to japanese high school life in order to protect a certain girl.

One day he gets an assignemt to protect Kaname Chidori a High Scool student from Tokyo. Sagara takes his job wery seriosly, this leads to many funny episodes and in the begining he denies to Chidori that he actualy protects her.Kaname Chidori is one of the Whispers special people that have black technology in the dephts of their minds. This tecnology is years advance of the world. Therefore the criminal and old fiend of Souake shows up and tries...to kidnap her.The weapons used in the series is just like the real world, exept that they also uses AS, giant robots that is piloted from within.The story is wery original and leaves an interesting plot. It doesn't take to long to come to the point, is easy to understand, yet not predictable.The art is in a pretty usual style. The picture doesn't stand to much still as other series do wrong.I don't quit know what to say about the sound as i generally don't really care about that aspect.The characters is quite interesting, expesially Sagara Souske who has lived as a merenary his whole life, so he has great trouble fiting in normal teenagers life.The characters are waried but not too original.This is a wery funny serie, that also contains love and fighting in a perfect balance.Feel free to give comment on the review. to kidnap her.The weapons used in the series is just like the real world, exept that they also uses AS, giant robots that is piloted from within.The story is wery original and leaves an interesting plot.

Though I don\'t know what anime it is, a captain appears and kind enough to tell me the title is. Full Metal Panic, I was hoping this anime to be a comedic series it is not. It was like 10% comedy, 80% mecha fights, and 10% nonsense. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not hating this series but I\'ll try make this review as objective as possible.[Story] 6/10Story is not the strongest point in this series. I got tired watching the main characters fighting the same enemy...the entire time. And yes, the bad guy -Gauron- is the only antagonist in this series. This smiling bastard -Gauron- always crawl back from the River of Styx and the protagonist -Sagara Sousuke- is kind enough not to confirming his kill. Gauron\'s evil deeds knows no end, I just wondering how a human can be so evil. I thought he was a businessman but he was doing nothing but evil. And the main characters don\'t even realize that they had been playing on Gauron\'s palm the whole time.[Art and Animation] 7/10Don\'t expect too much, it\'s a 2002 anime don\'t compare it with the latest anime (believe it or not lots of people doing this). But I\'ve seen better quality animation for an early 2000 anime, Full Metal Panic is just average.[Music] 7/10I like the music and the music videos are so classic, love that![Characters] 5/10The characters are too shallow! They don\'t develop the characters much in this entire series. In my opinion they added too many fighting scenes (and the fighting scenes is not great either). The main protagonist, Sagara, is a skilled Arm Slave pilot and a military-freak. He\'s really straighforward and easily misunderstood. Lacks common sense always appears expressionless that somewhat makes him funny. Sagara mostly associated with Chidori Kaname, a short-tempered girl that can\'t deal with Sagara\'s stunts. Nothing else make her special, just average character with a special power to make the plot going. Though she can still crying and pouting nonsense in a critical situations while the others are risking their lives to fight Gauron and saving her sorry ass. And the other main character is Testarossa ""Tessa"" Teletha. She\'s a 16 years old genius and the Captain of the fleet. Tessa is kind enough to cry over her subordinate (underling) death. But she can\'t deal with Mao Mellissa very well. She always playing with her hair while thinking. This one simple thing makes her characters stands out from the rest, the other characters don\'t have this unique feature as Tessa. As for Gauron he\'s simply too evil, I won\'t be surprised if his middle name was ""Evil"". The other extra characters such as classmates disappear after the first half of the series. The marines are incompetent, they can\'t even shoot a gun from a mere 10 meters distance. And last but not least is Kalinin Andrei Sergeivich a Lieutenant Commander of the fleet. I know from a glint of his eyes that he\'s a true veteran of war. Unfortunately he didn\'t get much screen time in this series.[Enjoyment] 6/10I really enjoys the story about the characters especially when Tessa appears. But the action is kinda boring and repetitious and the fighting animation is not that great. The main plot is not really enjoyable, I just wondering when will Gauron die the entire time.[Conclusion]If you\'re looking for a retro action military anime then Full Metal Panic maybe perfect for you. But if you\'re not, give FMP a try it\'s worth to watch :) the entire time. And yes, the bad guy -Gauron- is the only antagonist in this series.

That’s all.Respectfully, etc.Full Metal Panic the anime is good screwball comedy. Never mind that the light novel writer went off into dark, apocalyptic drivel essentially lobotomizing the lovely Tessa and demonizing Kalinin. No, no. This is Full Metal Panic the anime, and Sousuke at 17 and in high school for the first time in his abnormal life is the perfect straight man....There are three major story lines, each drawing in a wider array of characters and scenarios. In the first, Sousuke and Kaname do the two-step, finding a natural rhythm to the tune of an Arm Slave loaded with a lambda driver; the lyrics? “If you lose, they’ll rip off my clothes, play around with my body and kill me! You’d hate that, right?” Right, Kaname; Sousuke wins. In the second, Sousuke’s superior officer, Tessa, crashes on the duo with a homicidal teenage terrorist in tow to form a loopy square dance. And in the third, it’s an underwater dance party, with Tessa and Kaname resonating with each other to defeat the villain.What makes this funny are the characters. No matter how much the writers try to bury him under the “orphan child of war” angst, Sousuke is a comedic dream, an animated Buster Keaton – his beautiful face is so deadpan that you start to attribute meaning in the slightest change of his eyes. Kaname is versatile, tough, and gifted with comic timing; with her insane homerun swing and physical agility, she’s the only one who can match Sousuke stride for stride. And Tessa: can a tactical genius be this klutzy and ingenuous? “At the age of 6, I derived Einstein’s 10 component symmetric tensor field equations….My brother derived it at 4, and I’ve always felt inferior to him (smile).” On the Geiger counter of sweetness, hers is an order of magnitude higher than the rest.The episode to showcase the romp that is FMP is #13, “A cat and a kitten’s rock and roll.” Oh the glee of Mao.Three obligatory remarks:First, the animation. The action sequences are probably CGI, while the remainder is drawn with strong, clean outlines and sharp color. The lead characters are prettified, making them look like children playing in a grittier world.Second, the music. Pleasant and light, for the most part it is unobtrusive, except for the instrumental used for highlights from previous episodes which sounds like “the flight of the bumblebees” with its crescendoing fugue of strings.Third, the voice characterizations. The English dubs were better than the Japanese originals.Grade: solid B There are three major story lines, each drawing in a wider array of characters and scenarios.

I thought they tried to incorporate too many elements (mecha/military, magical girl, high school comedy) and didn't pull any of them off especially well. Things were brought up early in the series only to be completely forgotten about until near the end. I also thought that the series could have been half as long and would have benefitted from the faster pacing. "", 'I, um... I\'m going to stop writing reviews for a while after this one because honestly, this series was hard for me. Nothing about it stood out and more often than not I expected the MC to yell ""KAGOME!!"" in place of the lead female\'s actual name. I can\'t suggest this series to anyone who wants to be entertained.The story is about a 16-year-old girl in Japan who falls into a well and discovers she\'s been transported back in time to the feudal era where apparently demons existed but don\'t in the modern era. She discovers a demon named Inuyasha bound to a tree...by an arrow and fre- Oh, what? That\'s a different series? Then what the Hell is this?Full Metal Panic follows Sousuke Sagara (Who I will now rename Soggy Sausage), a member of a ""top-secret"" military organization that everyone with a laptop and a wifi connection knows about. He is sent to protect the token tsundere from some mean enemy military people because she\'s the key to a weapon they already have in their possession and their leader has the same power as her and is military-trained making the whole thing rather pointless WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE SO STUPID?If you expected me to review this series\' characters (the military personnel in particular) as good, you were hopeful. Unfortunately, I had to suffer through 24 episodes of someone who somehow functions well enough in a strict military structure to rise through the ranks, but can\'t figure out why stalking someone in broad daylight is a problem. Oh, and the tsudere starlet doesn\'t help since her reactions are what you would get from someone with Borderline Personality Disorder and not a rational, reasonable-minded person.What side characters? Oh, you mean those walking tropes almost every other series has? Those forgettable members of the cast that if they died and were replaced with a plank of wood you wouldn\'t notice? Yeah, even the villain exists to just be there. The climatic final fight scene is... Boring. I\'ve watched mecha anime like Bokurano, Code Geass, and even Gurren Lagann and the first one despite the slowness of how the damned thing moved was more entertaining that whatever FMP was trying to do.The music isn\'t there. I don\'t remember it and looking on youtube just doesn\'t strike me as a fruitful endeavor. The opening just feels out of place or maybe because the entire thing is a mess it just doesn\'t work. Nothing about the characters, the story, or the art draws you in and it\'s unfortunate because the art is similar to that of Escaflowne (Probably a product of the industry at the time). Nothing about this series is meant to appeal to anyone but a crowd of hiveminded persons who consider Inuyasha a masterpiece.If you\'re still curious, go watch Blood+.

The first FMP, in my opinion, is the weakest of the works, but nonetheless is required viewing if you want in on the series.Sosuke is part of Mithril, a secret organization dedicated to protecting the planet from terrorism with technology and armament far surpassing that of any nation.FMP is a mech/action about Sosuke who is sent to protect a high school girl, Chidori, who unknowingly possesses amazing technological knowledge. Overall, the series is pretty good but is overshadowed by the grandeur of it's successors (Fumoffu and TSR). This...is also one of the first shows that I'd watched so please bear with my minimalist review.Animation:Personally I think the mechs look strange and, well, unappealing. The characters are also somewhat odd at first, but I overcame that. Those aside, the general animation is done fairly well and the colors reflect the mood of the series. Expect a good dosage of action and a bit of gore.Sound:The OP was fairly good but I didn't like the ED that much. The background music also wasn't anything that memorable. Voice acting is the only plus here with the two main characters (Chidori and Sosuke) having superb voice actors.Story:There is a sharp contrast between the real battle world for Sosuke where death is a daily reality and the innocent high school life of Chidori.The plot basically has Sosuke fighting to protect Chidori from various foes, and certain fights are quite intense. There isn't really a conclusion, more of a settling down after the climax, which makes sense since TSR takes place right after.Character:Sosuke is an amazing character. Not only is he highly trained and knowledgeable about military technology and mechs, he is also completely clueless regarding civilian life. This makes for a great deal of humor. His antics with Chidori alone make this an above average show.Value:While the show was entertaining and exciting at times, it is neither as intense as TSR nor as humorous as Fumoffu.

What make the series great is the characters and their interaction.  The Series includes everything, Romance, comedy, action, etc.  I've watched the series multiple times and loved it every time.  It's a good laugh yet thrilling at the same time.  I highly recommend it. "", ""Full Metal Panic is a lot of fun! It features an outstanding sense of humor and great set of characters. Sousuke Sagara is hands down one of the funniest and fascinating anime characters ever conceived and Kaname Chidori; while she may appear to be an angry tsundere most of the time, she feels like a real person and is also very funny in her own right. These two combined is comedic\ufeff genius and the situations and interactions presented here are downright hilarious!Then there is the other side of the spectrum: The military stuff... Looking back on it, i really didn't care\ufeff about most of...it. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed all the sitcom aspects a lot more than the Mecha-stuff which i'll probably just skip on rewatch. It's just not that interesting, outside of the Mao/Kurtz banter and for the fact that we get to know about what drives Sousuke which IS interesting. The creators just wanted to have their cake and eat it too, but only really succeeded with one....And despite how completely unrealistic her being a 16-yo submarine captain is (let that sink in) I like Tessa Testarossa: She's cute\ufeff and the resulting love triangle makes for some fun moments (see Episode 13) but c'mon - We all know she's just a wacky obstacle in the Chidori/Sagara relationship! We want those crazy kids to get together dammit - The fans demand it!All in all I award this first season a 7.5/10: The military stuff is decent, if a bit dull, but what makes this series great and so much fun is the characters and their witty interactions!*I highly recommend watching the English dub sorely because of Chris Patton's hilariously methodical portrayal of Sousuke and his chemistry with Luci Christian as Kaname. In fact all the English VA's do an outstanding job - Check it out! it. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed all the sitcom aspects a lot more than the Mecha-stuff which i'll probably just skip on rewatch.

Despite the similiar titles, the shows are completely different in their presentation and plot- Fullmetal alchemist being, well, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Full Metal Panic! being a rather goofy mecha about a bunch of highschoolers.  That being said, it\'s not bad, just... slightly dissapointing.Art- 6Not a fan.  Didn\'t hate it but I really wish that the lines weren\'t so pronounced.  It makes the characters look way older than they are!  The AS designs didn\'t impress me, but since they are...consistent with the manga (which you should red b/c it\'s awesome (especially Sigma)), can\'t hate too much.  Gave it a 6 because I like the way the TDD looks.Sound-  6Don\'t like the OP but the amazing battle theme offsets it.  Rest of the OST is fairly solid, also.Character- 8Kaname Chidori, our heroine, is misinterpreted vastly different from the manga.  Sure, she\'s still a tsundere, but in the manga she is determined to fight along Sousuke and save herself.  In the anime she comes off as a more typical lead, but at least I can hardly say she\'s annoying.  But oh boy is Sousuke the best goddamn ""hard-ass military man"" lead I\'ve ever seen.  Maybe it was his voice actor, maybe it was his actions, maybe it was  that quirky animation-  but he is fucking hilarious.  You want more of his antics?  Entire series full of them.MAJOR SPOILERS FOR MANGA INCLUDING FMP SIGMAYou\'re reading this anyway you sick bastard.Sousuke has the most badass backstory ever.

A few years/months later (doesn\'t really give time frame), he it recruited by the motherfucking KGB to be an assassin.  But that\'s not all.

The characters are very likable and the development was great, although im not a huge mecha/ war fan,this anime actually made me like the genre more!The anime is very funny but also has another more serious and action side, which blend well together. I have been searching but I havent been able to find an anime with the atmosphere and enjoyment that i experienced when watching this anime!The downside of the anime may have to be that it ends!Overall, I have to give...10/10 as it is a story and an anime that i will always love and remember. 10/10 as it is a story and an anime that i will always love and remember.', 'WARNING BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE OPINION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL. WHETHER GOOD OR BAD YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT DETERMINE YOUR FEELINGS OF THE ANIME. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE ON THIS SITE I WILL NOT WRITE A GOOD REVIEW JUST BECAUSE IT IS ANIME. THE ANIME HAS TO BE GOOD IN MY OPINION.Full Metal Panic! With this weak, cliche story line... you should panic. Full Metal Panic is an anime that came out in 2002 as a military, school life comedy. It is rated PG-13 for some references to sexual content, a little adult language, and...violent scenes.For starters, I watched this as a dub. I am the type of person who will watch the anime as a dub first if it\'s available. If the dub is not good I will stop watching the dub and continue in sub. The fact I did not stop watching in dub is because the dub voice acting was actually good. The female lead voice Chidori Kaname was voiced by Luci Christian and like all of her works she made the emotions of the character shine. The male lead voice Sousuke Sagara was voiced by Chris Patton and his serious, professional voice is what saves the anime from being a totally flop.The story line for the anime follows soldier Sousuke Sagara as he and two others are assigned the task of guarding another ""Whispered"" Chidori Kaname. In the anime the whisper knows stuff that enemy armies want so they are in danger. I felt the plot was played out and not original. I have watched so many animes about a guy guarding a girl with mystical powers that quite frankly it is getting old. You must keep in mind that this is a trend of anime, so it\'s not a big surprise. It\'s successful usually, so it\'s okay. To make the plot even more unoriginal is how they try to throw comedy in the mix. They make Sagara a military nut that does outrageous things in Kaname\'s school. It acts as a double sword making the anime unique, but at the same time corny.The characters are not original either. The male lead is another serious type, the only thing that is original about it is that he is too serious. The female lead comes off as a dismal in distress, but is another loud, abusive female lead. Other characters include Weber, Kurz (Vic Mignogna) classic perverted male, Testarossa, Teletha(Hilary Haag) classic quiet person who creates the love triangle for Sagara.Nothing pops about the art style. It makes you feel as if the mangaka was playing it safe by not being different. Overall this anime can be amusing if you are a person who likes school comedy and military antics. If you are looking for something original this is not the anime for you. If you are looking for something that will keep you being bored, anime for you. This anime keeps you tuned in, but in the end feeling empty instead of begging for more. violent scenes.For starters, I watched this as a dub.

It was the combination of serious military/political action and amusing comedy/romance. That being said, it becomes evident that FMP is a hotchpotch of genres, breaking free from the traditional single-minded seriousness that's often the standard of military themed anime (not that I'd know what traditional would be)StorySet in what slightly resembles today's world, FMP tells the story of Sgt./Specialist Sousuke Sagara and the exploits of the pseudo-UNish organization of peace, MITHRIL. (it would make a killer acronym.. actually, it...probably is) That's the gist of the plot, which flows smoothly, creating an alternate universe that's believable. In fact, it's so believable that you can't help but get pulled into it.Being the sort of person that appreciates a healthy twist in the plot every once in a while, FMP offers quite a lot of unexpected moments of suspense scattered throughout the fog of your typical action scenes.The best part of FMP for me, which many people tend to overlook, is the sheer amount of realism applied throughout the plot. Being a military otaku myself, it was kinda self-gratifying to see accurate depictions of AEGIS class missile cruisers, Los Angeles class submarines and.. well... Sousuke's guns.ArtFirst thing I thought after watching was &quot;their noses are too pointy.&quot; Then, &quot;Wow, that C-17 Globemaster III looks so cool o_O&quot; ... Yeah, that's about it.SoundIt seemed adequate, but didn't impress much. ... Really, what else do you want me to say?CharacterThe characters are vibrant, varied, and very likable. Sousuke's otakuness and social ineptitude are the catalysts for most of the comical scenes in FMP, while Kaname's aggressiveness (tsundere, anyone?) and her chronic Sousuke-beating sessions exacerbate said catalyzed circumstances. But does this dynamic ever change? Not really. The one weak point I see is the inadequate amount of character growth. There are some changes the viewers see with respect to Sousuke's emotional capacity, but largely, the characters remain relatively identical to when the series started. In fact, it's The Second Raid that manages to build upon this more effectively than the first season. So when the series winds down to a close, Sousuke will still be incapable of giving a girl a proper gift, and Kaname will keep beating him up. But that's why we keep watching.Enjoyment10/10 guaranteed. The comedy was brilliant, with plenty of Sousuke-driven faux pas to laugh at.

The world introduces is interesting and believable (at least at the beginning) and the comedy is quite good but that subjective.The problems begin to appear in the second arc (from ep9), mainly because everything...is really confusing:- we know nothing of the enemy but some character are for strange reason connect to them- the terrorist goal makes no sense- for some reason the commander is left without any protection- ...But while that arc is confusing it's far from being as annoying as that pile of shit that is the third arc.First, the enemy of the arc is again Goron. Second, what should have been an elite team from mithril is a group of morons unable to listen to the info they are given or the man added to their team because he is a specialist.They have tactics on par with a shonen protagonist (attack from the front, without cover and without knowing where their target is), and to add to their stupidity they know of the borderline magic lambda drive and that the enemy as one but don't act accordingly.Unfortunately, Sousuke isn't better, and never uses the lambda drive outside of the final battle when it would have been very useful against his former friend. And obviously, he never confirms the kill, so that the final arc villain can be Goron.I will be short for the fourth arc because: it's like the third but a little less retard, and with some development on the plot.Overall it was mediocre with a good start and a really bad third and fourth arc, in fact, the filler episodes, more focus on comedy and characters were way better than the regular episode in the second half of the series.To conclude the author should have stick to comedy where he is quite good, which is confirmed by Full metal panic fumaffu being way better. is really confusing:- we know nothing of the enemy but some character are for strange reason connect to them- the terrorist goal makes no sense- for some reason the commander is left without any protection- ...But while that arc is confusing it's far from being as annoying as that pile of shit that is the third arc.First, the enemy of the arc is again Goron.

Time for Robert\'s Too Late Reviews! This time we\'re stepping all the way back to 2002 to take a look at Full Metal Panic!, a mecha comedy/action/light romance anime. I actually did a review on the latest season which was revived and aired in the past year, but didn\'t realize at the time I hadn\'t reviewed the beginning of the show! Today we\'re here to correct that! I\'m going to be dealing with the dubbed version and only talking season 1. I might come back and update after rewatching the Second Raid. I plan for the season entitled ""FMP! Fumoffu"" to get it\'s own...review as it\'s really a whole different pony show. As the overall number shows, I did quite enjoy FMP! and think there\'s something for most anyone\'s tastes to enjoy. However, this time I would suggest not giving up on it in the first few episodes, as it doesn\'t gel as quickly as other titles. Now let\'s get to it, see if we get some new wallpaper for the RTLR wall of mecha warfare!Story: 7The story is really your basic \'fish out of water\' plot. We have this version built around a young lady that possesses information subconsciously that is of great power, being protected by a life long soldier who has an awful time adjusting to his new undercover assignment. The pair of course go through the story and develop feelings for each other, as such things often happen. As I\'ve said before, and will likely say again in the future, knowing the general course of things doesn\'t mean we can\'t enjoy the ride. FMP! falls squarely in this territory, and yet, it\'s not really all that much of an issue.Our female lead, Kaname, is an energetic high school girl who has information inside her that relates to what is called \'black technology\' and the operation of a near magical power inside certain mech robots called the \'Lambda Driver\'. This is a real Macguffin as the only mention of origin for this information is explained by telling her she\'s known it \'since before she was born\'. As Kaname\'s parents are completely out of the picture, to the level of pointedly remarking on living alone a few times, there\'s no chance for her to really discover how she becomes one of the \'Whispered\' with the information. That is one place you just have to roll with \'because\' being the only answer to the question of \'why is she a Whispered?\'Because she has this information that somehow would greatly benefit anyone that could access it, a mercenary group not tied to any government but with morals that make Superman look like an ass, decides to send a trio of mech pilots to protect Kaname from shadowy, evil-type peoples. In the group is the blonde playboy Kurz, the kickass Melissa, and finally our male lead Sousuke. He\'s the only one of the three young enough to pass off as a student, so Sousuke is enrolled into high school to serve as Kaname\'s bodyguard, with all of this being unbeknownst to Kaname herself.Of course, hijinks ensue as Sousuke has been a soldier for so long that he doesn\'t have a single clue how to even appear as a civilian, let alone operate a cover as one. His personal details, revealed throughout the series shows that he\'s been in war after war for pretty much his whole life. This is where our fish flops on the land. He operates as though there is an assassin or kidnapper in every corner, and takes every small thing as a huge tactical threat. At first, his ability to even laughably hold his cover is missing, as he\'s often pulling his gun on other students, tackling and interrogating people, and just generally acting like a \'military maniac\' as Kaname calls him.Even after the story stabilizes a handful of episodes in, FMP! keeps this humorous angle intact. Kaname, even after discovering the mercenaries and the truth of what\'s locked in her mind *still* smacks Sousuke around for being completely overbearing and nearly ruining her entire high school experience. Kaname is a bit of a fish out of water as well, when she learns she\'s in the center of a very dangerous situation by prospect of just being a Whispered in general. This often finds her in the middle of battles or having to be rescued by Sousuke and the team. This still doesn\'t keep him from taking a fan to the forehead, as she\'s a bit quick to convert her fear to anger and taking that anger out on poor Sousuke.As FMP! moves down the stretch, Kaname and Sousuke begin to develop a relationship based on more than just military necessity. Like any number of other movies, tv shows, and anime, being in constant stressful conditions causes a bond between the two, though they don\'t make it as far as anything serious. The show is geared mainly around the battle actions and the comedy. I think this is a good call, as it keeps from bogging the series down. (A flaw I noted in FMP! Invisible Victory season)We end up with awesome robot battles and sweet action framed by the slightly sweet but mostly funny relationship between Sousuke and Kaname, and together it works, maybe even better than the sum of the parts in general. Throw in a very menacing villain who has personal history with Sousuke, and the mysterious mercenary captain who is so much more than she seems and what comes out of the oven is a fun little show.Art: 8The mechs, that\'s the question, right? They look good, they are not this bland CG makes of more recent titles. Nor are they the overly busy \'Transformers (movies)\' looking creations either. They are well drawn and fluid in their motions. In fact, they sometimes seem to be a little too fluid, leaping about nimbly in hand to hand combat and dodging incoming fire. These are not lumbering beasts by any means.The overall artwork is nicely done, especially for the time frame in which it was released. There is, to my eye, a different aesthetic for anime artwork in the late \'90\'s and early \'00\'s. This title does not look nearly as dated as many from that same era, and the animation does not come across as overly dated.My one complaint about the art, and its completely personal, is that I do not like Kaname\'s hair color and eye color combo. I don\'t know why. I like everything else, but her blue hair and brown eyes just irk me most of the time. Not enough to take away from the enjoyment, but enough to make this old man grumble about it.Sound: 8The sound is good, the mechs sound metallic enough, with the appropriate crashes and rattles as they move about. The gunfire sounds aren\'t remarkable in and of themselves, but are completely serviceable. The voice actors are very well suited to each of their characters, and everyone sounds pretty much spot on. The captain of the submarine, who is around Kaname\'s age, does sound, at times, almost too innocent and young for the portrayal needed.The supporting cast voices are really well done also, with Kurz, Melissa, and the senior officers of the group all sounding awesome. In the case of Melissa and Kurz, they are most of the time very humorous as well.The background music is well done, has a bit of brass fanfare to it in places, big sounds, but that\'s fitting as we\'re dealing with huge battling mechs. The theme songs are a bit subdued for the kind of action and comedy presented, but still work fairly well. My big complaint with the music is that in the theme songs, about halfway or a touch more through the season, they keep the exact same soundtrack, but change the lyrics. Just about the time I get the words down well, they go and remix the lyrics! It\'s not an overly jarring change, at least in how it sounds, but I would have been happy if they would have just kept the one version of each song.Character: 7Sousuke is a great character, he\'s always business, or at least always seems to be serious, yet at times kind of seems to grasp a lighter view. He does move from being somewhat clumsy as a bodyguard in the beginning, coming very close to completely blowing the trio\'s cover more than once, but after a handful of episodes he get the swing of things, and while is still just as maniacal about Kaname\'s safety but acts in a much more convincing manner. This is very noticeable once the main villain takes the stage, and once this growth happens, he doesn\'t change too terribly much. We do see him falling for Kaname in littler things he does and says, but perhaps he\'s not even admitted his feelings to himself by the end of the season. This works well, his fairly static nature, as he\'s the straight man in the comedy setup. Not only that, once he really gets rolling, he\'s shown to be an utter badass of the highest degree. While he is only in his late teens to early twenties, his abilities with the mechs are so well honed that he\'s given the only mech that has the ultra powerful \'Lambda Drive\' in it. He does have a bit of a tragic past, shown throughout the series. Overall, however, he remains a soldier trying to desperately complete his mission of guarding Kaname with little to no clue how to do it within his mission parameters.Kaname is just bubbly and fun, and while she does have her moments of getting into tight spots, she\'s not totally some damsel in distress. She\'s also actively involved a lot in her own rescue when she needs it, as her status as a Whispered somehow allows Sousuke to operate his mech\'s \'Lambda Drive\' at a power level far beyond any other soldier in the outfit. She seems to be taken with him almost immediately after they are introduced, yet spends most of the season in denial, even after learning that she\'s a Whispered. She is a very tsundere character, and when the stress of the battle is over, she\'s quick to vent on Sousuke\'s head with whatever object is nearby. As all tsundere characters though, she does really come around and reach a point of caring deeply for Sousuke, not wanting him to leave when they believe the threat to her safety is over.The villain is an absolute beast, killing remorselessly and once he realizes who Sousuke is, develops a psychotic infatuation with him. At one point, when it appears both Sousuke and the villain are to die together, the villain even tells him he loves him. At first blush one might think, \'haha what a funny thing to say\' but the villain delivers the line in such a menacing manner, touched with an almost eagerness to die that it\'s utterly creepy. He\'s a bad guy for the books, that one.The captain of the submarine that serves as the mercenaries\' base of operations is, as I said, a young woman with a mysterious past of her own. She also becomes somewhat of a mild romantic foil for Kaname, developing feelings of her own for Sousuke. She\'s determined, sometimes naive, but has a good heart, and will do anything for her crew or to spare innocents. She\'s almost a touch overly goody-two-shoed, but just almost.Finally to round out the character set we have Kurz and Melissa, Sousuke\'s fellow mech pilots and operatives on the protection of Kaname. Kurz is a blonde playboy that tries to be smooth, and thinks every woman wants him, and Melissa is a hard-drinking, hard driving babe that makes sure Kurz knows that most decidedly not all or even most women want him. He\'s always playing loverboy, making passes at Kaname the few times they come into contact, and constantly ribbing Sousuke to \'move in\' on her. Though he\'s a bit a pig when it comes to women, he\'s a reliable sniper and adept mech pilot who always steps up when the cards are played.Melissa is always throwing back a Budweiser and puffing a cigarette and giving Kurz a hard time. She\'s tough as nails and because she\'s the highest ranked among the three operatives, always leads by example. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and she\'s just one tough cookie! The only complaint I have about Melissa (who I otherwise love) is that she develops a very sudden case of competitiveness with the captain. This seems to come kind of out of nowhere, springing in suddenly one episode with little to indicate it was going to happen. She is the captain\'s polar opposite, so them not getting along perfectly makes sense, but it still hits as a little odd to go from only captain and crewman to prim and proper and loud and proud. It works, it\'s just a bit sudden when it starts.Enjoyment: 8Yeah, I know we\'re getting long again, aren\'t we? I can\'t help but talk about all the things I love, and I hope you guys, if any of you have read this far, can appreciate the passion I try to put into these pieces. So, FMP!, I did enjoy a good deal. I\'ve actually seen season 1 a few different times, have used it as something to watch when I wasn\'t feeling up to keeping up with a new series. It\'s a fun little show with cool action and some really funny and great moments. Being someone who was a gamer in the \'90\'s I nearly fell out of my chair the first time someone pulled out a Jane\'s magazine (they used to make *awesome* flight sims) and swung it around. There\'s several moments like this, some I know that went over my head in regards to weapons and tactics, but still, the overall experience is very satisfying.A note of caution however: watch the series in order if possible. Or at the very least do NOT watch Invisible Victory (the latest season) first. I actually prefer to watch season 1, then The Second Raid then Invisible Victory as they all have the same framework. I watch Fumoffu entirely separately usually after the Second Raid, as it\'s not really a \'mainline\' entry, and deals mainly with only humorous elements and not any heavy plot takes. For example there is a whole episode dedicated to Kurz and a couple other guys trying to peek in on the captain, Melissa, and Kaname in a outdoor hotspring. Sousuke of course uses military grade non-lethal (paintballs, etc) equipment to keep the girls\' virtues intact (well, as much as Melissa\'s can be salvaged at that point) complete with a VERY well placed rubber duck. So yeah, know that Fumoffu is the wacky spinoff, and don\'t start with the latest season, it\'ll mess it all up for ya. That wraps us up, feel free to throw me some love or hate, depending on how much your eyes are bleeding from this essay, I always love hearing from people. As for the great RTLR wall of mecha knife fights, the captain (Tessa) makes an appearance for Mithril and all of FMP! Two thumbs up! review as it\'s really a whole different pony show.

This still doesn\'t keep him from taking a fan to the forehead, as she\'s a bit quick to convert her fear to anger and taking that anger out on poor Sousuke.As FMP! moves down the stretch, Kaname and Sousuke begin to develop a relationship based on more than just military necessity. Like any number of other movies, tv shows, and anime, being in constant stressful conditions causes a bond between the two, though they don\'t make it as far as anything serious. The show is geared mainly around the battle actions and the comedy. I think this is a good call, as it keeps from bogging the series down. (A flaw I noted in FMP! Invisible Victory season)We end up with awesome robot battles and sweet action framed by the slightly sweet but mostly funny relationship between Sousuke and Kaname, and together it works, maybe even better than the sum of the parts in general. Throw in a very menacing villain who has personal history with Sousuke, and the mysterious mercenary captain who is so much more than she seems and what comes out of the oven is a fun little show.Art: 8The mechs, that\'s the question, right? They look good, they are not this bland CG makes of more recent titles. Nor are they the overly busy \'Transformers (movies)\' looking creations either. They are well drawn and fluid in their motions. In fact, they sometimes seem to be a little too fluid, leaping about nimbly in hand to hand combat and dodging incoming fire. These are not lumbering beasts by any means.The overall artwork is nicely done, especially for the time frame in which it was released. There is, to my eye, a different aesthetic for anime artwork in the late \'90\'s and early \'00\'s. This title does not look nearly as dated as many from that same era, and the animation does not come across as overly dated.My one complaint about the art, and its completely personal, is that I do not like Kaname\'s hair color and eye color combo. I don\'t know why. I like everything else, but her blue hair and brown eyes just irk me most of the time. Not enough to take away from the enjoyment, but enough to make this old man grumble about it.Sound: 8The sound is good, the mechs sound metallic enough, with the appropriate crashes and rattles as they move about. The gunfire sounds aren\'t remarkable in and of themselves, but are completely serviceable. The voice actors are very well suited to each of their characters, and everyone sounds pretty much spot on. The captain of the submarine, who is around Kaname\'s age, does sound, at times, almost too innocent and young for the portrayal needed.The supporting cast voices are really well done also, with Kurz, Melissa, and the senior officers of the group all sounding awesome. In the case of Melissa and Kurz, they are most of the time very humorous as well.The background music is well done, has a bit of brass fanfare to it in places, big sounds, but that\'s fitting as we\'re dealing with huge battling mechs. The theme songs are a bit subdued for the kind of action and comedy presented, but still work fairly well. My big complaint with the music is that in the theme songs, about halfway or a touch more through the season, they keep the exact same soundtrack, but change the lyrics. Just about the time I get the words down well, they go and remix the lyrics! It\'s not an overly jarring change, at least in how it sounds, but I would have been happy if they would have just kept the one version of each song.Character: 7Sousuke is a great character, he\'s always business, or at least always seems to be serious, yet at times kind of seems to grasp a lighter view. He does move from being somewhat clumsy as a bodyguard in the beginning, coming very close to completely blowing the trio\'s cover more than once, but after a handful of episodes he get the swing of things, and while is still just as maniacal about Kaname\'s safety but acts in a much more convincing manner. This is very noticeable once the main villain takes the stage, and once this growth happens, he doesn\'t change too terribly much. We do see him falling for Kaname in littler things he does and says, but perhaps he\'s not even admitted his feelings to himself by the end of the season. This works well, his fairly static nature, as he\'s the straight man in the comedy setup. Not only that, once he really gets rolling, he\'s shown to be an utter badass of the highest degree. While he is only in his late teens to early twenties, his abilities with the mechs are so well honed that he\'s given the only mech that has the ultra powerful \'Lambda Drive\' in it. He does have a bit of a tragic past, shown throughout the series. Overall, however, he remains a soldier trying to desperately complete his mission of guarding Kaname with little to no clue how to do it within his mission parameters.Kaname is just bubbly and fun, and while she does have her moments of getting into tight spots, she\'s not totally some damsel in distress. She\'s also actively involved a lot in her own rescue when she needs it, as her status as a Whispered somehow allows Sousuke to operate his mech\'s \'Lambda Drive\' at a power level far beyond any other soldier in the outfit. She seems to be taken with him almost immediately after they are introduced, yet spends most of the season in denial, even after learning that she\'s a Whispered. She is a very tsundere character, and when the stress of the battle is over, she\'s quick to vent on Sousuke\'s head with whatever object is nearby. As all tsundere characters though, she does really come around and reach a point of caring deeply for Sousuke, not wanting him to leave when they believe the threat to her safety is over.The villain is an absolute beast, killing remorselessly and once he realizes who Sousuke is, develops a psychotic infatuation with him. At one point, when it appears both Sousuke and the villain are to die together, the villain even tells him he loves him. At first blush one might think, \'haha what a funny thing to say\' but the villain delivers the line in such a menacing manner, touched with an almost eagerness to die that it\'s utterly creepy. He\'s a bad guy for the books, that one.The captain of the submarine that serves as the mercenaries\' base of operations is, as I said, a young woman with a mysterious past of her own. She also becomes somewhat of a mild romantic foil for Kaname, developing feelings of her own for Sousuke. She\'s determined, sometimes naive, but has a good heart, and will do anything for her crew or to spare innocents. She\'s almost a touch overly goody-two-shoed, but just almost.Finally to round out the character set we have Kurz and Melissa, Sousuke\'s fellow mech pilots and operatives on the protection of Kaname. Kurz is a blonde playboy that tries to be smooth, and thinks every woman wants him, and Melissa is a hard-drinking, hard driving babe that makes sure Kurz knows that most decidedly not all or even most women want him. He\'s always playing loverboy, making passes at Kaname the few times they come into contact, and constantly ribbing Sousuke to \'move in\' on her. Though he\'s a bit a pig when it comes to women, he\'s a reliable sniper and adept mech pilot who always steps up when the cards are played.Melissa is always throwing back a Budweiser and puffing a cigarette and giving Kurz a hard time. She\'s tough as nails and because she\'s the highest ranked among the three operatives, always leads by example. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and she\'s just one tough cookie! The only complaint I have about Melissa (who I otherwise love) is that she develops a very sudden case of competitiveness with the captain. This seems to come kind of out of nowhere, springing in suddenly one episode with little to indicate it was going to happen. She is the captain\'s polar opposite, so them not getting along perfectly makes sense, but it still hits as a little odd to go from only captain and crewman to prim and proper and loud and proud. It works, it\'s just a bit sudden when it starts.Enjoyment: 8Yeah, I know we\'re getting long again, aren\'t we? I can\'t help but talk about all the things I love, and I hope you guys, if any of you have read this far, can appreciate the passion I try to put into these pieces. So, FMP!, I did enjoy a good deal. I\'ve actually seen season 1 a few different times, have used it as something to watch when I wasn\'t feeling up to keeping up with a new series. It\'s a fun little show with cool action and some really funny and great moments. Being someone who was a gamer in the \'90\'s I nearly fell out of my chair the first time someone pulled out a Jane\'s magazine (they used to make *awesome* flight sims) and swung it around. There\'s several moments like this, some I know that went over my head in regards to weapons and tactics, but still, the overall experience is very satisfying.A note of caution however: watch the series in order if possible. Or at the very least do NOT watch Invisible Victory (the latest season) first. I actually prefer to watch season 1, then The Second Raid then Invisible Victory as they all have the same framework. I watch Fumoffu entirely separately usually after the Second Raid, as it\'s not really a \'mainline\' entry, and deals mainly with only humorous elements and not any heavy plot takes. For example there is a whole episode dedicated to Kurz and a couple other guys trying to peek in on the captain, Melissa, and Kaname in a outdoor hotspring. Sousuke of course uses military grade non-lethal (paintballs, etc) equipment to keep the girls\' virtues intact (well, as much as Melissa\'s can be salvaged at that point) complete with a VERY well placed rubber duck. So yeah, know that Fumoffu is the wacky spinoff, and don\'t start with the latest season, it\'ll mess it all up for ya. That wraps us up, feel free to throw me some love or hate, depending on how much your eyes are bleeding from this essay, I always love hearing from people. As for the great RTLR wall of mecha knife fights, the captain (Tessa) makes an appearance for Mithril and all of FMP! Two thumbs up!', 'Beautiful anime, it has it all!, drama, funny moments, romance, great main characters, mechas and bad ass antagonist, I like the background of Souske Sagara and how it tries to fit in Japanese society meanwhile protecting Chidori, the most beautiful anime girl I have seen, also nice Mechas in story, It fill my senses, very nice, 10!Opening and ending themes are fantastic, I am from Bolivia and I would like it to have been doubled because of Fummoffu is something great, but in japanese you engage with Main character Sagara Souske unique personality and all his struggle to set free from military standars. ', 'Full Metal Panic is a unique blend of serious mecha military drama and high school slice of life the likes of which can only be found in the medium of anime. What other entertainment medium could flip so easily from a story about your entire platoon being wiped out in a horrible desert ops massacre to preparations for the school festival? It\'s actually a kind of black humor the way they treat Sousuke Bousuke as a joke for being so stiff and not understanding how a normal high school boy should act even though the reason he\'s that way is because he\'s only known the...battlefield since he was a child.So the show tries to keep a very light tone despite it\'s potentially heavy subject matter and for the most part manages to do so. It can actually be pretty funny at times. And because it\'s an anime with kids in high school they had to add a love triangle. Not sure how I feel about it, especially since because of some mind melding magic the two girls in the love triangle might end up becoming the same person anyway. It\'ll be like some Children of the Mind type thing.I think this show falls into the category of ""entertaining to watch, but not winning any awards any time soon."" 7/10 battlefield since he was a child.So the show tries to keep a very light tone despite it\'s potentially heavy subject matter and for the most part manages to do so.

That's it.The story is really weak and sometimes you know what is exactly gonna happen. The characters are predictable.... the only thing good here is the relationship of Sousuke and the School (that is REALLY funny and non-sense).But if you expect a great story or a beautiful romance you will not find this here.I will recommend you this anime IF you really like bad developing romances or if you are looking for bad mechas.Even though, MAYBE i see the second season cause I liked Sousuke character. "", ""Let's start on what took my attention in the presentation, the animation in superb, character designs are gorgeous and music is very catchy. Like all Gonzo made anime, the visuals are very outstanding but what lack is the story because there are holes left in the story and unless there will be a sequel I can forgive them (well there is a sequel so its understandable). As a mecha show like Gundam this has less action but has comedy to make up for it. In the funny scenes you will always find Souske trying to protect Chidori by all means possible its really hilarious its...really hard not to laugh. In the action scenes, it is well animated and you'll find it top notch.The characters in this series has excellent chemistry they really suit each other and that fact makes the plot holes forgivable. The love team of Souske and Chidori are one of my favorites in anime. Their relationship to one another is like on and off but that what makes their relationship interesting.The opening song Tomorrow and the ending song Kirenai Hana by Mikuni Shimokawa is very catchy and it suits the series very well. The bgm is also nice because they fit in every scene they were put especially in the ones use during fighting scenes.Really, there are some unanswered questions left and that left me unsatisfied. The questions like what are the purpose of Whispers? How does the black technology work? Is Gauron really dead? etc. There are so many questions that I can't write them here.By the way, this anime is base from a light novel written by Gatoh Shoji. The studio that brought this to life is Gonzo(Vandread, Gate Keepers, Chrono Crusade) and is directed by Koichi Chigira.Thank goodness this has a sequel and that will fill the Souske and Chidori emptiness in me. Well this anime sure isn't perfect but that's forgiven because I like the characters and visuals so I give this show a 4/5 stars not bad for a Gonzo anime. really hard not to laugh.

The setting is about as vague as ""somewhere in Russia"" but like much in the show, concise context keeps the scene easy to digest and our focus on what\'s important, that being foreshadowing for later and most importantly establishing our hero.Sousake is presented to us in the same way that his Mech is, he is a machine of war both in ability and personality. He embodies the classic anime trope of ""Strong brooding type"" yet stands rather at odds to it. He may...be ""Military Mad"" and social inept but his history gives him more then adequate reasoning for this. To add to this his skills are top-notch, the show opts to show us this, rather then tell us. Aside from him being both a Sargent at 16 and a so called specialist, the show prefers to show Sousake\'s skills rather then have a character simply explain them and as such, it comes as no surprise that we first meet him pushing the specs of his \'M9 Arm-Slave\' to the limit in a brutal clash against an enemy chopper. After which he proceeds to calmly and efficiently take the \'whispered\' girl and \'toy box\' CD into custody, thought it is worth noting that he does stop long enough to let her know his name, which may seem like a small detail but serves as both an introduction to the character and the first subtle reminder that beneath the professionalism is a human being.The entirety of this opening sequence features plenty of imagery to help convey the scale of the machinery at work. FMP is an example of the \'Real Robot\' genre done right. From the Soviet \'RK\' Armslaves to the Arbalest itself, great effort and detail is given to reminding us that these are machines of war that are not so dis-similar to those of our own world and history. Additionally, unlike many of the Real Robot Genres touted greats, Full Metal Panic takes place in our own world in a sort of alternate reality, which, while adding challenges to keep the Mechs realistic, also acts as a huge boon to the realism overall. After all, out own world is far more realistic, relatable and believable then even the best fictional space colonies, stations and other worlds, can ever hope to be.The first shots of the aforementioned opening sequence establish the scale and power of the attack helicopter, it dwarfs the young women, extenuated by vibrant colours, we get a real sense of how this machine, holds her life in its hands. This image is quickly shattered by a shot of the women next to Sousake\'s M9. Comparatively, the Chopper now seems small and in one shot the sheer size of the M9 becomes immediately apparent, moving from this to the M9 thrashing the helpless helicopter gives us as a viewer a great point of reference for the power of Mech\'s in this story and helps to establish Sousake as a skilled AS pilot, this all with-in the first 5 minutes of the show and utilizing a fairly simplistic fight scene, paving the way the for how the rest of the show would handle many of its action scenes.Of course this being FMP, what follows next is the beginning of the \'Slice of Life\' portions of the show. Putting aside the thoroughly enjoyable antics of the crew of Mitral, Sousake\'s first day at school, much like the fight before it, quickly and entertainingly lays out what we can expect from the school portion of the show. The set up premise is simple: Standard school scenery which Sousake\'s handles in, his own unique brand of military thinking. It\'s not comedy genius or anything but it always comes across as genuine and unforced, as-well as garnering plenty of laughs even on sub-sequent re-watches but maybe more importantly it puts in place a simple, wholesome and gentle school environment in which we can Juxtapose the military elements of the show. What on the surfaces is just a set of gags and skits to pad out runtime, ends up being the very peace that Sousake is, in a way fighting to protect.An ordinary life he missed out on, a chance only given to him due to a target being placed squarely on Miss.Chidori\'s head.Speaking of which - Kaname Chidori takes the role of our female lead, she is strong willed, athletic and intelligent as well as periodically miss-taken for a Tsundere (Her somewhat violent tendency towards Sousake usually being due to him inadvertently over stepping the line, rather then because she\'s struggling with feelings towards him). Kaname\'s head strong personality lends itself to Sousake\'s socially oblivious miss-adventures, with her being often a straight-man to his antics. Like Sousake, much of Kaname\'s character comes from subtle dialogue or her actions, rather then having, for example Kyouko (her best friend) spell it out for us. A simple example of this occurs when she speaks to Takoma (The pilot of the Goliath). After learning of the boy\'s dead parents, she lets slip that her own mother is also dead, or later down the line during Episodes 24 and 25, while on the run from Guaran\'s subordinates after his capture of the submarine, she shows a basic knowledge of evading detection, when she ditches her shoes and socks and takes to checking around corners for her pursers rather then running blindly. In this instant, the show feels no need to have her pursers comment on her evasion, additionally this goes to illustrates how far she has come since some of her earlier kidnappings during the stories run, again without felling the need to shout this fact from the roof-tops.EP7 - Boys Meets Girl;In this rather aptly named episode and those proceeding it, we get a glimpse of the shows bigger goals and a clear idea as too much of what this story is trying to say. The premise is simple, for the first time in the series, the characters school life and the grander story are brought together when our Machiavellian antagonist Guaron, hijacks a plane with our hero\'s school class aboard and takes Kaname hostage. Over the course of the episodes there are a few interesting talking points, Guaran\'s state of mind is on display for the first time proper, with his highly calculated mind orchestrating the events unfolding, and more then enough skill behind his bite to match his bark. As well as his suicidal tendency to take a gamble and drive for self-preservation. Additional information about the whispered, black technology and Mitral are given to us, Sousake\'s cover is, as was rather inevitable, blown wide open. The other members of Mitral are given there opportunity to shine, in particular in the Mech battle between Guaren and Kurts (which is one of my personal favourites), as well as multiple other moments, details for world-building and of course the battle between \'Arbalest\' and \'Venom\' but what I find most interesting about this whole affair is what the whole sequence of events is trying to tell us. As Kaname so quaintly puts it ""Its like something out of one of those old black and white war films""*To me this quote sums up the philosophy of the whole show, Kurts (heavily Injured), Sousake (also injured) and Kaname are surrounded, the reinforcements have already with-drawn, their tired, out-gunned and backed against unfamiliar territory. Just like in those old black and white stories, they know there\'s no way out but the least they can do is go out with a bang, well maybe.While the Arbalest does inevitably save the day, this isn\'t a ""Happily Ever After"" kind-a story. The heroes don\'t get out unscratched, Kaname is hospitalized (Albeit temporarily) and both Sousake and Kurts take quite a beating. In the same way this isn\'t as simple as ""Boys Meets Girl"", they may\'ve been through a near death experience but that doesn\'t mean there now destined to be Wed.Kaname herself makes this the most clear, she may be the one talking about old war films of heroics and valour, but she is also the one who reminds Sousake that there is no glory in dieing at war, no matter how good the cause. LT. Commander Calcaneus\'s character makes this same argument in the ""Goliath"" ark but I believe it comes across far more clearly from Kaname. This is a story about war and all the horrors that come with it and equally a story about Love and all the hardships which that entails. Both facts this episode impressively communicates for which it sticks out to me as one of FMP\'s best written episodes and additionally as one of the best examples, of laying out a shows themes both effectively and entertainingly with-in the anime medium.The Wind That Blows At Home - Now its personal;""The Wind That Blows At Home"" is a three part story/Arc from episodes 15 - through - 17 that changes Full Metal Panic from an, admittedly entertaining, competently written and compelling War Drama mashed together with a Romcom, into a character driven piece about the companionship of war, the reasons for why we fight at war and the horrors of war. This arc takes the themes and story beats hinted at in all the proceeding episodes and expands on them in epic fashion but maybe more importantly then all of this, it makes Sousake and Kaname\'s story personal. Where-as in other stories and indeed the earlier arks of the show, the antagonist is a villain who we Learn has history with our protagonist, an implied past or long-standing rivalry. To the same extent, what drives our hero is often explained, or flash backed to us from his past, with The Wind Blows At Home, Sousake\'s animosity towards Guaren and his feelings of loss over fallen comrades become our own as we the viewers/audience. The faces and names of our heroes lost friends become more then just facts. The history between our antagonists and protagonists becomes our own in preparation for what\'s yet to come, in a way that echoes the Gundam rivalries of Char and Amaro.This is done through what on the surface appears to be the introductions of 5 throw away characters, those of Mitral\'s ""Indian Ocean Special Response Team"". This team is initially abrasive towards Sousake due to his young age, with the exception of second lieutenant Grace Wiseman (known simple as Grey). As the Mission to assassinate Guaren once and for all commences, the team over time come to accept Sousake one by one, only to eventually be killed off in roughly the reverse of the same order they came to like him in.On the surface this may come across as a cop-out, after all, clearly the show wants to up the stakes using a set of character deaths but doesn\'t want to kill off any of our main cast but I think this is a miss-understanding of the purpose of these episodes. Rather, then to simple up the anti for the final arc of the show, \'The Wind That Blows at Home\' is more about understanding Sousake\'s character and motivations, then anything else. As mentioned previous, if the show were to simple take an episode to show us Sousake\'s backstory with Ziaede and Guaren and so on, it would come across the same as the dozens of other shows that use this method of story telling, the issue with this is simple. Sousake would never realistic take the time to properly sit down and recount these events. Sure he might let the odd fact slip, or let people in on the basic details but the Sousake Saghara we know isn\'t talkative and it would go against his character if he did stop to explain all the gory details. As such even at the end of the show, the complete details of what happened are still vague, we know he started fighting at 8, that he\'s lost countless allies and that he\'s been fighting Guaren for upwards of half a decade but that\'s about it.In terms of what we know about him from the shows 24 eps run, there\'s mountains. He takes pride in his job, in being a specialist. He clearly has an interest in Mechs outside of his career, he has a great respect for those above him. He\'s socially inept, he\'s seen as reliable by superiors and allies, and he blames himself. That last point is the key, it\'s not something we learn through flash-backs, technically its only a presumption that Sousake feels responsibility or guilt for the death of his previous comrades, but we know for a fact from what follows, that Sousake feels personally responsible for the deaths of the Indian Ocean SRT, through his actions. He allows that very guilt to cause him to slip up in battle. He\'s distracted at the sub-marine party, and he lashes out at Kaname, seemingly without even realizing it.This form of story telling, where the viewer understands exactly why a character feels the way they do is what makes FMP and its characters so engaging. In other shows, Sousake lashing out at Kaname in the last Act would come across as contrived or forced for the sake of drama to finish out the series but here it comes across as totally understandable. Of Course this type of active story telling may come across as obvious to many but in a medium so full of flash-back story telling and implied emotions, Full Metal Panic comes across as refreshingly forward, despite it\'s age or reputation. Understanding what makes our protagonist tick, despite how on a surface level, unrelatable he is, is greatly enjoyable to watch.Of course this form of story telling also leaks into other aspects of this trio of episodes. Putting aside what it does to Sousake\'s mental state, as an audience we are forced to watch helplessly (Much like Sousake is forced to listen) as Guaren mercilessly murders the characters of Indian Ocean team, one after another, just as we came to route for them. Generic, maybe, but its undoubtedly sad to watch and Grey\'s offer of a place on her team to Sousake from before the battle becomes more and more heart-breaking, as we slowly realize there is no \'going home\' for the team. Once again the minimalistic fight animation becomes an asset as each member of the teams deaths, are laid out in front of us using quick cuts or still impressive visual effects and cinematography (With Grey\'s M9 in particular having been seemingly crucified). The eerie conclusion of Sousake walking away, carrying the nuclear war-head under one arm is haunting, with one sentence hanging over the final scene of episode 17; ""Your mission is to make it out - Sousake.""* as Sousake returns to Kaname with the sober word of ""No Problem""* which in a sense could be interpreted as being addressed to both Kaname and Grey\'s final request.Why all this matters going forward is with Guaron. At first nothing more then a \'bit villain\' from our character\'s past, a somewhat over-dramatic cartoon bad-y, we now know him as a crazed murder and real threat to the health of all our characters. As we move into the final Arc of the show and as Guaron once again becomes a threat for the final time, he does so not as a villain our heroes need to face but as someone who both Sousake and the audience want to see get a through ass-kicking.Engaging Six and Seven - A Welcome Break;Engaging Six and Seven comes as a welcome break from the bleaker story of the previous set of episodes. Overall it does feel somewhat misplaced, while it is appreciated that Mou tells the story rather then Sousake, it feels unnecessary considering how well the show has done at giving characters backstories and driving forces, without the need for flashback episodes.Non-the-less, it does a solid job of conveying the history between Erzu Two, Six and Seven and reminding us of their close bond (Although I still believe this is shown far more effectively in most other episodes involving the iconic trio). Overall the episode serves as a well needed pallet cleanser and is a lot of fun.Guaron - Nothing to Lose;The last section of FMP is quite like its Hijack Arc (EP 4 -7), the final 5 episodes of the show have a lot going on. Sousake as mentioned has to come to terms with his emotions post ""The Wind That Blows at Home"" arc, plot threads are woven together from all over the previous episodes, Kaname is again faced with the reality of who Sousake is. Every character is naturally and logically given their moment in the stage-light. From as little as Lieutenant Commander Kalinin beating the US navy with a single phone call, or Commander Mardukas with his Mega-Phone, all the way to Captain Teletha Testarossa (Who I\'ve written criminally little about in this review), but the most intriguing thing in this Arc to me is Guaron.Guaron initially comes across as a generic anime villain. He\'s a little unhinged and clearly a threat to our main cast but from his Manacle laugh to his almost super-natural ability to come back from the dead, he can, early on come across as little more then a cartoon villain. Unfortunately for our heroes and as already mentioned, after episode 17 this ceases to be the case. Guaron is now a serious threat, his seemingly ""silly"" traits from early on are now unnerving, his smug smile of self-satisfaction is intimidating and his unhinged nature is clearly dangerous to himself and those around him.All this leads to his final battle with Sousake being the anime\'s most entertaining. Like most of the show\'s fights, animation wise, its nothing to write home about but directions wise, its brilliant. The fight is brutal, almost animalistic, as Testa realized, Guaron is highly intelligent and calculating but more impotently he\'s got nothing to lose. He isn\'t trying to survive, He isn\'t in it for the money, or to protect anyone. This makes him an incredibly loose cannon and the fight shows all of this.It starts much like the fight from episode one, showing us/reminding us of the true scale and power of the Armslaves. The holding cables that snap as the mechs stand up shatter the ground where they fall, helicopters are crushed under the sheer weight and the hanger that once seemed massive, is shown as claustrophobic, to the point that the Mecha heads scrap across the ceiling.Sousake\'s rage and anger towards Guaron is palpable as the two Mech clash, clever camera cuts a small details all add to the brutality of the fight, with the damage the Mechs are sustaining being vividly clear. Then there\'s the use of the setting, aside from its initial use to show the scale of our combatants, Guaron makes use of SGT.MGR Mou\'s Mech to Taunt Sousake. The movement of the ship effects the mechs as-well as the flow of the battle and the elevator shaft to the subs launch deck becomes the focal centre point of the battle\'s final act.All this cumulates in the one of the most satisfying victories the medium of anime has to offer, a victory that comes of Sousake\'s Mech skills and Kaname\'s well established powers and one that feels so earned, because we understand what drives Sousake to be so violent and passionate towards Guaron.I believe it\'s also this that makes Sousake\'s sudden outburst of anger such a memorable and beloved moment within anime circles ""Kasime? Kasime?, I\'m not your friend SH*TBAG!""*. This outburst is a verbalized manifestation of Sousake\'s emotions and in a sense, those of the audience.Into the Blue - And Beyond; A True Tale, of Boy Meets Girl;Full Metal Panic is a 2002 anime from studio Gonzo. It\'s the sort of story that people call a ""Cult classic"", it\'s first season in particular is often seen in much the same light as the original season of ""Clanned"" or ""Kannon"" from studio Kyoto Animation, in the sense that its somewhat of a chore. Sure with some good points and merits of its own but as over-all a somewhat poorly animated and badly aged early 2000\'s show, that needs to be watched in order to get to the more exciting ""The second Raid"" but in my opinion, FMP\'s first series is still by far its best.It\'s simplest on a surface level in terms of character, story, direction and animations but its also the series that best captures what I believe Full Metal Panic is all about. FMP isn\'t a Boy meets Girl, and they live happily ever after story, nor is it the sort of story where the heroes all have to die for the greater good. It doesn\'t fall in the generic war story categories but instead strives to strike a balance between the two, in much the same way that it strikes a balance between Sousake and Kanime\'s tranquil, peaceful school life (The things Sousake has to fight to protect) and the story of Mitral, international ""Do-Gooders-For-Higher""*.The subsequent series\'s of the show are choc full of their own merit (This section is spoiler free), the second raid continues on the trend of Kanime becoming more adapted to a life of always looking over her shoulder and to Sousake learning to acknowledge his feeling and more human side, as the two gradually learn from each other. Additionally Fuffumo is a heart-warming and hilarious twelve episodes ""What If"" side story, that in-particular adds a lot to Testa\'s characterization but Season 1 is still the only one that best manages to strike a balance between the two.And while many may still say that this effort to convey the everyday with the action splits the focus and muddies the message, ""Into the Blue\'s"" ending scenes, to me, proves what season 1 is all about through the use of subtlety. Subtlety is an often overlooked facet of anime but for me is one of the main draws of the medium. Weather its the quiet characterization of Neon Genesis Evangelion\'s Rei Ayanami or \'Shuffle\'s\' sub-textual use of clothing, subtlety is a great way to communicate with the audience a more nuanced message then might otherwise of been the case. Case in point is two scenes which have stuck with me from Full Metal Panic the most of all.""He\'s out on patrol, Captain.""- This line accompanies Captain Testa\'s final scene of the show, as already mentioned she\'s a character I could definitely do with going into more detail on and in this moment we see why. A number of her crew are killed during the events of episode 21 -23 and in what should be a star wars-esk victory ceremony, were instead reminded that this was by no means a victory with-out loss. The set piece goes from being a triumphant victory to a sombre reminder that this is a war story with real consequences and this is all communicated not with Testa breaking down into tears or some overly dramatic funeral but instead with the simplicity of that single quote from Commander Mardukas and a tear-jearkingly pained but resilient expression on Testa\'s face.The episode goes on with this subtlety into its final moments, where we see Sousake show Kanime his \'secret fishing spot\'. The importance of this is easily missed but what we are seeing here is Sousake finally opening up to and letting Kaname into his life. It\'s not done with a kiss and most people already know that FMP pioneered the \'pre-marital hand-holding\' meme but instead its communicated with a simple action. It isn\'t flashy or grandiose, there\'s no star-struck confession or orchestral swoon in the music, instead he, of his own violation invites her and she of her own choice, chooses to stay. It\'s a little plain, level headed and down right lovely, which is maybe the best way to describe the entire show as a whole. As the characters fade out and the music strikes in one last time, I cant help myself from always smiling, more-so then when watching almost any other anime, to me it is the ultimate way to end \'the not quite boy meets girl anime\'.AfterwordThere are mountains more that could be said about FMP. In particular I barely glossed over Captain Testa and the other crew members of Mitral. There\'s also a lot more that could be said of the \'Erzu trio\', although I believe that is better saved for a review of the second raid. I also, for the most part skipped over the Goliath arc, as its worthy of an essay in its own right. I hope you enjoyed reading this and maybe found a new viewpoint towards FMP\'s story.Version watched; Dub.* = Quotes may be paraphrased.Apologies for any grammar errors.Thanks for reading. be ""Military Mad"" and social inept but his history gives him more then adequate reasoning for this. To add to this his skills are top-notch, the show opts to show us this, rather then tell us. Aside from him being both a Sargent at 16 and a so called specialist, the show prefers to show Sousake\'s skills rather then have a character simply explain them and as such, it comes as no surprise that we first meet him pushing the specs of his \'M9 Arm-Slave\' to the limit in a brutal clash against an enemy chopper. After which he proceeds to calmly and efficiently take the \'whispered\' girl and \'toy box\' CD into custody, thought it is worth noting that he does stop long enough to let her know his name, which may seem like a small detail but serves as both an introduction to the character and the first subtle reminder that beneath the professionalism is a human being.The entirety of this opening sequence features plenty of imagery to help convey the scale of the machinery at work. FMP is an example of the \'Real Robot\' genre done right. From the Soviet \'RK\' Armslaves to the Arbalest itself, great effort and detail is given to reminding us that these are machines of war that are not so dis-similar to those of our own world and history. Additionally, unlike many of the Real Robot Genres touted greats, Full Metal Panic takes place in our own world in a sort of alternate reality, which, while adding challenges to keep the Mechs realistic, also acts as a huge boon to the realism overall. After all, out own world is far more realistic, relatable and believable then even the best fictional space colonies, stations and other worlds, can ever hope to be.The first shots of the aforementioned opening sequence establish the scale and power of the attack helicopter, it dwarfs the young women, extenuated by vibrant colours, we get a real sense of how this machine, holds her life in its hands. This image is quickly shattered by a shot of the women next to Sousake\'s M9. Comparatively, the Chopper now seems small and in one shot the sheer size of the M9 becomes immediately apparent, moving from this to the M9 thrashing the helpless helicopter gives us as a viewer a great point of reference for the power of Mech\'s in this story and helps to establish Sousake as a skilled AS pilot, this all with-in the first 5 minutes of the show and utilizing a fairly simplistic fight scene, paving the way the for how the rest of the show would handle many of its action scenes.Of course this being FMP, what follows next is the beginning of the \'Slice of Life\' portions of the show. Putting aside the thoroughly enjoyable antics of the crew of Mitral, Sousake\'s first day at school, much like the fight before it, quickly and entertainingly lays out what we can expect from the school portion of the show. The set up premise is simple: Standard school scenery which Sousake\'s handles in, his own unique brand of military thinking. It\'s not comedy genius or anything but it always comes across as genuine and unforced, as-well as garnering plenty of laughs even on sub-sequent re-watches but maybe more importantly it puts in place a simple, wholesome and gentle school environment in which we can Juxtapose the military elements of the show. What on the surfaces is just a set of gags and skits to pad out runtime, ends up being the very peace that Sousake is, in a way fighting to protect.An ordinary life he missed out on, a chance only given to him due to a target being placed squarely on Miss.Chidori\'s head.Speaking of which - Kaname Chidori takes the role of our female lead, she is strong willed, athletic and intelligent as well as periodically miss-taken for a Tsundere (Her somewhat violent tendency towards Sousake usually being due to him inadvertently over stepping the line, rather then because she\'s struggling with feelings towards him). Kaname\'s head strong personality lends itself to Sousake\'s socially oblivious miss-adventures, with her being often a straight-man to his antics. Like Sousake, much of Kaname\'s character comes from subtle dialogue or her actions, rather then having, for example Kyouko (her best friend) spell it out for us. A simple example of this occurs when she speaks to Takoma (The pilot of the Goliath). After learning of the boy\'s dead parents, she lets slip that her own mother is also dead, or later down the line during Episodes 24 and 25, while on the run from Guaran\'s subordinates after his capture of the submarine, she shows a basic knowledge of evading detection, when she ditches her shoes and socks and takes to checking around corners for her pursers rather then running blindly. In this instant, the show feels no need to have her pursers comment on her evasion, additionally this goes to illustrates how far she has come since some of her earlier kidnappings during the stories run, again without felling the need to shout this fact from the roof-tops.EP7 - Boys Meets Girl;In this rather aptly named episode and those proceeding it, we get a glimpse of the shows bigger goals and a clear idea as too much of what this story is trying to say. The premise is simple, for the first time in the series, the characters school life and the grander story are brought together when our Machiavellian antagonist Guaron, hijacks a plane with our hero\'s school class aboard and takes Kaname hostage. Over the course of the episodes there are a few interesting talking points, Guaran\'s state of mind is on display for the first time proper, with his highly calculated mind orchestrating the events unfolding, and more then enough skill behind his bite to match his bark. As well as his suicidal tendency to take a gamble and drive for self-preservation. Additional information about the whispered, black technology and Mitral are given to us, Sousake\'s cover is, as was rather inevitable, blown wide open. The other members of Mitral are given there opportunity to shine, in particular in the Mech battle between Guaren and Kurts (which is one of my personal favourites), as well as multiple other moments, details for world-building and of course the battle between \'Arbalest\' and \'Venom\' but what I find most interesting about this whole affair is what the whole sequence of events is trying to tell us. As Kaname so quaintly puts it ""Its like something out of one of those old black and white war films""*To me this quote sums up the philosophy of the whole show, Kurts (heavily Injured), Sousake (also injured) and Kaname are surrounded, the reinforcements have already with-drawn, their tired, out-gunned and backed against unfamiliar territory. Just like in those old black and white stories, they know there\'s no way out but the least they can do is go out with a bang, well maybe.While the Arbalest does inevitably save the day, this isn\'t a ""Happily Ever After"" kind-a story. The heroes don\'t get out unscratched, Kaname is hospitalized (Albeit temporarily) and both Sousake and Kurts take quite a beating. In the same way this isn\'t as simple as ""Boys Meets Girl"", they may\'ve been through a near death experience but that doesn\'t mean there now destined to be Wed.Kaname herself makes this the most clear, she may be the one talking about old war films of heroics and valour, but she is also the one who reminds Sousake that there is no glory in dieing at war, no matter how good the cause. LT. Commander Calcaneus\'s character makes this same argument in the ""Goliath"" ark but I believe it comes across far more clearly from Kaname. This is a story about war and all the horrors that come with it and equally a story about Love and all the hardships which that entails. Both facts this episode impressively communicates for which it sticks out to me as one of FMP\'s best written episodes and additionally as one of the best examples, of laying out a shows themes both effectively and entertainingly with-in the anime medium.The Wind That Blows At Home - Now its personal;""The Wind That Blows At Home"" is a three part story/Arc from episodes 15 - through - 17 that changes Full Metal Panic from an, admittedly entertaining, competently written and compelling War Drama mashed together with a Romcom, into a character driven piece about the companionship of war, the reasons for why we fight at war and the horrors of war. This arc takes the themes and story beats hinted at in all the proceeding episodes and expands on them in epic fashion but maybe more importantly then all of this, it makes Sousake and Kaname\'s story personal. Where-as in other stories and indeed the earlier arks of the show, the antagonist is a villain who we Learn has history with our protagonist, an implied past or long-standing rivalry. To the same extent, what drives our hero is often explained, or flash backed to us from his past, with The Wind Blows At Home, Sousake\'s animosity towards Guaren and his feelings of loss over fallen comrades become our own as we the viewers/audience. The faces and names of our heroes lost friends become more then just facts. The history between our antagonists and protagonists becomes our own in preparation for what\'s yet to come, in a way that echoes the Gundam rivalries of Char and Amaro.This is done through what on the surface appears to be the introductions of 5 throw away characters, those of Mitral\'s ""Indian Ocean Special Response Team"". This team is initially abrasive towards Sousake due to his young age, with the exception of second lieutenant Grace Wiseman (known simple as Grey). As the Mission to assassinate Guaren once and for all commences, the team over time come to accept Sousake one by one, only to eventually be killed off in roughly the reverse of the same order they came to like him in.On the surface this may come across as a cop-out, after all, clearly the show wants to up the stakes using a set of character deaths but doesn\'t want to kill off any of our main cast but I think this is a miss-understanding of the purpose of these episodes. Rather, then to simple up the anti for the final arc of the show, \'The Wind That Blows at Home\' is more about understanding Sousake\'s character and motivations, then anything else. As mentioned previous, if the show were to simple take an episode to show us Sousake\'s backstory with Ziaede and Guaren and so on, it would come across the same as the dozens of other shows that use this method of story telling, the issue with this is simple. Sousake would never realistic take the time to properly sit down and recount these events. Sure he might let the odd fact slip, or let people in on the basic details but the Sousake Saghara we know isn\'t talkative and it would go against his character if he did stop to explain all the gory details. As such even at the end of the show, the complete details of what happened are still vague, we know he started fighting at 8, that he\'s lost countless allies and that he\'s been fighting Guaren for upwards of half a decade but that\'s about it.In terms of what we know about him from the shows 24 eps run, there\'s mountains. He takes pride in his job, in being a specialist. He clearly has an interest in Mechs outside of his career, he has a great respect for those above him. He\'s socially inept, he\'s seen as reliable by superiors and allies, and he blames himself. That last point is the key, it\'s not something we learn through flash-backs, technically its only a presumption that Sousake feels responsibility or guilt for the death of his previous comrades, but we know for a fact from what follows, that Sousake feels personally responsible for the deaths of the Indian Ocean SRT, through his actions. He allows that very guilt to cause him to slip up in battle. He\'s distracted at the sub-marine party, and he lashes out at Kaname, seemingly without even realizing it.This form of story telling, where the viewer understands exactly why a character feels the way they do is what makes FMP and its characters so engaging. In other shows, Sousake lashing out at Kaname in the last Act would come across as contrived or forced for the sake of drama to finish out the series but here it comes across as totally understandable. Of Course this type of active story telling may come across as obvious to many but in a medium so full of flash-back story telling and implied emotions, Full Metal Panic comes across as refreshingly forward, despite it\'s age or reputation. Understanding what makes our protagonist tick, despite how on a surface level, unrelatable he is, is greatly enjoyable to watch.Of course this form of story telling also leaks into other aspects of this trio of episodes. Putting aside what it does to Sousake\'s mental state, as an audience we are forced to watch helplessly (Much like Sousake is forced to listen) as Guaren mercilessly murders the characters of Indian Ocean team, one after another, just as we came to route for them. Generic, maybe, but its undoubtedly sad to watch and Grey\'s offer of a place on her team to Sousake from before the battle becomes more and more heart-breaking, as we slowly realize there is no \'going home\' for the team. Once again the minimalistic fight animation becomes an asset as each member of the teams deaths, are laid out in front of us using quick cuts or still impressive visual effects and cinematography (With Grey\'s M9 in particular having been seemingly crucified). The eerie conclusion of Sousake walking away, carrying the nuclear war-head under one arm is haunting, with one sentence hanging over the final scene of episode 17; ""Your mission is to make it out - Sousake.""* as Sousake returns to Kaname with the sober word of ""No Problem""* which in a sense could be interpreted as being addressed to both Kaname and Grey\'s final request.Why all this matters going forward is with Guaron. At first nothing more then a \'bit villain\' from our character\'s past, a somewhat over-dramatic cartoon bad-y, we now know him as a crazed murder and real threat to the health of all our characters. As we move into the final Arc of the show and as Guaron once again becomes a threat for the final time, he does so not as a villain our heroes need to face but as someone who both Sousake and the audience want to see get a through ass-kicking.Engaging Six and Seven - A Welcome Break;Engaging Six and Seven comes as a welcome break from the bleaker story of the previous set of episodes. Overall it does feel somewhat misplaced, while it is appreciated that Mou tells the story rather then Sousake, it feels unnecessary considering how well the show has done at giving characters backstories and driving forces, without the need for flashback episodes.Non-the-less, it does a solid job of conveying the history between Erzu Two, Six and Seven and reminding us of their close bond (Although I still believe this is shown far more effectively in most other episodes involving the iconic trio). Overall the episode serves as a well needed pallet cleanser and is a lot of fun.Guaron - Nothing to Lose;The last section of FMP is quite like its Hijack Arc (EP 4 -7), the final 5 episodes of the show have a lot going on. Sousake as mentioned has to come to terms with his emotions post ""The Wind That Blows at Home"" arc, plot threads are woven together from all over the previous episodes, Kaname is again faced with the reality of who Sousake is. Every character is naturally and logically given their moment in the stage-light. From as little as Lieutenant Commander Kalinin beating the US navy with a single phone call, or Commander Mardukas with his Mega-Phone, all the way to Captain Teletha Testarossa (Who I\'ve written criminally little about in this review), but the most intriguing thing in this Arc to me is Guaron.Guaron initially comes across as a generic anime villain. He\'s a little unhinged and clearly a threat to our main cast but from his Manacle laugh to his almost super-natural ability to come back from the dead, he can, early on come across as little more then a cartoon villain. Unfortunately for our heroes and as already mentioned, after episode 17 this ceases to be the case. Guaron is now a serious threat, his seemingly ""silly"" traits from early on are now unnerving, his smug smile of self-satisfaction is intimidating and his unhinged nature is clearly dangerous to himself and those around him.All this leads to his final battle with Sousake being the anime\'s most entertaining. Like most of the show\'s fights, animation wise, its nothing to write home about but directions wise, its brilliant. The fight is brutal, almost animalistic, as Testa realized, Guaron is highly intelligent and calculating but more impotently he\'s got nothing to lose. He isn\'t trying to survive, He isn\'t in it for the money, or to protect anyone. This makes him an incredibly loose cannon and the fight shows all of this.It starts much like the fight from episode one, showing us/reminding us of the true scale and power of the Armslaves. The holding cables that snap as the mechs stand up shatter the ground where they fall, helicopters are crushed under the sheer weight and the hanger that once seemed massive, is shown as claustrophobic, to the point that the Mecha heads scrap across the ceiling.Sousake\'s rage and anger towards Guaron is palpable as the two Mech clash, clever camera cuts a small details all add to the brutality of the fight, with the damage the Mechs are sustaining being vividly clear. Then there\'s the use of the setting, aside from its initial use to show the scale of our combatants, Guaron makes use of SGT.MGR Mou\'s Mech to Taunt Sousake. The movement of the ship effects the mechs as-well as the flow of the battle and the elevator shaft to the subs launch deck becomes the focal centre point of the battle\'s final act.All this cumulates in the one of the most satisfying victories the medium of anime has to offer, a victory that comes of Sousake\'s Mech skills and Kaname\'s well established powers and one that feels so earned, because we understand what drives Sousake to be so violent and passionate towards Guaron.I believe it\'s also this that makes Sousake\'s sudden outburst of anger such a memorable and beloved moment within anime circles ""Kasime? Kasime?, I\'m not your friend SH*TBAG!""*. This outburst is a verbalized manifestation of Sousake\'s emotions and in a sense, those of the audience.Into the Blue - And Beyond; A True Tale, of Boy Meets Girl;Full Metal Panic is a 2002 anime from studio Gonzo.

In a ways Souskue and Chidori\'s dynamic is that of the reverse manic pixie girl scenario only this time Sousuke has this status while Chidori is the only getting thrown into the mess by Sousuke put her in.The only obvious thing about Chidori as a character is that she has something up about her which is central to the plot which has the mecha element embedded into it which has to do with the Lambda Driver and the ""Whispered"" that and the obvious tsundere feelings she has for Sousuke though it isn\'t really focused on as much in this season, more or less Chidori has these feelings for Sousuke but she doesn\'t know what to do with it with this season. With that Sousuke being the aforementioned no common sense to the real world is somewhat justified considering his background as a child solider thus having little to no sense to what the real world expects from him and goes by orders and his own instincts as a soldier. His ""backstory"" as a child soldier is expanded heavily in two arcs as well as the central villain for this season, Gauron voiced by Masahiko Tanaka who pretty much becomes Sousuke\'s biggest hurdle and main rival throughout this season causing major trouble for Sousuke and the crew of Mithril.The thing is, Gauron as a nihilistic major villain LA really didn\'t like him as much as this is considering LA adores such characters similar to Gauron like Nui Harime from Kill la Kill and Junko Enoshima from the Danganronpa series, so what is the difference between them?, well LA found out after much thinking that Nui Harime and Junko Enoshima had the crazy batshit personalities to back up their nihilism, however for Gauron he\'s stock generic towards his nihilistic nature and no personality to back himself up with all this, sure ALL THREE characters doesn\'t give a crap besides causing chaos and destruction for the hell of it, but LA much liked these kinds of villains to have their personalities to back it up their nihilism and Gauron just didn\'t have it, it\'s like Kefka without his Dancing Mad.Main character aside, the minor characters were interesting to say the least...well those that moved the plot anyways, from Melissa Mao voiced by Michiko Neya and Kurz Weber voiced by Shinichiro Miki being comrades of Sousuke to the commander of Mithril Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa voiced by Yukana to Shinji Kazama voiced by Mamiko Noto, a school friend Sousuke befriends and having the common interest in military armaments. The minor cast do develop along with Sousuke and Chidori through this anime though considering their minor characters the screentime is justified, BUT with that, LA\'s favourite character was Tessa if only because of the great contrast to Chidori and that she can be VERY badass when she needed to be.Plot-wise, the first season goes in arcs besides the early episodes trying to set the anime in place with all the characters and villains in the process. The arcs also have some fillery breakers episodes focusing on some of the minor cast members and this is justified as they do develop the lackluster minor cast members to some interesting additions to the cast as well as develop Sousuke or Chidori in the process of it, that and it\'s a great breather from all the intense action that took place prior to it all, so the pacing is consistent in this regard. Plot twists arrive and it\'s easy to connect the dots to all this especially revolves around Chidori and the ""Whispered"" ordeal, we don\'t know HOW she has it and it\'s never explained but all things considered it allows Chidori an ordinary civilian to interact with the more militaristic side of the cast much more. Concerning loose plot points, this season didn\'t do too bad and considering there are more seasons LA is expecting it answer any small loose plot points later down the line especially the romance between Sousuke and Chidori that is is in it\'s beleaguered stage from this first season.Ohh and LA know this was a 2002 anime but the fanservice at times were awkward to say the least, from out of nowhere panty shots to non-nudity moments as well as some of the characters being pervy (cept Sosuke unless he unintentionally does it) but nonetheless as somewhat rampant the fanservice is, this is the least of Full Metal Panic!\'s problems and again LA thinks was another way of coping with the rather intense plot arcs Full Metal Panic! gets into.Animation-wise, brought to us by Gonzo, the character designs are expected from the time it was released in of 2002 along with the mech designs with some few PS1-ish style CGI when used but again it was released around the 2000\'s thus LA can give some leeway to the somewhat crappy blatant crappy CGI. Besides the crappy CGI, the animation was just decent and yes even with it\'s CGI, it was expected of the times and the animation in general just reminds LA of the 2000\'s animation style right down to the backgrounding and character designs aesthetics, another words, the animation was good for it\'s time thus ""decent"" to watch through at the very least.As for voice acting wise, well LA was shocked to say the least that Mamiko Noto was crossdressing voices as Shinji as much of a minor character he is but nonetheless that was interesting. Satsuki Yukino was pretty decent as the violent tsundere Chidori and Tomokazu Seki\'s dense strait-laced personality bound well to Sousuke. Nonetheless with all the praise, LA\'s favoruite voice actor easily goes to...and you know it\'s coming...Yukana as Tessa.Full Metal Panic! was an anime LA had out on hold and LA really shouldn\'t of that and LA\'s younger self was a picky little idiot, but LA picked it again after 5 years and LA enjoyed it for the most part though LA had a few problems such as Gauron as a villain to seeing some plot points coming a mile away to it\'s awkwardly rare fanservice sprinkled in, but nonetheless Full Metal Panic! was a good experience, from likable characters, some anime cliches twisted on it\'s head with a military twist and a WHOLE LOT of mecha action, blood and wholesale destruction. LA just hopes it\'s 2nd Season, ""Second Raid"" does flesh out the main cast a bit more especially Chidori, here\'s hoping! was probably one of LA\'s longest unfinished anime at almost FIVE YEARS.Full Metal Panic! for LA can imagine is something of cult classic mecha anime combining both school life and militaristic missions of our main protagonist with little common sense to the real world Sousuke Sagara voiced by Tomokazu Seki trying to protect the rather tsundere Kaname Chidori voiced by Satsuki Yukino and the hijinks and missions they undertake in the process of it. In a ways Souskue and Chidori\'s dynamic is that of the reverse manic pixie girl scenario only this time Sousuke has this status while Chidori is the only getting thrown into the mess by Sousuke put her in.The only obvious thing about Chidori as a character is that she has something up about her which is central to the plot which has the mecha element embedded into it which has to do with the Lambda Driver and the ""Whispered"" that and the obvious tsundere feelings she has for Sousuke though it isn\'t really focused on as much in this season, more or less Chidori has these feelings for Sousuke but she doesn\'t know what to do with it with this season. With that Sousuke being the aforementioned no common sense to the real world is somewhat justified considering his background as a child solider thus having little to no sense to what the real world expects from him and goes by orders and his own instincts as a soldier. His ""backstory"" as a child soldier is expanded heavily in two arcs as well as the central villain for this season, Gauron voiced by Masahiko Tanaka who pretty much becomes Sousuke\'s biggest hurdle and main rival throughout this season causing major trouble for Sousuke and the crew of Mithril.The thing is, Gauron as a nihilistic major villain LA really didn\'t like him as much as this is considering LA adores such characters similar to Gauron like Nui Harime from Kill la Kill and Junko Enoshima from the Danganronpa series, so what is the difference between them?, well LA found out after much thinking that Nui Harime and Junko Enoshima had the crazy batshit personalities to back up their nihilism, however for Gauron he\'s stock generic towards his nihilistic nature and no personality to back himself up with all this, sure ALL THREE characters doesn\'t give a crap besides causing chaos and destruction for the hell of it, but LA much liked these kinds of villains to have their personalities to back it up their nihilism and Gauron just didn\'t have it, it\'s like Kefka without his Dancing Mad.Main character aside, the minor characters were interesting to say the least...well those that moved the plot anyways, from Melissa Mao voiced by Michiko Neya and Kurz Weber voiced by Shinichiro Miki being comrades of Sousuke to the commander of Mithril Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa voiced by Yukana to Shinji Kazama voiced by Mamiko Noto, a school friend Sousuke befriends and having the common interest in military armaments. The minor cast do develop along with Sousuke and Chidori through this anime though considering their minor characters the screentime is justified, BUT with that, LA\'s favourite character was Tessa if only because of the great contrast to Chidori and that she can be VERY badass when she needed to be.Plot-wise, the first season goes in arcs besides the early episodes trying to set the anime in place with all the characters and villains in the process. The arcs also have some fillery breakers episodes focusing on some of the minor cast members and this is justified as they do develop the lackluster minor cast members to some interesting additions to the cast as well as develop Sousuke or Chidori in the process of it, that and it\'s a great breather from all the intense action that took place prior to it all, so the pacing is consistent in this regard. Plot twists arrive and it\'s easy to connect the dots to all this especially revolves around Chidori and the ""Whispered"" ordeal, we don\'t know HOW she has it and it\'s never explained but all things considered it allows Chidori an ordinary civilian to interact with the more militaristic side of the cast much more. Concerning loose plot points, this season didn\'t do too bad and considering there are more seasons LA is expecting it answer any small loose plot points later down the line especially the romance between Sousuke and Chidori that is is in it\'s beleaguered stage from this first season.Ohh and LA know this was a 2002 anime but the fanservice at times were awkward to say the least, from out of nowhere panty shots to non-nudity moments as well as some of the characters being pervy (cept Sosuke unless he unintentionally does it) but nonetheless as somewhat rampant the fanservice is, this is the least of Full Metal Panic!\'s problems and again LA thinks was another way of coping with the rather intense plot arcs Full Metal Panic! gets into.Animation-wise, brought to us by Gonzo, the character designs are expected from the time it was released in of 2002 along with the mech designs with some few PS1-ish style CGI when used but again it was released around the 2000\'s thus LA can give some leeway to the somewhat crappy blatant crappy CGI. Besides the crappy CGI, the animation was just decent and yes even with it\'s CGI, it was expected of the times and the animation in general just reminds LA of the 2000\'s animation style right down to the backgrounding and character designs aesthetics, another words, the animation was good for it\'s time thus ""decent"" to watch through at the very least.As for voice acting wise, well LA was shocked to say the least that Mamiko Noto was crossdressing voices as Shinji as much of a minor character he is but nonetheless that was interesting. Satsuki Yukino was pretty decent as the violent tsundere Chidori and Tomokazu Seki\'s dense strait-laced personality bound well to Sousuke. Nonetheless with all the praise, LA\'s favoruite voice actor easily goes to...and you know it\'s coming...Yukana as Tessa.Full Metal Panic! was an anime LA had out on hold and LA really shouldn\'t of that and LA\'s younger self was a picky little idiot, but LA picked it again after 5 years and LA enjoyed it for the most part though LA had a few problems such as Gauron as a villain to seeing some plot points coming a mile away to it\'s awkwardly rare fanservice sprinkled in, but nonetheless Full Metal Panic! was a good experience, from likable characters, some anime cliches twisted on it\'s head with a military twist and a WHOLE LOT of mecha action, blood and wholesale destruction.

For the longest time I had not been very keen to watch another damn mecha anime. It seemed from 2004-2008 that is all we had to watch was mecha or hair-brained shoujo. However, wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt I had rented my first copy of it and popped it in on a snow day from school.Surprise, surprise I found out that I actually like FMP even if it was mecha. The strategic blend of comedy, drama, and...action worked so well I was impressed. To me the situations and characters did not feel forced or out of place; everyone worked smoothly. Characters make up a good portion of the anime we watch and it is always good to know we have a solid cast to view. Full Metal Panic takes our rather common sense lacking main character Sosuke and places him in the funniest situations. His lack of knowledge on civilian life is what makes up about 87% of the show's comedy.Even with that being said when it comes down to action and drama the show delivers, and boy does it. Right in the beginning of the series we are introduced to one of (my personal favorite) villains, Gauron. He is a no hold back, slimy, double crossing creep but he is such a good villain for Sosuke to play off of. While both thrust into similar situations their thinking could not be more opposite. It is that opposition that truly made them one of my personal favorite hero vs villain duo.Animation for this series is very lively and well done as is again done by Gonzo Digimation. The opening theme Tomorrow by Mikuni Shimokawa is uplifting and nostalgic, and the ending theme is peaceful and melodious.All in all a great series if you want good characters, a solid war story without the boring bits, and lots of good action. action worked so well I was impressed.

I don\'t regret watching it, but it\'s very much a mediocre show.[b]Story[/b]The story framework follows seventeen year old, Sousuke Sagara, and ""Whispered"" candidate Kaname Chidori. ""Whispered"" candidacy is essentially a MacGuffin-- an excuse for Sousuke and Kaname to hang out, while later it\'ll be used to explain/elaborate on the ""deus ex machina"" of the series: the lambda driver. For some reason (it\'s never really explained), only certain people can use the lambda driver. Sousuke is one of them. The main...villain is the other.I\'m not really sure what else to say here. There really isn\'t much of a cohesive plot. It seems that random missions, or ""fate"", just happen to bring Sousuke, Chidori, and the villain together. At first, the Villian is after Chidori. Then he\'s just smuggling cargo. Then he has some sort of suicidal, ""let the world burn"" motivation. It\'s hard to really understand the underlying conflict in this series. He also only appears within three main parts of the series, while the rest is essentially filler, or poor exposition.My main critique of this show is that we never fully understand anyone\'s motivations, or how anything works. Who does the villain work for throughout the series? Are they different people/groups? Where is he getting all his influence/money? What\'s his motivation? What\'s his relationship with Sousuke (this is supposed to be a key factor between their struggle).Who is Sousuke? We learn a little of his past, but not much. We get that he\'s very dutiful and stiff, but why? His struggle is almost more clear at the beginning of the series than the end.Why do Chidori/Tessa like Sousuke? Can it all really be summed up to, ""There\'s just something about him""?Who is Kalinin? What\'s his relationship with Sousuke? They never flesh this relationship out.These relationships are written as if they drive the plot, but they are never fleshed out, and we never fully understand them. It\'s all very flat.5/10[b]Art[/b]The art\'s fairly good. It\'s a bit inconsistent. Sometimes an action scene/character interaction is extremely fluid and dazzling. At other times, it\'s blurry, vague and simple. Overall, it\'s OK.7/10[B]Sound[/b]I actually like the music of the series. Nothing amazing, but the light themes were light and quirky, and the action music was thrilling but not distracting.8/10[b] Character [/b]As I said before, the characters are written as if they\'re the ones driving the plot, but we never really get to know any of them. Chidori is just the popular girl at school. Sousuke is just a life-long, dutiful soldier. Kalinin is the father figure. Mao is a spunky female soldier. Weber is a laid-back foil to Sousuke. And other than his relation to Sousuke, we never learn anything about Zaied, who was supposed to have such a profound influence on our main protagonist.The only character I really liked was Tessa, the captain of the submarine that Sousuke is stationed on. She\'s a soldier, so she is just as dutiful as Sousuke. She\'s also quite talented, for semi-secret reasons. But there are many episodes that brush over her worries, sense of humor, jealousy and compassion. If only all the other characters were as well layered as she is.5/10[B] Enjoyment [/b]The characters are pretty much flat tropes, but they\'re still fun. For the most part, the filler episodes are silly, and the humor is actually pretty good. There\'s lots of fan-service, but I enjoyed it\'s tongue-in-cheek nature (mostly). It almost seemed as if the filler episodes were really at the heart of the show instead of the main conflict, which felt like an excuse to keep airing.6/10[b] Overall [/b]All in all, the characters are flat but enjoyable. No deep, rich themes. No complex, interesting characters or relationships. But the humor is good and the story/characters are simple. If you want to something easy to digest, this anime would be the perfect amount of simple, yet suspenseful.6/10 villain is the other.I\'m not really sure what else to say here.

The coupling of these two genres was very successful because it gave the light heartedness of school life with the seriousness and politics of mecha. Surprisingly the darkness and comedy made a very elegant contrast.  I really liked how the action always had a purpose rather than some anime were there is a 5 episode long battle scene that isn't really all that important in the scheme of things.Art: 8I thought the art was very good because it had...it's own style but wasn't pretentious. And for an anime released in 2002 it definitely had superior art than others in that time frame.Sound:7I'm writing this for the english dubbed version and while I really liked the voice actor that played sousuke I wasn't really impressed with kaname's voice actress every now and again her voice simply didn't sound sincere. The supporting actors all had varying degrees of success from okay to very good. The accompanying music was okay.Characters: 9I really loved all the characters in this anime. They all had their funny and heartbreaking moments and none of them were the conventional shounen characters. Rather than being the testosterone filled, save the world hero Sousuke is a serious in control person who comically fails at functioning in a society where you can't use weapons against other people. Kaname isn't the typical damsel in distress. Though she lacks formal training she always tries and even succeeds in helping herself. All the characters had faults that made them even more endearing. Frankly I have trouble describing the characters in the correct light but rest assured they are the type you become quickly attached to.Enjoyment: 10Nothing in this anime is perfect but something about  it stands out and just makes it plain enjoyable and fun. It's the type of series you watch in a day because its just hard to stop watching.Overall: 9Theres just something endearing about this anime that makes it great. The stories and the characters are fun yet thought provoking you will laugh one moment and then be deep in thought the next.

It was really a stunner then. I got my hands on a really high quality video FMP and it was really eye candy for me. Loved the first two episodes as well. Laughed my head off real bad. I think it's equivalent to any good comedy (considering FMP is not really comedy).Well I just finished the series recently and I thought I'd do a write-up on FMP. I think overall it's a pretty good series. The whole package wasn't half as good as the beginning 2 episodes though.Story 7. The story's...military-related. I could relate really well with it since I'm in the army currently. The story was pretty well drawn out but not very exceptional in my opinion. There's a good mix of suggestive romance, war (not exactly war but it's a war setting), school-life, comedy, mecha?.Art 9. The artwork is pretty unique, not overly cute (thumbs up for me), and the characters look mature. The colours used are very bright and vibrant, it'd be really nice if you had a really high quality version of FMP e.g. the dvd, and play it on a CRT or good LCD panel.Sound 7. Honestly I can't really remember the OST of FMP. But I guess if I didn't notice it too well, it's not that impressive. I remembered it was pretty nice though. The opening and ending were quite nice.Character 8. I liked most of the characters in FMP. Quite likable. And it's rare that I'd come to like the protagonist. I didn't really like the main girl's attitude that much. FMP has a full array of characters and it was built well. Most characters have ranks so it's quite interesting (if you know about these things). The main characters are too powerful though lol.Enjoyment 7. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. It's bad to bring expectations when you're watching anime imo. Unless it's really that good. If only the standard of the first few episodes dragged on till the end, it may just end up as one of my favourites.Overall 7. I'd give like a 7.8 if they allowed decimal points. 7 is a bit unfair for FMP I find. It's a quality production, just whether you like it or not. military-related.

However, what comes out of this attempt is a decent anime that, while perhaps revolutionary during its time, has not aged gracefully.The story of Full Metal Panic, as stated earlier, tries to combine both Drama at highschool and intense military and mecha action. However, what causes its down fall is not falling at one side or the other but the mediocrity of both aspects. The entire set up of the situation, the heroine's 'Whispered' candidate status, serves as an excuse for this story. While there are a...few moments of comedy gold and intense showdowns, the series as a whole does not do anything particularly well. The actions scenes are okay, the dialogue between classmates is basically filler and overall, it lacks focus. The ending, while nice, is preceded by one of the weirdest final boss fights I've ever scene, making me do a double take before saying good bye to this series.STORY 7/10The art shows its age with no real CGI to speak of. The style also seems a tad generic. The designs themselves are not bad (well, at least not the characters. The mechs are a different story) its just how they are drawn. They show emotions and are quite dynamic, but a certain stiffness to the animation can be felt.ART 7/10The catchy opening was a welcome addition to the OST, but everything else did not seem up to snuff. The voice acting was quite well done, with characters capturing their roles perfectly.SOUND 8/10The characters of this series had the potential to be something great, but most of them get little development. Sousuke, the hero, is a mercenary with a blood stained past. He reminds me of Setsuna of Gundam 00, except he is much more likable due to his going to extreme lengths to protect Chidori. He provides nice comic relief, more so than his one trick pony pal Kurz, who is the typical girl-chasing best friend. Testarossa, the commander of their group, may seem like a naive girl at times, but her sincere nature and deep thinking make her one of the more well rounded of the characters. There's also Mao, another of Sousuke's friends, but she does not see as much spot light as the other females.As far as Chidori goes, she is a defining feature of this series. She represents the end product of the show: a highschool drama with mecha elements. Her involvement in the military side of the plot feels shoehorned in, especially during the instances where she becomes a damsel in distress. She herself is a typical tsundere-esque girl. On numerous occasions, she tries to show depth, only to fall flat. She holds an important military secret, but her 'secret' is about as original as Obama's Fried Chicken in China. Overall, like the anime itself, she's full of pointless drama and while she's initially appealing, not a lot of thought went into crafting a unique experience.There's also the main villan, Gauron, and I'll just say this: Ali-Al-Saachez takes a lot of cues from this guy.CHARACTERS: 7/10While I was watching FMP, I did enjoy it. It was a nice romp, but looking back, I just can't help but think of its flaws. Its cliche devices and the characters of Chidori and Kurz really brought it down. Sadly, the rest of the cast, while good, were not enough to carry the aging animations and lukewarm soundtrack.ENJOYMENT: 7/10Its a shame that FMP did not live up to the hype around it in my anime community. I must say though that while it mirrors the more recent Gundam 00, it does what 00 did, but with a lot more consistency.OVERALL: 7/10 few moments of comedy gold and intense showdowns, the series as a whole does not do anything particularly well.

Back when i first started my anime journey, this was one of the first Mecha related anime`s that i watched. It was not because i had heard anything about it, but because i fell in love with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, which is an anime that you can fully enjoy without watching this one. Nevertheless you will have a stronger love for the characters, and get an even better enjoyment out of it, by wathcing this one first. That is also...why i give this anime 7/10 now, with a medium rewatch value, compared to my old 9/10 score.For me the first season is the weakest. It have some holes, here and there, were Sousuke manages to do think, they should not be able to do. Get in positions that does not make sense in the story. Still it have a charm to it, with it`s loveable character that is grounded in a very good way. Still it is clear that the anime does not know it`s strong point, which is its characters. The story itself is pretty mediocre, and i find myself wishing for some more slice of life/ school like elements, because i just want to enjoy the characters, and see them interact with one another. When it starts to propel itself  through its story, it does not really catch me, even though it should. It is possible that it is because that it is an old anime, and because of that it have a slower pacing compared to todays anime. still i think people should give this a chance, and it will more than pay off when you watch Fumoffu, because that season plays to it`s strenght.Something that really exceeds my expectations, is the art of the anime, especially when it portraits its characters and some of its still frames. It is able to comepete with todays anime(2018) with some of its artwork, and that is very impressive for an anime made in 2002. It will drop in quality when action happense, but that is to be expected and it is the best artwork i have ever seen for an anime that old. And in Fumoffo they up it even more! when i watched it in 2011 i thought it was new, because it was better animated than all the animes released that year, despite being made in 2003.(and that is amazing!) Fumoffo is able to comepete with some of todays anime in the art department, but this one falls short.Still enjoyable, and even if you don`t like mech, it deserves a chance. And if you desite that you can`t watch it, at least watch Fumoffo, because it has no mech in it. why i give this anime 7/10 now, with a medium rewatch value, compared to my old 9/10 score.For me the first season is the weakest. It have some holes, here and there, were Sousuke manages to do think, they should not be able to do. Get in positions that does not make sense in the story. Still it have a charm to it, with it`s loveable character that is grounded in a very good way. Still it is clear that the anime does not know it`s strong point, which is its characters. The story itself is pretty mediocre, and i find myself wishing for some more slice of life/ school like elements, because i just want to enjoy the characters, and see them interact with one another. When it starts to propel itself  through its story, it does not really catch me, even though it should. It is possible that it is because that it is an old anime, and because of that it have a slower pacing compared to todays anime. still i think people should give this a chance, and it will more than pay off when you watch Fumoffu, because that season plays to it`s strenght.Something that really exceeds my expectations, is the art of the anime, especially when it portraits its characters and some of its still frames. It is able to comepete with todays anime(2018) with some of its artwork, and that is very impressive for an anime made in 2002. It will drop in quality when action happense, but that is to be expected and it is the best artwork i have ever seen for an anime that old.

She possesses knowledge about some crazy technology and she herself isn't even aware of it.  And the baddies are after her. This military organization sends souske sagara to protect her. There is where the Comedy comes in. i really liked this idea.  it's a mixture of Mecha action and comedy. But its more serious than funny. even though i found the concept quiet unique, the story overall was mediocreCharacters: 7We get a large cast of characters. We have the 2 MC's Kaname and Souske.seeing souske...being placed in normal day life was quiet humorious. with kaname we have a pretty strong female lead. Than there are the military crew mates and the captain tessa. what i found stupid was, why did they put a 16 years old girl as captain. i don't get it. Then there is the villain. he was charismatoc and enjoyable to watch. What is also a plus is that our MC's get chaaracter development.Art: 7FMP! came out in 2002 and for this the art is pretty good. there was some CGI used and it was okay. The mechafights animation was also not that bad. Thwre was never a moment where the animation got crazy good.everything was kept low.Sound: 5The OST was pretty forgetable OP and ED are mediocre.Enjoyment: 7At first i was at first skeptical but the more i wachted the more i got invested in it. it had mediocre mecha fights. it was more serious than funny and  the main cast and the villain were good.Overall: 6/10 being placed in normal day life was quiet humorious. with kaname we have a pretty strong female lead.

For the first 2-3 episodes it was actually good with all the misunderstanding and accidents that Sagara caused but that\'s it. Is this a school comedy or a serious military action anime? This feels weird saying this since Fullmetal Panic came out first, but it\'s like one big discount version of Code Geass, which actually succeeded in mixing those two genres.The plot is sketchy at best and makes no sense at worst. I think it\'s about people born with information inside them and they call give this information via telepathy but I don\'t know what is those ""Whispered""...people have to do with anything, feels like some fancy way to make a bond between Kaname and Sagara because nothing else fuels their romance. It feels like one of those series where a girl meet a badass guy and falls in love with him like Rurouni Kenshin except it totally fails here. There is also the black technology which I\'m not even sure is seen in the anime, unless it\'s those AT field rip-offs used by the main antagonist. I\'m not even sure if the antagonist has a plan since it\'s all sadism, killing, evil for the lulz, I got a secret cd, I kill my allies and I don\'t care if I die if something expensive explodes at the same time. I don\'t know what he tried to accomplish.The characters are all uni-dimensional and the very little character development feels out of character more than anything. You got the socially retarded military guy that cannot understand why people are angry at him after he tackled them into the ground or groped their boobs by accidents. His unawareness is funny for a little while but then you realize that\'s his entire character. Chidori is your basic tsundere who can\'t understand her feelings and you\'re not even sure if she has any feelings. She\'s also stupid and pretty shallow. Wurt or whatever his name was is a womanizer. Mei is a alcoholic. The captain commander with white hair is a bizarre character with no explanation behind her existence in the anime, she\'s clumsy and poor at military stuff so why is she a commander? Did she inherit the rank from a relative who was foolish enough to use someone inexperienced as his replacement? Who knows, it\'s not explained. Why is her advisor not the commander?Sometime the show likes to introduce some lowkey pedophilic humor about 30+ years old men fantasizing to get kissed by an underage girl or even receive her panties, sometime they introduce mediocre characters to create contrast and make the MC look good. I think if I went on to explain how stupid anything is in this show, I\'d go into spoilers territory so I\'ll stop here. people have to do with anything, feels like some fancy way to make a bond between Kaname and Sagara because nothing else fuels their romance.

Full Metal Panic! came up as a recommendation and I figured I’d really enjoy it, especially given how funny the first couple of episodes were. But as it progressed it got a little muddied as it was balancing two genres and couldn’t find a focus. This review is going to give my first impressions of this show as a whole but I do want the reader to know that it’s a show I want to...watch again in the future now that I know that the initial impression it gives isn’t what you’re going to get.Sousuke Sagara works for a mercenary group known as Mithril who operate out of a giant submarine and have made it their task to save people with a certain ability. These people, called the Whispered, have minds chock full of tech terminology and can also pilot and operate equipment with a certain driver installed.This takes us to Kaname Chidori, a regular Japanese high school girl until Sagara shows up. She slowly learns of him and his pals being part of this military group as a bad guy comes after her hoping to unlock the secrets in her mind.The series starts in a very comedic way, offering us a unique situation with Sagara. He’s a military guy who cannot adapt to civilian life in the least. Becoming a high school student in order to protect Chidori, he gets into all kinds of really funny situations from bringing a gun to school to saving Chidori by holding up a guy on her balcony who just wanted to steal her panties. The high school setting and Chidori’s tsundere character are all familiar but Sagara is that outstanding character that shines as a comedic entity. So I felt that the series was going to follow through as a comedy with a small amount of military action here and there.Around episode four or five the class goes on a trip that leads to the plane being hijacked and Sagara having to save Chidori from the bad guys. This is where the show slows considerably. First of all the action for much of the show is weak and boils down to very shonen-esque. These sequences take far too long and the one or two episode comedy tease between these military-centered episodes are so out of place, yet the best part. Where Full Metal Panic! shines is the unique comedy. The dynamics of Chidori and Sagara work well to set up a romance, the situation works well to create the funny. But the show is so indecisive on what it wants to be that these glimmers of genius are shadowed by the mediocrity.The bad guy Gauron is…well, a bad guy. He wants the Whispered because…well, they’re there. The reasoning behind Gauron being there is pretty shaky. We’re given a small glimpse of why he wants the girls but he’s otherwise there to be the antagonist. It’s one of the biggest problems with the show and especially considering FMP focuses more on the action than the comedy. If I were to be invested in the action, I’d want to be invested in seeing the bad guy get his come-uppance, right? But with Gauron, I could care less.There are four big action arcs in this show, one of which is boring as hell, two of which are eh, and the other is kind of neat. The first two arcs of the show are the eh ones. Much like the bad guy, they’re just there. The third arc, which takes Sagara to his home country, is the weakest one. I was so bored I actually fast forwarded through it. The final action arc is overlong but has some unique action.Did I mention the giant robots? This is one of those shows where I feel like the robots don’t need to exist. Don’t get me wrong, giant robots are always tactically stupid and make little sense in a real world situation, but watching these robots pull puny knives as weapons and start having CQC fights was pretty hilarious.Let’s add to those complaints with a few more concerning the characters. Sagara as a lead is hilariously clueless and entertaining in the school setting. In the military setting he’s rather boring; just another cold, calculating military kid like Lelouche from Code Geass. And the accompanying characters are truthfully no better.Chidori is a tsundere. Pretty cut and paste overall. In situations where she’s opposite Sagara, she can be cute and funny but on her own she’s hopelessly two-dimensional. As I keep saying, if this were a romantic-comedy these two would be perfectly acceptable characters and fun to watch play off each other. But on their own they’re pretty dull.Tessa is worth a mention. She’s the sixteen year old captain of the submarine Mithril operates out of. She’s well-respected by the crew who also seems to see her as fap bait as much as the writers did. A strong female lead she isn’t. An adorable moeblob who acts strong only when the situation calls for it then cries into the arms of Sagara (who she loves, opening a pointless love triangle) when things get tough, she is. Tessa is a girl I only wish had been given a lot better treatment because there are moments toward the end where she seems a genuine badass.Other characters include a womanizing sniper and a female sergeant whose character I can barely discern aside from “drunkard”.Also, how can a show have some of the best animation I’ve seen in early-2000 anime yet some of the most mediocre at the same time?Full Metal Panic! is all over the place and suffers from not having a singular direction. If it had focused on the comedy or the military action instead of jumping back and forth it would have worked. But as it is, it’s a very average piece with a lot of potential. I can only hope that later seasons nail the balancing of elements to leave me with a more satisfying experience. watch again in the future now that I know that the initial impression it gives isn’t what you’re going to get.Sousuke Sagara works for a mercenary group known as Mithril who operate out of a giant submarine and have made it their task to save people with a certain ability.

The anime series was directed by Kouichi Chigira who\'s also directed shows like the Last Exile TV series.The story of Full Metal Panic follows Sousuke Sagara. Spusuke is a 17 year old sargeant within the paramilitary counter-terrorist force, Mithril. One day he and his team recieves a special mission, to enroll in a Japanese high school in order to...protect a girl named Kaname Chidori. She is believed to be what is referred to as a ""whispered"", and there are terrorists who are looking to kidnap her and use her. However, trying to protext Chidori without her knowing proves to be a lot harder than anticipated for Sousuke who has been raised on the battlefield and knows very little about how to act ""normal"".This show has a huge cast of diverse characters, and we\'re not simply locked into the perspective of one character. Sousuke Sagara is one of the shows main characters. He\'s a 17 year old boy who since he was an 8 year old kid has known nothing but the battlefield. Now he\'s a part of Mithril, an organization dedicated to trying to stop terrorists.Chidori Kaname is another of the main characters, and is at first what seems like your average popular high school girl. But there turns out to be more to her. She is also what is referred to as a Whispered, people with a lot of knowledge and the ability to create powerful devices and machinery. However, Chidori herself is not aware that she possesses this power and knowledge.You also have the rest of Sousuke\'s team who joins him for this mission. First you have Kurz Weber who is a flirt and doesn\'t seem like he is serious about anything, but he is actually a very talented sniper. You also have Melissa Mao. She is SRT\'s (Special Response Team) second in command.Lastly you have Teletha Testarossa also referred to as just Tessa. She is the captaion of captain of Mithril\'s TDD-1 submarine, despite only being 16 years of age, due to her being a genius.Visually this show is fine. The character designs are pretty standard early 2002s designs and the backgrounds are fine. The animation in this show has it\'s high\'s and lows, but the longer the shows goes on, the more of a drop in animation quality we start to see. It\'s not like it\'s a poorly animated show or that it looks bad, but it is not consistent.The music in this show was done by Toshihiko Sahashi who has also been responsible for the music to shows like Gunslinger Girl and the original Hunter x Hunter. Sadly the music in this show doesn\'t really stand out at all. It\'s not bad, but it is simply there. It works in the context of a scene, but you\'re probably not gonna come away from this show thinking a whole lot about the music.The first thing that I\'m sure people are gonna react to with this show is that it sounds like a lot of other early 2000s anime. I mean, how many times haven\'t we seen the trope filled high school anime? If you\'ve been watching anime for a while, probably a few more times than you would have wished for. And this show is also guilty of being very much a product of it\'s time. A lot of the tropes that we have gotten used to are also to be found in here. However, what seperates this show from a lot of other shows is how it uses these tropes to it\'s advantage. You might think that this is a show about a weird guy trying to protect a girl and ends up enrolling in high school and hilarity ensues, and while you are not wrong, that\'s only one small portion of the show. You have also got the actual plot of the anime which is about a world of relative unrest, and where the slightest spark can set of a huge war. Also, the characters might seem very simple at first, but most of these characters are more than just their respective tropes, and get fleshed out more over the course of the story. In other words, this show is not trying to seperate itself from others by doing something completely different to what other shows at the tie were doing, but rather by doing a lot of the same things better than most other shows would, and it does succeed... at least to an extent. I would be lying if I said that there aren\'t times where the tropes pull the show down. Things like pointless bath scenes, and certain episodes that adds absolutely nothing to the story are also present in this show. But despite this, most of the episodes are still good and add something to the story, so rather the pointless episodes being a big part of the show, there are only a few of them.So my overall thoughts on this show is that it\'s a good show. Sure, it has it\'s ups and downs, but for the most part it\'s a fairly solid show. I would not recommend this show to anyone though. If you are very tired of early 2000s tropes, then I\'d suggest to stay away from this, at least for now, but if you are not that bothered by them, then go ahead and give this show a chance. It\'s an entertaining watch. Full Metal Panic has also got a sequel, and I will definitely be checking that out at a later date. protect a girl named Kaname Chidori.

Full Metal Panic has also got a sequel, and I will definitely be checking that out at a later date.', 'Story- Full metal panic is a multitude of things all rolled into one show. it is a school, romance, comedy, military, Sci-Fi, mech, action, drama-ish show. the only way all these genres can possible fit into one show is by it\'s premise. where Sagara a young soldier working for a private military is sent to protect Chidori a ""Whispered"" who are people who somehow have vast hidden knowledge inside them, and their knowledge is also the reason to have mechs and other Sci-Fi objects in their world. because of this, they are valuable targets even though it\'s never explained how they became whishered or how...they are able to be located. the first few episodes are pretty much sagara protecting Chidori, and getting into situations because he doesn\'t know how to integrate/blend into civilian life. over that time they grow fond of each other. after that comes the more action-y part of the show named Gauron, as a group of people including the main antagonist of the entire series hi-jack a plane chidori and her class on in order to kidnap her and unleash her inner whispered. the situation ends with a mech battle between the Sagara and Gauron, as Sagara beats him with Lamba drive a machine powered by emotions and Chidori being able to tell the weakness of the enemy. thus the arc ends and Chidori learns that sagara is a soldierall following arc/storylines in the series pretty much follow the same pattern. where a situation arises usually with Gauron pulling the strings or is the antagonist of the arc and usually ends with Sagara winning via the Lamba drive or through Chidori\'s help. in between the arcs are pretty much the slice-of-life part of the story but never serve much of a purpose other than filler with the of the first episodes. when it comes down to how the story is structured and flows it feels rather flimsy as things are contrived for the sake convenience of the story to move somewhere rather than to stagnate in the school setting. the tone shift between the action and the comedy school life feels weak, most of the comedy isn\'t really funny with more misses than hits, and there wasn\'t much of an impact that any of the story lines left on the season as a whole.3/10charactersthe main characters of the show are Sagara a young soldier tasked with guarding Chidori, and getting into mishaps as he fails to integrate into civilian life. and Chidori the class rep in her school as well as a whispered containing special technological knowledge, as well as her having a blunt and tsundere attitude. other characters are the people from mithril namely Mao a soldier that likes drinking, kurtz a try-hard womanizer, testarossa the captain of the submarine that they are stationed on, and many other people on the sub. the main antgonist of the show is Gauron a person who just won\'t stay dead throughout the entire season and some lesser antagonist who are connected to him but are mostly bland and not worth noting. they don\'t really develope much as characters other than Chidori growing fond of each other and meeting the people from mithril. oh, and chidori also has a friend with glasses if that\'s worth noting.4/10art/animation- the art and animation for the show are ok-ish. i\'m not really fond of the character designs in the show. it\'s decent for it\'s time, but feels bland now a days. there is a lot of use of CGI when it comes to machinery mostly for the subs and the helicopters that when shown look very off putting. the mech fights are decent enough, but nothing amazing; same can be said for the regular people fights. a lot of the violence is omitted for a show that has military and mechs where it doesn\'t feel like there is a lot of impact in the fights.6/10sound- the voice acting is par for the course good. Chidori\'s voice does sound a better annoying at first but after a little while sounds pretty good. the soundtrack is ok with a lot of military like themes for the acion parts and generic music for the school life part, with the military soundtrack being the most memorable of the two.6.5/10enjoyment- mostly bored abd hoping the next two season are going to be better than this.4/10overall- the story is a bit bad , the characters are mediocre and underdeveloped,  the animation and sound are ok.4/10\ufeff they are able to be located. the first few episodes are pretty much sagara protecting Chidori, and getting into situations because he doesn\'t know how to integrate/blend into civilian life. over that time they grow fond of each other. after that comes the more action-y part of the show named Gauron, as a group of people including the main antagonist of the entire series hi-jack a plane chidori and her class on in order to kidnap her and unleash her inner whispered. the situation ends with a mech battle between the Sagara and Gauron, as Sagara beats him with Lamba drive a machine powered by emotions and Chidori being able to tell the weakness of the enemy. thus the arc ends and Chidori learns that sagara is a soldierall following arc/storylines in the series pretty much follow the same pattern. where a situation arises usually with Gauron pulling the strings or is the antagonist of the arc and usually ends with Sagara winning via the Lamba drive or through Chidori\'s help. in between the arcs are pretty much the slice-of-life part of the story but never serve much of a purpose other than filler with the of the first episodes. when it comes down to how the story is structured and flows it feels rather flimsy as things are contrived for the sake convenience of the story to move somewhere rather than to stagnate in the school setting. the tone shift between the action and the comedy school life feels weak, most of the comedy isn\'t really funny with more misses than hits, and there wasn\'t much of an impact that any of the story lines left on the season as a whole.3/10charactersthe main characters of the show are Sagara a young soldier tasked with guarding Chidori, and getting into mishaps as he fails to integrate into civilian life. and Chidori the class rep in her school as well as a whispered containing special technological knowledge, as well as her having a blunt and tsundere attitude. other characters are the people from mithril namely Mao a soldier that likes drinking, kurtz a try-hard womanizer, testarossa the captain of the submarine that they are stationed on, and many other people on the sub. the main antgonist of the show is Gauron a person who just won\'t stay dead throughout the entire season and some lesser antagonist who are connected to him but are mostly bland and not worth noting. they don\'t really develope much as characters other than Chidori growing fond of each other and meeting the people from mithril. oh, and chidori also has a friend with glasses if that\'s worth noting.4/10art/animation- the art and animation for the show are ok-ish. i\'m not really fond of the character designs in the show. it\'s decent for it\'s time, but feels bland now a days. there is a lot of use of CGI when it comes to machinery mostly for the subs and the helicopters that when shown look very off putting. the mech fights are decent enough, but nothing amazing; same can be said for the regular people fights. a lot of the violence is omitted for a show that has military and mechs where it doesn\'t feel like there is a lot of impact in the fights.6/10sound- the voice acting is par for the course good.

I am watching this again with its original version.I am not very fond of Mecha series but this one changed my view with this type of genre completely. Of course, when we’re talking about Mechas, it’s always about war which is very interesting and we all know that it is always a sure hit. Though, there is lightness in the storyline, the main plot is very serious and equipped with heavy drama. However, it is not overly done to the point of being far-fetched. Every element...is well-balanced; from the drama to the comedy part to the romance part, everything is well-incorporated with one another so the result is such an interesting and nice story.Even for a typical 24 episodes series, there are a wide range of interesting characters in the story. From civilian to the military; there are quite few that would really make an impression. Kaname is the very cliché “TSUNDERE” heroine that would always get angry at the male protagonist because she won’t admit her real feelings towards him. Well, usually the typical dense guy is always partnered with a tsundere girl because it is no doubt very effective. Though, sometimes she can be really irritating. She always gets mad at Sousuke when the truth is, she just wants him to notice her. And in important times, she would play “hard to get” act or even deny what she feels for Sousuke which extremely irritates me. With that said, she is still pretty much likeable character. Plus, her character is somewhat interesting because of her mysterious abilities. And her relationship with Sagara is still very sweet and cute.About SAGARA SOUSUKEI think Sousuke is one of the rarest and most original male protagonists out there. All he thinks about and knows are things about the military and ironically it is mostly the source for the comical acts in the series. He becomes extremely cute and funny because of his stiffness and seriousness in almost all things. However, this personality and his amazing skills are the reason why he’s very much effective in the military field, though it is also the reason why he’s having a hard time dealing with people outside the military. And after meeting Kaname, little by little he learns different things that are quite new to him particularly when it comes to emotions.Considering it was made around early 2000’s, the animation is not that great compared to the ones of today. However, during those times it was really amazing. I still think it is made well. It is clean and not complicated or to the point of being far-fetched. The Mecha’s are also not made too complicated. Somehow, it is made realistic and believable as much as possible. is well-balanced; from the drama to the comedy part to the romance part, everything is well-incorporated with one another so the result is such an interesting and nice story.Even for a typical 24 episodes series, there are a wide range of interesting characters in the story.

"", 'Full Metal Panic! features two distinct styles in its storytelling. The first is comedic, starting with Sousuke\'s struggles to fit in at school and moving on to other topics. The second is the harsh reality of a Mythril soldier, which includes political intrigue, terrorism, sci-fi weaponry, and mecha action. If these two elements had been better integrated, Full Metal Panic! could have been an award-winning series. However, the two styles never really blend well, and the story progresses in awkward chunks as it switches between them. Although both styles start out strong in their respective sections, it\'s unfortunate that they soon become mediocre. The comedy...stops being funny, and the seriousness is mostly dull, except for a few moments and a reasonably strong finale. As the series comes to a close, I am still unsure about what ""Whispered"" and the ""Lambda Driver"" actually are, leaving many unanswered questions that could have been easily resolved.I really like how diverse and vibrant the cast of characters is, particularly in the dynamic interactions between them. The central focus is on the relationship between Sousuke and Kaname, which ranges from humorous (often due to Sousuke\'s social awkwardness) to more profound as Kaname is introduced to a world she is unfamiliar with. Sousuke\'s connection with the primary antagonist, Gauron, is also intriguing as it delves into Sousuke\'s past, although it could have been further developed. The pairing of the lecherous Kurz and the more serious Mao is another standout aspect. Even Kaname\'s school friends, who contribute little to the plot, possess unique and enjoyable personalities. The only weak link is Captain Tessa, who is the closest thing to an annoying character in the show but still manages to undergo significant character development in the final few episodes.This show also showcases a considerable amount of mecha action. The Arm Slaves are quite plain and military-like, but they do provide a good understanding of the type of combat the show portrays. This also means that when the Arbalest and later the Venom make an appearance, they stand out more, making it easier to follow the action. I find the animation somewhat outdated, but the character design and action sequences are still as impressive now as they were long ago.This was not a terrible series. However, it bothered me how much the show attempts to blend two distinct genres and only manages to strike a decent balance at the outset. The initial comedic episodes are excellent, and the first serious story arc is interesting. However, the comedic episodes that follow tend to fall short, while the serious episodes are mostly uninteresting, except for a few intense action scenes. The series concludes with many unanswered questions, and without a strong cast of characters (and the knowledge of two additional seasons in hindsight), watching all 24 episodes would feel like a chore. While the show has the potential to be great, it never quite reaches its full potential. stops being funny, and the seriousness is mostly dull, except for a few moments and a reasonably strong finale.

It's certainly not the worst but no where near the best. It's a fairly entertaining show but I'd say it's certainly aimed more at the younger anime audience. At times it's just that little bit too ditzy for me & the action scenes just lack something. It's a mecha anime but the parts I enjoyed, didn't involve mecha whatsoever. The non-action, light...hearted side of the story is the high point of the series.From this series and on the strength of the FMP fanbase, I will definately continue watching FUMOFFU & Second Raid but I'm expecting a bit more from each. This series delivered just enough to keep me interested and I have heard that the next two series get better. hearted side of the story is the high point of the series.From this series and on the strength of the FMP fanbase, I will definately continue watching FUMOFFU & Second Raid but I'm expecting a bit more from each.

Maybe it was the pain relief that came with getting a tooth filled. Maybe it was the degree at the end of a long four (or five, or six) years in college. Or maybe it was Full Metal Panic S1, a show that I found so unenjoyable but stuck with entirely because of one character.This show, specifically S1 but the entire franchise in general, is a black sheep for me. I don’t like military shows, mecha shows, or...anything with blood or extra violence. I don’t like shows with predominantly weakly-developed characters, annoying characters, or flat characters. I don’t like shows with wildly varying animation quality, questionable directing, or fanservice. Somehow, Full Metal Panic has all of this, and I’m giving it what’s close to an average rating. If you’ve read any of my other reviews in this franchise or know me personally, it’s no mystery what I’m hinting at. I watch this show for the MC, Sagara Sousuke, alone. Is it hilarious to put up with a show I sincerely dislike just because of a single character? Hard to understand? Cringey, even? Sure. But it’s equally funny, nonsensical and cringey to write a review of an anime only discussing one character, and that’s exactly what I’m about to do.Like many others, I was born on KyoAni works. A few years after starting, I decided I would watch all of them, starting from the beginning – FMP Fumoffu. Being a context-driven person, I decided it would be reasonable to start with watching the first season, released years earlier and directed by Gonzo. What a shock for someone, having seen little beyond slice-of-lifes, to be thrust into a really mediocre military mecha show. Trust me, I wanted to drop it, but the male MC somehow kept me interested. Why? At first glance, Sousuke really isn’t an interesting character. He’s absolutely stereotypical in so many ways. He’s a military kid, orphaned (obviously), raised in war and a mercenary working for a mysterious organization. He has a complete misunderstanding of society and social cues, exacerbated by suddenly being thrust into a high school setting. His character is all focus, all the time, completely ignorant to social propriety for the sake of his mission and his duty. Most of all, Sousuke is apparently extremely flat, showing only this front of his character. Why then, would I be so attracted to such a character, and stick with the show (and franchise) despite its many shortcomings? I’ve got two theories – the first is what I’ll call “suggested development” and the other “admirability.”First, I’d like to look into “suggested development” first, and to do this, I’ll have to take a look at some other means of characterization. One way of developing character is to do so explicitly. This occurs when character traits are either shown or explained directly, meaning that the audience does not need to work out the details on their own. And this, if done correctly, isn’t a bad thing! Lucky Star is an excellent example of this – all of the characters are more or less explicitly developed. Rarely does one have to sit and deeply weight how a scene impacts each individual player’s characterization, instead, it’s obvious from the beginning. Another way of characterization is implicit. Character traits are suggested, but not directly stated, and are not always obvious from the beginning. In this way, implicit character development takes more skill from the producer and more effort from the audience. Very good producers can also use implicit character development as a means of dramatic tension, where the audience is left questioning whether their interpretation of a particular characterization is correct. Serial Experiments Lain is perhaps the best example I have of implicit characterization, with regards to its titular character.Where does Full Metal Panic fall on the characterization spectrum? The answer is actually surprisingly complex. At first glance, it may seem obvious that explicit characterization dominates. From the first few episodes, it’s no mystery that Sousuke exhibits traits such as social ineptitude, commitment to duty, and a worst-case-scenario outlook on life. That’s obvious, and I’m not debating it. However, I also feel that implicit characterization plays a small and subtle role. However, due to the extreme prevalence of the explicit method, the implicit method is much more difficult to distinguish, and that’s why I call it “suggested development.” Some examples: Sousuke demonstrates apparent inability to recognize social cues due to ignorance, being raised in and around war. True, but the second thoughts he sometimes exhibits seem to suggest that this social ineptitude is bolstered as much by personal choice as it is by ignorance. Another: Sousuke’s commitment to his job and his mission drives his incredible preparedness. True, but his interpersonal relationships almost suggest that he is subconsciously driven by loyalty rather than blind duty. Again, these suggestions are subtle. They lie beneath the surface and are absolutely up for debate. But they, for some reason, made me deeply interested in the character of an otherwise-flat character. If Sousuke is somehow hides a modicum of implicit characterization, could it also be possible that he hides a bit of roundness in his flat character?The second theory is that of “admirability.” I think that while not necessary to create a good story, many excellent piece of media involve a character that is somehow admirable in one way or another. And I’m not merely talking about a surface-level impressiveness that makes you say “wow” at huge explosions, but a deeper sense of appreciation that actually influences you as a viewer. Sure, maybe you’ll never train as hard as your favorite Shonen hero, but doesn’t something about their commitment to kicking their nemesis’ butt leave you with a sense of motivation? This ties into a much more complex personal theory that I have regarding the relationship between fiction and reality, but I think it’s obvious that admirable fictional characters can inspire real-world audiences in meaningful ways. And even if you don’t buy that, it seems to me that an admirable fictional character is much easier to root for than one who lacks anything to look up to. For me, Sousuke is that character. I’m never going to spend my life fighting terrorism, but something about his commitment to duty and others is personally inspiring to me and turned the entire watching experience from unbearable to even enjoyable at parts. It was enough that I could overlook my revulsion for the genre and even the other characters while watching the show, and it’s why I’m going to watch S4 if any foolish studio decides to pick it up.Weird review? Sure. Am I greatly overstating Gonzo’s ability to subtly sneak in implicit characterization and admirability? I guarantee you I am. Is all this stemming from a bizarre and somewhat creepy over-obsession with Sagara Sousuke? Maybe. Is this review 1000% reading too much into things?

Majorly turn off. When i watch anime...I place myself in the story. I couldn\'t do that here, the men here were so gosh darn bitches. Taking orders from chicks, getting hit by chicks left and right, and the men apologizing.Un-freaking-believable.

seasonsfrom full metal panic that is made by gonzo to invisible victory that made by xebecThe thing in this series is it doesn't have consistency in terms of seasons in the first season its the combination of rom com and actionthe second  season is just comedyThe 3rd and the 4th is pure action with dark themesThis is makes this series unique and different compare to the anime the time that came outThe premised of this show is the soldier mc known as sosuke sagara was assigned to become a body guard of the young girl chidori kaname...that has a special power and specify as whisperSo the mc go to highschool and protect the fmc to all the danger while learning about how to have common senseSince the mc is so serious to his mission he carry all the military equipment and caused more trouble than convenient to the fmc its hilarious and cheesy at the same timeAs the characters most of them is carcature and hard to get into but the mc is the one standout because of his behaviorAnd i really like how the show was good in terms of transition from comedy to serious so that it wont break the immersionI will break down it by seasons mentioning the ups and downsFirst seasons by by gonzoThe animation its mediocre at best nothing special  in terms of mech fights one of the selling point of the showThe transition from comedy to serious is kinda messyThe op is very catchyThe villain is lame typical bad guy who moves in the shadowsLack of explanation about whispers besides of being known of having telepathy powers and know about some highly advance scientific equations and

entirety.Overview:""Full Metal Panic!"" is a military mech anime with a twist, combining the genre with the painfully plain world of high school, and showing the struggles of an overranked young soldier attempting to fit into such an environment. Much hilarity ensues as a result of this concept but the series is ultimately the sum of its parts, and as a result can be rather lacking in certain areas. However, while far from the smartest series I\'ve seen, I nevertheless consider it to be one worth your time, especially for fans of the mecha genre...who want a series that departs from the norm.Story (7/10):The story is set in an alternate version of Earth, where military organizations employ the use of mechs known as Arm Slaves, and revolves around mysterious human beings known as the Whispered, who somehow have the ability to tap in to mysterious knowledge that many government agencies would love to get their hands on. One such person is Kaname Chidori, though she doesn\'t know it as she\'s otherwise a completely normal high-school student, with nothing unusual about her background at all. Unaware or not, however, the nature of her existence still makes her a target and so a soldier is assigned to watch over her and make sure her and her knowledge don\'t fall into the wrong hands. That soldier is Sousuke Sagara, a 16-year-old sergeant in the secret anti-terrorist private military organization Mithril, who comes to Kaname\'s school disguised as a student. However, it\'s not long before his true purpose and background becomes known to Kaname, and so while he attempts to protect her from those who would try to use her for their own ends, she attempts to help him adapt to the mundane world of school life, the latter of which proves to be just as much of a challenge as the former, if not more so.One thing the story has going for it is that it takes the near-universal anime trope of an improbably aged soldier then both justifies and deconstructs it. Out of the main military cast, two of them are teenagers- Sousuke himself and his submarine captain Teletha ""Tessa"" Testerossa. In Tessa\'s case, she\'s a Whispered like Kaname, but unlike her, she\'s able to tap into her mysterious knowledge at will, which has enabled her to design the very submarine she commands, be a truly excellent tactician, and essentially gives her all that she needs for somebody of her rank. As for Sousuke, well, he\'s basically a walking study of exactly what one would have to sacrifice in order to become such a competent soldier at his age, and how useful and important those skills truly are. Much of the series\' humor stems from Sousuke reacting to typical high school situations with extreme paranoia, often resulting in Kaname scolding him or reigning him in, and an entire season is based around this aspect in the form of ""Full Metal Panic Fumoffu!"", though watching this is entirely optional as it has no bearing on the actual story.Sadly, the story does have a good number of problems. Even though the plot revolves a great deal around the Whispered, to the point that both of the main heroines are them, the series ultimately focuses little on exactly what Whispered are. Sure, we know that they have access to knowledge that shouldn\'t even exist, which allows Tessa to be a captain and Kaname to help Sousuke fight despite otherwise being an ordinary girl, but that\'s all we know about them. At no point do the characters ever sit down to talk about the knowledge Whispered possess or question where it even comes from or why they have access to it, to the point that by the end of ""Invisible Victory"" (the third and latest main season), we\'re still nowhere closer to getting any answers. There\'s also the fact that the story eventually does away with the school life aspect entirely in favour of becoming a straightforward military series, and while this does make for better pacing, it kind of takes away what made the series unique to begin with. As a whole, the story just feels incomplete, which certainly isn\'t helped by the fact that ""Invisible Victory"" ends on a huge cliffhanger that we can\'t guarantee will ever get resolved.Art & Animation (8.5/10):""Full Metal Panic!"" is notable in that it\'s animated by three different studios- Gonzo for the first season, Kyoto Animation for ""Fumoffu"" and ""The Second Raid"" and Xebec for ""Invisible Victory"". As such, the animation quality varies from season to season- the first season is rather average-looking, ""Fumoffu"" and ""The Second Raid"" look much better and ""Invisible Victory"" looks about on par with the latter two, though this is mainly because it aired more than a decade after the rest of the series rather than the studios being as good as each other. Regardless of the studio, however, the characters are all distinct and very well-drawn and the various fight scenes are a joy to watch, especially in later seasons.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Full Metal Panic!""\'s soundtrack really isn\'t anything special, consisting of mostly typical action tracks that tend to just blend into the background than actually enhance what\'s happening on screen. I also didn\'t particularly care for any of the ending themes except ""Invisible Victory""\'s or the opening of ""The Second Raid"", though I loved the openings for the first season and ""Fumoffu"" and quite liked ""Invisible Victory""\'s opening as well. On the other hand, the voice acting is great, with the title of ""best actors"" going to Chris Patton and Vic Mignogna, who provide the voices of Sousuke and Kurz, respectively. However, Luci Chistian\'s Kaname, while good, may take a little bit of getting used to, mainly because it\'s rather odd to hear a Japanese girl speak with a fairly obvious Texan accent.Characters (7.5/10):As usual, I will start with the protagonist of the series, in this case Sousuke, who is also the show\'s best character. As a result of being trained to be a soldier since he was very young, he knows almost all of the ins and outs of warfare, but that\'s just about all he knows. When it comes to civilian life, he is absolutely clueless, to the point that he will constantly miss the point of things, can\'t have a normal conversation to save his life and will respond to even the most basic situations with violence. While he\'s not exactly a jerk (quite the contrary, he\'s rather polite and respectful, as one would expect from a soldier), his obliviousness and insensitivity, particularly towards Kaname\'s feelings, means he can come off as one rather frequently. He can also be rather apathetic, with the only things that really concern him most of the time being completing his missions and protecting Kaname. However, he is a good guy deep down, and while he won\'t hesitate to kill if necessary, he generally prefers to use non-lethal force, which is particularly thankful when he threatens a civilian due to his extreme paranoia. The irony is that he is easily the funniest character in the entire show despite frequently being shown to have no sense of humour. In other words, he is the king of comically serious. However, while his social cluelessness and paranoia are frequently played for laughs, they\'re just as often played for drama, particularly when we learn about the horrific childhood that made him the way he is, and ""The Second Raid"" in particular spends a good bit of time examining that he has no real plans for the future and he\'s been unable to adapt to normal society, which especially becomes a problem as he starts to fall for Kaname, though it takes an awful lot of time for him to realise it. In fact, for most of the series, Sousuke doesn\'t even know what love is, making his obliviousness to the feelings of girls entirely justified. Long story short, while he may seem rather flat at first due to his stoic nature, he\'s actually a very complex and interesting main character, and a total badass to boot.On the surface, Kaname seems like a typical damsel in distress, given that Sousuke\'s mission revolves around protecting her and she gets captured rather frequently by the villains. While this is justified by her being a mostly ordinary girl with no training of any kind, she does manage to break from this role with her Whispered abilities, which enable her to help Sousuke out in combat multiple times, usually by telling him a crucial weakness of the enemy he is facing. As for her personality, she acts like a violent tsundere a lot of the time, frequently hitting Sousuke with a paper fan when he steps out of line or lets his paranoia get the better of him. Despite this, it\'s obvious that she cares for him as early as the first episode, and eventually she becomes wise enough to know that when Sousuke says it\'s not what it looks like, it really isn\'t. Her character doesn\'t revolve solely around Sousuke, however, with one notable trait she has being that she\'s clearly seen too many action movies for her own good. While this does come in handy most of the time, the twist is that she doesn\'t seem to realise she\'s in an action ANIME, and so is blindsided by the more anime-esque tropes of the series e.g. when meeting Tessa for the first time, she doesn\'t believe that she\'s Sousuke\'s captain, believing that submarine captains are always middle-aged men with some kind of facial hair and that Tessa\'s more the type to read off telegrams. Essentially, she can be seen as a surrogate for viewers who often complain about anime protagonists being too young for whatever position they have or just aren\'t too familiar with anime in general. However, Kaname really comes into her own during ""The Second Raid"" and onwards, when she manages to survive several hectic situations by herself through quick thinking and sheer dumb luck. All of this proves to make her a great, well-developed character even if she can be a bit annoying at times.Third in importance is Sousuke\'s aforementioned captain Teletha Testerossa, though pretty much everyone calls her by her nickname Tessa (when they\'re not calling her ""Ma\'am"" or ""Captain"", that is). While most of the time, she seems like an innocent, carefree, and airheaded girl, her status as a Whispered alone makes it clear there is much more to her than that, and she shows several times that she got her position for a very good reason. Not only did she design the submarine she commands, but she\'s also an expert leader and strategist, as well as surprisingly competitive; it\'s noted at one point that whenever someone tells her she can\'t do something, she takes that as a point to prove that she can, which is implied to be due to an inferiority complex she feels towards her brother, who\'s even more intelligent than her and would always one-up her when they were children. However, while she\'s quite adorable most of the time, I ultimately didn\'t like her as much as Sousuke or Kaname. Like Kaname, she has a crush on Sousuke, but unlike Kaname, she seems to have no respect for his personal boundaries and will frequently invade them. She can also get ridiculously jealous at times, and often makes rash decisions based on her jealousy, one of which has consequences that last an entire season, though thankfully she has the sense to recognize when she goes too far and even apologises on occasion, which keeps her from becoming unbearable.Of course, these three are far from the only important characters. Two notable examples are Sosuke\'s squadmates in Mithril- Kurz Weber, a master sniper and resident perverted comic relief, who nevertheless hates to see women cry, and Melissa Mao, Sosuke and Kurz\'s no-nonsense Major who bears a striking resemblance to Evangelion\'s Misato Katsuragi, complete with the same English voice actor. Neither of these two are quite as fleshed out as the main three, but they\'re nevertheless a welcome addition to both the cast and the series. The rest of the Mithril cast consists largely of people who show up every now and again but don\'t do anything particularly significant (or, at least, nothing I can say without giving away serious spoilers). The villains are decent, but you definitely shouldn\'t expect a lot of depth from them, as a lot of them seem to cause chaos with no particularly grand goal in mind. One villain, in particular, just keeps showing up when he\'s supposed to have died, with each instance being increasingly improbable as to how he survived, making you want nothing more than Sousuke to finally kill him for good (though this could very well have been intentional, as Sousuke feels the same way, which for him is a big deal).Enjoyment (7.5/10):""Full Metal Panic!"" is a very entertaining series throughout, with great action scenes and some truly hilarious moments. However, things do get significantly darker and more serious as time goes on, which starts in ""The Second Raid"" and culminates in ""Invisible Victory"", the latter of which can be downright depressing at times, with the comedy of previous seasons being seriously reduced, even if it\'s not completely gone. It\'s because of this very reason that, while watching ""Fumoffu"" isn\'t essential, it is recommended, as it\'s the perfect breather you need before everything goes to hell.Overall:""Full Metal Panic!"" is an anime that\'s easy enough to recommend, but is kept from true greatness by falling short in several areas, with an interesting but unfinished story, entertaining but clichéd villains, variable art and animation and largely forgettable music aside from a few standout tracks. It\'s certainly worth watching, especially if you\'re a fan of action anime, but if you go in with your expectations too high, or just have very high standards in general, then there\'s a good chance you\'ll be disappointed.Score:7+8.5+8.5+7.5+7.5=39/50=7.8/10 who want a series that departs from the norm.Story (7/10):The story is set in an alternate version of Earth, where military organizations employ the use of mechs known as Arm Slaves, and revolves around mysterious human beings known as the Whispered, who somehow have the ability to tap in to mysterious knowledge that many government agencies would love to get their hands on.

The main villain almost always facing off against sagara but for reasons unknown. We never know what are the villians intentions to the very end of the show. His intentions are inconsistent such as with his infiltration of the submarine. He first said he will kidnap Chidori because she is made out to be a person with special abilities but in when he gains control of the ship he just tries to kill himself?Characters are also inconsistent. The greatest example could be made with the supporting character Weber. He is made out to be the comic relief of...the cast but goes out of character during the final last few episodes. His personality is depicted as being a perv but instantly changes to being a white knight for Chidori when Sagara makes her cry.There is no characterization or growth of the main character. Sagara who is a socially inept military nut stays that way through out the entire show. There is no growth to try and connect with others. The only instance we can see any actual growth is when he invites Chidori to the island but is only given the last three minutes of the last episodes to show that Sagara is trying to connect with her. Due to this moment only being given a few minutes we cant tell if is intentions are genuine or if he is just doing it to get Chidori to trust him again which would make his job of protecting her much easier.Character conflict and how it is handled is laughable. There are two main conflicts that the main characters face. In the first instance, Chidori says that she hates Sagara but is resolved by her visiting him and saying sorry which concludes the conflict instantly. The second conflict is when Sagara tells Chidori that she doesnt know him at all. This is also concluded with a sorry from Sagara.Thinking of what genre to put for this series is difficult. You want to put it as action but the movements are very stiff and it feels like a fight between two cardboard boxes. Putting this as a romance is inacurate as we cant even tell what the chemistry is like between Sagara and Chidori since Sagara also had a heated moment with Testarossa or if he is even ok with having a relationship with someone since in the first few episodes he says that having a relationship would cloud judgement. The comedy aspec is there but is only provided by Chidori and Weber. Chidori provides it by giving Sagara a hard time about is social ineptitiy which confuses the audience about when she is actaully angry with Sagara if she is like that 24/7.In the end there is no lesson that the main character learns. He doesnt become anymore socially capable, he doesnt start anything with Chidori, he doesnt become a different person from the affects of the story, he just remains a static character. This would be fine if the actual plot was good but it just feels like playing a side quest. There really is no main goal or challenge for Sagara to overcome plot-wise. the cast but goes out of character during the final last few episodes. His personality is depicted as being a perv but instantly changes to being a white knight for Chidori when Sagara makes her cry.There is no characterization or growth of the main character. Sagara who is a socially inept military nut stays that way through out the entire show. There is no growth to try and connect with others. The only instance we can see any actual growth is when he invites Chidori to the island but is only given the last three minutes of the last episodes to show that Sagara is trying to connect with her. Due to this moment only being given a few minutes we cant tell if is intentions are genuine or if he is just doing it to get Chidori to trust him again which would make his job of protecting her much easier.Character conflict and how it is handled is laughable. There are two main conflicts that the main characters face. In the first instance, Chidori says that she hates Sagara but is resolved by her visiting him and saying sorry which concludes the conflict instantly. The second conflict is when Sagara tells Chidori that she doesnt know him at all. This is also concluded with a sorry from Sagara.Thinking of what genre to put for this series is difficult. You want to put it as action but the movements are very stiff and it feels like a fight between two cardboard boxes. Putting this as a romance is inacurate as we cant even tell what the chemistry is like between Sagara and Chidori since Sagara also had a heated moment with Testarossa or if he is even ok with having a relationship with someone since in the first few episodes he says that having a relationship would cloud judgement. The comedy aspec is there but is only provided by Chidori and Weber. Chidori provides it by giving Sagara a hard time about is social ineptitiy which confuses the audience about when she is actaully angry with Sagara if she is like that 24/7.In the end there is no lesson that the main character learns. He doesnt become anymore socially capable, he doesnt start anything with Chidori, he doesnt become a different person from the affects of the story, he just remains a static character. This would be fine if the actual plot was good but it just feels like playing a side quest. There really is no main goal or challenge for Sagara to overcome plot-wise.']"
Chuuka Ichiban!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/110/Chuuka_Ichiban,"[""**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**First chinese dubbed anime that I just finished watching, so the story's still fresh in my mind. I've seen bits of this anime in our local channel, back then it was already pretty interesting but I haven't been able to catch it always on tv. The plot is very interesting, centering around a 13 year old boy who has a magical touch when it comes to cooking. Like his mom, Mao believes cooking should be used to bring happiness to people, and this is the theme the story revolves in. One can't help but cheer for Mao as he goes through...several tough cooking competitions. Ever watch the Ironchef Master show in Japan? This is the anime version. Man, I can't help but crave dimsums, fried rice, & other chinese food while watching this. What's interesting is that the show offers lots and lots of trivias about food -- I never realized till I watched it that there are lots of food that can actually improves our health! The characters are very well done, all of them are likeable and its more effective since it uses the bad-guy-turned-good-guy style, making us like the other characters that we thought annoying at first. The phasing of the series is great as well -- with each event getting more and more interesting as one watches. The parts I definitely like is the Super Chef competition. The Dark Society of the cooking chefs and the quest for the legendary utensils added that suspense factor, making it not just an ordinary cooking competition. The only thing that lessens the enjoyment a bit is the ending -- I was thinking there must be another chapter to this but its the end, apparently this is the case wherein the audience is left to imagine that Mao's group defeated their enemies, him accepting top chef position and finding all the legendary utensils. Its too bad since if they had just made it a bit longer, the ending would definitely be a happy ever after several tough cooking competitions. Ever watch the Ironchef Master show in Japan?

The Chinese cooking theme is surprisingly interesting, although the cooking style and food appearances are a little over exaggerated to me, but I still like it. ', 'I remembered when I was a kid, I\'ve watched like 2-5 episodes of this on TV and thought that I want to Completely watch it. My first impression of it was something like making Yakitate Japan into a cooking anime set in 19th century China. Watching it completely right now, I saw that this was really an enjoyable series. The story was alright (though they say the manga was better), It was not predictable(unlike other shounen anime were you already know how the MC will win),it also made good cliffhangers and twists which was truly unexpected, and the animation is good for an 80\'s show....I think I can\'t say anything bad about the show except that they should have made Liu Mao Shing more older. I know the show is titled Cooking Master ""BOY"" but come on I don\'t think a 13 year old boy would have fell in love or travelled all over China. I think they should\'ve made himolder like 15. But other than that, it was ton of fun watching this and I hope you do as well. I think I can\'t say anything bad about the show except that they should have made Liu Mao Shing more older.

But other than that, it was ton of fun watching this and I hope you do as well.', 'My feelings for this anime are quite complicated so I just had to write a review for this series.I will focus on two things about this series that I feel are most prominent and want to talk about, the characters, structure and the story arcs and their internal structure.But first I will quickly breeze through all the points that don\'t really matter:Story: The story of Cooking Master Boy is exactly what one would expect for a shounen of this ilk. Defeat comically evil opponents in cooking battles and make friends.Art: Totally average and passable for it\'s time, and still looks nice enough.Music:...What music? Oh right, yeah I guess there\'s some playing in the back every now and then.******************************************************************************************* Slight spoilers ahead but if you\'ve ever seen a shounen before you\'ll be fine. ********************************************************************************************And now, characters.I will focus on the main 3 individually and the rest in one go.The protagonist, Liu Mao Xing:Our protagonist for this adventure is a 13 year old boy whose mother was one of the greatest and most renowned chefs in China. At the beginning of the series an evil villain comes to take over his mothers restaurant but out the kitchen steps up Liu Mao Xing, never having cooked before apparently he takes on the villain to the horror of his fellow restaurant workers and wins, after which he sets out to an adventure to become a great chef.The girl, Mei Li:Mei Li is the series main heroine whose only, and I\'m not exaggerating here, purpose is to constantly question everything the Protagonist and others around do. She is supposedly a chef, a daughter of the head chef of the best restaurant in Canton no less; however, that is never shown to be the case, for all the viewer knows she may not be able to cook at all. During the series she tags along the protagonist and questions the methods to his madness, and despite witnessing his continuous, unbroken streak of success, she never gives thought to the idea that maybe the Protagonist knows what he\'s doing.I cannot for the life of me understand why she is there. Shounen series usually have a female character tagging along as either one the female viewers can relate to in order to pull in a bit of that crowd, or as the male viewers to swoon over. But Mei Li is so useless, incompetent and irritating I can\'t imagine any girl wanting to be her, or any boy wanting to be with her. She has no character or development there of.The Loudmouth, Zhi Lou (Shilou):During the first arc they introduce what is possibly my favorite character of the series, we have a lot of characterization for him, backstory and character development, and logically we believe to typical shounen fashion this\'ll be our secondary main character of the series. He is not. Instead he just leaves at after all we been through with him and much later at the beginning of the second arc, over 15 episodes later, we are introduced to Zhi Lou. Zhi Lou has nothing to him but that he\'s a loud and incompetent chef (at least we know he can cook something, unlike Mei Li) that just tags along against anyone\'s wishes. For the rest of the show he causes trouble by not thinking before speaking or doing something stupid.And now, the good characters:Chouyu & Ruoh: These are the two mentor Characters to Mao. Mei Li\'s father and the Vice chef of the greatest restaurant in Canton, Chouyu and the Master Chef of that same restaurant, Ruoh. However, despite them being said to be far superior to Mao, whenever they ought to cook, something happens which puts Mao in the spotlight, never truly showing us how or why they\'re better than Mao.Xi Er (Shell) & Li Wen (Leon): These two characters are villains who challenge Mao somewhere during the second arc, but turn out allies and join him and the two incompetent sidekicks for the last arc\'s adventure. These two are by far the best characters of the series, they get the most character development, are shown to be excellent chefs and during the last arc duke it out with villains getting more screen time than even Mao it feels like. They\'re also adults who behave as such.Sanche: Sanche is the character I talked about in Shi Lou\'s section, and despite him leaving during the first arc he makes a return during the last arc and proves himself as an excellent character that should\'ve been the sidekick of the series instead of Zhi Lou.************************************************************************** Major Spoilers ahead for the 3 upcoming arc segments ****************************************************************************Next I want to talk about the three main arcs of this series, these are the original reason I had to write this review, because it\'s just something else. I do try to be brief though so I may not convey the full scope of these arcs and why they\'re so odd.Arc 1: episodes 1-14These 14 episodes are so incredibly fast paced, I\'ve never seen a series breeze through this much content in just 14 episodes. Hell, a lesser series would\'ve made this arc last the whole 52 episodes of the series allotted run time. So I\'ll breeze thorough this segment as fast as the series does.We get introduced to our main character who is said to never have cooked before, after which he defeats a villain trying to take over the restaurant his deceased mother possessed, after which the admiral of the imperial kitchen is so impressed with his talent he sends him out to study in the best restaurant of Canton, Yonsen Suka. Once he gets to the restaurant he is shown to fail to cook a worthy meal and banished from it, afterwards he finds out the problem, get\'s the meal done and is congratulated buy the restaurant owners and given a job there. After overcoming this small bump they immediately send him to a tournament to get the title of a Super Chef, a title only a select few of the greatest chefs in China posses. He wins, the end.Now one of the greatest chefs in China one would think the series may end, where is there to go? Well an adventure of course.Arc 2: episodes 15-33these 19 episodes consist of the worst arc, in my opinion, of Chuuka Ichiban!During the first 6 episodes Mao goes on a journey across China, we are shown 6 episodic episodes where he arrives in a new town and out-cooks some bad guy, this is also where he meets Zhi Lou. After these he is back in Canton again and back to the Yonsen Suka, where we see the rest of the arc play out in few episode long cook-offs where Mao defeats a bad guy. Of these bad guys two of them are the previously mention Shell and Leon.The last bout of the arc is against Leon, where Mao acquires a legendary knife, which turns out to be one of 8, and now it\'s time to go across China again in search of these treasures before the COOKING UNDERWORLD can get them first, which is a conglomerate of super evil cartoon villains that want to take over the world. Because that\'s what a cooking show needed.At the end of the last episode of this arc they tease that Mei Li and Zhi Lou would leave the gang and be replaced by Shell and Leon, however this is shown to be but a sad Sike in THE MOST BAFFLING scene I have ever seen, period. I have no idea what the idea behind it was but I think it might just be a sceneworth watching the whole damn series for, it is unbelievable, absolutely unfathomably confusing. I simply don\'t have the words to explain my utter bewilderment.Arc 3: episodes 34-52As if the pacing of this show couldn\'t be confusing enough with the speed of sound of the first arc, and the episodic shenanigans of second. This third and last arc is quite the opposite of the first. This is actually my favorite part of the whole series and I watched these 19 episodes in one sitting raising the score of the show from what I had as 5 to the 7 it is now.The first 12 episodes of this series are one single cooking match against the underworld for the second legendary cookware similar to the Super Chef exam of the first arc which only takes a few episodes. The remaining 7 episodes cover  quite a few things in the vein of the second arc but these events despite somewhat episodic are much more fun than the events of the second arc.And so the series ends, there is no real conclusion they only acquire 3 of the legendary cookware but whatever, I had fun.EXCEPT THAT IN 2019 THEY ANNOUNCED A SEQUEL SERIES, 21 YEARS LATER THIS SHOW MOST PEOPLE HAVEN\'T EVEN HEARD OF WILL CONTINUE.- edit: The new series is a remake, not a sequel, so it\'s redundant if you\'ve seen this, additionally it doesn\'t cover the first 20 episodes, so it\'s not even a proper place to start for those who haven\'t seen this one or read the manga.********************************************* END OF SPOILERS ***********************************************To end, a few addenda.- This series is very non sexual overall but there are a couple ass shots that are just not very sexy at all.- Despite generally decent animation work for it\'s time there are a few odd continuation errors that are just subtle enough to miss.- For whatever reason of all the vile and horrible villains of the series, it\'s always the female villains that are the most disgustingly evil.- This series uses flashy non-diegetic effects to accentuate the food but sometimes the characters react to them as if they were all real and there.The end, whoever read this far is a madman, who even cares about this show? Why did I write this for 2 hours? Fuck... 2 hours? what\'s wrong with me?Watch ""Yakitate! Japan"" instead, it\'s essentially the same show but about bread and better in every single way possible.Go home it\'s over. What music?

The premise is quite simple: the protagonist Liu Mao Xing explores China's culinary landscape, while making friends and battling other chefs, in order to become a legendary chef himself. I didn't remember too much from the show, but I did remember having a lot of fun and learning about food at the same time (entertaining and educational - who'd have thought?) The simple premise, humor and intense cooking scenes were enough to keep me hooked back then.I revisited the show about a year ago, mainly...due to nostalgia. Although the animation and sound don't hold up to today's standards anymore, I still felt the same degree of excitement I did 10 years ago. The characters are quirky and likeable, the show doesn't take itself too seriously (and neither should you), and there's also LOTS OF FOODPORN. Not only do all of the dishes look scrumptious and amazing, but the show always manages to re-imagine traditional Chinese cuisine in creative and unexpected ways. Being half Chinese, I really appreciated that. (If you're interested in Chinese cuisine in any shape, way or form, I would also recommend this show - it's certainly more entertaining than a documentary)Verdict: this is the kind of show you can watch sporadically, when you're looking for some light-hearted entertainment that'll make you hungry (you have been warned). The show doesn't place too much emphasis on an over-arching storyline, so you can jump in and out without feeling guilty. I didn't watch it for the character development or compelling plot, but for the sheer joy of accompanying Mao on his quest to become the very best. due to nostalgia.

Despite it's rather plain subject matter, I give the series high marks for the enjoyment that comes with watching it. Although not a fan at first, I was hooked by the fifth episode and watched faithfully to the end. Although simplistic, the artistry grabs the eye and the sound, although plain, grabs for the heart. I especially enjoyed hearing the dub in Cantonese, as the voice actors were excellent. I would recommend this series to...anyone who likes a good yarn without a lot of dark baggage, and is appropriate for all age groups. anyone who likes a good yarn without a lot of dark baggage, and is appropriate for all age groups."", ""I've only watched the Cantonese dub of this anime when I was a child but the memories of this anime is still fresh in my mind.This is a type of anime which makes a normal profession seem like magic. You will see people chopping food in outrageous fashion, the critics' food reactions are hilarious and down right over the top. That was what made me fall in love with this anime and also attempting to cook like they have although my cutting skills still can't make cabbage fly yet.Plot wise it's like Pokemon to be honest. Main character goes off to venture the country,...meet memorable characters then fight bad guys to a cook off death match. Then main character goes to a gym, in this case it's a cooking competition; wins and then venture some more with more new companions on the way plus more baddies.

The detail on the food was mouth watering, looks nothing like that in reality. Seeing as it's a 52 episodes anime, the animation staff did have to repeat quite a lot of reaction scenes to save money. It's quite annoying at some parts.Sound, well going by the voice actors in the Cantonese-dub, it was outstanding and great fitting voices for the main characters. The bgm is classical traditional Chinese music, which I really enjoyed listening to, however they really do repeat it a lot. The Opening songs and ending songs were not localised in Cantonese, thank god. The songs are fitting for this anime and highly catchy.

The character development the main three under go is amazing, it's like you're watching them mature into young adults, but I think the manga shows more of their development a lot more.Enjoyment. Through out my childhood, this anime stuck with me forever. I watched it with my family and could recall that everyone enjoyed it. I could still to this day remember the food they cooked and I called remember feeling jealous of the critics eating it. The lobster cook off. *drools*Okay I'm salivating now, but overall I didn't give it a perfect 10 because of the animation repetition and how much they cut down on some major plot but also the alternative ending for this anime was just not up to the standards as in the manga.

I think mostly because i watched SnS and the MC is sometimes lose against the adversarybut, this is an old anime and i don't really bother by ita...little bit advice for anybody who want to watch CMB, watch the original 1990s since the remake is kinda feel off for me little bit advice for anybody who want to watch CMB, watch the original 1990s since the remake is kinda feel off for me""]"

However, both of the characters were cabbage, I could never understand how they did not realize that they were in love with each other. If you want to watch this eight-minute art of love, I definitely recommend you to watch it. I envied the characters.Aynusundan daha önce hiç görmemiştum. çok oricinaldu. sanat tasarumu temaya uygundi. karakterlerun iç sesu oldiğından gerçekten derunlukli kişilukleri vardi. Ancak karakterlerun ikisu de lahanaydi birburlerune sevdaluk olduklarini nasil anlamadular hiç anlayamadum. Bu sekiz...dakikaluk sevdaluk sanatinu izlemek istiyorsanuz kesunlikle izleyun derim. Karakterleru kıskandum. dakikaluk sevdaluk sanatinu izlemek istiyorsanuz kesunlikle izleyun derim. Karakterleru kıskandum."", 'I\'ve been a big fan of Sasaki and Miyano since pretty much the early chapters so when the Hirano and Kagiura manga was launched I was there. I was under the impression this anime was going to be a full movie rather than a few minutes of snippets between the two boys however I do think it is something worth watching.Hirano is a character well known to us through the Sasaki and Miyano anime, since he isn\'t just Sasaki\'s close friend but also a loving upperclassman to Miyano. There are a few mentions of Kagiura in the SasaMiya anime, althought we don\'t actually see him...as a character (to my memory he only has one cameo), we hear about him through the other characters. Miyano mentions how Hirano is having his ""BL moments"" with his roommate while the upperclassmen tease him about him.The short is in no way enough to properly introduce the characters and add the depth needed for them to stand out, however it does show us a snippet of their dynamic and how they interact while at the same time it brings forth a new dimension to both Hirano, who up until now existed to be Sasaki\'s close friend and to help him get with Miyano, and Kagiura, who we only knew as a name.Definitely watch this after you watch the Sasaki to Miyano anime, and if you feel up for it read the manga to see even more of what they get up to, as well as more details on their lives (romantically and not). as a character (to my memory he only has one cameo), we hear about him through the other characters.

However, this was just 8 minutes of random snippets of the manga's earlier chapters, not providing an exposition to the series, but rather just advertising for the manga (or potentially, a future adaptation of Hirano and Kagiura).My recommendation for fans of the manga is to not go into this short with high expectations and view it for what it is. As well, to those that have...not read the manga, it is a good read for anyone interested in slow-burn romance! It is as wholesome as Sasaki and Miyano, but I rate this series higher simply because it is less cringe due to the fact that BL manga is no longer a plot point. not read the manga, it is a good read for anyone interested in slow-burn romance!

Fairy Tail: Final Series,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35972/Fairy_Tail__Final_Series,"[""Contains spoilers. Not that anything could sour this anime more than merely watching it, but hey.The vast majority of the western anime community is made up of kids, teenagers, and college kids, and as the medium becomes more and more mainstream, that bell curve keeps centering around lower and lower ages. Many within this community of young people have grown up with anime and can reminisce about shows like Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach which have been influential for as long as they can remember, teenagers on the older side can still remember their own era’s shows like Pokemon or Dragon Ball, and now the...newest generation\xa0of children growing up with anime have faces like My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 to grow up with themselves. I don’t have any of that. I’m seasoned enough for even the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia to loose their effects, since a good ninety percent of anime I can remember watching with few late 90s exceptions the likes of Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop rerunning on TV have been viewed through my eyes as they are now. I can’t ride on nostalgia and fond memories I don’t have, but I can ride on lies.Fairy Tail came and settled into my life of extreme clinical depression and violent self-harming, intently suicidal tendencies in a roller coaster of fashions. Watching something so vapid and kiddish began by simply making me feel even dumber and even lonelier by getting into a show aimed at an audience nearly half my age, but after getting along with my streak of nihilism at the time, it soon became my single favorite show ever made, seriously. Just hearing Natsu and Lucy autistically screaming about the power of friendship ad nauseam was enough to lift my spirits, no matter how hollow those feelings were. No matter how little sense it all made, I truly did come to love Fairy Tail and the cast of characters therein. I’d always rated it lowly as I do currently, but never would I deny how genuinely I adored it despite its countless flaws, lacks, and offenses. No matter how many victories they won without a shred of logic, no matter how many times villainous motivations would break and birth new allies apropos of nothing, and no matter how many times they’d tease a romance only to never make a single iota of progress for hundreds of episodes, I always left the viewing with life in my eyes, because at the end of the day, everyone was a friend and friendship was magic. In my real life, “friendship” stands only as a childish dream my insomnia never permitted me to relish in, but if I remembered the Fairy Tail necklace I was wearing hidden under my formal attire, I could keep going, if only for one more day.During Fairy Tail’s first hiatus, A-1 Pictures had made it crystal clear they would be picking the series back up in 2014, and they did exactly that, but when the next break came in 2016, they gave no indication of it coming back, much to my dismay. I was horrified by the idea of losing this lovable guild of friends who I cared for more than my own family, so when the manga announced its plans to end, and the production committee behind it announced they would fund its final season set to adapt the rest of the manga, I was absolutely overjoyed. After all, I was finally getting to see my friends again. As the Fall 2018 season approached, and they started airing promotional videos, I was kind of taken aback. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I knew how technically bad Fairy Tail was. Be it the terrible animation, overuse of still frames and speed lines, endless off-model character artwork, a totally nonsensical script, infinite plot holes, egregious filler arcs, or the brain numbing pacing, I was always more than willing to say, “Yeah, but I still love it.” That being said, watching these promotional videos was the first time I noticed Fairy Tail was the only show I did this for. Anyone whose seen my profile knows how painstakingly critical I am, and the single bad show I refused to drop was Fairy Tail. Since I refuse to watch low quality anime, the time Fairy Tail was on break was enough time for me to completely forget what it was like to sit through a bad show. I know I’m coming off as sarcastic, but I’m being completely serious. I simply forgot what it was like to watch a poorly produced, poorly written, poorly paced, poorly directed, poorly acted, generically scored show without dropping it nigh instantly, and trying to get back into it was an unforgiving, brutal challenge. I knew I should’ve just left well enough alone and trying to watch the final season would do nothing but expose all my blissfully ignorant yet recently made fond memories…but I did it anyway. Whilst all those happy memories were, indeed, trampled into ruin exactly as I thought they would be, I’ve come to argue the degree to which they were was not entirely my own fault. After all, even after forgetting the feeling of watching a bad show, if Fairy Tail had returned exactly as it was when it left, then all I could really say was touché.And for the zero people still reading, I suppose this is where the “review” actually starts…Fairy Tail: Final Series is unquestionably among the worst pieces of so-called entertainment I’ve ever committed the sin to consume, and I’m going to do my absolute best at selling you on this horrendous reality as fast as possible, because I want to be here doing this just about as much as the corporatized, probably zombified staff wanted to produce it. To start, I’ll acknowledge the elephant in the room: who in the fuck cares? No matter what argument I propose and no matter the eloquence or logic with which I do so, who the hell cares if a shitty series no one respected anyway went from bad to worse? FANS! All the dumbfuck fans, LIKE ME, no matter how stupid we are for already liking a bad show, have the right to be angry when that standard which we’ve grown entitled to gets even worse. And, holy SHIT, did it get worse or what?! The animation went from poor and lacking to outright non-existent. Entire minutes, literal complete minutes were spent just panning over everyone’s face any time the slightest movement was made, any time someone said anything even remotely emotional, and any time the screenwriter knew they couldn’t animate the action and had to instead show people flatly reacting to it. The sound design went from repetitive and boring to straight up inaccurate. Gunshots used the same sound effect as doors closing, and Natsu getting comically slapped by Lucy was the same sound effect used when someone literally slammed into the ground after falling out of the damn sky. It’s a complete and total joke no fan of the series could laugh at. The directing went from stock and amateur to inexcusably dishonest. As mentioned, whenever the budget would run out and they couldn’t animate an impact, they would awkwardly hard-cut to someone else’s still face reacting to it. This was the case with action scenes, obviously, but also in fucking DIALOGUE SCENES! IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO ANIMATE THREE FUCKING FRACTIONS OF AN ALREADY STILL SURROUNDING FRAME FOR SOMEONE’S MOUTH TO OPEN AND CLOSE?!?!?! The pacing went from purposefully slow to drag out the series for as long as possible to breakneck rapid fire speed because now all they wanted to do was finish the damn thing since the cash cow apparently became infertile. Remember the big tease Gray was going to kill Frosh? Got retconned; forget about the Rouge from the future and all the plot lines tied to his actions. Remember how Zeref was a legendary black wizard known even outside of Fiore? Got retconned; apparently he’s so poorly known, he can be the king of an entire foreign nation, merely under a different name, without ANYONE outside the country being aware of this fact. Remember the big bad Emperors of Ishgar who were hyped up to be greater than all the Wizard Saints? Got retconned; they all go down at the same time at the hands of some random guy who's owned barely four minutes later. Remember all the symbolism suggesting Mavis to be the fundamental antithesis of Zeref? Got retconned; not only do they have the EXACT SAME CURSE AND POWERS, but they got them by literally falling in love. I could go on. No effort was expended explaining anything properly or concluding the series in a satisfying manner because all they wanted to do was finally put the last nail in the bloody coffin as soon as livingly possible. Even when the characters were given a few paltry scraps of time to develop, we were treated with bafflingly retarded lines like Precht holding Mavis’ dead, cold, limp, pale, lifeless fucking corpse, looking at it in its closed eyes and asking, “Mavis, are you dead?” Even when the characters were given equally paltry scraps of time to explain the plot and motivations, we were treated with equally retarded lines like Zeref looking at his counsel of nameless lackeys saying, “Humanity must be temporarily exterminated.” Like, seriously?!? The one and only aspect of the series which remained consistent with previous seasons was the music, but that’s only because they wholesale reused the soundtrack. I don’t know why I’m complaining, though, seeing as if they did put in the work to actually recompose anything properly, it probably would’ve been just as awful as the rest. If you wanted a silver lining, I guess I could say there’s a few opening animations which aren’t bad and the show never fully gives up by falling back on CG, but that’s really all I’ve got for you. I’m sorry. Believe me, I wish I had more to offer too.In hindsight, there is a moment from episode twelve which really summed up my experience with Fairy Tail: Final Series in one nice little package. They were saying some dumb shit—I wasn’t really paying attention—and I realized as they were panning across the guild hall the characters just…weren’t drawn. You’ll have to see it to believe it, but they just weren’t drawn. I was looking at a guild hall of greyed out silhouettes. When I really looked closely, shocked, as I couldn’t believe what I was seeing either, I could pick out who was who, I guess. I could make out Gajeel’s Sonic The Hedgehog hairdo and Bickslow’s weird helmet thing. I could make out Elfman’s broad shoulders and Mirajane’s bangs in that quirky little ponytail of her's. But why did I have to? Was it so hard to draw the faces of the people I couldn’t wait to see again? Couldn’t you’ve just grabbed a frame from another scene and reused it as a still image? Hell, couldn’t you’ve just copy and pasted their god damn character models right off file into the scene, again, just as a still image? It’s not like the silhouettes were animated. How many seconds of care would you have to expend to add them this one time for this one unanimated scene? This bleak lack of any semblance of passion or investment will be my last memories of what once was the most beloved series in my small world.Thank you for reading. newest generation\xa0of children growing up with anime have faces like My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 to grow up with themselves.

No, it\'s not My Little Pony I am talking about, but Fairy Tail. This time around our main characters, Rarity and Appleja... oh sorry, I mean Natsu and Gray are hanging out with their little club and every goddamn villain they fight against, joins their ranks because that\'s the way Fairy Tail\'s heart beats. It\'s friendship time!Story:Annoyed by very superficial, core level flaws that are practically self-explanatory? Too bad. How Fairy Tail works is completely different from the norms as it abandons every fuck it could ever give about avoiding such things. Instead,...the story entirely focuses on doing whatever it wants with the best sides it has [No matter how ""bad"" its best is]. Let\'s face it, the more there is content, the more room there is for all sorts of different issues, common tropes, general cliches, character flaws, logical errors that in generally, are hidden in the details in purpose of fooling the viewer into thinking that ""this shit is actually good"". Fairy Tail does not lie, it does\'t try to hide its flaws anywhere. What we have at hand is perhaps the single most \'Be Yourself\' anime I have had the pleasure of watching, and for that reason, I really like it.On a technical level, under every single general quality trait, upon analyzing, Fairy Tails achievements are miniscule, but what it does is go beyond the norms and for that reason, it is among the most intelligent anime series I have seen, but no, not in its content -- I would never claim such a thing -- but in its making. It doesn\'t care. And I don\'t want care either, and for that reason, it is the ideal show for me. Simple? Well, it really is not! For example: Let\'s imagine for a second that this thing actually has a plot. In that case, the series would very likely be much, much worse than it currently is because the author is really horrible at writing anything (except zero arc which was pretty damn good actually). The best decision he has ever made, was create this series without it having a plot. Intelligence.The other amazing factor here is the fact that Fairy Tail cannot do anything that makes the story worse than it already is. Watching this series for that reason is a real blessing. No! I am not joking the least, and do not think for a second that is an insult because it is actually the biggest praise I can give. For example, when I watched some highly appreciated series -- which I will not mention by names, you can find them on any top 20 anime list on the interweb basically -- many of them contained this one cliche which I absolutely hate. Whenever a character is about to die, another character/nakama  quite literally teleports there and saves the other character from certain death in the very last second. It\'s so f****** annoying that it kills all the believability for myself in works that were otherwise good. When Fairy Tail does this exact same thing, it is not even a flaw but a pure feature/attribute that the viewer already expects of it. For that reason, Fairy Tail does what so many other shows can only dream of: It never disappoints. It simply can\'t. And that\'s precisely why the story is such a major success. This is one of the very few series which I can watch without asking any questions because I wholeheartedly acknowledge that there are no answers. It may be childish and problematic, but damn if the series doesn\'t know what it is. What I would in other cases call ""an absolute horseshit of a writing"", In Fairy Tail\'s case, I casually laugh and say ""oh, that\'s just Fairy Tail being Fairy Tail."" In one way, this entire series is Moon Moon the meme except it\'s an anime: this anime. I can\'t hate it, it\'s too special and precious.Characters:Like scarce  amount of shonen series -- which I will not namedrop here -- Fairy Tail does what so many others are so afraid to do: Give us canon pairings already when the series is still ongoing. 2/3 of the big 3 were nothing but a tease, the last one purely uses girls in comedic fanservice. The biggest meme, by Bones, made romantic situations a damn running gag. Fairy Tail\'s characters are never disrespected in this manner nor any manner. In fact, they are loved so much and so deeply that even every single mildly interesting villain join Fairy Tail\'s side because letting go off them is not an option. And that\'s okay. I think that\'s great. It\'s one thing for the viewers to hate characters, but when authors choose any of the routes mentioned above, it doesn\'t become pretty to watch. I unironically respect the guy because I find the romances and the feeling side of Fairy Tail to be genuine and honest unlike in so many other shonen series where ""romances"" become nothing but disgusting and dishonest comedic banter just so viewers would keep their interest and follow the characters like their unconfirmed shipping relations are some sort of ongoing cliffhanger that keeps them watching the damn thing. It\'s so fake and purely exist to fool the viewers to a point where the fans try to convince themselves that given pairings would be some sort of ""fanservice"" while it\'s the opposite. Let\'s face it, Gajeel x Levy is the most ""canon"" canon-pairing ever written by man, and that\'s my biggest reason for thinking these characters are great.Production:The last season certainly had a worse start considering it had about as much animation as the manga. This season still has lots of still pictures going on and money is saved pretty much whenever it is possible. Fairy Tail\'s viewers are familiar with this so continuity exists at least. Personally I don\'t mind anymore as long as it never gets as bad as in the beginning of 2014. The seiyuu work is naturally identical as well, and the glorious OST is still there. The OP and ED are bit weird choices.Enjoyment:Fairy Tail is a flawed work, but none of its flaws are something the viewer is supposed to forgive like is the case with so many  supposedly ""smart"" and ""good"" anime series. Fairy Tail doesn\'t give a damn, and that\'s exactly why it is so enjoyable and entertaining series to watch. I do NOT think ""Fairy Tail is so bad that it is good"", I think Fairy Tail is completely off the scale because Fairy Tail is not a good series in the most common definition of the word. It\'s its own thing and stays loyal to it, which may not me enough for everyone. However, I am willing to take this series with its problems and weaknesses and by doing so, I have seen how entertainment, in its purest form, is born.ps, I saw season 2 actually twice and upon my study, I discovered that Mira Strauss is the best girl the story entirely focuses on doing whatever it wants with the best sides it has [No matter how ""bad"" its best is]. Let\'s face it, the more there is content, the more room there is for all sorts of different issues, common tropes, general cliches, character flaws, logical errors that in generally, are hidden in the details in purpose of fooling the viewer into thinking that ""this shit is actually good"".

I can\'t hate it, it\'s too special and precious.Characters:Like scarce  amount of shonen series -- which I will not namedrop here -- Fairy Tail does what so many others are so afraid to do: Give us canon pairings already when the series is still ongoing. 2/3 of the big 3 were nothing but a tease, the last one purely uses girls in comedic fanservice. The biggest meme, by Bones, made romantic situations a damn running gag. Fairy Tail\'s characters are never disrespected in this manner nor any manner. In fact, they are loved so much and so deeply that even every single mildly interesting villain join Fairy Tail\'s side because letting go off them is not an option. And that\'s okay. I think that\'s great. It\'s one thing for the viewers to hate characters, but when authors choose any of the routes mentioned above, it doesn\'t become pretty to watch. I unironically respect the guy because I find the romances and the feeling side of Fairy Tail to be genuine and honest unlike in so many other shonen series where ""romances"" become nothing but disgusting and dishonest comedic banter just so viewers would keep their interest and follow the characters like their unconfirmed shipping relations are some sort of ongoing cliffhanger that keeps them watching the damn thing. It\'s so fake and purely exist to fool the viewers to a point where the fans try to convince themselves that given pairings would be some sort of ""fanservice"" while it\'s the opposite. Let\'s face it, Gajeel x Levy is the most ""canon"" canon-pairing ever written by man, and that\'s my biggest reason for thinking these characters are great.Production:The last season certainly had a worse start considering it had about as much animation as the manga. This season still has lots of still pictures going on and money is saved pretty much whenever it is possible. Fairy Tail\'s viewers are familiar with this so continuity exists at least. Personally I don\'t mind anymore as long as it never gets as bad as in the beginning of 2014. The seiyuu work is naturally identical as well, and the glorious OST is still there. The OP and ED are bit weird choices.Enjoyment:Fairy Tail is a flawed work, but none of its flaws are something the viewer is supposed to forgive like is the case with so many  supposedly ""smart"" and ""good"" anime series. Fairy Tail doesn\'t give a damn, and that\'s exactly why it is so enjoyable and entertaining series to watch. I do NOT think ""Fairy Tail is so bad that it is good"", I think Fairy Tail is completely off the scale because Fairy Tail is not a good series in the most common definition of the word. It\'s its own thing and stays loyal to it, which may not me enough for everyone. However, I am willing to take this series with its problems and weaknesses and by doing so, I have seen how entertainment, in its purest form, is born.ps, I saw season 2 actually twice and upon my study, I discovered that Mira Strauss is the best girl', 'The FINAL SEASON...until the 100 Year Quest gets adapted...No but seriously for a ""final season"", Fairy Tail really brought their all or more or less Hiro Mashima amalgamated all his loose plotlines (especially with the deal with Zeref and Acnologia) not only to a grand final war but to resolve the MANY MANY characters plot threads it gave us and the majority of it...succeeded.LA had been and still was a huge fan of Fairy Tail, Fairy Tail brought LA into the shounen genre and though Fairy Tail did abuse the entire ""nakama"" arc finales as an asspull let alone it\'s ""no one dies"" attitude and...to this end makes Natsu has immense plot armour and one-shots every main arc villain in the series, all these flaws bar one or two get given some context and actual reasoning to, the exception being the ""nakama"" BUT LA even has a defense for that (to a certain extent) and that is..well Fairy Tail was ALWAYS about nakama or family, heck Fairy Tail was always about camaraderie even in the worst of times and most of the characters centred on family one way or another, Lucy with her father, Cana and Gildarts, Natsu and Igneel, Gray and Ur and Wendy with the guild itself. Yes Fairy Tail had some problems be it it\'s filler arcs or the flaws LA mentioned above but man this final season remedied ALOT of the problems it had.With this being the culmination to the final battles against Zeref and Acnologia, the character development and the lore intertwining things to make sense was all there. For character development the main players gets the most screentime, expanded both on the world building and lore of Fairy Tail to ties things together, everything from why the Year 777 was soo important, Lucy\'s mother, the Dragon Slayers themselves, Zeref and his conflict and war with Mavis and how Acnologia came to be. It\'s all covered here. If anything the main characters who get the most screentime and development became Natsu, Zeref, Mavis, Acnologia, Erza, Wendy, Gray and Lucy though LA thought that Lucy once again took the fanservicey status and her backstory was more towards her family line than her as a character came into play but nonetheless she was a central player...mainly helping Natsu in all this but still.The battles were crazy to say the least, mainly because of Zeref\'s Elite commanders, being mages of ABSURD magical strength and having them pitted against not only Fairy Tail themselves but EVERY guild (including the main dark guilds who have turned over a new leaf giving THEM redemption as well as well as minor development as well). But most of the battles were interesting in how the character overcome it as...well Natsu was focused on Zeref, it gave the rest of the cast a chance to shine MAINLY Erza, Gray, Wendy and Gajeel. YES...sometimes they used nakama power but....ummmm...it\'s cool ok.The animation done by A-1 Pictures, Bridge and Cloverworks...well the animation was toned and alot sharper, the fighting and battles scenes were much more fluid and intense and because of the tone, the character designs and quirky and exotic as they were were crisper and much sharper than before, since this was a collaboration between three studios, LA can see the animation was consistently great (aside from the rare derps) because of it and considering the animation was consistent for 51 episodes and still the final few episodes were greatly detailed and batshit cazy in terms of battles...well what else woul LA say but bravo A-1 Pictures, Bridge and Cloverworks!The voice cast was utterly HUGE so LA will go by the simple standouts or MVP\'s...for LA they were Mamiko not as Mavis, Akira Ishida as Zeref, Tetsuya Kakihara as Natsu, Sayaka Ohara as Erza, Yuuichi Nakamura as Gray, aya Hirano as Lucy, Satomi Sato as Wendy, Rie Kugimiya as Happy, Kousuke Toriumi as Acnologia, Takako Honda as Eileen Belserion, Manami Numakura as Brandish, Saori Hayami as Kagura, Show Hayami as Ichiya (yes really) and Kana Hanazawa as Zera, seriously a damn great voice cast if LA could go on this section would be HUGE.Fairy Tail: Final Series is nothing but a great send off to the series, as it just ties everything up from 10 years of Fairy Tail anime, sure in a bit of shaking ways especially considering the nakama power activating time to time but like LA said, it\'s kinda what Fairy Tail embodies time and again and Fairy Tail just wraps everything in a crescendo.LA had and always will be a fan of Fairy Tail even when it was in it\'s lowest moments and in a time when Fairy Tail was looked down upon, LA always stick by it and wanted to get better and with this Final Season it did. Fairy Tail was LA\'s first shounen anime and be it the annoying filler arcs, Natsu\'s plot armour, Lucy\'s unneeded fanservice and of course the nakama eleventh hour superpower but even with all that this Final Season did it\'s job and ended the way it wanted too and by god, did it go out great.Here\'s to Fairy Tail and a close to Zeref and Acnologia as the Big Bads of the series...E.N.D to this end makes Natsu has immense plot armour and one-shots every main arc villain in the series, all these flaws bar one or two get given some context and actual reasoning to, the exception being the ""nakama"" BUT LA even has a defense for that (to a certain extent) and that is..well Fairy Tail was ALWAYS about nakama or family, heck Fairy Tail was always about camaraderie even in the worst of times and most of the characters centred on family one way or another, Lucy with her father, Cana and Gildarts, Natsu and Igneel, Gray and Ur and Wendy with the guild itself.

I started watching the fairy tail anime back in 2013 when I was still 13 years old. I binge watched the first part, then I watched the second part as it came out and then now I started watching the finale. However, since I watched this anime the first time, I have become an active member of the anime community and I have watched lots and lots of different animes, and now, this anime just keeps becoming worse and worse in my opinion.Story - 6/10The story...is the only slightly attractive feature of this anime. The story is fluent and there are very few plotholes. The backstories of characters actually make sense and the connection between individual arcs is good. The stories have enough emotions tied to them.However, even though the story is the most attractive part of the anime, it doesn't compare to other famous animes. The story is filled with plot armor and nonsensical power-ups. For example, this series takes place a year after the last arc and in this one year, all the characters got incredibly strong and smart. We don't get to see how they trained or how they gained their powers. We just know that they became very strong in one year.The most appalling part, however, is the random power-ups in an on-going fight/match. The main character fights the underlings of the main boss and gets bet up very easily. Then, all of a sudden they get a flashback or a shout-out from a random friend and then they one-punch-knockout their opponents. Not only this but somehow, they restore their health completely and then fight the main boss only to be taken down instantly. There is some random show-off the main boss's power and then again, the main characters get some random power and one-punch-knockout the main boss regardless of how powerful the main boss is.Art - 5/10This is not an anime. This is just a colored manga with hints of hentai in it. One of the main female characters gets nude every time she transforms and another one apparently likes to seduce men. Like, literally, even her wiki fandom page says she likes to seduce men (lucy heartfilia). The only purpose of those two characters is to attract attention from hormone filled men who want to vent their stress. Their bewbs are the only attractive part of the 'art' of this anime.The fighting scenes, as I mentioned earlier. are like a colored manga. It is a set of still shots (with obviously* unnecessary random bewb involvement) and the same tricks been used again and again. An anime like mob psycho 100 which is based on a webcomic drawn by an unprofessional, has far better-animated fights than this anime.Sound - 3/10The music is catchy, but they don't use it wisely in this anime. It is repeatitive and gets annoying if you watch the anime long enough. They have to literally play the music all the time.Character - 3/10Random power-ups, no character development, character whose only compelling feature is their bust, random flashbacks. unnecessary crying and most importantly over-display of 'friendship'. The whole anime revolves around 'friendship'. Each time you see a power-up, you will see the term 'friendship' being used in the vicinity.Before someone bashes out on me for saying 'no character development, let me tell you what character development means. It means that there are some changes in your character due to some incidents. These changes are mostly positive changes and are supposed to make them more mature.    I guess the only display of character development is when Natsu learns to give up after fighting glidarts. (That's actually what made me give this factor a score of 3, instead 2)Enjoyment - 3/10As a teen, my pubescent hormone kept me attracted to this anime, but now that i don't feel the same attraction as before, I don't really find the point of watching this anime. I can watch other animes which are wayy better than this anime. You can just read the manga and enjoy the story rather than wasting time on this anime. is the only slightly attractive feature of this anime. The story is fluent and there are very few plotholes.

What can the world do without you? From its original run back in August 2006 to July 2017, the fantasy adventure has been dubbed as a popular franchise that became famous for its “friendship” theme. It’s become so well-known that the words “friends” has become synonymous with the franchise itself. Now, we finally have the conclusion of this long-running fantasy adventure.The final season initially had mixed reception so seeing this been translated into anime form would also generate some degree of trepidation. I approached this final season with some optimism as a voice told me it would be a proper sendoff...of the show but far from a masterpiece. From the first few episodes, It reintroduced the main characters we are so familiar with – Natsu, Happy, Lucy, Erza, Gray. The Fairy Tail guild itself is no longer the same as we remember. But surely enough, the final season begins to slowly reintroduce the other familiar cast ranging from Wendy, Gajeel, Laxus, Levy, and among many others. Perhaps most noticeable is the reintroduction of Zeref, a powerful dark wizard who has been an integral part of Fairy Tail’s expansive plot. Now, he’s a character with a purpose and takes on the role of an emperor with his own personal empire. The final season covers the Alvarez Empire arc that concludes the series.Looking back now, Zeref has been a complex character since his introduction. Now that he is in command of an empire, Zeref developed a more strategic and cunning mind who seeks to achieve his ambitions. The previous season also covered a side series (Fairy Tail Zero) that chronicled his relationship between Zeref and Mavis. The importance of their relationship carries an emotional degree that fully reaches its apex at the final stages of the season. To me, it’s a type of long-term development that actually works effective in terms of story writing. But from the start, we also have to realize the conflict Natsu and his friends to has to deal with now. From the Alvarez Empire, the Sparggan 12 serves as an elite unit of powerful wizards under Zeref. They consist of some of the most powerful adversaries Fairy Tail has ever encountered. From the arrogant sand mage Ajeel to god-like entities such as God Serena and August, there’s no doubt we’ll see the guild struggling to overcome these obstacles. Others such as Brandish and Irene has their own complex relationships with certain characters. I’m not going to spoil but it’s let’s just say that they are important to the overall tone of the season. Unfortunately, a decent portion of Sparrgan 12 are easily forgettable such as Jacob, Neihart, Bloodman, and Wall Eehto. I honestly forgot some of these characters and had to look them up again. Others such as Larcade and Invel has somewhat important roles in the show but honestly are overshadowed by powerful mainstays like Zeref. Collectively, they are a unique group of individuals that brings a thrilling sensation to the final arc. Individually, some just lacks presence on their own and suffers from stardom.Fairy Tail’s own members has their many spotlights although most of it is carried by the usual suspects. Of course, Natsu and Lucy play significant roles in determining the outcome of the arc. This is especially shown through Natsu’s complex relationship with Zeref. In one particular episode, we also get an important revelation about their origins. In the meantime, the final season also hopes to elicit character emotions beyond just the usual friendship gimmicks. Don’t expect much romance outside of Zeref and Mavis though. At this point, it’s pretty much established that Fairy Tail values its character connections more important than anything. As a guild, Fairy Tail has always been known for developing connections between its cast and forging bonds that lasts seemingly forever. From a storytelling perspective, it’s hardly unique as friendship themes have always been a part of many action adventures. It’s just that Fairy Tail amplifies its friendship context more than the usual. To me, it’s oversaturated and seemingly forced down our throats. Sure, it’s an important context of the show but when you’ve watched over 200 episodes of this, it gets pretty damn redundant, no?With 51 episodes, Fairy Tail final season does hit the sweet spot for concluding this anime. It doesn’t rely much on fillers to do the storytelling in this case and is actually quite faithful to the manga. The previous seasons had numerous filler episodes that can be a chore to get through. Some of those fillers were genuinely enjoyable while others had an entire arc of shallow writing. The final season gets straight to the point and commits most of its time on bringing out what the fans wants to actually see. The first half builds on the main plot while the second half executes what it establishes and ultimately brings together its conclusion. I’m not going to lie though. The final season is pretty much aimed at fans who really wants to see how this anime franchise wraps up. Chance are, some people just wants to finish the show and be done with the franchise for good. Others really wants to see the best of what Fairy Tail can offer. Personally, that part was long and done from the first seasons. The final season at best is a definitive end of the main story saga and as its worst is lazy writing that continues to use recycled ideas.However, I will give a credit where it’s due and that’s for Hiro Mashima’s work consistency. Being able to finish the manga from the start to finish with his weekly schedule is almost inhuman. When writing the script and storyboarding, I’d imagine he planned out well ahead of time. The mangaka is a madman when it comes to his speed of working. Why do I mention this? It’s because Fairy Tail’s art style has a cartoony look but can be deceptively complex at times to watch. Both the anime and manga also consist a lot of character emotions during important moments. Fairy Tail has been known for a lot of crying times and this final season is no pushover with those scenes. Emotions are drawn out by the main themes of the show and connects the characters together. A-1 Pictures return with their staff with a similar look to the previous seasons. And of course, any longtime fan will know Fairy Tail has fan service. It has lot of fan service, sometimes which can be dramatically distracting. There’s even jokes about the fan service itself with characters like Lucy being a main culprit. Gray taking his clothes off is also a running gag that melts Juvia’s little heart.The anime is over. This is the final season and I doubt we’ll see another Fairy Tail anime for a long time. If Hiro Hashima’s other works like Eden’s Zero or Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest ever gets adaptations, I’d imagine it to be much shorter than what we’ve seen here. The final season indeed concludes the long running Fairy Tail main saga that started between a fiery salamander and a blonde mage. And if you want to give it a chance, the ball is in your court. of the show but far from a masterpiece.

And if you want to give it a chance, the ball is in your court.', ""From all the reviews I've seen, it seems that many people regard Fairy Tail as a great show, but I can't comprehend why. There are so many problems with this show, and I cannot understand how people do not see them. I'm not really reviewing this specific season, but the anime as a whole. Fairy Tail actually had some potential, but Hiro Mashima and A-1 threw all of it into the trash.The writing is the first thing I want to address about this show. It is fucking stale. Out of the 300 episodes I have seen I swear that each arc except two contains...the exact same formula. For those who do not understand, each arc literally just consists of a new conflict and foe arising and the main characters defeating them. It goes through the same cycle over and over. The protagonists struggle a bit against the opponent and then thanks to the power of friendship, they are able to defeat them. I am not joking when I say most of the arcs just consists of this; this is an accurate description of them. There are only two arcs of this series which I actually liked thanks to the outcomes being different. I also want to mention that pacing is not very good, and arcs drag out way too long.I am not really a musical person, but in my opinion, sound is decent in this show. The music is good, but the problem is that it gets really overplayed. There isn't much variety, and I feel like I hear the same songs over and over. Voice acting is not that bad in Fairy Tail either.For people who do not realize, art and animation are two different things. The art in this show honestly isn't that bad. I don't remember there being many moments where facial expressions or bodies looked in an awkward way. Despite that, animation in this show is fucking awful. For being an action-based show, you would expect fights to be well animated, but it is the complete opposite. All of the fights consists of still frames and little animation. It is basically a colorized manga. I realize that this is not a seasonal show, but I wish that they would put even some effort into the important fights.Characters in this show are extremely average. The problem to me is just that there are way too many. I came into season three not remembering half of the characters' names. I also just hate how fucking stupid the people in this show are. Any moment where there is suppose to be emotional and sympathetic value is ruined by fan-service put in every frame or an unfunny and forced joke. The majority of females looks exactly the same in this show; exact same facial expression and giant breasts. It really pisses me off as well that pretty much no characters have died either. Oh what's that, it looks like a character is about to die. No fuck that I'm gonna be saved by some bullshit reason. It causes the show to have no sense of risk or danger because you know that the main characters are never going to die. Character development is somewhat nonexistent in this show as well. Most characters have remained the same throughout the entirety of the three seasons.Overall, Fairy Tail is a very mediocre anime. Black Clover may honestly be better than this shit. It is a show that would best be watched as background noise. I really wish that I could make myself drop this show, but I'd prefer to stick to my policy of not dropping shows. For anyone who is considering to watch, I suggest you don't. Don't make the same mistake as me. the exact same formula. For those who do not understand, each arc literally just consists of a new conflict and foe arising and the main characters defeating them. It goes through the same cycle over and over. The protagonists struggle a bit against the opponent and then thanks to the power of friendship, they are able to defeat them. I am not joking when I say most of the arcs just consists of this; this is an accurate description of them. There are only two arcs of this series which I actually liked thanks to the outcomes being different. I also want to mention that pacing is not very good, and arcs drag out way too long.I am not really a musical person, but in my opinion, sound is decent in this show. The music is good, but the problem is that it gets really overplayed. There isn't much variety, and I feel like I hear the same songs over and over. Voice acting is not that bad in Fairy Tail either.For people who do not realize, art and animation are two different things. The art in this show honestly isn't that bad. I don't remember there being many moments where facial expressions or bodies looked in an awkward way. Despite that, animation in this show is fucking awful.

I hereby bestow upon this anime the name of ""GIF\'s, The Animation!""I\'m so annoyed with this that this is literally the first review I\'ve ever done. Maybe the first of many, I don\'t know.The animation for this season is AWFUL! I\'m writing this review to rant as well as point this out because I don\'t see anyone else talking about how lazy, ugly, & absolutely pathetic the quality of the animation for this show has become.This is literally like watching a colored picture book with shaking backgrounds. Hell I\'m nicknaming this ""GIF\'s The Animation."" Every fight scene consists of still cutouts...of the character in question, then they animate the hair for 3 frames in repetition, add some screen shaking, movement lines, and wallah! That\'s your fight scene! What the heck is this!?On second thought, calling this show ""GIF\'s The animation"" is an insult to GIF\'s because I\'ve seen GIF\'s with better animation than this.What the hell am I even watching this for when I read the manga? I thought this was supposed to be an anime! You know, with ANIMATION! Not a glorified coloring book!I actually went back to season 1 to check out the fight scenes there because I don\'t remember it being this bad and guess what. They\'re not! Season 1\'s fight scenes are actually animated! Granted there are a lot of the same lazy still frames, but they animate when it counts! Their punches and kicks have ""Movement!"" But this show, just when you think there\'s going to be a big fight, when they introduce a new character into a major fight to change the outcome.... nothing but still frames.This is a new low, a new level of how to not even try, a new level of lazy, a new tier of cutting corners. All the fights are GIF\'s! They\'re not even bothering to animate punching. The most basic of all fight moves!!!They\'ve actually masked this laziness with CG Special effects for their magic! So at least it ""looks cool"" right?This is just a review on the animation aspect of this show. Waste your time at your own will. This is my warning. If you\'ve read this, you may as well just stick with the manga, because this anime, is not really an animation.Episode 41 update:I\'m impressed. With the Gildarts vs August fight in this episode, they really put some effort into it and it looked fantastic!Edit: I\'ve decided to summarize everything else.Story: 6/10It deviates from the manga a bit as expected, but major plot points still in line. Watchers can still easily follow the story. They did add extra, extra, ultra layers of plot armor.Characters: Meh 5/10Not much to say. They haven\'t changed much. Just new abilities that have deus ex machina\'d their way into the show. Everyone still has plot armor so there\'s really no suspense at any point whatsoever.Update: Deus ex Machina plot armor powers intensified hardcore.Art: 1/10We talked about this.Sound: 7/10Well thank god there\'s at least audio. I\'m no sound expert so, wish I could be more critical.Overall: 4/10I\'m being very generous with this because I\'ve seen worst shows.

Sadly, Fairy Tail (2018) is a disappointment as well.Long story short: while the audio is still top notch, the visuals are the worst of the whole series and the story is far from good.STORYI like Fairy Tail, I\'m not ashamed to say it. Despite what people claim, it has great plots and great ideas (although it\'s often mixed with a lot of stupidity).This Final Series adapts the last 3 arcs of the manga: Avatar, Caracolle Island and the Final Arc.While I do enjoy Avatar and the first...half of the final arc (which has a lot of revelations and intense moments), the rest is really... uninspired. It\'s full of clichés, it\'s rushed, it\'s dumb. Caracolle Island is hilarious, but the Final Arc is really not worth it overall (it seems to be usual in the anime industry...).Fairy Tail never had a brillant story. But at least it was decent, sometimes even great. Tartaros Arc, for example, had intense battles with very nice characters, and that was more than enough to keep it entertaining.The biggest positive point of this manga is its characters (at least when they are developed). Many of them have a very nice background. Zeref, in particular, is a great character, and one of my favourite vilains in recent animes.But the new characters, introduced in the Final Arc, go from ""meh, nice background"" to ""utterly garbage worthless character"".ARTFairy Tail never had great graphics and animation. But the first anime at least had a very nice art style, which made it enjoyable to watch.The second series had better drawings, but the animation had gotten worse as it was less dynamic.Now, the Final Series... actually started very well. It\'s not great, but the first episodes are actually nice to the eyes (especially the environments, which are great).But starting from the end of Avatar arc, the art suddenly goes down the hill. It\'s mostly still pictures badly drawn!SOUNDGreat seiyuus, great OST (although it has too much remix of the previous OSTs imo).CHARACTERI love the characters of Fairy Tail. They\'re not the most original, and when they\'re not important to the current plot they\'re transparent, but despite that, they\'re fun to watch.My favourite is Wendy. She\'s the only character who had actual progression. She got stronger and stronger over the arcs, and in this Final Series she really shines as a powerful wizard.The other characters are... well, the same as usual. Some of them are real badass (Erza in particular), they\'re still great to watch in action.But most of the new characters are shitty. The Avatar crew was just here to have their asses kicked, I get that but still, did they have to be so... forgettable?Most of the new main vilains are garbage because they\'re beaten quickly and don\'t have a story.ENJOYMENTI\'m really disappointed in this Final Series. I\'m not surprised, but still, it\'s a waste of potential for me The first series of this anime is still the best for me. It\'s the only one that kept me entertained for hundreds of episodes. The second series disappointed me most of the time, but at least it kept me onboard until the end. This Final Series, however, I\'m on the verge of dropping it.If you watched the previous series and want to know the end, I really advise to read the manga instead. Sure you\'ll miss colors and music, but really, I enjoyed the manga version of these arcs way more than I do their anime version. half of the final arc (which has a lot of revelations and intense moments), the rest is really... uninspired.

Anyone who legitimately thinks this show is good should automatically be assumed to have terrible taste (which would be the correct assumption); You should never listen to another anime opinion from them again. Even for **Fairy Tail** (which hasn\'t even been good since around episode 60), this is bad.The ""animation"" (if it can even be considered that) is literally just still shot after still shot along with incredibly rough art....In terms of the writing: this arc took two characters that have been built up for almost the entire show and completely throws all the potential they had right out the window. Every character is retarded and just worse versions of themselves then they were in previous arcs. I\'m not going to go on because I do not care enough about this dogshit.TL;DR what I\'m trying to say is that Fairy tail is terrible and isn\'t worth the watch.

As you watch the show these flaws will appear.They\'re back... but wait, are they going to be back forever? Some of you might be asking what this means... I\'m talking about the obvious plot armor placed on anyone with the Fairy Tail insignia. This is a horrible decision made by the writing team of the source material. Sure, they can protect the beloved characters of the show to avoid community outrage. However, this move only diminishes the impact of a characters supposed death....What makes the plot armor even more aggravating is that, in the anime, they exaggerate the death to evoke sadness. This tactic worked for the first death as I legitimately felt a feeling of despair. However, all of that was immediately lost when the character came back to life. This paved the way for more characters to ""parish"" and after the second person was saved by the bell, this completely erased all meaning in character deaths as I just believed that they would return. Furthermore, the characters don\'t just die from normal combat causes. They die from heroic feats of courage ""sacrificing"" themselves for the benefit of their peers. That in itself is beautiful, but they never die, which makes the moment less meaningful.Also, pacing is rough around the edges. I understand for an anime of this magnitude they will sometimes sacrifice pacing for income, so I won\'t be too critical of them. However, this cannot be ignored. My main gripe is with the formulaic nature of the episodes. They all essentially follow the same layout... slow beginning which remains stagnant, with a possible few moments of action, until we reach the very end of the episode, which is often a cliffhanger. This allows the viewer to really anticipate the next episode, but it makes the overall watching experience slow and boring. Just count how much time character expressions take per episode.The whole “power of friendship” is bullshit and is so overused to the point that it just became annoying and childish.Overall, this show is a disgrace to its previous seasons with pacing issues, repetitive bullshit and aggressive plot armor placed on characters that detract from the overall potential and enjoyment.

But there was no despair or too much of a hurdle.Characters-Unlike Naruto or One Piece, Fairy Tail's each and every characters are invincible. They do not die in the hands of 10 times stronger enemies. Enemy characters are given overwhelming magic power without any talent on how to use it including ACNOLOGIA. There were some characters...who didn't notice enough attention like GOD SERENA.Sound-Soundtracks are nice but sometimes voice actors voices just don't match the situation.

They called it a ""poor man\'s One Piece"" and not investing. While I do agree there were and remain too much plot armor and PLOT, the Final Series is definitely the highest peak of the entire show. It maintains the great music and character that was introduced in the first season, while also looking even more fantastic with better fightscenes than the already improved (artistically) Fairy Tail 2014. The Final Series contains the raw emotions of the main cast, as well...as Zeref and the Spriggan 12, and fixes numerous plot holes and answers questions fans have been waiting for since the show first started (if you haven\'t read the manga). Also Natsu and the rest of the cast are way more bad ass this time, as they trained for a year in order to prepare for this final showdown (not including the 100 years quest). This is the best way to end the series that has captivated us for years on end. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because of the art. The art itself is the best the show has ever looked, however, fight scenes still are pretty static with not a lot of fluent animation (it will probably get better since the first third of the show was animated around the same time the second season was coming to an end, so the last episodes will be looking the best). To add to this, Sword Art Online: Alicitization, and other concurrent A-1 Pictures/Cloverworks animes look better than Fairy Tail, with movements, even though they are using the same animation and production teams. Besides this, Fairy Tail: Final Series is fantastic and  makes you fall in love with the characters again as they win battles, struggle , suffer losses and do everything they can to protect their family, their guild, Fairy Tail. I wish they turn the 100 Year Quest into an anime, but they most likely won\'t. as Zeref and the Spriggan 12, and fixes numerous plot holes and answers questions fans have been waiting for since the show first started (if you haven\'t read the manga).

With its beloved characters and exciting fights, it consistently provides a captivating view into a world of wizards and mages.The story follows a group of wizards known as Fairy Tail who are part of a guild of similar people. Through their adventures and escapades, we follow the magical journey of Lucy Heartfilia and her magical partners as they get caught in the mix of a variety of misadventures. Along the way, they meet a variety of characters and make thrilling alliances with some enemies, making for a riveting come together...of powerful forces.The animation and art style are as colourful and vibrant as its cast of characters, making the entire series a visual treat to follow.

Through this simple premise with the epic & emotional music, I was looking forward to the following seasons. Maybe the animation could have been a bit grittier or the dialogue less repetitive, but my main concern is the lack in the complexity regarding the world. The flare and charm, no matter how much the first and the story as a whole, the final season did not met my expectations nor did it surpasses its predecessors. Never would I say the final season is bad, only that it could have been much better. ', '-This review as been amended to reflect the final episode 51-Fairy Tail is...well was a amazing show. It\'s cast, sound-work, animation and art design and direction were something of a spectral and a dance. It kept you wanting more and more while also treating your intelligence with respect and appreciation. While the show used magic as it\'s basic premise it never really did a full ""Deus EX Machina"" and utterly insulted your ability to think for yourself or your imagination.Story:That is until this season and on Episode 50. Where entire sections of previous season are ret-conned for the sake of ""Plot device"" and a clear...trash written Deus EX Machina.Remember the season with a massive chunk of it being about a alternative world called Edolas? And how when they left the pathways and connections between Earth Land and Edolas were severed?Ya well you can act like that never happened. In episode 50 the entire population of Edolas is showing to be helping defeat Acnologia. Better yet there is a scene where Lucy asks Meredy where she\'s been all this time when Meredy just randomly shows up all beaten and bruised and Meredy says she\'s been traveling around the world to help ""connect"" people to help make Fairy Sphere successful.Which begs the question, how did she get back to Edolas? Why does Edolas care about Earth Land when they two worlds are connected as per the shows own lore? How do the people of Edolas know about the fight with Acnologia? If the fight with Acnologia is only in Earth Land then how would it effect the land of Edolas?None and I mean none of these questions are answered and with one more episode left it\'s incredibly unlikely they will, or will do so without insulting the fan base and audience more then they already have.Yes this show has had plot devices before but they made sense and didn\'t contradict the show and series own lore and plot. They were all believable in their own way. Not this one.Also the people of Edolas suddenly have the ability to use magic, as the shows down dialog says that the magic within people is being pulled to help power Fairy Sphere. EVEN though the show itself stats that the people of Edolas has no magic and what little magic that was present (magic items) was entirely transfer to Earth Land. So somehow, suddenly Edolas has some level of magic again and within it\'s residents?EDIT: Both Zeraf and Mavis were brought back and aren\'t actually dead, but it\'s not actually either of them but some two characters that literally look identical to them and even have the same VAs for them and the characters from the Guild all recognize them as these two people but then it\'s just...passed off as nothing at all. Even the way Mavis is framed coming into the scene is literally how Mavis has been framed in the entire series up to this point. A ghostly presence in the form of a child.Acnologia gets a redemption story but doesn\'t at the same time as a way to pull at the viewer heart strings a little to late and clearly comes across as a insult to the entire audiences intelligence.Natus acts like he\'s going to ask Lucy out to be his GF and maybe Wife but then the show is like ""Naaah"" and pulls a really piss poor attempt at subverting expectations. Natus isn\'t known to be a romantic in the early parts of the show but he\'s not that student or ignorant. He\'s acted in ways or done things for Lucy that shows he also has feelings for her yet the show just slaps you in the face over their relationship. At least Levy and Gajeel are more forward about their feelings, somehow since Gajeel is leagues more dence then Natsu ever way. Same with Grey. It\'s just insulting.Oh and the whole thing with the Edolas character suddenly being shown as helping with the final battle against Acnologia and Meredy somehow traveling back to Edolas to get their help is STILL never explained and STILl utterly contrived and forced in for the sake of having a Deus Ex Machina.Sound:It\'s Fairy Tail, Sounds design is still some good stuff with it\'s sound track still being a favorite of mine and still rocking that Celtic metal vibes. However the sound effects seem like they are just reused ones from the first seasons and you can tell they are reusing them for the sake of time and money.Art:It\'s tanked pretty hard. Animation quality is now sub-par, the amount of movement, fluid fighting and fight scenes overall are pretty bad. Everything feels rushed (will get to this at the end) and it shows pretty blatantly too.Characters:They are...there. Nothing to write home about and some of more interesting ones are killed off in really cheap and haphazardly ways. Irene was probably one of the most interesting characters they not only introduced but also fleshed out in this entire season. You got a pretty interesting backstory, some lore about her you\'d have never guessed about (she invented dragon slayer magic) and had the most potential to be a redeemable character. Something this show has a knack for doing when there is as much build up for Irene as they gave.But nope. Killed her off like it was nothing. Which is disappointing because far FAR less interesting and redeemable characters were in-fact, redeemed in this series. Showing a complete lack of continuity from the shows writer who can\'t keep his own writing method straight and it\'s pretty obvious.Other then her characters are forgettable, bland or pretty pointless and are just there to push the plot along. Something this series didn\'t fall prey to prior to this season as each character as a important role and motive they made them believable and enjoyable. Even the villains.EDIT: With the death of both Zeraf and Mavis any reasonable viewer would think that they\'d never been seen or heard from again. Yet within the shows own last season this gets utterly retconned as well. Both of them are brought back with absolutely not explanation. Just given different names and the way it\'s set up and their design it\'s clear this is EXACTLY who they are and even the Guild Member of Fairy Tail know it\'s them. Yet that\'s all dropped when the two act like they\'ve never met and neither are actually mages, let alone know any of the rest of the cast. Outside of the cast from Edolas being brought back it\'s the most jarring and trashy thing the show and it\'s writers could have done.Also Acnologia suddenly has a change of heart when he realizes he can\'t have everything and is starting to crumble into literal dust. Saying that Natus is now the King of Dragons (which he thankfully declines) but it\'s some feigned attempt to garner sympathy for Acnologia. I am sorry but what? This makes no sense and is another notch on the shows grave stone of how to insult your fan-base and audience. Acnologia shouldn\'t have any sympathy for him yet the show tries to pull this ""have it both ways"" crap.Enjoyment:It\'s...bland to put it nicely. If you like a show you just turn your brain off of then you MIGHT like this last season. But if you are like most of the intelligent population and can tell when you are being insulted by a shows writing and how it\'s slapping you around with a wet rag then you probably won\'t like how this show ends. It\'s better off putting on in the background while doing something else (like a Podcast) then actually sitting down, putting it on and watching it and doing nothing else.Overall:Fairy Tail started off strong. REALLY strong and continued to be strong until this last season. Ending on a strong note is the most important part of a story or any medium, even if you had a poor season or half of one as long as you end on a strong note then people will tend to be forgiving to the parts you flubbed on and say good things about your work overall.Fairy Tail however ends on probably one of the weakest seasons I\'ve seen in a anime to date, and I\'ve seen a lot. From ones in the 70s (Star Blazers) to the 80s and 90s (Gundam and Gundam Wing) and all the way to date. From multiple different genres and studios, Fairy Tail has ended on the worst possible season from not only a critically acclaimed franchise but also the budget something like this would get.It insults your intelligence as a view with their pulling a Deus EX Machina by dragging the entire land of Edolas into the frey which fundamentally makes no sense based on the shows own lore, the bland and boring characters during this entire last season and killing off ones that were actually interesting and (based on the shows own history) would have been kept alive and redeemed, to some of the worst art and animation within a series own show when compared to previous series.Fairy Tail started off with a blazing fire but has sadly gone out like a puff of smoke with no fire in it\'s belly. It\'s gone from someone wonderful and amazing to a utter joke and one that\'s not even funny.Closing Note:I had reason to believe that this season was made not because the studio wanted it, but because of fan entitlement and fan backlash for not having the last season. And the publisher jumped on as their eye turned to money signs and they could see how easily they could make dough from it. As such the product is bad because there is no longer love, heart and appreciation put into it.EDIT: This season is by far the worst in the life time of this franchise. It has massive plot holes that it not only digs deeper then they already were but creates entire new ones for no reason other their to give a excuse to try and help force the plot along. It\'s contrived, shoddy and does nothing but slap you in the face repeatedly and insults your intelligence as a viewer the entire time while also leading you to believe that serious questions that have been created WILL be answered but never bothers to.This series started off very strong and it wasn\'t till this last season that it fell to very far from where it once stood. It\'s a joke and a joke that no one is laughing at. I used to love this franchise, characters and the story, but I can\'t be bothered to care anymore after the train wreck of a ""Final Season"". And based on what I am seeing there\'s supposed to another entire Arc called the ""100 Year Quest Arc"" and good lord please don\'t let that become a thing. The show just need to stop existing now after how bad this ""Final"" season turned out to be. We don\'t need more from the abysmal season. trash written Deus EX Machina.Remember the season with a massive chunk of it being about a alternative world called Edolas?

Showing a complete lack of continuity from the shows writer who can\'t keep his own writing method straight and it\'s pretty obvious.Other then her characters are forgettable, bland or pretty pointless and are just there to push the plot along. Something this series didn\'t fall prey to prior to this season as each character as a important role and motive they made them believable and enjoyable. Even the villains.EDIT: With the death of both Zeraf and Mavis any reasonable viewer would think that they\'d never been seen or heard from again. Yet within the shows own last season this gets utterly retconned as well. Both of them are brought back with absolutely not explanation. Just given different names and the way it\'s set up and their design it\'s clear this is EXACTLY who they are and even the Guild Member of Fairy Tail know it\'s them. Yet that\'s all dropped when the two act like they\'ve never met and neither are actually mages, let alone know any of the rest of the cast. Outside of the cast from Edolas being brought back it\'s the most jarring and trashy thing the show and it\'s writers could have done.Also Acnologia suddenly has a change of heart when he realizes he can\'t have everything and is starting to crumble into literal dust. Saying that Natus is now the King of Dragons (which he thankfully declines) but it\'s some feigned attempt to garner sympathy for Acnologia. I am sorry but what? This makes no sense and is another notch on the shows grave stone of how to insult your fan-base and audience. Acnologia shouldn\'t have any sympathy for him yet the show tries to pull this ""have it both ways"" crap.Enjoyment:It\'s...bland to put it nicely. If you like a show you just turn your brain off of then you MIGHT like this last season. But if you are like most of the intelligent population and can tell when you are being insulted by a shows writing and how it\'s slapping you around with a wet rag then you probably won\'t like how this show ends. It\'s better off putting on in the background while doing something else (like a Podcast) then actually sitting down, putting it on and watching it and doing nothing else.Overall:Fairy Tail started off strong. REALLY strong and continued to be strong until this last season. Ending on a strong note is the most important part of a story or any medium, even if you had a poor season or half of one as long as you end on a strong note then people will tend to be forgiving to the parts you flubbed on and say good things about your work overall.Fairy Tail however ends on probably one of the weakest seasons I\'ve seen in a anime to date, and I\'ve seen a lot. From ones in the 70s (Star Blazers) to the 80s and 90s (Gundam and Gundam Wing) and all the way to date. From multiple different genres and studios, Fairy Tail has ended on the worst possible season from not only a critically acclaimed franchise but also the budget something like this would get.It insults your intelligence as a view with their pulling a Deus EX Machina by dragging the entire land of Edolas into the frey which fundamentally makes no sense based on the shows own lore, the bland and boring characters during this entire last season and killing off ones that were actually interesting and (based on the shows own history) would have been kept alive and redeemed, to some of the worst art and animation within a series own show when compared to previous series.Fairy Tail started off with a blazing fire but has sadly gone out like a puff of smoke with no fire in it\'s belly. It\'s gone from someone wonderful and amazing to a utter joke and one that\'s not even funny.Closing Note:I had reason to believe that this season was made not because the studio wanted it, but because of fan entitlement and fan backlash for not having the last season. And the publisher jumped on as their eye turned to money signs and they could see how easily they could make dough from it. As such the product is bad because there is no longer love, heart and appreciation put into it.EDIT: This season is by far the worst in the life time of this franchise. It has massive plot holes that it not only digs deeper then they already were but creates entire new ones for no reason other their to give a excuse to try and help force the plot along. It\'s contrived, shoddy and does nothing but slap you in the face repeatedly and insults your intelligence as a viewer the entire time while also leading you to believe that serious questions that have been created WILL be answered but never bothers to.This series started off very strong and it wasn\'t till this last season that it fell to very far from where it once stood. It\'s a joke and a joke that no one is laughing at. I used to love this franchise, characters and the story, but I can\'t be bothered to care anymore after the train wreck of a ""Final Season"". And based on what I am seeing there\'s supposed to another entire Arc called the ""100 Year Quest Arc"" and good lord please don\'t let that become a thing. The show just need to stop existing now after how bad this ""Final"" season turned out to be. We don\'t need more from the abysmal season.', ""The first 2 seasons were fine but not the best. But this final season is so random, it's like they ran out of ideas and kept putting whatever comes to their mind. Too many characters and too many meaningless twists that will make your brain hurt. At one point I stopped reading the subtitle because it is pointless, just fights and cliches of deriving your power from your friends.I was hopping to see more development on the romantic side of the story, but the magakas decided to keep it silly and cringe-worthy, the ending is bad and not interesting at all.I had to...finish it because I started watching it in 2012 and that is the only reason. finish it because I started watching it in 2012 and that is the only reason."", 'I was a huge fan of the original series back when it was airing, and despite the plot amour and everything it still was one of my favorite series. Unfortunately after the first series the quality went downhill. The plot amour is at stupid ridiculous levels in this anime. I swear someone dies every episode just to come back to life (this applies to the villains as well). It really takes meaning away from the fights and the sacrifices.If you are a fan of the series you will still find great enjoyment in watching it but its definitely not the same as the first...series.

This final season brings in a new antagonist in the form the New Alvarez Empire which serves as a way to bring all the characters from other guilds and places to defend their home. Each character in the show is finishing their final character arc such as Lucy who meets Brandish a distant friend/ family member as well as learning her family’s history through 400 years. As well as finishing of...the characters arcs the series fills in many gaps left by the previous seasons such as Acnologia and Zeref’s backgrounds and the creation of dragon slayer magic. All in all I think thatFairy Tail: Final Series contributes great world building to the Fairy Tail franchise and a richer sense of history to the narrative.Although I can find many positives about the final series of Fairy Tail there are still many negatives such as the weak battles which consist mostly of the Friendships solves everything cliches or the mostly unnecessary fan service expressed throughout the show. the characters arcs the series fills in many gaps left by the previous seasons such as Acnologia and Zeref’s backgrounds and the creation of dragon slayer magic.

I've been following Fairy Tail since it's begining and it was a commitment for me to finish it, if it weren't, I would have dropped it.So this is supposed to be the finale, with the strongest enemies and the worst situations. It is expected for a finale to hace epic moments and some characters being gone forever, but that doesen't work for Fairy Tail right. Ok so I come from the Naruto and One Piece generation, I am already tired...when anime ends battles because of the friendship power. This has become abusive in this season. If it wasn't friendship, then an amazingly stupid reason make the superpowerfull enemy to be beaten. Like, seariously, I expected better.In my opinion Mashima created characters that he couldn't manage. With characters as Dimaria and Briandish, they could have won the war in a second (not to mention August and Irene, who were shown as a fearful enemy and, well.), but they failed because they weren't taken seriously by its own creator.Let me tell you that I am really disappointed at how lame this anime ended. I didn't expected too much tho, but, really, so shameful. I am angry because, as I said, it has been a commitment and I spent hours and hours at watching this anime and reading this manga and, well, that's how it ends.The final chapter is also very poor... Just an excuse to show you the ships the anime has ended with, as if we didn't knew already. That's not a way to end the story of those relationships. I didn't care that much for that aspect to be honest, but I found it shameful anyway.To sum up, I really need to stop commiting myself into things I don't enjoy. when anime ends battles because of the friendship power.

Fairy Tail is my gateway Anime and when a second season was announced for 2014, I was so excited to finally be able to continue where the first season ended. Now when “Fairy Tail: Final Series” got announced, I was both happy and sad. Yes, another season is always nice to have, but this also meant the franchise is going to end. However, right...now as of typing this review, I kinda wished we didn’t get this “Final Series” at all.Story: 7/10Fairy Tail’s story has always been a hate it or love it kind of thing. The guild runs into enemies who are a lot stronger, gets beaten, to get back up and beat them by the power of friendship, on most occasions. Either you like it or not, the final series is no different in that regard. During this series we got some interesting reveals and backstories, which really answered some questions for me after the first 2 seasons.The story starts straight after the Fairy Tail guild had been disbanded after their battle with Tartaros (Fairy Tail 2014), with Lucy, Natsu and Happy searching for the scattered guild members who all had joined other guilds, to rebuild what Fairy Tail once was. All leading up to their final battle against Zeref/Acnologia.The conclusion of these battles left me a bit unsatisfied. With the introduction of the Spriggan 12, we have had the toughest group ever for the Fairy Tail guild to handle. The defeat of some of these Spriggan 12 was actually alright and I have not much to complain about that. The main issue is the defeat of the biggest antagonist of Fairy Tail, Acnologia, due to the power of friendship. I was never really against this “power of friendship”, but I feel like I was robbed of a really good battle that would have been fitting for a conclusion.Art/Animation: 4/10The Final Series biggest issue. Fairy Tail 2014 gave us a slightly different art, which for me was quite a nice upgrade from the first season. The Final series doesn’t change that at all. Which is not a problem. The problem is the Animation. A1-Pictures/Cloverworks really butchered this. Fairy tail has always had many still images for their action scenes, but the final series really takes the cake, with barely animated fight scenes and guild members shown as silhouettes behind the main character. It’s so lazy animated. Eventho some scenes do look better than others I am still so utterly disappointed at what the Studio(s) have given us. To me personally, it’s not worthy for a Shounen Anime as big as Fairy Tail.Sound: 9/10Always have loved the soundtracks and still do. Voice acting was as great as to be expected. This season had some really nice songs for their Openings and Endings. Solid job done here! No complaints from me.Characters: 10/10This was kinda the reason I kept watching, I love all these characters so much. Don’t expect too much development though.Enjoyment: 5/10As much as I love the characters and sound, my enjoyment was so much less than previous seasons. Mainly due to the lack of Animation and quality of the Art, that I started to realise.. It wouldn’t have hurt to wait another year or two to get an adaptation that is worthy for a conclusion.Overall: 6/10I have never been a critical person, especially when it came to my favorite Anime Series, but this adaptation for me, was a huge disappointment. Rating it a 6/10 is me being generous, cause the love for the franchise is and will always be there. now as of typing this review, I kinda wished we didn’t get this “Final Series” at all.Story: 7/10Fairy Tail’s story has always been a hate it or love it kind of thing.

I got SO attached to the show with time. It took me a little less than 6 months to finish it. I had no reason to watch fairy tail but I still did. I did not even like it at first. But I kept watching. It's a bad habit. I never drop an anime once I start watching.The character design was SO good tho. Mashima sensei designed so many characters with distinct personalities. The supporting characters got so much screen time. Other than these 2 reasons, it's brilliant ost is...another reason Fairy Tail was such a good watch for me. Fairy Tail's ost has become one of my personal fave of all time.The 'power of friendship and love' thing was overused but it's a 2000s shounen so it's acceptable. I also didn't understand why they introduced Raven Tail when it had no role later. Sometimes I got bored and increased the speed. But I still watched all the OVAs movies and 'fillers'. There was excessive fanservice sometimes but it didn't spoil the show it was rather funny.Fairy Tail was a long journey. There were many flaws but it was a nice ending imo. The idea behind Fairy Tail's name is so cute xD (just wanted to mention this). I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. People who wanna watch a cute, long, funny, less-logical adventure anime will love it.Spoilers ahead--Natsu and gang's 100 year quest, Cheerful Makarov, Zeref and Mavis lovers once again - that's all I needed in the end. I wanted to see Plue once in the end. I also wanted to see more Erza X Jellal and Happy X Charle but it's okay T~TWho knows someday I might rewatch it?

Aye sirrr!! ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ"", 'I would be lying if I said I wasn\'t a total fan of the Fairy Tail series, however, the final series was very underwhelming, and it really hurts to say that.To start off, I genuinely did like where the story wanted to go, but the execution of it was poor. You would expect that fighting against the big bad strong people would come at a cost or some kind of repercussion in order to beat them, but you are wrong. A lot of the ""repercussions"" are fake, they happen, but they get fixed later on in the anime. Like for example: in order to win...a fight, said character has to sacrifice their power to win. But oh, they get this power back later in the anime.This happened multiple times in the anime, especially in the final series and it destroys, what is supposed to be, an emotional moment.Also the fact that they literally reused an ""OMG"" moment from the first season doesn\'t help either. (If you don\'t know what I mean, I am talking about Gray.)Coming to the art, I don\'t have a problem with the artstyle in this show, however the animations were poor and didn\'t feel magical to me. For example: A powerful attack is just some rainbow-glowing thing. Yeah... doesn\'t really do it for me. For an anime that\'s about magic and fighting, they really could\'ve done much better in my opinion.The fanservice is okay-ish, but gotten worse over the years. (How many times did we see Lucy censored-nude?)I\'ve always loved the voice acting and the music of Fairy Tail, so there is not much to say here.I enjoyed the beginning of the final series, but the more I watched, the more my enjoyment went down tbh.I am hoping the 100 Year Quest will be better in terms of writing and animations. a fight, said character has to sacrifice their power to win.

Also I didn't watch this entire season because I'm not going to watch 50 episodes of something I'm not enjoying.Me and my brother loved Fairy Tail back in the day, it was emotional and entertaining. I have good memories of chatting about Fairy Tail with my bro but this final season sends Fairy Tail off with a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like this show used to have a solid story, there was always enough of a mystery with Natsu and Igneel and between Natsu and Zeref to...keep the suspense up but this season it just felt like there was no real plot, it's all just a huge war with a bunch of pointless fights. None of the villains were introduced well and there's just too many of them, I didn't feel like there was any intense conflict. The manga artist must have thought you need to have the same amount of villains as heroes which just isn't true in my opinion. I think a show is much better with a few amazing villains than a bunch of average villains.I either out grew this show, finally realized what all the people criticizing it were saying or this season was just bad compared to the last. I think this season just didn't have the magic Fairy Tail used to have. The final season is disappointing but I definitely have great memories of Fairy Tail as a whole, I don't regret watching anything. keep the suspense up but this season it just felt like there was no real plot, it's all just a huge war with a bunch of pointless fights.

The built-up to the final villain of the series was greatly portrayed as a solid villain and had some actual hype to it. However, the goal for the villain was kind of poorly written. The other big baddie had an actual reason and I could understand where the villain was coming from, but the OG villain of the show was written as ""bad to be bad."" However, this was not my only complaint. Some of the animation scenes were reused (a lot) and some scenes were stretched...out to make the episode hit that time mark, or it felt that way.To be clear, this review is made by an all-time fan of Fairy Tail. It is my favorite anime, despite it having this ending and having some bad moments, but it is still one of my favorites to this day.

Don't read if you haven't finished the anime!Fairy Tail as the name implies is literally a Fairy Tale. No one dies, everyone gets happy endings, the damsel-in-distress (Lucy) always gets rescued, the moral is a Nakama/Friendship conquers all, injuries are irrelevant and never permanent, and every single villain is a sympathetic villain and are redeemed.I have so many different things I want to criticize I don't even know where to start; the craziest part is I still like this anime. Every character is amazingly well-developed, their backstories, friendships, and bonding is genuine! I swear there are times I thought two different authors were...writing Fairy Tail. One who can write epic and beautiful stories about characters and one who writes overly-indulgent, cliche plot lines.Since the story both started with and ended with Lucy, I was really hoping to see more epic-ness from her. I like her a lot but the author and the show are intent on keeping her the weakest member of the main cast. In the entire final arc, she technically never had a full fight or defeated anyone. That's so disappointing. We never got to see the full scale of her magic abilities. We didn't even get to see her spirits in the end. She also never collected all 12 keys. Ugh, so many things left undone with Lucy.However, the single most disappointing thing in this anime is the fact that there are NO consequences. Aside from Igneel, no one dies. Cheria, who should never have been able to use magic again, can still use magic; Natsu's right arm was injured severely but by the end he's totally fine; Ultear doesn't die even after spending all of her time to reverse time by a minute; Makarov should have died after spending all his magic on Fairy Law; Minerva is turned into a demon by demon blood but is somehow Human again; Acnologia is never acknowledged as the mass murderer he is...my point is there are never any consequences. Everything works out in the main character's favor and that is so disappointing.From the beginning to the end of the show, no one lost anything and everyone just gained and gained. That sounds like it should be a good thing, but it does not make for good storytelling. This method dampens our ability to empathize with the characters. Like why feel bad for them if we KNOW everything works out?The last critical note about this anime is the production value. I normally don't pay attention to this stuff, but the art production was seriously CRAP. The freeze frames, the character's expressions when they are seen from a distance, the number of reused shots were ridiculously poor. The grayed-out background characters is the worst animation I have ever seen from an anime. It really sucks that such a wonderful anime did not have the budget for better animating.Okay, negative criticism aside. There's a reason why I stuck with the show as long as I did.Erza is the single most epic female character ever written! She is never shaken morally! Like that never happens with female characters! Erza could have been crippled by her past or could have been emotionally-stunted; instead, we are delighted by this wonderfully empathetic and STRONG badass female character! Erza is everything I want to see in a strong-female character who can balance and own her femininity and strength!Natsu, as a shounen protagonist, is surprisingly refreshing. He's not driven by the need to be the Strongest Wizard, the King of the Pirates, the Hokage of Kohoha, the Greatest Super Hero...He's primary objective is and always has been to find his father and protect his family. These are traits other Shounen heroes share, but I love that Natsu's goal isn't to be the strongest in his world. He also breaks the stereotype of being a dumb, hot-head. He's still a talk-with-my-fists brash idiot, but he's not actually stupid. In missions, he does contribute intellectually as well as being a strong arm.Gray had the potential to end up as the titular loner, emo-wannabe, dark-tall-and-brooding type of character. Instead, he is a dynamic, heart-warming character who genuinely cares for the friendships in his life and doesn't have to be all macho to express it. This particular season was such a turning point for Gray; every time we expect him to go down a dark path he couldn't recover from, he didn't. His motivation was always fueled by love, never clouded by things like revenge or regret.As a bonus, Natsu and Gray did not end up like the whole-frikken Sasuke-Naruto rivals relationship. They were ACTUALLY friends and rivals! They don't have to get along 100% of the time to be friends. They can fight and challenge each other without loosing sight of their friendship: AWESOME!Lastly, Lucy is not a jealous or whiny hag even though she was designed to fit that stereotype. She's also not romance obsessed or boy-crazed! She values friendship from both her female and male friends equally! Although I personally want her to be Erza-level of badassery, I also respect that not every member of the main cast HAS to be a powerhouse. Her greatest weapons are her intelligence and her kindness. She could have easily been the wallowing-in-my-insecurities and I'm-not-strong-enough type of character, but nope. We got the delightful, fight-till-the-end, always look ahead, positive celestial mage that is Lucy Heartfilia. writing Fairy Tail. One who can write epic and beautiful stories about characters and one who writes overly-indulgent, cliche plot lines.Since the story both started with and ended with Lucy, I was really hoping to see more epic-ness from her. I like her a lot but the author and the show are intent on keeping her the weakest member of the main cast. In the entire final arc, she technically never had a full fight or defeated anyone. That's so disappointing. We never got to see the full scale of her magic abilities. We didn't even get to see her spirits in the end. She also never collected all 12 keys.

It\'s been about a month since I finished the show, but this is the first time I can start writing out my thoughts without tears XDAs usual there were a few episodes that were lacking (less than previous seasons), but overall it\'s absolutely the best season of Fairy Tail and a more than fitting end to such an epic show, although I wish it would go on forever and ever.The soundtrack is on point as...always and perfectly accentuates the battles and emotional scenes.The animation and art is gorgeous, and little Mavis as absolutely adorable!The story:SPOILER ALERT!Since this is the end and an emotional roller coaster I am finding it very hard to emphasize my points without referencing the plot and MAJOR SPOILERS in it. So if you have not seen the whole thing yet do so before reading on.Like I said before this season is the very definition of an emotional roller coaster. I have never cried as much for anything really as I did in this final season of this show, and I am talking about both tears of joy and sorrow.Lets begin with the heartbreaking stuff. Oh boy... Well first we have Makarov\'s sacrifice and goodbye. OMFG... I was in a puddle on the floor ugly crying like a newborn baby.Then we have Mavis\' backstory which is devastating. I was saying to myself the entire time she is not real, she was made up by Mavis because of her overwhelming loneliness, and still, when time came to say goodbye it tore my heart to shreds. LOL, just typing this out is making my eyes water.On to happier times: I don\'t think I have ever actually shed tears of joy before watching this show. There were 2 points in particular were I did so, and those were when Makarov moved and at the very end when we see the reincarnated Mavis and Zeref meet again with no memories of their passed tragic lives to hopefully live a long and happy life this time around (getting a little choked up rn). That and along with Lucy\'s words I think were the perfect ending to this amazing show because as with the rest of it, it was overall bitter sweet. We know they live on but we will never again see their adventures with our own eyes.I\'ve seen some people online complaining about Makarovs revival, but I could literally not be happier that they chose to do it, and I don\'t think it takes anything away from his sacrifice as at the time it seemed completely impossible that he survived, especially as the episodes went on and we were show shots of his lifeless body, so the emotional weight of his decision remains even though ultimately he did not have to pay the ultimate price.As for the characters, the biggest change I would have to say is Lucy. She is no longer useless in fights!!! FINALLY! Although I did love the ""Lucy Kick"" and ""Lucy Punch"" now she can actually hold her own in more of the fights, and that was a very welcome change.Another major change as far as characters go is Mavis. With her backstory finally and fully revealed we can\'t continue to see her as a pure unspoiled child like figure anymore, and in fact we can now see her true self warts and all.Erza is no longer the immovable mountain she was in past seasons. Yes she is still incredibly strong, but we also get to see a more vulnerable side to her when the toll of all the physical and psychological trauma she suffered over the years surfaces. So we get to see a more human side to her and not just Titannia the Fairy Queen or the adorable sweets loving airhead, although she still has a LOT of badass scenes and fights this season.OK, gonna have to stop here. If I go on now I will be crying again. Gotta find a comedy ASAP! always and perfectly accentuates the battles and emotional scenes.The animation and art is gorgeous, and little Mavis as absolutely adorable!The story:SPOILER ALERT!Since this is the end and an emotional roller coaster I am finding it very hard to emphasize my points without referencing the plot and MAJOR SPOILERS in it.

I feel cheated. The last fight could have been made more epic but hey. Analyzing the anime, the truth is always handled with the same plot, a stronger and stronger enemy appears; then natsu beats him, after beating him they become friends because yes, period. The truth is, I don't know what it has that hooks you with its simple plot, the truth is, and well, I think the development of couples is fine, but that last touch is missing....I recommend it if you want to see a shonen that will always give you the same thing, that is to say that the protagonist always wins but always.En español:acabó de terminar de ver la última temporada de  fairy y la verdad no me dieron ni un beso de natsu con Lucy me siento estafado. La última pelea la podrían haber hecho más épica pero bueno. Analizando el anime la verdad siempre se maneja con la misma trama aparece un enemigo más y más fuerte; entonces natsu le gana, después de ganarle se vuelven amigos porque si y punto. La verdad no se que tiene que te engancha con su trama simple la verdad y bueno creo que el desarrollo de las parejas está bien pero falta ese último toque. Lo recomiendo si quieres ver un shonen que te va a dar siempre lo mismo, es decir que el protagonista gane siempre pero siempre.

The reason for this is they setup the anime very very well. At every stage before the final season they built hype well and carried it well through each arc. But in the final season they threw out all the seriousness out the window. Zeref was feared, he was a man around whom animals couldn\'t even live if they come into his vicinity. But they didn\'t utilise the fear of Zeref well in the anime. And the same can be said for Acnologia. The man who killed Igneel just got...defeated by the cringe power of friendship. The end was very rushed and for this reason the final season was horrible to watch. But besides these 2 characters, the rest of the season was pretty good but we all know that if the final antagonist is boring as hell, it really reduces the appeal of the anime. It makes you go ""so what was all this for"". I miss the old Fairy Tail. defeated by the cringe power of friendship.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISKIn the land of Fiore, where magical happenings are a part of everyday life, we meet Lucy Heartfilia, an up-and-coming celestial mage. She is in search of the guild known as Fairy Tale, the most popular and destructive guild in all of the land. However, for better or worse, she happens to me Natsu Dragneel. Natsu not only saves her from a scamming wizard, but is also one of the members of said guild. With an open invitation and a...thirst for adventure, Lucy gladly follows him to his guild he calls home. With the gleaming thought that a new journey was opening right before her, she sets out to create new memories and make new friends!Fairy Tail is a true Shonen: packed with action, comedy,  numerous adventures, unbreakable friendships and a knack for getting into trouble anywhere they go.Fairy Tail is one of the funniest animes I have watched and Happy (the blue cat) is the best, he is funny, loving & just straight up makes Fairy Tail better to watch.Fairy Tail starts off very slow and the main character progression happens in season 2+. Lucy gets her story first where you find out.Lucy Character Progression SpoilerLucy is a celestial wizard who joins Fairy Tail and you find out about her mother who passed away and her father who is a very wealthy business owner. Lucys dad never pays Lucy any attention and only care about money, at first.Fairy Tail has so much fighting that its hard to sometimes keep track of when a character will be serious in a fight or just be playing with there opponents.Sadly most of the fights in Fairy Tail felt rushed to me.  Either the fights will go off on other people fighting who you don’t care about or they will only be maybe 2 minutes long.Don’t get me wrong some of the fight are very OP and amazing but sadly it just didn’t feel like a Goku vs really anyone fight. There was never any way to really tell if Natsu was taking a fight serious or there would be moments when Natsu would beat a crazy powerful enemy one fight then be beat by a weaker enemy the next.Overall I started really liking Fairy Tail in the Tenrou Island ARC & again in the Grand Magic Games ARC!Towards the end when they started explaining Natsu’s story is when I completely fell in love with the anime, at this point Natsu is extremely strong, Lucy is OP, Erza is practically a god at this point. But really Fairy Tail is not a bad anime, there are people out there who think that there are alot of better animes out there but if you have time try it out and see how you like it. thirst for adventure, Lucy gladly follows him to his guild he calls home.

It\'s massive, overwhelming, and most invincible. It seemed like the author was like, ""Alright, since it\'s the final series, let\'s give it all, make everyone overpowered."" They maximized the power potential of each characters but the storyline, it\'s still mediocre as ever.  The cyclical pattern is still evident. It still runs where the antagonists appear with tremendous and destructible power, and the fairies...will fight back but then the foes will storytell their back stories first, so as the soon they will be defeated, the audience will be drawn attached to the characters as they will feel sorry for them.Nonetheless, they managed to expand the length of the series upon revolving the battle chances of one character to another. For instance, Erza who was able to defeat Ajeel, Neinhart, and Lady Irene. However, just like other Fairy Tail members, they are partnered with some other side characters as they will resolve the remaining scars from their own history. Like Erza, who remedied her past with Jellal and Kagura, and also Lady Irene.This is how this arc will differ from the other previous arcs, as it is established tougher and almost impregnable, it will take two to three people to achieve victory. The Final Series is a power performance. This invincible aspect of the opponents will make you bite onto the series as you hold on to the question, ""How will they pass through them? Or could they?"" Personally, I would not deny that the battle scenes still interested me, I even rewatch from time to time the battle of Lady Irene against Wendy and Erza, because Wendy is best girl.Moreover, discussing how it concluded, most animes choose a certain path, either will it be emotional or excellence (for great animes, they manage to consist both of these options). The Fairy Tail, at least for me, chose the path of the emotional. No, it will not cater a tear-jerker moment, but it will emotionally invoke your attachment and catharsis that it invested within you. It will remind you of that principle that this series held on from the very beginning of the series, and it is the bond and friendship.Some audience hated it, but Mashima consistently showed us what was his reason in creating the series. He remained faithful that this series is about this relationship of family and camaraderie until the final battle of the entire Magnolia. You might not agree with this, but his faithfulness despite the amount of criticisms, for me, is commendable.Overall, it was not as remarkable on how an anime should conclude, although I am completely aware about the presence of 100 Year Quest manga, but for a great series alone to reach its denouement, it was not concluded as magnificent to call it GOAT for a long-running series. I might have exemplified its mediocrity but I still enjoyed the series in general. The roller coaster emotion was a great experience, and the characters are truly memorable and outstanding on their own.Fairy Tail, you have been a great friend. will fight back but then the foes will storytell their back stories first, so as the soon they will be defeated, the audience will be drawn attached to the characters as they will feel sorry for them.Nonetheless, they managed to expand the length of the series upon revolving the battle chances of one character to another.

I believe the major reason wasn\'t that they made any bad decisions with the story, but it is the fact that they didn\'t change anything at all.It could also be the result of abusing the shounen loop of ""get beaten up, remember your friends, stand up, and beat your way out"".  This is Fairy Tail in a nutshell. You will see nothing more than that.So just before watching the final season; I sort of knew what I was going to see, but I still finished it just because I don\'t like to drop series and...unfortunately everything went as expected. unfortunately everything went as expected.', ""the final season is awesome...sooo loved it..FairyTail is one of my top favourite anime and it has a great story and overall it is one awesome anime..i love FairyTail.i'm sad its finished though because FairyTail keeps one longing for more adventures and i wish they would have given a clear explanation on how every couple ends up together as this ending makes one wonder what can happen between them and are they a couple or not and so on..but the overall story of FairyTail is really outstanding..the art of the series is well made..the sound and music is so beautiful and heart warmingthe characters are...so very cool..my top favourite are obviously the main characters-natsu,lucy,erza and gray<3the overall enjoyment level was maxed up so high i cant even put it into words..i sooooo love this anime and a biggest fan of FairyTail <3 <3it is very fun to watch,makes me cry at few emotional scenes and you just cant stop watching it although they ended the series..it will stay on forever in my heart and hopefully the eternal adventure may continue one day..hoping for the best :D :D <3 <3 <3 so very cool..my top favourite are obviously the main characters-natsu,lucy,erza and gray<3the overall enjoyment level was maxed up so high i cant even put it into words..i sooooo love this anime and a biggest fan of FairyTail <3 <3it is very fun to watch,makes me cry at few emotional scenes and you just cant stop watching it although they ended the series..it will stay on forever in my heart and hopefully the eternal adventure may continue one day..hoping for the best :D :D <3 <3 <3"", 'Alright, what can I say here? As a long time Fairy Tail fan, I was hyped to see this finally getting animated and oh boy did it not disappoint. Let\'s break this down shall we?Story (9/10): The story is actually surprisingly in-depth, and it\'s something I loved seeing. I won\'t spoil anything, but seeing the amount of depth and seeing how well some characters link into the plot made it so much more interesting. The only thing really holding it back from a perfect score is just me wishing it was expanded on just a tad bit more, but beyond that, awesome job Mashima.Art/Animation (8/10):...This is the lowest score you\'ll see here, but the reason it\'s so high is because the art style offsets the animation a bit. The art style is a nice blend between the lighter 2009 tone and the darker 2014 tone, and it\'s exactly what I was hoping for in a blend like this. So many scenes look so crisp with this art style, it\'s actually amazing. Now, for the animation... it\'s a literal PowerPoint presentation for most of the fights. I won\'t hold this against them TOO much because they were on a lower budget (but it\'s still gonna dock em down a bit), but on the other hand, other fights looked amazing, especially near the end (which makes sense).Sound (10/10): Here\'s a no-brainer. Fairy Tail\'s soundtrack has always been god-tier, and bringing over tracks from both the 2009 and 2014 series (some of the 2009 ones even got revamped), along with adding new soundtracks like ""Infiltrate the Alvarez Empire"" just made the experience all the more beautiful. A+ I say!Character (10/10): The characters are just as lovable as always, and the new ones continue this trend in spades. Characters like Brandish, Acnologia (with his revealed backstory and greater character depth), Irene, and August are all wonderful additions, and we can\'t forget about my dude Zeref either. However, Wendy remains top dog as the best Fairy Tail character in my opinion. Seeing her growth shown even in this final series only reinforces that belief of mine.Enjoyment (10/10): What can I say here? Fairy Tail is Fairy Tail, which is to say, absolutely amazing. I enjoyed so much of this series. While there are complaints such as ""nakama power,"" which is actually quite literal since magic power increases in response to emotions, as noted by Makarov very early into Fairy Tail (people tend to miss that for some reason), the fan service (which I never really was bothered by, especially with how many anime have fan service nowadays), and the fake-outs (anyone that has seen the series will know what I mean), which still didn\'t bother me too much, I looked past all of it, and as a result, I saw a masterpiece.Overall (10/10): Fairy Tail never fails to provide a wonderful series of episodes for me to just binge whenever I wish, and it reigns supreme as my absolute favorite anime to date. You might say I\'m too easily impressed, but as you can see from my list, that is certainly not the case, as I too can feel disappointment... I just simply didn\'t feel it here. I expected to feel disappointed with how so many people were expressing their own discontent with the final series, but I just didn\'t see it. It was an absolute blast, and I\'m so hyped for the future of Fairy Tail. This is the lowest score you\'ll see here, but the reason it\'s so high is because the art style offsets the animation a bit. The art style is a nice blend between the lighter 2009 tone and the darker 2014 tone, and it\'s exactly what I was hoping for in a blend like this. So many scenes look so crisp with this art style, it\'s actually amazing. Now, for the animation... it\'s a literal PowerPoint presentation for most of the fights. I won\'t hold this against them TOO much because they were on a lower budget (but it\'s still gonna dock em down a bit), but on the other hand, other fights looked amazing, especially near the end (which makes sense).Sound (10/10): Here\'s a no-brainer. Fairy Tail\'s soundtrack has always been god-tier, and bringing over tracks from both the 2009 and 2014 series (some of the 2009 ones even got revamped), along with adding new soundtracks like ""Infiltrate the Alvarez Empire"" just made the experience all the more beautiful. A+ I say!Character (10/10): The characters are just as lovable as always, and the new ones continue this trend in spades. Characters like Brandish, Acnologia (with his revealed backstory and greater character depth), Irene, and August are all wonderful additions, and we can\'t forget about my dude Zeref either. However, Wendy remains top dog as the best Fairy Tail character in my opinion. Seeing her growth shown even in this final series only reinforces that belief of mine.Enjoyment (10/10): What can I say here? Fairy Tail is Fairy Tail, which is to say, absolutely amazing. I enjoyed so much of this series. While there are complaints such as ""nakama power,"" which is actually quite literal since magic power increases in response to emotions, as noted by Makarov very early into Fairy Tail (people tend to miss that for some reason), the fan service (which I never really was bothered by, especially with how many anime have fan service nowadays), and the fake-outs (anyone that has seen the series will know what I mean), which still didn\'t bother me too much, I looked past all of it, and as a result, I saw a masterpiece.Overall (10/10): Fairy Tail never fails to provide a wonderful series of episodes for me to just binge whenever I wish, and it reigns supreme as my absolute favorite anime to date. You might say I\'m too easily impressed, but as you can see from my list, that is certainly not the case, as I too can feel disappointment... I just simply didn\'t feel it here. I expected to feel disappointed with how so many people were expressing their own discontent with the final series, but I just didn\'t see it. It was an absolute blast, and I\'m so hyped for the future of Fairy Tail.', ""This was a pretty well done finisher I'd say. It's not over yet tho to be exactI mean, anyone who is familiar with Fairy Tail, should be able to pretty much foresee what happens because it's Fairy Tail after all.You won't miss any of the Fairy Tail cliches, like it or not.That also means the music is hella amazing as always tho and the characters are pretty fun to watch.The story was all in all pretty interesting, they also had a nice finisher at the end. However, the pacing was kinda bad sometimes I'd say.And while the story was pretty interesting, it's like I...already mentioned pretty predictable because it basically reuses already seen plots and all.So overall a 7/10 by me, anyone who likes Fairy Tail should watch it, naturally. already mentioned pretty predictable because it basically reuses already seen plots and all.So overall a 7/10 by

before watching this final season because i thought that this final season would never come and i grow tired of waiting so i read the manga to finally know it\'s conclusion and because i already read the manga so i already know what to expect from this final series.this series sure brings back memories from the past when i first watched this series back in my childhood days and it gives more feels into it with the music and voice acting than the...manga. i know most of the people said that this was the worst arc of fairy tail simply just because they don\'t get what they expect from this show such as ""darker story"" where someone actually died or some more ""conclusive"" ending where they can finally see their ships come together.when i read the manga i felt the same way too as i really get frustrated and disappointed that this isn\'t a very conclusive ending and like seriously still a very naive story i would say. but, after watching this final season of fairy tail in anime version after 2 years of the manga\'s ending, i realized something.fairy tail was a very joyful show that focused on friendship from the bginning that even the word ""nakama"" cannot be separated from the show. and also fairy tail is very focused on adventure genre and very often in the show mentioned about a ""never ending tale"" or that ""friend\'s forever"" tagline. for me, both of this things are the soul of the show itself and what makes me personally fall in love with this show the first time i watched it. i know now that we all have grown and not a kid anymore so we need a ""darker"" story. but for me, if fairy tail\'s story somehow turns out to be ""dark"" at the end then it kinda lost it\'s meaning. so, i personally think that this kind of ending just showing that hiro is being consistent of his work and refuse to erase the soul of the show.even so, i still agree with the majority of people that said this arc\'s story was very rushed. the pace of the plot is just too fast that it kinda lose it\'s true meaning. the power of their new opponent or even their own new power is very vague and poorly described. the fighting scene is also very fast paced and not intriguing to watch. although the goal of the enemy and their reason to fight is pretty clear except for one of them, the rushed story telling made it look/sounds unreasonable or stupid.i would say this isn\'t a good show technically and clearly not for everyone. the animation is bad, many plot holes, rushed narration, naive story, repetitive character design, and only the music that\'s truly great. but if i want to be subjective, i really love the idea of magical world, magic guild, adventures with funny and joyful characters, strong bonds between every character, friendship power, and of course the always happy ending.in conclusion, this show is far from being the best, may even be considered as a bad show. but it is still simply my favorite because it has a soul in it and i can feel a strong

of the first series, literally watching the entire things within weeks, and finding the arcs, characters, and developments of the characters, fun and engaging, I can say it\'s one of my more guilty pleasures to watch because I genuinely enjoyed it when watching it.. but this is only applied to the first series, The second series in itself was a bit less interestesting, and I didn\'t vibe with it as much as I did the first one, but still managed to...enjoy it overall, and found the series great, I think Fairy Tail Zero is still one of my favorite arcs from the entire series, which what made me rank the [2014] so high...Fairy Tail: Final Series... Is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the process of watching it, and I found myself still engaged with the story, but... I dunno... I have mixed feelings on it..Let\'s start off with the things I enjoyed..I enjoyed some of the villains of the season, they were fun in their own way.. More specifically Achnelogia, Brandish, Irene, and Austin. Those four are major stand outs to me, Irene most especially, I found her back story interesting, her being ruthless, and also being Erza\'s biological mother too. She was a really cool villain overall..I liked the concept of Natsu being END himself, It was revealed at the end of the Tartarus arc, but it was now brought into full swing here in the final series, I liked the concept, and the idea but the execution of it is ... well... It could have been better but then again, allot of things could have been better, and of all the things that could be better, this was probably handled the best.Now... Some of things about this series I did not really like...How low the stakes are for the characters.. The heroes most specifically. Yeah, as the series went on and seeing the amounts of characters being killed, literally dying or on the brink of death, only to be brought back to life with some rather plot armored excuse as to WHY they are still alive, it got old really quickly.. Gajeel, despite him literally being my FAVORITE CHARACTER in the entire series, died at one point only to be brought back to life due to some ""Technicality"", Makorav literally dying due to a rather touching sacrifice, and would have been SUCH a huge moment for the series... but NO, he stayed dead for like 10 episodes, and then is brought back to life... for no reason. Mira got killed at one point, only for Brandish to shrink her wound and keep her live.. just allot of examples of characters ""dying"" and then being brought to life, with either explinations that are more so plot armor to keep the heroes alive, OR no reason at all, they just get to live..In fact, I am surprised that they kept Mavis and by extension Zeref dead, I half expected them to ressurect them and- Oh wait yeah, the final episode.. Oh but y\'know, they\'re not them but still. =~= ...Just with all these kills, and ressurections out of no where it REALLY lowers the overall stakes of the entire story, we KNOW these characters are gonna be live, so Why bother? To tear jerk the audience? Pretty much, It might be emotional for those who watch THIS season first before the previous two, but for those who are caught up completely, the moments grow stale.. The only characters that die in this series are the villains.. There are NO stakes at all.The whole time travel plot was confusing, I feel like we could have done without this whole ""Dragon Slayers being brought to the future 400 years ago to defeat Achnelogia\' BS, it just really complicated things and admittedly it was hard to follow at times.The characters getting random power ups, basic plot armor...I also do NOT like how the story just straight up refuses to make any of these characters official, with the exception of Gajeel and Levi, and Elfman and Evergreen... All of these couples like Erza and Jelal, Gray and Juvia, Laxus and Freed [Fuck you, they are a couple. You can\'t convince me otherswise.], they just leave us guessing and quite frankly this ""Will They, Won\'t They"" trope is really old and annoying, and I wish they\'d give us something other than alluding to them being a thing ""allegedly."" Don\'t get me STARTED on Natsu and Lucy, literally that pair goes no where.Overall, Fairy Tail\'s Final Series, was a disappointment, but in it\'s own weird way, I still enjoyed the process of watching it... If you wanna watch it, go ahead, especially if you\'ve already watched the first two seasons and wanna watch the last one to finish it completely BUT if you don\'t? Then don\'t...Really it all comes down to your tastes....I give this a 5/10 overall....

To be honest, I felt like a big portion of the reviews it got were exaggerated. The anime is really enjoyable and the characters are lovable, with some really good twists along with the plot. Yes it had...a heavy plot armor and a few cringe moments, but I mean that's nothing new for shonen types and it doesn't get too much in the way of enjoyment. Fanservice is definitely heavier than usual, but again I think it's something that can be easily overlooked, and even enjoyable in a few cases.Just wanted to let this out there because I feel like sometimes people will just hate for no reason or for the trend. I don't mean to attack anyone, of course, everyone will have differences in opinion but this is mostly directed to people who like me, might have been hesitant to even give it a shot after trying all the supposedly great and popular shonen and being afraid it might not meet the hype, I'd say definitely give the first few eps a chance.Overall enjoyement : 8.5/ 10 a heavy plot armor and a few cringe moments, but I mean that's nothing new for shonen types and it doesn't get too much in the way of enjoyment.

My one problem with FMA Brotherhood when compared to the original FMA series was the sense of completeness that the viewer is stuck with.  Almost every single element of the plot is resolved or answered, including events that link to time way back in the past.  What is left in the...future?  What else is there to be unraveled historically?  Unfortunately the viewer is given details of the significant events, so there is little room left for exploration.  In the final episode of Fairy Tail, it is shown that members continue with quests and so forth, but the effort is almost futile, considering that two major ""God"" characters have been defeated by the guild after over 400 years of struggle. Defeating the main (and presumably strongest enemies over generations of time) suggests that there is really little left to encounter that the guild would even struggle to fight.I think the show would have been better left off after the Fairy Tail Zero arc (Zero).  Zero introduced snip-its of history that excite the viewer with backstory, without providing information out about the whole world and all the characters - instead just a select few locations and people are shown.  The arc ends with a present-time disbanded Fairy Tail taking steps to reuniting again, which was a great ending in my opinion.  There is a promise of hope and more adventures to come; it appears that Zeref has been taken down for the time being and that Fairy Tail will one day take down Acnologia.  While there are some other unsolved plot elements such as Gray seeking out END, the outcome can be left to the viewer for interpretation.The Final Season fails to pull in the audience much at all.  There are so many characters introduced that they appear quickly and die quickly.  The same trend can be seen in several elements of the plot.  The fight between Natsu and Gray is lackluster in the sense that is happens abruptly, the death of Erza\'s mother is brief and quick, Acnologia\'s take-down is somewhat uninspired, and the list goes on.  Fairy Tail is known for its emotional fight scenes - where did they go?  While I criticize the fight between Natsu and Gray, the ""death"" of Makarov and the fight that Erza intervenes was probably the highlight of the entire season for me.  After seeing Fairy Tail drag on elements like these so well for 300+ episodes, I feel like it could have been pulled better.One big problem I had was the lingering plot of Natsu\'s fate.  When Natsu came to the conclusion that he only wanted to be himself and suppressed the two seeds growing inside of him, I thought the plot was case-closed.  Natsu was still bound to the book, however, and Lucy and Happy continue to dread Natsu\'s fate until almost the end of the season.  I think that plot could have ended with Natsu\'s realization, thus saving room to expand on the more pressing issues of Zeref and Acnologia.Characters seemed not to grow much, with some of them actually reverting.  Gray seems lifeless when Lucy is trying to rewrite Natsu\'s END book and the English dub really makes Gray seem like a robot; I hadn\'t seen Gray this bad since the time he seemingly betrayed Natsu and befriended Daphne in earlier seasons.  Natsu does not power up in any bizarre way like in previous seasons.  I really thought Natsu would become a hybrid dragon demon or gain an insane pure-Natsu form, but the closest thing we get is his ally-assisted rainbow form towards the end of the season.  Zeref and Mavis come to some kind of realization, but it seems unclear and like both characters just had a quick change of heart instead of undergoing any kind of events to propel the changes.  Let\'s also just point out all of the characters that do not really have room to develop also, including the Spriggan 12 - who I really expected to see more of that from, especially considering how much they were shown towards the beginning of the season.  There are also a lot of elements that repeat themselves in no particularly new way, such as Gray trying to use the forbidden freeze spell once again.  While it was a neat tactic to scare Zeref, the scene where Gray attempts to use the same exact spell could have been handled better to not make it seem like previous events - even if the spell was an upgraded version of some sort - just something.The music of the final season is okay.  I feel like there was one  fighting track that was just played too often and then the music lost its impact.  The opening songs were great as always, but other than the first of the season, ""The Power of the Dream,"" none of the openings were mentally memorable for me.  The animation of the show is clean, but not very stylistic like the original series, which was kind of disappointing considering that there were no neat locations to take advantage of the higher quality animation.The final season of Fairy Tail was good and I wanted to see the plot unfold, but I just didn\'t get the same feels as other seasons, causing the season to drag a bit amidst all the action.  There is a lot that happen, but there just is not enough time to let everything receive attention.  The magic counsel, the fates of the Spriggan 12, and so forth are barely given any attention at the end.  Finally, the end was just bad.  Why Zeref and Mavis are shown again with different names/identities is beyond me and I did not like that there was a party - it just felt boring and less sentimental than I was hoping for the conclusion of a show that is founded on the idea of emotional sentiment.  While I haven\'t read the manga, I hope the manga does the story more justice than the anime, because I really like Fairy Tail and hope for more in the future from the franchise. future?

Needless to say that my wish was granted just as much as my other wishes for Fairy Tail.After witnessing Juvia beg Gray for over a decade didn't we at least deserve to know if she succeeded.Couldn't we see Jellal gain forgiveness or did we deserve to remember him always in self loath.do we have to wonder forever if there was someone that captured Laxus heart or is it up to us to imagine him with whomever we want.The worst of it is that this time around fairy tail is over and we have to lay judgement, there is tomorrow to hide behind, no glimmer of hope that something might come to pass.So as I so the last episode I wasn't disappointed, because one can get disappointed only if one expects something which I have long  since not done with fairy tail.I feel just a bit amazed to see how low can they fall.Fairy Tail had everything to be a great show except someone to write it well.So now I will remember Fairy tail as a natsu that never got to grow no matter the years, as someone that slayed dragons but failed to confess his feelings.A Juvia that fought in vain for the love of someone that never even bothered to explain how he felt.A Jellal that never got to confess his feelings even though he damn well knew he was loved back.I could've forgiven fairy tail for all the things that didn't make sense if at least what was hinted over and over again would come to pass.I don't want to make my own assumptions I want to see it with my own eyes but apparently I will not.Bye bye Fairy Tail.If only you had been written by someone who knew what he was doing reach the potential it has, and then one day you find yourself finishing the last episode and you realize there is no tomorrow to put your hopes into.I remember how many times I hoped for some Jellal screen time, I never got it but still there was a tiny litle part of me that continued to hope that some  day maybe I'd get to see Jellal preferably in a situation where he doesn't humiliate himself.

I never read reviews of shows till after I watch them because I never find them helpful and I end up not watching a good show. I am glad that I stick to that mind set because boy the negative were not helpful at all. It makes me even wonder if they watched them our if someone is paying to put them on here.Art/ animation  10/10The art is no different from the first two seasons beside the color of hair is darker on some people. That is what i keep...seeing over and over and i can't see what people are talking about. I can't see how it looks ugly and lazy. it is not doing a black clover where they got to lazy to draw more detail in the fight scenes so they are not being lazy at all. I am starting to think these people are watching the CGI anime and see the ones that don't use them as boring and lazy, I don't like the CGI anime they look weird and you might as well go to live action.----------------------------------- some what spoiler ahead----------------------------------------Story10/10The story is great. The Fairy tail gang get to fight both of the bad guys and you get to see a lot of power up in the main group of people.There are some finally to with the love interest.  They do the power of friendship because it is true, if you have really good friend that stick with you, you can do about anything. So it is not old or childish to say that over and over, it is also why our world sucks because we don't believe in those around us. One thing I almost agreed on but stopped when I thought about it was how a lot of people said that fairy tail should have let Zeref do his idea. All they would have done was let Zeref go back in time to have him not do the spells that cursed himself, which mean Natsu, the other 4 dragon slayer, and Erza would have never came to the current time line. that would also mean that fairy tail would not have even came about. Zeref plan would have erase the current timeline. would have all the problems go away, most likely that is unknown, But that would have meant that the friendships and bond would have disappeared and who know if the world would have turn out better or worse.Character10/10I love them. The fairy gang are their happy go lucky self, but you can tell that still have a lot weighting on them from what happen one year before. To me it was kind of scary when Gray found out that Natsu was E.N.D because you didn't know what he would do. What is cool is how they put the other guilds in.This while season was all of Fiore fight, not just Fairy tail.I felt really really sorry because of the sacrifice that Sherria, Ichiya, and Makarov did in this season they were powerful. Though it was kind of embarrassing to see which character did the deed.Those episodes with Larcade fight and power is not for kids.The biggest surprise was Anna, it does make sense to have an adult to come with the children but you would not have thought of it at all.  I also like how they put all of the side character from the older shows in the show even if for a second. Even the bad guy were good, they had power and they knew it, they just didn't think that Fairy tail would not give up. I did feel sorry for two of the bad guys,Larcade Dragneel and August, even thought they are bad guys you can't help but to feel sorry at the end. Being with Zeref messed them up in the end.Sound 8/10this is the one thing i tell people to not ask me because all I can say is I don't know.Over all enjoyment for me 10/10I  love this show, i love the series. I love the action, the humor, the tear jerks. I love how the character are put together and the fact that they had the worse hand in life handed to them they still manage to be happy, loving people that you would want in your life.I like how that when the going gets tough they still fight for what the believe.  I am sad that this show is ending, I know that there is more that could be put in the show like the 100 year quest which from watch I hear is good, but from the looks of things people are slowly not liking this show.I can tell I will always love this show for the meaning and power behind that meaning.The whole Fairy tail show helps me when i am feeling down and help me realize that being nice to people no matter who they are make you are a better person. This is one of my go to when I have nothing to do and don't know what to watch and no matter how many time i watch any of the season, they still hold a lot of power to me.I laugh, cry , and get mad along with them like I live there with them. Fairy tail and other older show are dying out because of the new animation style that is out there, I have watched some then watch this and if does look different.they are also dying out because a lot of people get bored of the character really easy. it is why there are so many anime's with only 12 to 24 episodes out. seeing over and over and i can't see what people are talking about.

I don\'t actually hate Fairy Tail. It\'s just such a mainstream, by-the-numbers series and it\'s really easy to clown on it for being so predictable. But honestly, it\'s kind of charming in that way. You already know exactly how every arc is going to end from the outset. They could be fighting the abstract concept of time itself or a villain with literally infinite magic and still win because Natsu got really fired up this time. Like his punches weren\'t doing anything before but then he got really fired up, and punched even...harder and that did the trick.That\'s how every arc ends, and they even did it twice in this one. The very last fight was as ""the power of friendship"" as you can get. They had a ""everyone give me your energy"" moment and everything. Super cheesy, super predictable, yet somehow I found myself enjoying it most of the time. At the end of the day at the core of the series is powerful emotions, and even if your just throwing a bunch of sappy story beats at the wall eventually something\'s going to stick and make you feel something.I knew going into this that it wouldn\'t be the ""Final Series"" for real. Not just because the 100 years quest literally just got announced around the time I started this season, either. Popular franchises make for profitable merchandise, and as long as there are plushes and minifigures to sell, the fines folks over at Kodansha will never let a series die. They\'ll drag it up from the grave a decade later if they think it\'ll sell more merch when they do. Or they\'ll launch it into space...8/10 friendships harder and that did the trick.That\'s how every arc ends, and they even did it twice in this one.

When I first started watching this series, I was still a newcomer to the anime community so I didn't know what was good and what wasn't. As I was a freshman and a guy in college, I was drawn, of course, towards shonen. I had heard of Naruto, mainly from people who wouldn't shut up about it so I didn't start with that series. So after scrolling through Netflix, I found Fairy Tail, started watching it and finished every episode available on Netflix in just a few days or so (Netflix only has like 48 episodes available in...the US).Anyway, I liked it, especially the music and characters. The music is some of my favorite in anime, the characters has some funny personalities and the arcs were short but fun to watch. I really enjoyed the show, all the way up until midway through this final season. While the show never had the cleanest fight animation, I did like the fights but the power of friendship and family triumphing everything soon got really old. Add in the poor animation this season has had, a bunch of still images and utter lack of motion on camera during fights and I got bored very quickly. So bored that I repeatedly put it on hold and finally decided to just drop it all together. I've read the manga so I know how it ends but I'll always prefer the first half of the series. Once it came back in 2014, it felt like something was missing.I used to say this was my favorite anime. That was before I opened up and watched other better anime. Fairy Tail will always hold a place in my heart as the series that got me into anime. But it won't be the anime that I would suggest other non-anime fans watch to get into the medium. the US).Anyway, I liked it, especially the music and characters.

But it won't be the anime that I would suggest other non-anime fans watch to get into the medium."", ""I had heard the rumours, but I chose to not heed the warnings, just how bad could the final season of Fairy Tail be? The short answer is absolute trash. If you have seen the other two seasons of Fairy Tail, you may as well just stop there, don't succumb yourself to this. Please.Story 3/10:It is Fairy Tail, if you are expecting a fully fleshed out completely sensical story you are wasting your time. Even going into this final season with this knowledge I was blown away by how low the standard had dropped. The biggest issue I have with the story is when something...crazy happens or someone comes up with a plan, idea or theory, literally nobody questions it and just accepts it as fact. For example, in a certain fight scene the characters attempt to defeat the enemy by trapping him in a time rift. Nobody questions the existence of a time rift, how it works or if it would even work against the enemy. Another example of this is when certain characters disappear, someone has a premonition about where these characters might be and everyone just accepts this as fact. Nobody bothers to offer alternate theories.The other issue I had with the story was Zeref's motives for why he was doing what he was doing was incredibly logical and made perfect sense. I don't really understand why anyone was even trying to stop him as if his plan succeeded then essentially all of the issues within the Fairy Tail universe would be resolved. In fact stopping Zeref creates more problems than it solves. I won't go into details as it is a spoiler, but there is this one scene were Zeref is incredibly close to doing something, but then he suddenly stops doing it to do something else.Art 2/10:The art is alright. I was debating whether or not to give it a 1. What I want to criticise is not so much the art per se, but the way the actual anime was directed.The funky thing about Fairy Tail is particularity in this third season is the director does not understand comedy. Randomly in the middle of scenes that should have an emotional impact or should be action intense are ruined by a random art direction to make the characters Chibi and throwing in some random gag that is not funny in the slightest which then goes on to serve to ruin the entire atmosphere they were working to build.The other awful thing the director does is have incredibly drawn out sequences. Instead of directing a fast paced action scene with high tension like Mob Psycho 100, the director uses long drawn out shots that make it impossible to generate any sense of exhilaration. The camera will randomly pan over someones face for an extended period of time in the middle of battle or the character will have an long dialogue sequence while he is attacking with just a moving background. Worst of all is the sequencing of the action scenes. There are no grand epic battles like season 1 or 2, it is only ever one side over powers the other for about ten seconds, they have some lengthy dialogue and then all of a sudden the good guys wreck the enemy. There is no tension or sense that the good guys have a chance of losing. Even worse is when they make a dramatic sequence out of characters deaths only to say a few episodes later 'lol guess what they didn't die hahahaah.'Sound 1/10:Don't get me wrong, the soundtracks for Fairy Tail are fantastic. Each of the individual tracks are brilliant and suiting to the universe. The opening and ending songs are very catchy and upbeat. So why is it that I give the sound a 1?The reason the sound sucked is because of how it was used. The editor randomly switches between tracks of different moods and tempos that really throw you off. For example, they might pick an appropriate battle theme and then mid-way through the battle theme switch to another piece that has more 'hopeless feel' to it.The problem is that the music does all of the thinking for you. The sound directing would have been far more effective if they left certain sections of the anime without music all together or at least faded out soundtracks before jumping to another one. I can excuse the poor visual directing, but coupled with terrible sound directing just made the third season of Fairy Tail at points almost unwatchable.Character 6/10:There are far too many characters in Fairy Tail. I literally don't even remember half of them. But nonetheless most of the characters are fun besides the ones that are either purposely designed or are only inserted for the sake of fan service (which there are a lot of). It is amazing how easily characters get away with sexual harassment in this universe.But yes, the main Fairy Tail crew are fun and are well developed. The only character that could have been developed better is probably Acnologia. Each of the other Fairy Tail villains have fleshed out motives for why they are doing what they are doing which makes them seem realistic. This was attempted with Acnologia, but wasn't properly fleshed out.One other point I wanted to make is that they randomly give Lucy upgraded celestial powers that are still just as useless as her regular celestial magic. A pointless character developmentEnjoyment 4/10:There was the odd moment in the final season of Fairy Tail was quite good. Whether it be a concept, a character, or something else. But overall due to the technical aspects of the anime, my overall enjoyment was limited. If the director was more competent then this anime could have had some very impactful action sequences and emotional dialogue.Overall 3/10:The final season of Fairy Tail fails to capture the magic of the first few arcs of season one. I absolutely adored the beginning, Natsu going on quests, meeting interesting characters with well choreographed action scenes, but never taking itself too seriously. Much like all other long-running series, as it drags on, the story becomes more focused, the characters become more and more over-powered, gradually it loses its charm.I really wanted to enjoy the ending for Fairy Tail. The actual ending itself is a satisfying conclusion, but the arc leading up to that point leaves much to be desired.You can be the judge. Watch this final season, but just don't come crying back to me to tell me that I was right and you regret your decision because I  very much do. Locking myself into an entire year, waiting a week for each episode only to put it off because I found something better to watch, but then coming back to it out of obligation. crazy happens or someone comes up with a plan, idea or theory, literally nobody questions it and just accepts it as fact.

So this is going to be a review just for this last 51 episodes, which I just finished a day ago, after not watching Fairy Tail for 4 years. I am not gonna do the Art / Story / Characters / Whatever review type because for...me the story and the art are not equally important in the final score. Also this is my first english review and second overall :).When this premierd in 2018 I watched the first episode and then put in on-hold until few days ago. I watched some recap of the first 2 seasons so I can get in the story first and then I started the Fairy Tail: Final Series.I gotta admit the first few episodes really got me back into the story, I was actually exicted getting back to this anime after few years. Seeing the Fairy Tail squad getting all back together, I will admit some moments were cringy, but maybe the anime is not for my age as i grew older since I started watching it. However I still was happy getting back at it, and after them all getting back, which was like the first 10 episodes I think, they introduced the new enemies: some empire across the ocean in the West Constinent, the Alvarez Empire who are after the power of the first master of Fairy Tail, who was in the undeground of the guild building. Some Fairy Tail members traveled the ocean to the Alvares Empire to rescue their master who was there and got him back to the Magnolia, that is when we first discoverd some of the top members of the Alvarez Empire and the fact that their emperor is actually Zeref, they were quite ok. Until now the anime looked promising, but what first changed this for me, in a good way, was the 2nd opening of the anime, which I think debuted on around episode 13 to 15, somewhere. For me that got me all hyped up for this arc, it looked more dark than any other Fairy Tail arc, and presented it like a final arc should be. All the Alvarez main characters were presented and they all looked badass, more or less, also we learned that Fairy Tail were going to recive help from they friends from Lamia Scale, Blue Pegasus, Saberthoot, the new Council and from former enemys Oracion Seis and Jellal. Some of the battles were presented like Erza vs the sand-guy from Alvarez, Wendy and Cheria vs the time-girl, Gajeel vs the demon-like-man-something. It looked like we were gonna get some dope fights for our final arc in Fairy Tail. Another thing that I saw in the opening that made me hyped up for the arc was Saberthoot beeing crucified, I mean that is not your usually Fairy Tail, even we had seen something similar when Gajeel did it before he joined Fairy Tail. And Gajeel looked like he was going to die in the opening, my favorite character by the way, I actually was looking forward to it, hoped he just dies, but in a nice context, I mean you gotta sacrifice someone in war to win it, right? No.Fight after fight after fight this anime destroyed everything I was hoping for. All the fights had the same pattern: the good guy is beat up, then do some basic stupid magic looking like it is an even fight now, then the bad guys says something like: ”Oh, wow you are the strongest I faced in some years!” and then nearlly kills it. After that there are two way the battle is going to end: 1. ”Oh, I nearlly died, but my nakamas are waiting for me!” and then wins or 2. The good guys ”dies” but rose up to life some episodes later, that happened with Gajeel, Gray, Juvia, Charle, Mirajane and others. When Makarov used Fairy Law I really thought ”Ok, at least a guy died” 3 to 4 episodes later: surprise Makarov is alive. Same with Natsu, same with the parfum-guy from Blue Pegasus. After the end of all the war we learn that the 12 Spriggans of Alvarez are alive too. So basically who died? Mavis, Zeref, Acnologia (which by the way was so boring of a character and so bad constructed I am not even gonna talk about it) and a bunch of non-named characters. Last episode surprise: Mavis and Zeref are alive and started a new life on Earth, but lost theirs memory, ok. So basically just Acnologia died. Oh, and by the way, even him learned that he had no character development in his last seconds learning that what he run after for more than 400 years was stupid listening to 1 minute of speech from Natsu, ok.Another stupid thing about this arc is that the Alvarez guy had to be so sort of related to our main characters. Ok Zeref and Natsu had a not so bad story. But then Erza mother appers a one of the 12 Spriggans of Alvarez, what? Lucy’s mother’s servant’s daughter is this Brandish girl one of the 12 Spriggans too, what? Gray and that ice-guy from Alvarez, well they are not related just have the same magic type and the ice-guy knows that Gray wants too kill E.N.D., which its actually Natsu, well that is ok.Well there are lots of 400 year ago storys in this arc too but I am not gonna speak about them because I don’t feel like. They were not great not terrible, so basically nothing to say about.Oh, almost forgot, after 50 episodes we learn in the last one that there could be evean another sequel in the future for the Fairy Tail: FINAL SERIES.For the design part, well I am not really looking at this as a big part of any anime, I mean yeah, I like when things are looking good, but if the story is really good and it is decent looking I can call it a masterpice. One thing that got me upset was the design of the background characters. All the Alvarez soldiers except the 12 Spriggan and few of their direct servent were looking exactlly the same, but ok I could get with this, but the Fairy Tail non-named charcters were looking so poor, I felt bad for them. I don’t know the budget for this show but that looked like a low budget show, and I don’t think Fairy Tail don’t have money for this. Right now I am looking at Tower of God and I really like the fact that all the characters have some great and unique look, even some of them are already dead, after just 3 episodes.Audio part, again not so interesting for me, I really care about the story and characters (which yeah I know I did not talk about, they are all super basic and you probably got that from the 2 first seasons already). Well the openings were not as good as the first two seasons, the OST was the same the mediaval one it is really nice and it fits the show. The voice, nothing super good or super bad.To sum up for the tl;dr-guys: first I got a bit into the story, then I was really hyped up for it, then it destroyed me little by little. After all I do not want to say if I recommand it or not because it depends on so much things that I do not know about you, I just wanted to write down my thoughts about this series. So my rating was really between 6 or 7, for the intention of a good story. I don’t really get how people would go through a 300 some episodes of the Fairy Tail and then rate all of them with 2 or 3, I mean you gotta to be a psychopathe to hate something that bad and after first 175 still watch the next season. As I am writing this I dont know if I will give it a 6 or a 7. me the story and the art are not equally important in the final score. Also this is my first english review and second overall :).When this premierd in 2018 I watched the first episode and then put in on-hold until few days ago. I watched some recap of the first 2 seasons so I can get in the story first and then I started the Fairy Tail: Final Series.I gotta admit the first few episodes really got me back into the story, I was actually exicted getting back to this anime after few years. Seeing the Fairy Tail squad getting all back together, I will admit some moments were cringy, but maybe the anime is not for my age as i grew older since I started watching it. However I still was happy getting back at it, and after them all getting back, which was like the first 10 episodes I think, they introduced the new enemies: some empire across the ocean in the West Constinent, the Alvarez Empire who are after the power of the first master of Fairy Tail, who was in the undeground of the guild building. Some Fairy Tail members traveled the ocean to the Alvares Empire to rescue their master who was there and got him back to the Magnolia, that is when we first discoverd some of the top members of the Alvarez Empire and the fact that their emperor is actually Zeref, they were quite ok. Until now the anime looked promising, but what first changed this for me, in a good way, was the 2nd opening of the anime, which I think debuted on around episode 13 to 15, somewhere. For me that got me all hyped up for this arc, it looked more dark than any other Fairy Tail arc, and presented it like a final arc should be. All the Alvarez main characters were presented and they all looked badass, more or less, also we learned that Fairy Tail were going to recive help from they friends from Lamia Scale, Blue Pegasus, Saberthoot, the new Council and from former enemys Oracion Seis and Jellal. Some of the battles were presented like Erza vs the sand-guy from Alvarez, Wendy and Cheria vs the time-girl, Gajeel vs the demon-like-man-something. It looked like we were gonna get some dope fights for our final arc in Fairy Tail. Another thing that I saw in the opening that made me hyped up for the arc was Saberthoot beeing crucified, I mean that is not your usually Fairy Tail, even we had seen something similar when Gajeel did it before he joined Fairy Tail. And Gajeel looked like he was going to die in the opening, my favorite character by the way, I actually was looking forward to it, hoped he just dies, but in a nice context, I mean you gotta sacrifice someone in war to win it, right? No.Fight after fight after fight this anime destroyed everything I was hoping for. All the fights had the same pattern: the good guy is beat up, then do some basic stupid magic looking like it is an even fight now, then the bad guys says something like: ”Oh, wow you are the strongest I faced in some years!” and then nearlly kills it. After that there are two way the battle is going to end: 1. ”Oh, I nearlly died, but my nakamas are waiting for me!” and then wins or 2.

As I am writing this I dont know if I will give it a 6 or a 7.', ""As a fan and a fellow manga reader of FT, I have to write a review on this. Since I know the story for this season, I'm not gonna go through on that.When you read shounen manga and it adapts to an anime, you definitely want to look out for the fight scenes and that is my main reason to watch this final season of FT. Guess what... I'm truly disappointed. I expected the fight between Natsu vs Gray & Natsu vs Zeref to be super intense. Based on the manga, the fight scenes was amazing but in the anime, its just trash. Then...when it comes to the fight between Acnologia vs Dragon Slayers, it was okay. I feel like they put all their money for that final fight and other fights are just minors. What a shame. It makes me lost all the enjoyment to watch the rest of the season. When you compare the fight scenes from previous seasons to this final season, previous seasons are much better. I think the studio is like out of budget to put some love into this season. So sad.But I believe for anime watchers only, they will like this season. Unlike for manga readers, it will be a utter disappointment. Overall, the animation is really bad but story is good. So I had to give a pretty decent rating for this. If FT 100 year quest going to adapt to an anime, will I watch it? Unless there's a change in the animation, I will definitely give it a watch. when it comes to the fight between Acnologia vs Dragon Slayers, it was okay.

Fairy Tail, how to start? This show and Sword Art Online are the two more controversial animes to this day  (on my point of view at least), when I say this I mean that they are the...two animes with the most numbers of fans and haters. Like, I don\'t know if Fairy Tail has more fans or haters and I think is very difficult to be on the middle, you hate it or you love  it. So, in which side am I? By the score that I gave to it you might think that I like it and that\'s 100% true. I like it. Maybe is because it was the first ""real"" anime that I saw (Pokemon doesn\'t count). So now I am going to tell you why I like it.2) CharactersI want to proper start this review judging the characters because I think it\'s one of the most controversial topics. The haters say that this show doesn\'t contain character development and I think that they are right. ""What? But you said that you like Fairy Tail, how dare you agree with the haters!"" Yeh, that\'s right. I like the show but I don\'t think it is perfect. Unfortunately, this anime made a very poor development for the characters which is very disappointing because I really liked them. Yep. I really liked Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray, Erza and the others, I love their backstories and I was very sad and disappointed that they didn\'t grow up, like, I love them but I want to see a change, a better version of them, not just a stronger version but a version with better personality.3) StoryWell, on my opinion the story is the weakest part of Fairy Tail. I said before that I love the characters\' backstories and it is true but the actual plot isn\'t so good. Now that I am thinking, Fairy Tail is one of a few shows that I prefer the flashbacks than the actual story of the arc. Oh, I forgot to mention that the story is organized by arcs and not seasons. My bigger problem with the story is that there is a poor connection of the arcs or a goal, like, Naruto wants to be hokage and the story is focused on this goal but in Fairy Tail there isn\'t a goal so the arcs are just there, you can mix the order and small things changes. The ""power of friendship"" and the amount of fan-service are others things that bothers me but not so much as the lack of a cohesion story. A good thing about the story is the world building, really cool and well done, very immersive.4) ArtThe art is very good. Character design is what sells a lot of people to this show. And this is all that I can say. I am not an artist or a really good analytic so I can\'t make a deep analysis. So move on.5)SoundThe ost of Fairy Tail is the best thing of this show, it is SO good . The theme music, the sad music, the openings, omg, everything is great. But again, I can\'t make a deeper analyse so move on.6)Enjoyment and overallOn the ""introduction"" I said that I like Fairy Tail, I think it is a good show and deserves a 7 out of 10. ""But why? ""-you might ask-""You said that the story is the weakest part of the show and the story is the most important thing about an anime, so how you liked?"" Well, you might don\'t understand but to like Fairy Tail and have a good time the story isn\'t actually the most important thing. Every flaw of the show\'s story can be ignored because of the good characters and the very immerse universe created. Yes, the problems are still there and the anime would be way better with a more cohesion story, less fan-service and less ""power of friendship"" but these things don\'t make Fairy Tail a bad or horrible anime. Fairy Tail can create a good atmosphere and you can fell part of the guild, and this felling is good and this is why I like Fairy Tail but don\'t think is a 10/10 anime, it is just good. two animes with the most numbers of fans and haters. Like, I don\'t know if Fairy Tail has more fans or haters and I think is very difficult to be on the middle, you hate it or you love  it. So, in which side am I?

And I disagree with that. I genuinely thank this author for writing one of my favorite series.Fairy Tail's fights don't really have much technical logic in them. I'd usually tell you that's boring because then you're not really scared, or resonating with the characters through them. The outcome is known, or easily manipulated. But are they boring? No. Not to me. Because every fight in Fairy Tail...tells a story. About the characters. About their past. About their present. And sometimes, about their future. About their weaknesses and about what lead them to be who they are. I personally really dislike bullshit. I don't feel at all like Fairy Tail packs bullshit. It very much resonates with my real life experience, from beginning to end. It represents many different things and types of people in this world, and I love it. Watching it and always being reminded of its core message, brings me a warm feeling of what I don't want to ever forget about. I don't want to be distracted by anything, because this world is full of distractions, and the best thing is to have my friends around, and the most beautiful scenarios are the least luxurious ones.It is clear from early on that magic in this world is affected by and originates from feelings, and that feelings can change it. So. Not mad at all. The way it was used to telling the stories was beautiful and I loved all the different scenes we got to watch. And the creative situations that were built with it, that reflected much deeper things.I love Fairy Tail's guild. I love the story it tells about every one of its different characters, and about how in a real family anyone can fit in. Fairy Tail's own family had a leader that didn't lead what a family should be, but it returned to being what it was founded from with Makarov, who (tiny spoiler) didn't even believe in himself to be such a good leader.Fairy Tail, in every part of my life, speaks truth. It doesn't do it in a shabby way, it doesn't come short in its depth. I've cried so many times through this. Every part of this resonated with things I see and have seen around me, and Fairy Tail focused on showing so many different parts of this world, that can be so twisted sometimes, so surprising sometimes. But in the end, exactly like my grandma made my family a Fairy Tail, if you have the modesty and the right mindset, you can live in a Fairy Tail.I'm thankful to have watched this beautiful series. Please don't be discouraged to watch it.P.S. I even give it credit for its pacing. Many series these days have a pacing that takes you for an idiot and it's a no no for me tells a story.

We also got some fun news about Natsu, some pretty epic fights, and I don\'t know what it was, but the music seemed much more lively. I got really excited when the violins kicked in as Natsu reared up...to fight the bad guy. We get to watch lots of characters fall in love in this season, and for me, romance always has my heart.

And I gotta say I expected a lot more out of this series.... This was by far the worst last season of a great show.---- MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ----The only thing I liked about how the writers did this season is that they revealed that Natsu is E.N.D. and Zeref\'s little brother. But other than that, I was severely disappointed in this final season of Fairy Tail.The first and foremost thing that I was really bummed out about was when Natsu found...out all about what and who he is. His reaction to finding out everything was very underwhelming. All we got was his usual angered outburst, nothing new or special. And to top it off, Happy, after hearing all of that with Natsu, decided for some reason not to tell anyone about any of it. The reason why this bothered me so much was that Happy usually does what\'s best for Natsu, so wouldn\'t telling the Guild of the situation have been the smartest idea?Then there was when Natsu shifted into his more demonic form... well, first off, I will just blatantly say right now that I was very underwhelmed by how Natsu looked in his demonic form. A shadow over the top of his face and some demon arms? Seriously? Why not do something with his eye color? Why not give him demon horns on his head? Or black veins on his face? Or something actually SCARY looking? Also, why not change his personality into something more sinister? You know, Like how Jellal was before he became good: where he laughed at the suffering of others and was just bone-chillingly evil.END was supposed to be the MOST POWERFUL AND VILE DEMON in all of the books of Zeref. I had imagined that END would be so powerful that just the feel of his power alone would more than startle everyone on the battlefield. But no, the moment we get introduced to Natsu\'s more demonic form, he is evenly matched in a battle with Grey. I get that Grey\'s dad gave him demon slaying powers in order to destroy END, but that didn\'t have to mean that he was just as powerful as supposedly the most powerful demon ever created by Zeref.And then to top all of that off, we only got to seeNatsu\'s demonic form ONCE!! Why? So many people were so hyped up to see what END looked like, and there was all of this plot build-up to it,  and we only end up seeing him in one lousy battle scene with Grey? I honestly don\'t understand how any of the writers thought that was somehow a good idea.But even ""how"" END appeared was all wacked. I get that Natsu was emotionally wrecked because he thought Lucy died, but why did he even THINK she was dead in the first place? He\'s an incredibly powerful dragon slayer who has an enhanced ability to hearing things around him. Even without concentrating hard, he should have been able to hear her breathing or her heartbeat. And also, I was under the impression that Natsu\'s demonic form could only be release under very specific circumstances (I don\'t remember exactly what circumstance those were though).And then there was Lucy being able to decipher demonic script from the END book... How? How was she able to do something like that? Even Zeref himself seemed baffled by the concept that someone was able to rewrite the END book.Now backing up a bit, to when Makarov met Zeref and Zeref blatantly told Makarov that he wanted Natsu to come fight him... why did the writers make it seem like Makarov never heard that? I get that he was in pain because Zeref was trying to kill him, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that his ability to understand what Zeref was saying was impared.And then there was the attempted heroic deaths... so incredibly disappointing, honestly. Anna, Ichiya, Macarov... All of whom didn\'t actually didn\'t die. I actually thought it made the story more deep and meaningful when I saw these characters ""die"" so heroically.And then the last episode of the series.... was the most disappointing part of this season. I mean seriously, all of these couples make significant progress except for the main couple? I mean yea I know Natsu is dense but come on. I feel like I\'ve been waiting forever for either a vocal love confession or a kiss from them and the last episode didn\'t give us squat except for Natsu wanting to tell Lucy something and then changing his mind at the last moment.Something that is also overlooked is Zeref\'s necklace that was left on the guild\'s floor after he died with Mavis. Why couldn\'t the writers have done something special with that? Like maybe have Natsu walk into the guild after the battle, see it, open it up and see the picture of him and his older brother, and then maybe either decide to wear it himself or have keep it at his house.And the fact that Zeref died in general, really left a sour taste in my mouth... Fairy Tail has given second chances to so many villainous people who have taken so many lives in the past. Why not Zeref as well? Zeref is not inherently evil. Its just that, understandably, his mental state started to deteriorate after so many years of self isolation in fear that he would hurt people, and combined with immortality and an enormous amount of dark magic power that he never asked for, of course he would become a more vile person in general. If the writers really wanted to, they could\'ve made it so that Zeref and Mavis could just stop being immortal through some super complicated spell. And then they could just age normally from then on and Natsu could try to have some form of relationship with his brother. I would\'ve loved to see that.In conclusion, there were so many things that disappointed me with this final season, and I could go on about a lot more things I didn\'t like about it but I think I got my point across. This was just a really bad final season to Fairy Tail. out all about what and who he is. His reaction to finding out everything was very underwhelming. All we got was his usual angered outburst, nothing new or special. And to top it off, Happy, after hearing all of that with Natsu, decided for some reason not to tell anyone about any of it. The reason why this bothered me so much was that Happy usually does what\'s best for Natsu, so wouldn\'t telling the Guild of the situation have been the smartest idea?Then there was when Natsu shifted into his more demonic form... well, first off, I will just blatantly say right now that I was very underwhelmed by how Natsu looked in his demonic form. A shadow over the top of his face and some demon arms? Seriously? Why not do something with his eye color? Why not give him demon horns on his head? Or black veins on his face? Or something actually SCARY looking? Also, why not change his personality into something more sinister? You know, Like how Jellal was before he became good: where he laughed at the suffering of others and was just bone-chillingly evil.END was supposed to be the MOST POWERFUL AND VILE DEMON in all of the books of Zeref. I had imagined that END would be so powerful that just the feel of his power alone would more than startle everyone on the battlefield. But no, the moment we get introduced to Natsu\'s more demonic form, he is evenly matched in a battle with Grey. I get that Grey\'s dad gave him demon slaying powers in order to destroy END, but that didn\'t have to mean that he was just as powerful as supposedly the most powerful demon ever created by Zeref.And then to top all of that off, we only got to seeNatsu\'s demonic form ONCE!! Why? So many people were so hyped up to see what END looked like, and there was all of this plot build-up to it,  and we only end up seeing him in one lousy battle scene with Grey? I honestly don\'t understand how any of the writers thought that was somehow a good idea.But even ""how"" END appeared was all wacked. I get that Natsu was emotionally wrecked because he thought Lucy died, but why did he even THINK she was dead in the first place? He\'s an incredibly powerful dragon slayer who has an enhanced ability to hearing things around him. Even without concentrating hard, he should have been able to hear her breathing or her heartbeat. And also, I was under the impression that Natsu\'s demonic form could only be release under very specific circumstances (I don\'t remember exactly what circumstance those were though).And then there was Lucy being able to decipher demonic script from the END book...

This was just a really bad final season to Fairy Tail.', '[spoilers ] This show is so damn flawed, but i struggle to rate it low, will be the thesis for my review.So the last season starts of weak with the avatar arc, horrible villains, slightly better plot. I can understand that maybe this arc was solely purposed for bringing back fairy tail, but my gosh you couldve at least made the enemies a bit stronger and interesting. The only pluses to this arc is that natsus power was cool to see against these weaker wizards/witches. Next we have the alvarez arc; this arc was definitely much better as it felt like it had more of...a important plot and so had a purpose. However, the author dug himself a hole when hyping up the spriggan 12 to be so immensely powerful and then making every last one of them lose to the power of friendship or something equally as stupid. A few moments in this arc that angered me in particular include: erza destroying a massive meteor while only being able to move her right hand, the dragon slayers breaking out of a crystal in the rift dimension thingy just because they heard the voices of their friends, natsu being strong enough to 1 shot a fairy heart empowered zeref. As you can see there are many stupid moments in this show, and many more that i couldnt be asked to type.However…Despite the sheer amount of flaws, i am still giving it a 7(good),  simply because i was able to enjoy it. I try not to dwell on the obvious mistakes on storytelling and powerscaling and in turn I managed to enjoy it as the main characters are fun and it does feel good when they are victorious. Also, i watched 300 episodes of fairy tail so i automatically increase the minimum score this show can get ( although through these episodes i did drop it around 3 times and had to rewatch when i forgot what happened ). So that explains why i gave it the score i did.Thanks for reading if you did, this is my first lengthyer review 😄 a important plot and so had a purpose.

Fairy Tail was one of my first anime back when I was like 12 or something and the first season was okay back then. Anyway, normally when your final season comes up, you want to make it big. You want to make it awesome and blow the living socks off of everybody. The Fairy Tail staff decided: ""Eh... No one\'s going to pay attention anyway."" And thus...this lazy piece of junk was made.In short, if you watched the first couple of episodes of the first Fairy Tail and then watched the final episode of this show. Nothing changed. Absolutely nothing. No character relationships were further developed. No character arcs really changed the character. Any developments that were in place were abandoned in a matter of seconds. All of the super powerful wizards we established in the first two seasons are weak. Pathetic really. Anything big that happens here is rendered pointless a few episode later. That\'s it for characters. Nothing happens. On a side note., do you remember that one character back in the first couple of episodes in season one? The guild member that would always say ""I\'ll take a job tomorrow!"" Me neither. But he\'s back for his second appearance in the final episode. Hope you\'re excited to see him.As for the animation, it\'s not really there. You might as well draw some fan art of each scene and you might get more frames than they did. Every shot was the same slow panning shot of any one character and their blank expression reacting to something that was lame and didn\'t really matter. Fights might be a punch and the rest is some useless dialogue about something obvious and a lot of standing still.The only reason I didn\'t give this crap a 1 is mostly because it didn\'t make me want to bleach my eyes and wipe my memory. It also didn\'t do anything that made me question humanity so... That\'s good I guess. You get 1 point for not making me want to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth.Anyway. If, like me, you\'ve watched too much of Fairy Tail to stop now and you decide that you have to watch this show, as my final effort to save you from 51 episodes of nothing let me tell you this. No spoilers, I promise. Think about the show for a minute. Like actually just think about the whole show and the story up until now. Now imagine the ending. You\'re right. That\'s the ending, whatever you imagined is the ending. Whatever ending you just imagined is probably superior to what the Final Season has in store. Take that ending and make it your personal ending. Otherwise you\'ll be disappointed and sad.I hope this helped whoever reads this. Please don\'t make the mistake of watching this show.

It\'s not funny, it\'s irritating and boring.', 'Plot:It is pretty convoluted and murky, to begin with, but I like how Hiro Mashima used a lot of different narrative styles and techniques in the story. The main perspective is from Lucy\'s eyes which is pretty rare in shounen. She tells the story of the Fairy Tail guild. I like how Natsu was never the main character and unlike Luffy and Naruto, he didn\'t have this one huge goal he needed to accomplish by the end of the story. He is also not used as the ""chosen one"" for the entire plot.First, Fairy Tail had two main villains: Acnologia, the dragon king; and Zeref,...the black wizard magician. Unlike with most fictional stories where there is more than one villain where they eventually teamed up to defeat the main characters, here Acnologia and Zeref are different entities that served different purposes to the entire narrative. Acnologia is the villain that affected all the main characters\' lives. He also shaped the entire Fairy Tail world. But Zeref is the main villain that Natsu and the entire guild must defeat. He is part of the Fairy Tail guild history.So, it wasn\'t also like One Piece or Dragon Ball where after one enemy there is a higher level of an enemy that they must defeat. They needed different strategies for each main villain.Basically, there are two storylines. The first one they must defeat all Zeref\'s demons and Zeref himself. His and Mavis\' story is a romantic tragedy of the Fairy Tail guild. The second storyline is about how Dragon Slayers came to be, why were they sent to the future, and why did they exist. Once, I finally understood where Mashima is going with his story and that there are only two main villains, the entire plot is starting easier to follow.Magic System:Next is the magic system, this one is the hardest one to understand and until now I don\'t get it. This is where the audience is starting to point out that here lies the lazy writing. ""Power of friendship"" and ""plot armor"". I hit up the fan Wikipedia and there is still a lot Mashima added by the end of the series. So basically there is one container of ethernano in every mage\'s body and a person must utilize it to use magic. Then there is the Second origin that reminds me of Awakening from One Piece where they used the dormant power. However, for some reason, Mashima added the Third Origin as a plot convenient tool during Sherria and Dimaria\'s fight. Mashima added a lot of stuff by the end and I can see why people went mad with how convenient everyone\'s fight became. There is also Lucy rewriting Natsu\'s demonic spell.Overall:However, we must note that Zeref also pointed out before the final season that magic is fueled by emotions. I don\'t see any plot holes but the entire story is filled with plot conveniences. I must also take note that I could see why this story gets hate among shounen lovers. Fairy Tail is filled with sappy and too cheesy scenes and lines that even a girl would cringe for. I think I skipped a lot of dragging sappy scenes and that despite that I am a romantic one myself. I don\'t see how would this appeal to young teenage boys. But I see why this had a solid fanbase. The entire cast had cool character designs and powers. There is a lot of characters that are likable enough to ship that is also oozing with chemistry. Despite the excessive nudity and fanservice, the girls (main characters and villains alike) are pretty diverse unlike with One Piece or useful in fights and leadership other than used as eye candy-like in Naruto. the black wizard magician.

Some people say it was rushed due to the final fight with acnologia and that's understandable. Realistically he could have killed all of the dragon slayers by himself there's no arguing that; However, I feel like he let his pride get in the way instead of just killing the 7 dragon slayers he decides to just toy around with them for a bit and that allowed Natsu to obtain all of the slayers magic which led to his defeat. The way god Serna got one tapped also left watchers unsatisfied. i still question...how he possessed every dragon slayer magic but got one tapped by acnologia; however, Natsu had all of the slayer magic as well but he was able to defeat acnologia. The finale could have been much better, the Natsu and gray fight had so much potential and it shouldn't have ended the way it did. The Zeref fight was perfectly executed from my standpoint. Zeref was an amazing villain throughout the series and his ideology's were great therefore left me satisfied with his ending.

The stories and characters are so boring. Every time they stumble across an idea to make the anime even remotely interesting they drop the ball. Full of cliches and unnecessary fan service that it makes me question who their target audience even is?? HONESTLY, WHO IS THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE, there are thousand of boring cliches, they have the predictable theme of friendship is power which makes it seem as though their target audience is children between the age of 5...to 10 years old but then with all the unnecessary fan service I don't even know anymore! One of the major problems with the Fairy Tail series is the ridiculously poor power scaling which leads to hundreds of more problems. This series is disgustingly bad. While they trick you into believing that there is character development, in truth nothing is really going on no-one is really going anywhere, there are time skips and then scenes with an incredible display of power and but it takes us all back to the same shit - boring fight scenes where the fighters take turn slugging at each other and turning the tide of the battle around until eventually, it's the power of friendship that wins SO BORING.Looking at Fairy Tail the Final Series by itself, the writers are literally handed a good plot line. With the end of Fairy Tail 2014 we are left at awe with the power levels of each main character - then the beginning of the Final Series we notice that Grey is potentially being consumed by the power of his devil abilities. This was a brilliant start to an arc. Have Natsu and Grey duke it out and have Natsu reign just barely victorioues. However they drop the ball on that too by running the typical cliche of Grey being undercover. Seriously, even when they have it handed to them they still fall short. THEN WE GO BACK TO THE EXACT SAME THING - where we seem to forget that everyone had a time skip and they just go back to returning to slugging it back and forth until friendship wins. After watching this series from beginning to end I am petrified by how I was able to find this serie even remotely entertaining. Again with the power scaling, how is it that a pathetic fool like Natsu even come close to soloing both Sting and Rogue? Honestly even this weakling of a character who can't even beat a goddamn mole without struggling can solo both Sting and Rogue when they are in their Dragon Force mode then literally ANYONE should be able to beat them without trying. ALSO KILL OFF SOME OF YOUR CHARACTERS, they are too scared to kill off anything, they can't even kill off a cat Lector, he got blown to bits in a secluded area and they still somehow bullshit him surviving- HELL They can't even kill off GODDAMN HAIR, they have to bring back Wendy's hair after she cut it off because they just didn't have the genitalia to kill off that!

Hana yori Dango,https://myanimelist.net/anime/106/Hana_yori_Dango,"['The shoujo romance genre is littered with countless series with predictable formulaic plotlines, bishies, and uninteresting characters.  Often we are left with a terrible non ending or one in which usually one side can’t express their feelings for the other until the credits start to roll.  Hana Yori Dango completely captivated me from the beginning and left me with a rewarding ending that restored my faith in the romance genre.The premise starts out in a way that you wouldn’t expect much romance to develop from.  Tsukushi Makino is a middle to lower middle class student at an exclusive high school attended by...mainly wealthy students.  Tsukushi is not particularly happy with her high school life nor does she really even want to be at this school.  But she attends because of her parent’s insistence and because they have sacrificed a lot to send her there.  The school is controlled by the F4, a gang of 4 guys from extremely rich and powerful families.  Basically the entire school lives in fear of getting on their bad side and getting the ""red card"", which basically means your school life becomes hell on earth until you transfer out.  Tsukushi goes about her day just trying to be unnoticed until she graduates, leading a fairly miserable existence.  This all changes when the only real friend has accidently incurs the wraith of the F4, she jumps to her defense and finds herself given the red card.  But she’s not the kind of girl who\'s going to back down and she declares war back on the F4 herself.  As Tsukushi fights back and starts to gain the respect of many classmates and even begins to befriend the F4 and we learn that they are not quite as bad as initially thought.I found the story to be quite moving and powerful and found myself experiencing the full range of emotions.   The portrayal of the bullying, which becomes quite intense at times was often very difficult to watch.  There will be times you will cringe and times when you will jump out of your chair and cheer.  Eiktoku High School may just be one of the 4 or 5 worst places on earth.  It truly was a hell on earth and it doesn’t exactly paint a pretty picture of high society and the people who populate it.   I’m not sure I would have had to strength of character Tsukushi had to stick things out and not let them win.   It’s difficult to talk about the romance aspects of this anime without giving away spoilers.  Though it will become pretty obvious fairly early where they are going and who she’s going to end up with.  The journey to this revelation though is quite the ride.  The ending differs completely from the manga version, since this anime was completed several years before its run had finished.  Despite the original ending it is still very satisfying and believable.Tsukushi Makino emerges as perhaps the best shoujo heroine of all time.  I really cannot give her enough praise for how I felt about her as a character and how much I would love to have a friend like her.  She is tough, practical and no-nonsense type of girl in a world full of shallow materialistic bitches.  Viewers will be drawn to her both her likeable nature and the sheer torture she has to endure over the course of the series.  The things that are done to her and the torment she is put through are both frightening and inspiring.  Seeing the events of the story told through her inner monologue made me feel even more connected to the plot and her emotions felt even more intense because of it.  Though perhaps she is in the end a bit more forgiving than I personally would be if I was in her place, she is overall a very inspirational character.Tsukasa Domyoji is the leader of the F4 and one of Tsukushi’s love interests.  He has all the classic elements of a shoujo love interest.  He’s fabulously wealthy, handsome, and an asshole.  I have mixed feelings on him.  Initially he is an extremely frightening character.  His menacing demeanor and the adjunct terror that Tsukushi often feels in his presence makes him initially almost impossible to like at all.  However as the series progresses he becomes less and less the horrible boogeyman he begins as and actually turns into a decent and even sympathetic human being.  While I tried my best to keep hating him, he wore me down not unlike Tsukushi into believing someone could actually fall in love with him.  As a character, Tsukasa makes a huge amount of growth.  He changes from selfish and egotistical brat into a much more humble and likeable guy while still maintaining the essence of who he is.Rui is another member of F4 and another main love interest.  He is almost the complete opposite of the hotheaded Tsukasa.  While still from an enormously wealthy family and suitably good looking, Rui is far more introverted and shy.  I liked him far more at first than any of the other men in the cast but he really isn’t any nicer that Tsukasa is.  While not physically violent his cold nature and inconsistency in when he does or doesn’t jump to Tsukushi’s defense doesn’t exactly win him any feminist awards.  My feelings for him are pretty much the reverse of what I felt for Tsukasa.  By the end of the series I grew tired of his personality and while he does manage to change a little, his nature just gets more and more annoying.  He was also just a bit too bishie for me.Most of the remaining supporting cast is pretty detestable.  The two remaining members of F4, Akira and Sojiro are not very well developed as characters being their basic personality archetypes and never emerge as serious love interests.  Tsukushi’s childhood friend Kazuya is likeable and provides comic relief, often at times when the story can really use some.  While he is in love with Tsukushi he is more of a friend to her and he provides her with a much needed friend at times when she really needs one.  Shizuka also is one of the rare decent characters who also provides Tsukushi with plenty of support and encouragement in times of need.  There are plenty of absolutely spoiled rotten waste of skin bitches and assholes to get mad about.  But despite the anger you’re likely to feel every time one of them appears on screen or plots against the heroine they do serve a useful purpose in the growth of the main characters and in the development of the romances.Given the age of this series the animation and visuals are understandably dated.  Unfortunately they are bad enough that it’s possible that it will discourage some people all together from even giving this series a chance.  That is a real shame.  While I can’t say that I loved the artwork, I did eventually develop some appreciation for it as the series progressed.  The color palette used is very drab and the hairstyles and fashions are also extremely dated.  The character designs are true to the manga and are realistic body types which adds to the overall sense of realism.  The settings and backgrounds though are strength are all look pretty good.The audio is also a bit of a mixed bag.  While the voice acting performances are all top notch, I didn’t much care for the music at all, especially the lame and uninteresting OP animation sequence.  The incidental and background music is also very dated.Ultimately Hana Yori Dango is a series that should not be missed by serious romance and anime fans alike.  It’s a very intense series likely to stir up just about every emotion there is for the viewer.  Though as much as I loved Tsukushi and the story, I just can’t give this series the perfect score I wanted to because of the uninspired art and music.  I highly recommend it. mainly wealthy students.  Tsukushi is not particularly happy with her high school life nor does she really even want to be at this school.  But she attends because of her parent’s insistence and because they have sacrificed a lot to send her there.

While some of the storylines can be a bit farfetched, there's just enough balance of drama, romance, and comedy to draw you in. The storylines have so many twists that you'll never be bored while watching this series.Bottom line: If you're looking for an anime packed with drama, romance,...comedy, and interesting plots and characters, this is the anime for you. If you are more concerned with pretty animation and good OSTs, you should look elsewhere. comedy, and interesting plots and characters, this is the anime for you. If you are more concerned with pretty animation and good OSTs, you should look elsewhere."", 'A romance that is not romantic at allHana Yori Dango was one of my worst anime experiences, mainly because it tricked me in the first 20 episodes. In the beginning, the anime offers an interesting plot, especially with the protagonist. However, to my surprise, everything broke down relatively quickly, here are, in my view, the main problems of the work:-The ""triangle"": The love triangle of this anime does not make any sense, because simply, one of the 2 parts of the triangle is not interested in the protagonist, in fact, all the moments that this person directs in a more ""loving"" way with protagonist seemed...to me out of pity, or for him to console himself from another novel. (It is a triangle because the protagonist is indecisive about which boy she likes)-The characters: The protagonist at the beginning is very interesting, strong and courageous, but in the last 2/3 of the work she becomes petty, false and liar, unpalatable. The men in this anime are even worse, one of them is a bully who, believe me, RAPES the protagonist, well, if you consider that the other only used the protagonist when she was fragile, it is also rape ... It is worth mentioning that because of the bully she suffers at least 4 times physical aggression, I just don\'t understand what the author had in mind.-She didn\'t love him: I won\'t say who she stays with, but for me she didn\'t love him at all, just looked at the other, she didn\'t even say once that she loved him in 51 episodes! Not in appearance either, whenever she was with him she seemed in a bad mood. So, the main point of the anime, romance, for me, didn\'t exist.-The manga Vs the anime: When I finished the anime I was so nervous, and I found out that the ending in the manga was different, so I read the last chapters and damn it! It\'s totally different from the anime, the chemistry between the characters was absurdly better, I don\'t know what happened to make these changes in the anime, in short, do you want to know the story? Read the manga.-Visual and audio waste: I really like the anime songs (minus the opening) but the violin pieces were beautiful, the visual was beautiful too, the design of the characters was exactly the style I liked, unfortunately, wasted in a horrible story.A story with a lot of potential, but that the immaturity of practically all the characters of the work, spoils it. to me out of pity, or for him to console himself from another novel.

I had been feeling like I hadn\'t seen a good romance in a while and what brought my attention to it was a review that had said it ""restored their faith in the romance genre""The main characters while childish and obnoxious at the start slowly seem to develop into mature-ish young adults. Starting with Makino, throughout the anime she is rather stubborn, naive and headstrong. She is a...strong female character that faces many emotional trials, while struggling with her life she manages to overcome everything relatively well. Her character has been constructed in a way that places you in her position, withering away in fear when she does or feeling happy when she does.The F4 boys that she stands up against also go through changes as well, making you cringe and want to pull your hair out. There are many things that could be said about the things they do wrong and right, however, overall they are young boys going through school with emotions and things that a normal person could not understand.The story was captivating and by the first episode I wanted to know more and see more. It was an anime with life and has many lessons in it. It addresses bullying and other themes that high school comes with, and was easy to relate to.I enjoyed Hana Yori Dango a lot more than I thought I would and I managed to watch it in two days, days off work spent well in my opinion. I felt extremely satisfied with it and the way it ended. There were times were I couldn\'t help but laugh along with the characters. The anime came alive to me, it became a real thing and I wanted to give Makino a good slap every now and then. There was not one moment I wanted to give up on it and not one moment I wasn\'t entertained.I give it an overall score of 9/10 strong female character that faces many emotional trials, while struggling with her life she manages to overcome everything relatively well.

Desiring nothing more than a low-profile existence among the upper-crust of society Tsukushi’s world is turned upside down when she encounters an elite clique of popular men known as the F4. From here, she begins a chaotic, fish out of water story where the boys are constantly involved. In the midst of this, she manages to fall for two of the Flowers Four creating a romantic triangle with two distinct flavors.The first relationship is your standard aloof love...interest angle with Rui Hanazawa. I like the quiet, kind, artist, nature of the character and his dynamic when opposite Tsukushi elegantly done despite the lack of dialogue between them However, this ceases to be when their growing relationship is subvert by his returning flame, Shizuka Toudou. While Shizuka was a welcomed addition providing exposition on the F4’s history, a humanizing character for the group as a whole, and a sort of guide for Tsukushi she felt more like a protagonist in her own right rather than a supporting character. But, by far, the worst thing the writers of the anime could have done was use the sympathetic character to remove Rui as the love interest for the secondary alternative.The secondary Romance begins with the leader of the F4. Tskasa Domyouji. To say that I despise this character is a gross understatement. His personality shifts between childishly lording his status over characters to picking on Tsukushi to being uncharacteristically nice to her. Worse yet he seems to have an almost incestuous fixation with his sister who happens to look like our main heroine. As if to feed into the creep factor he holds her down and nearly RAPES her in an early episode.While he does mature throughout the series the and eventually becomes worthy of the love interest role the aforementioned moments irredeemably corrupted the character to such a degree that I cannot stand his on-screen prescience. Even after he redeems himself by softening up I still detest the character I am supposed to root for. In short I found him to be a pretty face with little more than a base understanding of social functions that was easily overshadowed by almost every other character.bofscreen 1screen 3this brings me to the side-characters which can be summed up in the phrase as bland as white bread. In fact, the only two character’s whose names I remember without consulting MyAnimeList ar Soujirou and Akira and their main functions were to act as the F4’s exposition and voices of reason. Otherwise, every other character in the series is a direct embodiment of their trope. The childhood friend is a cookie-cutter childhood friend. Tsukushi’s family seems to be the cliché poor family composed of the overbearing mother, the pathetic father, and the annoying little brother. After that every other character just blends into the background until they decide to cause trouble or just randomly speaks up. To remind Tsukushi of her place.The focus on the pauper-versus-prince wealth disparity that persists throughout the series is a glaring weakness in storytelling. While this is a universal plot element that transcends its medium it actually weakens the relationship building aspect of the show. Combine this with the night-and day dynamic between Tsukushi and Tsukasa and the viewer gets a dysfunctional relationship that feels forced and unrealistic. Sure, one might see it as a clear case of opposites attract but, Boys Over Flowers executes this poorly.Thus I come to the shows worst flaw of this entire narrative. its execution If the story of an independent woman finding herself in a high-society prep school featuring a cast of bishounen men is familiar to you have likely seen a reverse-harem anime in the last 20 years. While the show’s formula is well-trotted ground for many anime fans at this point the story’s progression is painfully slow providing the viewer with very little pay-off. For any romantic plot steady character growth and interaction is key. Hana Youri Dango’s characters grow at a snail’s pace making its run a slog to get through.Style:screen 2screen 4screen 5Alongside the painfully weak story Hana Yori Dango suffers from an eye-ruining animation style that seems to be a halfhearted attempt to simply colorize the cells of the original manga. While the muted colors and stark background would have translated well to the manga format the same cannot be said for animation. In fact. I found the lack of vibrancy and life in some scenes to be somewhat distracting at times. Aside from that character movements seem a bit stiff which forces some of the dialogue-heavy moments feel more like poorly animated GIFs rather than properly animated sequences. But, discounting my nitpicking, I feel that character and background designs are beautiful when assessed separately as portraiture.Sound Design:Much to my delight, Hana Yori Dango scores highest in the category of sound design. Unfortunately, this applies to the series’ soundtrack rather than its vocal performances. While they can be taken separately, I feel the two are inexorably linked and aides the viewer in suspending their disbelief. For their time, the talent did a passable job of bringing the characters to life. But, it is important to remember that the 90s were an awkward time for anime dubs and this anime suffers greatly from the growing pains of the time. Thankfully the music does a great job of distracting us from the flawed delivery.For the most part, the music of Hana Yori Dango does quite a bit to amplify the high-society feel of the show. The opening and ending themes are light and airy J-pop pieces that connotes a relaxed and energetic tone. This does a great job of setting the tone as a slice of life piece. Intermittent pieces like Tomaso Abononi’s Symphony No. 5 adds depth to the upper-class feel of Eitoku Academy. Together, classical and popular styles fill the gap created by poor voice acting. Sadly, it isn’t enough.I watched the series in its English dub as distributed by Viz Media as instructed by the one who requested this review. While it was nice to hear popular 90s era voice actors like Micheal Adamthwaite and Stephen Park in the roles of Tsukasa Domyouji and Rui Hanazawa I feel that Kelly Sherodin was completely miscast as Tsukushi. This led to my great dismay as her pronunciations of the name Rui as Luis grated on my ears. Alongside this, some dialog was stiff and stilted leading to an overall flat delivery. The lack of compelling delivery forces me to dislike the dub but only slightly.Recommendations:I do not usually give my recommendations separate from my conclusion but since the following are TV dramas rather than anime I feel obligated to break form and inform you as to the existence of two great shows.  If you wish to see this concept done  properly I point you to the Taiwanese Drama Meteor Garden as I believe the acters Vic Zhou and Jerry Yan provide the best characterizations of the two male leads.  While the Karean variant has its merits, I find it slightly less appealing.  Still, feel free to check both out for yorself as this is a matter of preference to me.Final Thoughts:In conclusion I feel that Hana Yori Dango suffers from a lack of proper execution. But, it is still a salvageable piece. In many ways it is the progenitor to great series in its genre and I encourage fans of pieces like Ouran High School Host Club to check this out, The dub is currently licensed by Viz Media and is available at Rightstufanime.

While the Karean variant has its merits, I find it slightly less appealing.  Still, feel free to check both out for yorself as this is a matter of preference to me.Final Thoughts:In conclusion I feel that Hana Yori Dango suffers from a lack of proper execution. But, it is still a salvageable piece. In many ways it is the progenitor to great series in its genre and I encourage fans of pieces like Ouran High School Host Club to check this out, The dub is currently licensed by Viz Media and is available at Rightstufanime. Please feel free to enjoy Boys Over Flowers and stay tuned here for more reviews.', ""I loved the story concept when I first heard it--it sounded awesome and I couldn't wait to watch it. Guess what? It is awesome! I have watched this series numerous times with different friends (surprisingly a few were guys!) and all have loved it. The animation style is a bit more old school... but in a way it's more endearing than all color shininess. I like the more subdued coloring style in settings and the music fits well. I love the violin music and the opening song. Some people may be annoyed by character stubborness... key word DRAMA, lots and lots of it. And just...when you think there should be a happy understanding and feelings returned time and time again? Think again. Though may I say she's a stubborn idiot when it comes to love, Makino is a strong-willed character that you can admire. Doumyouji is a tempermental  rich-boy, but under the tough-guy act he's more of a cute bratty kid who doesn't know how to act around a crush... and gradually starts to grow up. With the setting, the characters, plot, romance, drama, and a bit of humor, I highly recommend this series. when you think there should be a happy understanding and feelings returned time and time again?

I can honestly say that, without a doubt, watching ""Boys Over Flowers"" (BARF) was the most excruciating anime experience in all my life. Never before have I so hated almost every character in a show so fucking much that I found myself vainly waiting for them all to be slaughtered in a school shooting or terrorist attack, only to be met with disappointment when the sadly death-free ending is framed as a happy one.I want to make this perfectly clear:...In no way are my words intended to be hyperbolic. I truly do so hate this show with every fiber of my being; so much so, in fact, that I will immediately think the worst of anyone who likes it because only someone who is ignorant, stupid, deluded and/or a complete piece of shit could possibly enjoy this show... and there are absolutely no exceptions to this rule. Yeah, fucking fight me, bitches.So, yeah, scores. Whoop-dee-fucking-doo...Story: 1Art: 6Sound: 6Characters: 1Enjoyment: 1OVERALL: ***ZERO OUT OF TEN***By the way, I am going to spoil the shit out of BARF because fuck this show, and I am not going to bother using any of the characters\' names because fuck each and every one of them with a razor-wire dildo. Now let\'s get this over with...STORY: BARF is little more than a cheap hetero/co-ed bastardization of the fantastic shoujo classic \'Oniisama e...\', as both revolve around a high school girl from a comparatively-modest background finding herself unwittingly-involved with a clique of popular stuck-up rich kids, and getting bullied mercilessly as a result of the association. In this case, a girl from a poor family gets into a prestigious high school, but ends up becoming public enemy #1 on campus after she stands up to the leader of an influential clique of spoiled rich douchebags with the most fragile bitch-ass egos in existence. Because she does the right thing, the childish rich kids order everyone in the school to bully her without mercy, which results in the entire school body constantly abusing her at every opportunity.Throughout all 51 episodes of this pitiful excuse for a show, girls and boys alike take turns literally beating her into the ground, often with baseball bats, as though she were an evil piñata full of diamonds or something. At one point, a number of boys even tie her up to a fucking sports car and drag her behind it, with half the school cheering it on like it were a sporting event. Add to this several sexual assaults, a few murder attempts and at least one forcible kidnapping, and you\'ve got yourself at least a few life sentences\' worth of felonious behavior by at least half of the cocksuckers who attend this horrid school... which never once attracts the attention of pretty much any authority figure able or willing to intervene. Pretty fucking despicable, right? Well, just you wait, because we\'re not done yet!The show then attempts to trick you into thinking these snooty jackasses are actually good people by having them retaliate against some of her most violent attackers, but what the idiot author(s) apparently forgot is that they were the one who ordered their classmates to do this shit in the first place, never made a real effort to put a stop to the attacks once and for all, and instigated further violence whenever she did something that even remotely displeased these fucking losers. And to think people defend them...This is where it starts getting especially twisted, though. The ringleader of this douchetarded little clique, the one who is by far the most responsible for every bit of the misery I just mentioned, professes his love for the MC early in the show, and maintains his love for her even as he arranges for her future misery. Even worse, whenever the MC rebuffs his rapey advances or simply refuses to reciprocate his confessed feelings, what does he do? Handle rejection maturely and move on with his life? HE FUCKING SLAPS HER! This happens so many times, in fact, that I got desensitized to it after a while.And now, finally, here is the worst part: Not only does the whiny prick responsible for all of her misery profess his love to her early on in the show, but he ends up being the one she chooses in the end! True to form for this piece-of-shit series, our bruised & battered MC ends up developing one of the most hardcore cases of Stockholm Syndrome ever displayed, and chooses to eventually marry the most stupid, ridiculous and abusive man-baby in all of Japan! I lost all sympathy for this foolish ditz when she refused to disassociate from these overprivileged pricks, but this decision made me almost wish the schoolchildren actually succeeded in murdering her.Fuck this shit.ART: Whatever. The smiles look fucking weird.SOUND: Whatever. Who cares what a pile of shit sounds like anyways?CHARACTERS: As I said earlier, I so hated this group of taint-licks that I wished for them all to die the most horrific deaths imaginable by the time I reached the fifth episode. Hardly anyone is even remotely redeemable, from the MC & her family to the rich douche-nozzles & their families, and the only characters who display anything akin to a decent personality are auxiliary characters who, for the most part, have relatively-little influence on what inevitably transpires and even become apologists on occasion.ENJOYMENT: In order to mitigate the discomfort of having my senses abused by this deplorable atrocity, I literally watched the vast majority of this series by playing it at 2x speed and fast-forwarding through every non-dialogue scene. If anything, perhaps I will consider this an especially-painful rite of passage, if only to justify my suffering through this turd sandwiched between stiffer turds.----------------------IN SUMMATION: If you genuinely enjoy BARF, you are a terrible person and I hope equally-terrible things happen to you until the day you die, which I will joyfully celebrate.Just kidding... not.

There was also parts of it I really liked. My main issue with it was that the same problem that infects a lot of romance animes, the unrealistic conclusions, overtorn thoughts, and ridiculous action or inaction.The very first part of the series was a slow starter, but it began to pick up and even though the relationships and characters felt shallow it wasn\'t bad. Eventually the character\'s became deeper but at this point, even with a pretty good story, the puzzling actions of some of the main characters became annoying.""Does he really like me?"" Of course he does you idiot.Later...it becomes really bad and nonsensical but I will save the spoilers.I also really wanted to see the pairing more as an actual couple because I felt like that would have lead to some interesting character interaction but they didn\'t get there.This series had potential so I\'m a little disappointed it ended up so average. it becomes really bad and nonsensical but I will save the spoilers.I also really wanted to see the pairing more as an actual couple because I felt like that would have lead to some interesting character interaction but they didn\'t get there.This series had potential so I\'m a little disappointed it ended up so average.', ""The opening theme is pretty catchy and while the story was very slow to get to the point, I did enjoy the drama of this series.That being said, it was way too much drama and it felt like everything was repeating.Certain scenes were realistic and others...just weren't.The ending of the anime didn't really give me any closure, since the heroine didn't seem really close to her main lead at least not in a romantic way, but I was able to get through this anime.I would recommend it to someone like me, just enjoys watching anime and wants to add another title to this list, however...I would not watch this a second time. I would not watch this a second time."", ""The Manga was great, the anime was great, the movie was boring as sh** (did they even try or did they just sh** in a bucket and call it an anime movie?), THE DRAMA WAS FLAWLESS!!! Even if you've never read the manga or seen the anime, SEE THE DRAMA!!! I realize i'm promoting the drama more than the anime but OMIGOD, it is THE drama (the score, btw, is mostly for the drama)! "", ""A story about a poor girl moving to most fucked up school filled with rich snobs.**Due to the nature of this review I will be spoiling the first 15 episodes of the series. This includes a major initial love triangle that gets resolved.**Boys over flowers is a *reverse harem* romance comedy series about this heroine who is really poor who attends this really super duper rich school. In this school there is 4 top dogs. Known as the F4. Though really you will only get to know about 2 of them. Particularly, Rui hanazawa = the violin player. And Curly man who is also...the leader of the F4 and the MMC. The series than revolves around 5 (really just the 3) characters and how they all affect each other. Other characters show up from time to time. Jealous women mostly. But again it mostly revolves around those 3 and later just curly man and the FMC.Now this series starts off really bad. Why you ask? Well, the F4 are the biggest group of assholes ever. These guys are very harsh people, that make satan look like a pretty princess. They beat up random ass people who bump shoulders, Hurt kids so much that they have to drop out. And if they put a red card in your locker that means that every other student will be out for your blood. They are such a vile group its kinda hard to root for any romance. With that being said, they do kinda grow on you albeit begrudgingly.Now the series starts with this love triangle between rui, the FMC and the MMC. Rui is actually the nice guy of the group. But is also an asshole because this is a shoujo manga. Now there is this push and pull thing going on between the FMC and Rui, and Curly man wants in on the action but his desire to date the FMC is very odd. I don't understand why he starts liking her in the first place.Let me break down what he does in the first 10 episodes of the series. First he hires 4 goons to rape her. Then he puts a red card in her locker (which she fights back and the male lead starts gaining affection for her).  Then he tries to rape her himself. Then the school tie her up to a car and *drag her around* and he runs away like a fucking dumbass. They are other moments where he physically assaults' her. I understand that I've made him look like the worst guy in human history but he does do nice things and this is the problem I landed in. The author wants us to believe that the MMC and FMC are supposed to be together and there is this push and pull thing happening between them but at the same time Curly man is constantly going way too far and it seems absolutely ridiculous that the author just wants us to sweep this shit under the rug.They are both good quiet and loud moments in this series that makes you appreciate the MMC but in contrast to the entire thing he is a piece of shit. Even if by the end of it, I did think that these 2 were meant to be together.I originally was rooting for Rui. Because he was i shit you not the nicest character in the series so far. And he was still an asshole. There is this whole love triangle this that becomes a square when Rui's crush shows up and he leaves with her to France. But its done so poorly i just completely missed it tbh. I'm glad Rui left though because this did solidify the relationship between curly man and FMC but at that point i still didn't actually like the MMC. Rui does show up again but this is purely to fuck with there relationship and nothing else.Majority of the cast also suck massive dick. Lets start the FMC's parents. They literally put her in a school like that so she can marry some rich kid and they can be together happily ever after. One time the mom refused a bribe from someone's mom because she believe that he daughter would marry her son and be even more rich. The dad is also just a complete deadbeat. What are these parents man....The 3 wicked witches of the west are also awful. They are just there to fuck up the main heroine as much as possible and have no repercussions whatsoever even by the end of the series. Any heroine that tries to help the FMC is also trying to murder her behind her back. There is such a large amount of garbage people in this series it really makes you wonder what kind of fucked up childhood the author had.The only really likable character in this series that has personality and charm and isn't retarded (mostly) is the Tomboy Princess. She is very likable and i wanted to see more of her. Too bad she only shows near like the end of the series.I also could not take any moment in the series seriously. Like there is this music playing every single time whenever there is a dramatic sequence to the point of over doing it. I cannot help but laugh during these moments. They happen so much and are so repetitive that I just lose it from time to time.I've seen some people say that Curly man is a great guy. I hope people saying this get out of the abusive relationship they are currently in because the MMC should not be the type of guy you go afterTLDR: The series in general is just filled with shit characters, with no personalities that get practically no repercussions whatsoever. That is my problem. There are good moments but its not worth wading through a sea of bullshit to find it. 3/10Im curious about the movie though. the leader of the F4 and the MMC.

It helps me in the bad and good days. Because of drama i started to think different. It made me smarter and more aware of the world.Thanks to this drama i'm now that girl i always wanted to be.To some it will sound off and totally overdramatic maybe your right.

This series kicks serious ass!  I'm not dancing through the flowers on this one.  I'm serious if you haven't seen it and consider yourself a romance fan you are currently failing at life.

Granted, I don\'t typically watch romance-centric animes, but this was a treat because initially, the story has many things going for it. However, overtime, the good was overshadowed by the bad and with each episode I found myself falling out of love with the story more and more.And here are just a few reasons why:Characters [ 6 / 10 ]The main character, Tsukushi Makino, works a treat in the beginning of the series.She\'s just a typical teenage girl - neither particularly unique, but also not boring or bland - trying to get...through her last years of school. She is hardworking, caring, and though her parents are grating with all their love of money, none of it rubs off on her. She\'s grown up, sensible, brave and despite initially hesitating, she stands up for others.But there is also a more childlike side to her, which is to be expected from such a young heroine. Her stubbornness knows now bounds, she can be a little oblivious - but to be fair, none of the characters make it very obvious that they like her more than as a friend - and yes, she can be somewhat selfish and prone to making mistakes. This; however, is balanced out by her self-awareness - her ability to reflect over her faults and mistakes, which makes her even more likeable.Unfortunately, when it comes to the f4 she goes from being this admirable girl to a fragile little flower that puts up with their sh-t even when they go too far and is nice to them, even though they manipulate and mistreat her.Even when someone has already been two-faced to her before she is very quick to forgive them - which is a nice trait to have, but so often it just gets her into trouble because she doesn\'t know who to forgive and to what extent to let her guard down around people that have betrayed her trust in them before.So she keeps getting into similar situations, creating a relatively cyclical plot, which becomes tedious and frustrating to watch for someone like myself.Initially, Tsukushi is also more than capable of defending herself, but as of recently she\'s become a doll. Which, on the one hand, can be viewed as development - albeit in a terrible direction - in response to the constant torment she\'s being put through, but on the other hand it can be viewed as a forceful attempt to push the plot and characters in a direction they would naturally go given what we know about them.. which seems like lazy writing to me.Her close friends - Kazuya, Makiko and Yuki - are thankfully friendly and supportive people, to my relief. Granted, they aren\'t the bravest people ever and don\'t really do much in the way of standing up for themselves or for anyone, but they\'ll pay attention to their friend and hear her out. They are there for her, which is more than I can say for a lot of friends of female heroines from any medium. They also each have unique personalities without being unrealistic. Sadly, we don\'t see nearly enough of their interactions because I would honestly have rather seen more of that than her interactions with the f4. Also, shoe-horning that crush Kazuya has on Tsukushi feels jarring - they would have been better off just being best friends. I do like Kazuya overall, though. He\'s funny and his interactions with Tsukasa are surprisingly fun to watch (much as I don\'t like Tsukasa).I don\'t like the Lilies - the popular girls at school that constantly bully her, and Sakuraka is incredibly cartoonish. At first, I was okay with her. She wasn\'t anything interesting but then her character took a tangent and well, sure she had her sympathetic backstory, but considering she managed to find someone who liked and defended her and had no reason to go against her at all bar a stupid crush who clearly didn\'t like her back. I found her character to be repetitive and... kind of dumb?Tsukasa\'s mother isn\'t as intimidating as the boys make her out to be through a lack of feats in being able to achieve her goals - which makes her underwhelming. Her methods are petty, uncreative, obvious and all for nothing. But to be fair, I didn\'t really care for this story long enough to get to the point where the heroine gets to the point in her relationship where she meets her potential mother-in-law. After all, I didn\'t care for the couple at all.I liked the teacher, Urara. She\'s interesting. She\'s the only teacher in the whole school that does anything. All the rest of them are puppets. She still doesn\'t do much, but at least she does /something/ to keep things just balanced out enough that the setting this story takes place in - a highschool completely ruled over by the f4 - seems feasible.Junpei was interesting, though it was disappointing to know that he a) a model - because apparently all her new friends have to end up being rich; especially the guys - and b) planning to use her to get back on Tsukasa. BUT I can totally get with his reasons for getting back on Tsukasa and I was glad that Tsukasa took the revenge without returning any more hits considering what he did to Junpei\'s brother. Still, I think Tsukushi should have told him off more, or even smacked him, or something for causing her so much grief and kidnapping her and manipulating her.But then, she\'s become completely /used/ to being manipulated - which is NOT a good thing. And it\'s the thing that bothers me MOST about this anime. How easily this abuse and manipulation and the turning of a strong girl into a victim is romanticised and made out to be harmless and sweet... This is WRONG.I suppose we get some admittance of wrong doing from Junpei which is about as much repayment as I\'d expect from a redeemed shounen villain, but, still...Shizuka is probably one of my favourites. She is INCREDIBLY supportive of Tsukushi despite barely knowing her. She\'s like a personal godmother to her, and I love her autonomy, her freedom, her love for everyone, and her confidence. When she makes a choice, she sticks by it but she\'s not really a hot-head or fiery, or stubborn. She\'s a quiet and calm yet decisive individual. She\'s much more the grown up than most older women in the anime. And she\'s beautiful inside and out. Of course, when she makes her choice, she\'s willing to leave everything behind and that may seem selfish, but honestly...? She had to do it for herself and for the sake of people like Rui who needed to find their own way and become their own people. That said, I vaguely recall her telling Tsukushi to look out for Rui... and that wasn\'t a good ask of her. Rui needs to be independent. (And to develop more of a character).However, the f4...Sojiro and Akira are only there to excuse and romanticise Tsukasa\'s behaviours. They\'re there to be ""worse"" than him in their womanizing ways. But at least they don\'t sexually assault woman, I guess. That can\'t be said for /all/ the f4 though. They have little personality beyond their loyalty to Tsuakasa and their love for bullying and being with women. Oh, and the fact that they\'re supposedly not ""pure"" anymore. They are the typical popular boys only there as part of the background. I think if you changed their voice actors or their faces completely half way through the series, no one would even notice.Rui is the most decent of them, and initially is the friendliest to Tsukushi. He\'s much less of a bully; he actually has a talent outside of bullying; he isn\'t a womaniser; and whilst his pining for Shizuka sometimes borders on unhealthy, he\'s decent. Sadly, he\'s also not very exciting and not very romantic. There is something funny and sweet about his obliviousness, and I like it when he finally starts laughing and smiling more, but he\'s just not that interesting. And it\'s obvious he\'s not getting over Shizuka any time soon. (To be honest, I can get why he loves her, but I think he has a long way to go before he\'s deserving of her.) He\'s also clearly not able to take care of himself much, he\'s quiet and he\'s distant. Which is good, but when you want to create a love-interest... this does get in the way. And when Tsukushi needs it the most - i.e in the snow blizzard in the mountains - Rui might tell off the Lilies but he doesn\'t go after her to help her, or call some rescuers or professionals that could help them instead. These people drip with money, why can\'t any of them get help? No signal? And Rui and the f4 seem physically strong enough and with the right equipment, together they could go out to search for her. They\'d cover more ground and be safer if they went in pairs and split in groups of two to search in different directions. More importantly, Rui should have stopped Tsukushi before she even left the house. That was a bit of a disappointing moment. Also him playing with her feelings when he came back from France was a bit annoying. Still, he\'s the most decent of the f4.Then we\'ve got Tsukasa. The devil himself. This guy beats the crap out of other guys for fun. This guy just needs someone to bump into them and he\'ll start beating the crap out of them. He\'s rude, temperamental, unapologetic, violent, aggressive, forceful, controlling, manipulative - everything you would hate in a boyfriend and see in a narcissistic abuser. In the first seven episodes there is /nothing/ likeable about him, and it only gets /worse/.Also, he somehow falls in love with Tsukushi despite initially being reminded of his sister by her? What the heck-?By far the worst things he does in the series include: kidnapping a student,haiving his people knock her unconscious then undress her and dress her in the clothes he wants her to wear (and not showing any remorse for that), deciding to just control her life; later getting angry at her, almost beating the crap out of her, and almost sexually assaulting her (he even forcefully kissed her and started undressing her completely against her attempts to just escape him haiving terrorised her initially); forcing her to hug him then almost forcefully kissing her again, bringing her to tears; and planning to get her and Rui expelled just because they are together. No matter what his reasons behind it, he uses his money and influence to get students kicked out of school because of sheer pettiness and vindictivness. It takes Rui and Tsukushi putting up a fight to finally persuade him. And you know, he is NEVER remorseful for anything. He NEVER apologises for any of his wrongdoings - just expects other people to apologise to him.People say he gets better as the show progresses, but no. The show just does a better job of making him look like the hero compared to the villains of the story, thereby excusing him and freeing him of any proper consequences, or of true character development and developing some damn self-awareness.If he were just a little reckless, if he were just a little dumb, or temperamental or a little bit vindictive...But no. He goes out of his way to be the absolute WORST.Sadly, the characters are some of what I most care about in a show. When poorly executed and developed, they can really ruin the viewing experience.Sound [ 6 / 10 ]To be honest, I\'m not actually an expert in this area, so I don\'t really know what to say. It\'s okay, I guess. Sometimes it fits the scene and is really nice, other times it doesn\'t really. The first opening song is okay, I guess. I preferred the visuals for it though. It\'s nothing memorable, but on a good episode, the soundtrack does its job. What more could I want? It\'s not the thing I care most about.Art [ 7 / 10 ]I see that not many people like it, but I actually think it has a certain charm.Sure it doesn\'t make the characters look pretty - though that\'s also down to hairstyle and whatnot - but I feel like it makes them a little more realistic in its own way?Certainly the characters are designed and drawn out with relatively realistic proportions bar the exaggerated broadness of all the f4\'s shounlders, and whilst the faces could use some more variety in facial structure, the hairstyles look different and new compared to most anime I\'ve seen thus far. There isn\'t much detail, the lines aren\'t as sharp, but that\'s not bad for an anime that takes place in a more ""real"" world. It dates the anime, but in a nice way.And I love the art and animation in the opening.Also, the different characters manage to look unique without the anime requiring wild hair-colours or eye-colours. Instead the anime chooses to play with hair length/style, eyes, build, etc, which I think looks a lot better. That said, without a memorable personality, you\'d hardly remember them because of their looks. So characters also rely on a good personality. Which is realistic - how many faces do we forget unless we are immediately hit with a unique personality or a unique style every day - but it can be a hindrance to the anime too. I also think that the lighting on the hair makes it look kind of greasy, sorry.Story [ 4 / 10 ]Probably this series\' weakest point because it centres around a damn love triangle and then switches to another potential love triangle and then... ugh... so many triangles!The plot sometimes feels very contrived and unnatural. It doesn\'t fit the art of the series, or Tsukushi\'s clearly multi-faceted character that shows many different faces to different people like a real person would.It\'s enjoyable initially - it feels like a coming of age anime in some ways, where the protagonist goes through her love life and school life simultaneously, developing as a person and coming out of the highschool experience more mature and even more independent. I expected so much progress from Tsukushi in terms of cutting ties with her parents who were a horrible influence, her getting over her crushes for the sake of pursuing a happier and healthier life...But that development never came.All of the story is basically focused on her and Tsukasa eventually getting together, despite the fact that they don\'t really deserve each other. They\'re clearly not good for each other.I guess to the anime\'s credit, no matter what the rest of the f4 says, the heroine doesn\'t actually change the bad boy. She just doesn\'t. And most times in real life, that doesn\'t happen. Love doesn\'t change people, not unless they want to change out of their own will.Unfortunately much of the story is dragged out.The plot is rather basic - outcast gets together with popular bully bad boy character. Very tropey.Initially the premise of Tsukushi getting involved with the f4 was something I found interesting. I liked the premise of her falling for the nicest of the f4 and thought maybe she could either a) influence the rest of the f4 through him and change the school system, or b) persuade him to leave the f4, even if it meant losing his reputation because he\'s not like them, even if they were once his friends - thus causing him to develop and break ties in order to become a better person with safer bonds and connections. Very soon into this series this fell apart, though, and while at first I had hoped ""hey, maybe the story will come around and get better"", it never actually did.I initially even didn\'t mind the idea of the bad boy and good girl getting together. I mean, I loved when Tsukasa and Kazuya got along so well during the squid fishing activity, and for a moment I had hope that maybe the two of them would befriend one another and then Tsukasa could befriend Tsukushi and from /there/ develop a slow-burn romance.That idea was immediately chucked away after it overstayed it\'s welcome though and Tsukasa and Kaguya never do befriend one another. At one point, Kaguya does get invited to the f4 but he gets ditched almost as soon as he is invited. The dynamics between the characters don\'t change, leaving the relationships stagnant and dull.Throughout the story, I got introduced to new characters and for a moment, the story grew more interesting and likeable, but soon enough the one-note nature of the characters became obvious and once more the story and characters grew stagnant.I wanted to love the show, because I loved the personality and goals of the main character at the beginning of this anime, but the story took a tangent for the worse.Overall [ 5 / 10 ]Initially, I had rated this much higher - around 7-8/10. That was before I watched almost 40 of the 51 episodes of this show and realised that it probably wasn\'t going to go in any nice direction.My recommendation to you is: there are probably shoujo anime out there that are a far better influence and include more realistic depictions of people than this anime. If you have absolutely no other anime you planned to watch and you have watched well over a hundred anime, then sure... suit yourself. Feel free to watch and form your own opinion on it. Maybe you\'ll like it. But don\'t go watching it for the life-lessons, because you won\'t find any good ones here. through her last years of school. She is hardworking, caring, and though her parents are grating with all their love of money, none of it rubs off on her. She\'s grown up, sensible, brave and despite initially hesitating, she stands up for others.But there is also a more childlike side to her, which is to be expected from such a young heroine. Her stubbornness knows now bounds, she can be a little oblivious - but to be fair, none of the characters make it very obvious that they like her more than as a friend - and yes, she can be somewhat selfish and prone to making mistakes. This; however, is balanced out by her self-awareness - her ability to reflect over her faults and mistakes, which makes her even more likeable.Unfortunately, when it comes to the f4 she goes from being this admirable girl to a fragile little flower that puts up with their sh-t even when they go too far and is nice to them, even though they manipulate and mistreat her.Even when someone has already been two-faced to her before she is very quick to forgive them - which is a nice trait to have, but so often it just gets her into trouble because she doesn\'t know who to forgive and to what extent to let her guard down around people that have betrayed her trust in them before.So she keeps getting into similar situations, creating a relatively cyclical plot, which becomes tedious and frustrating to watch for someone like myself.Initially, Tsukushi is also more than capable of defending herself, but as of recently she\'s become a doll. Which, on the one hand, can be viewed as development - albeit in a terrible direction - in response to the constant torment she\'s being put through, but on the other hand it can be viewed as a forceful attempt to push the plot and characters in a direction they would naturally go given what we know about them.. which seems like lazy writing to me.Her close friends - Kazuya, Makiko and Yuki - are thankfully friendly and supportive people, to my relief. Granted, they aren\'t the bravest people ever and don\'t really do much in the way of standing up for themselves or for anyone, but they\'ll pay attention to their friend and hear her out. They are there for her, which is more than I can say for a lot of friends of female heroines from any medium. They also each have unique personalities without being unrealistic. Sadly, we don\'t see nearly enough of their interactions because I would honestly have rather seen more of that than her interactions with the f4. Also, shoe-horning that crush Kazuya has on Tsukushi feels jarring - they would have been better off just being best friends. I do like Kazuya overall, though. He\'s funny and his interactions with Tsukasa are surprisingly fun to watch (much as I don\'t like Tsukasa).I don\'t like the Lilies - the popular girls at school that constantly bully her, and Sakuraka is incredibly cartoonish. At first, I was okay with her. She wasn\'t anything interesting but then her character took a tangent and well, sure she had her sympathetic backstory, but considering she managed to find someone who liked and defended her and had no reason to go against her at all bar a stupid crush who clearly didn\'t like her back. I found her character to be repetitive and... kind of dumb?Tsukasa\'s mother isn\'t as intimidating as the boys make her out to be through a lack of feats in being able to achieve her goals - which makes her underwhelming. Her methods are petty, uncreative, obvious and all for nothing. But to be fair, I didn\'t really care for this story long enough to get to the point where the heroine gets to the point in her relationship where she meets her potential mother-in-law. After all, I didn\'t care for the couple at all.I liked the teacher, Urara. She\'s interesting. She\'s the only teacher in the whole school that does anything. All the rest of them are puppets. She still doesn\'t do much, but at least she does /something/ to keep things just balanced out enough that the setting this story takes place in - a highschool completely ruled over by the f4 - seems feasible.Junpei was interesting, though it was disappointing to know that he a) a model - because apparently all her new friends have to end up being rich; especially the guys - and b) planning to use her to get back on Tsukasa. BUT I can totally get with his reasons for getting back on Tsukasa and I was glad that Tsukasa took the revenge without returning any more hits considering what he did to Junpei\'s brother. Still, I think Tsukushi should have told him off more, or even smacked him, or something for causing her so much grief and kidnapping her and manipulating her.But then, she\'s become completely /used/ to being manipulated - which is NOT a good thing. And it\'s the thing that bothers me MOST about this anime. How easily this abuse and manipulation and the turning of a strong girl into a victim is romanticised and made out to be harmless and sweet... This is WRONG.I suppose we get some admittance of wrong doing from Junpei which is about as much repayment as I\'d expect from a redeemed shounen villain, but, still...Shizuka is probably one of my favourites.

I loved how they had a clear plots and didn't steer away from it. These plots were not as simple as a love triangle they were complex and really developed.

I like the vintage look that this anime provides.Characters- This anime gives a wide variety of characters that we see grow...and blossom from each trail that they face. Each character progressed and we got to see who they actually are. Even supporting characters were developed to their full potential and that is what makes this anime different from other anime's. No character was left alone and forgotten about.Enjoyment- I enjoyed this anime thoroughly. It was more than just another love story and that' s what makes it different from other romance anime's.  It had a story to tell that was deeper that just love. They had economic situations that many people face on a daily basis and internal feelings that people would feel.I totally would recommend this anime to anyone who wants a good romance story that is complex and has meaning. and blossom from each trail that they face.

First of all I do recommend this anime for everyone who loves romance. This anime was so good! I loved the story and characters, but there are some things that I absolutely didn't like. In my opinion this anime could be much more better.Spoiler alert: In the beginning I did like the girl (main character) she was really strong and stood up for everybody, but after a few episodes I really started to hating her, she is so annoying she doesn't even know who she loves or what she wants, I understand that is normal in the beginning but...after a few episodes I was like ''come on girl what do you want!?? The leader of F4 was a jerk first but later on he really turned into a good person and he really does love her, but that stupid girl is so blind, EVEN  in the last episode she did not even say I love you to him, the girl was so cold to him, this anime turned from a girl who is strong to a confused girl who doesn't know what she wants and that really pissed me off. Really sad that the creator made this decision... after a few episodes I was like ''come on girl what do you want!??

It's a classic messy shoujo that will piss you off to no end, but it's so brainless that you end up feeling really relaxed while watching it and it's really fun to just sit back and pay half-attention to. There's some genuinely good character development and some likeable people, some really sweet moments, and some inconsistencies that will make you kind of insane.If you like brain-rotting shoujo and need something less-than-serious to get your mind off of things, this show is perfect! Tsukushi will make you nuts, but you'll love her anyway. Have fun. "", 'Before I begin this review, I just want to say that this review is a bit late and my first impressions from my blog (listed on my profile on this site) hasn\'t changed with the exception of some of the things that I have to add after finally finishing this series. Where to begin?I remember back in high school some of my friends mentioned this anime to me, or more specifically the Japanese drama from 2005 but those same friends also had the mangas so yeah. But instead of referring to the series as Hana Yori Dango, they referred to it as Boys Over Flowers...(which is what the title translates to here in the West). I didn\'t really find myself interested in watching the Japanese Drama or reading the manga, BUT the title, Hana Yori Dango has stayed in the back of my mind much like a few other animes that came out around the same time (Fushigi Yuugi, Ayashi no Ceres, etc).It almost feels like the 90s were the time for the more mature Shoujo and romance animes because when I compare this anime to Marmalade Boy and Fushigi Yuugi, I always find the same common themes (there\'s always a love triangle of sorts, the main female protagonist starts off bickering with the main love interest, and there\'s apparently always something trying to keep the two main characters apart, and it\'s usually from the girl\'s side of the relationship that things get tense due to the girl hesitating on acting on their feelings while the guy risks their lives to win the girl over).Anyways, what is Hana Yori Dango about? It\'s about a poor/lower class girl named Tsukishi, who after defending her friend from the F4, the most popular boys in Eitoku(sp?) Academy, it’s then that a red tagging “game” begins between her and the F4 and of course being tagged with a red card makes all the other students at the school bully Tsukishi. It’s during Tsukishi’s many interactions with the members of F4 that Tsukishi finds herself slowly falling for two members of the F4 (Tsukasa and Rui/Lui).I bingewatched HYD in almost a week and a half, and I gotta say, I had a rough time getting into it at first. The art style took some getting used to (and it\'s not because I\'m not used to 90s anime, I\'ve watched a lot of 90s anime). I think it was the designs for some of the characters. Especially the girls. A lot of the girls looked a bit weird or off to me. Most of the guys ranged from ok looking to good. But I got used to it and once I did, I found myself starting to like the anime. I still like it actually, but I\'m getting a bit ahead of myself here.In the beginning I actually legit liked Tsukishi because she reminded me a lot of me, at least where being nice and always helping others is concerned and I don\'t blame her for kicking Tsukasa\'s ass once in a while, cause the guy needs a good slap to the face when he mouths off as he does. Speaking of Tsukasa, I didn\'t like him in the beginning. He came off as a total... he was a jerk, a cocky jerk at that. Then there\'s the other members of the F4. Lui was... interesting...The way Tsukishi hyped him for the audience made him seem like one of those quiet shy jerks who acts like a jerk but really he\'s a kindhearted person, but I found him to be boring. They made him classy and somewhat kindhearted, yeah. He was the first one of the F4 to be nice to Tsukishi, but IDK. He felt boring. After I lost interest in Rui and Tsukushi getting together, I turned my interest to Tsukasa because he was starting to mature and grow up some.Again, I\'m getting a bit ahead of myself. Let\'s talk about Akira and Soujiro. In the beginning when I didn\'t care much for Rui and Tsukasa, I actually found myself liking Akira and Soujiro a lot. They were funny and charming. They actually had a lot of patience in trying to get Tsukishi with Tsukasa (or with Rui) and they didn\'t treat her like complete crap. I mean they were a bit rude towards her in the beginning but they quickly warmed up to her. They even supported her possibly going out with either Rui or Tsukasa. But sadly despite all of their comedic moments and their charm, they only play the role of matchmakers or comedy relief when another side character, Kazuya is on screen with them. It\'s sad too because i really want to see them take the spotlight so that the viewers can take a breather from the constant back and forth Tsukishi does with Lui and Tsukasa (especially Tsukasa, like dang girl, just hurry it up and tell him something, don\'t leave him hanging!).Out of all the female characters, I absolutely loved Tsubaki and Shizuka. These two are so classy yet kindhearted. Both of them supported Tsukishi on whoever she wanted to date (Rui or Tsukasa) and they accepted her for who she was. I was actually sad to see Shizuka leave eventually. Then there was Yuriko and her two gal pals, these three were fake as all hell and I wanted to beat the crap out of them. I kinda wish there was some character development for the terrible trio but there wasn\'t. When it seemed like there was, they immediately go back to being nasty witches and it destroys whatever character development there was for them. Then there\'s Sakurako. Sakurako annoyed me from the first time I saw her. She was all too sweet and I figured she was gonna be the fake sweet and manipulative girl from the get go. While I was getting frustrated with Tsukishi being indecisive about Rui and Tsukasa, I didn\'t see Sakurako\'s meddling as a fresh breath of air. As a matter of fact I didn\'t like her little arc at all.Finally we come to Junpei, the worst ""villain"" in the entire anime. I didn\'t like him, his character design was the worst of all the guys on the show and his personality is even worse. I understand his motives for wanting revenge against Tsukasa, but that whole kidnap Tsukishi and beat up Tsukasa scene was extremely over the top. It made me extremely uncomfortable. It\'s almost worse than when Tsukasa almost raped Tsukishi while angry at the thought of her dating Rui or something. And rape is something no one deserves to go through.Unfortunately, the beat up Tsukasa scene and the Tsukasa almost raping Tsukishi and how all the characters dealt with it afterwards felt awkward and unsettling. It was as though the author really wanted to try and surprise the audience and make them accept that both the scenes happen and the characters are over it and fine with it because it\'s a love story and everything is gonna be sunshine and skittles.And also I don\'t like Tsukishi\'s family, I mean I understand their financial situation but you can\'t rely on your daughter to date and marry a rich dude alone. I\'ll admit Tsukishi\'s parents are funny, but the whole “let’s rely on our daughter to end our money problems” thing just really annoys me (They also have a son who could help out with their money problems, too…).Like I said before, I wish we could get a few one shot episodes that focus more on the side characters than Rui, Tsukishi, and Tsukasa so we could get a breather from the ongoing drama between them, but sadly this is a shoujo anime, and most shoujo/romance animes must keep the spotlight on the two (or three) main characters while leaving the side and supporting characters in the limelight. Which is a shame because while I\'ve grown to like Tsukasa immensely, I still find Akira, Soujiro, Tsubaki, and Shizuka far more interesting than watching Tsukishi\'s indecisiveness. As a matter of fact, I lowkey liked the minor interactions that Sakurako had with Kazuya because if they had their own little one shot episode/adventure together, I can totally see Kazuya slowly getting over Tsukishi and moving onto Sakurako and getting her to not be so fake.That\'s pretty much it. I was gonna talk about the Rui and Shizuka arc but I think that was actually a good arc and I had no complaints with that. And as for the Tsukasa and Tsukishi\'s relationship,  rooted for the two of them to get together the whole time, but I\'m getting tired of Tsukishi flaking out on Tsukasa, especially after they\'ve had a crap ton of cute moments together. But those cute moments were worth watching and I’m glad that everything ended nicely for everyone in the end.All the music and sounds were really beautiful and they were pleasant to the ears. Even the voice acting (the English dub, which I watched) was really good.I may have a lot of gripes with this anime but I\'m going to admit that despite what I said about the characters, it does have an interesting cast and I\'m glad the anime has quickly moved on from the whole red paper tagging thing to actually churning out a complicated romantic and friendship plot because otherwise, seeing Tsukishi dodging all the kids being sent to mess with her and seeing her just merely insult and banter with Tsukasa would get boring really fast. All in all, would I recommend this anime to everyone? Well if you’re a big shoujo fan and don’t mind watching older animes than yes, I highly recommend this anime to watch. Just be forewarned that there are some uncomfortable moments in this series but otherwise Hana Yori Dango was extremely enjoyable. (which is what the title translates to here in the West). I didn\'t really find myself interested in watching the Japanese Drama or reading the manga, BUT the title, Hana Yori Dango has stayed in the back of my mind much like a few other animes that came out around the same time (Fushigi Yuugi, Ayashi no Ceres, etc).It almost feels like the 90s were the time for the more mature Shoujo and romance animes because when I compare this anime to Marmalade Boy and Fushigi Yuugi, I always find the same common themes (there\'s always a love triangle of sorts, the main female protagonist starts off bickering with the main love interest, and there\'s apparently always something trying to keep the two main characters apart, and it\'s usually from the girl\'s side of the relationship that things get tense due to the girl hesitating on acting on their feelings while the guy risks their lives to win the girl over).Anyways, what is Hana Yori Dango about? It\'s about a poor/lower class girl named Tsukishi, who after defending her friend from the F4, the most popular boys in Eitoku(sp?) Academy, it’s then that a red tagging “game” begins between her and the F4 and of course being tagged with a red card makes all the other students at the school bully Tsukishi.

It transitions smoothly and just at the right pace. There are surprises you wish you had seen coming and moments that make you want to look away from how embarrassing or painful events are, but you keep looking.Art: Personally, I didn't like the animation style they used at first, but after a while you really get used to it.

I don't know, but it was still pretty good.Sound: I saw the series in English, so you know. I think the people who portrayed their voices were great. There was much room for improvement, however. Sometimes the tone of voice changed unnecessarily, and other times the dialogue itself--the words and the way they said them--sounded a bit unnatural. It didn't happen too often, but it did happen quite a few times.Characters: Here they did an outstanding job. They present characters who at first sight seemed flat and simply there to pose a conflict, but before even the third episode you start to see they're so much more than what they first seemed. They transition into actual people. You invest your own emotions into them and sometimes feel torn. You can really sympathize with them, even if none of this has ever happened to you.

First you get what I call the Neo-Shoujo types (e.g. the works of Wataru Yoshizumi, of which you could say the comparable equivalent to Hana Yori Dango would be Marmalade Boy) and then you get what I call feminist-grounded Shoujo types (e.g. Nana). The former portrays an idealised version of love and focusses on romantic relationships and friendships. It\'s about dreams and hopes. The protagonists are perpetually in a state of innocence and carry the viewers in that fantasy. The other genre, by contrast, is more dark and down-to-earth where the protagonists do not believe in fairy-tales anymore (so...to say) and is not in search of an idealised first kiss but rather of the next man to hump! Indeed the feminist-grounded shoujo always attempts to romanticise such illicit sexual intercourses to try to portray it as life realities. Dream and fantasy is not part of this genre which focusses more on the disillusions of life. Some of them should actually be classified as downright Josei - the female equivalent of hentai or Seinen.Hana Yori Dango lies in between these two. On the one end it deals with the realities of life such as peer pressures, school bullying as well as sexual pressures which teenagers face; but concurrently it manages to fit all these within a cinderella-kind of fairy tale plotline with the rich prince and the poor princess kind-of-romance thing. The beauty of this is that it works - it makes us dream, cracking in our shoes, always wanting to see what\'s going to happen next or how things will turn out! So for instance amidst all the sexual pressures and other life depressing realities she has to confront, the heroine managed with a bit of luck to go through it all, remaining true to herself and achieving her dreams the way she wants! Isn\'t shoujo fantastic indeed!?!Hana Yori Dango is one of those must see anime for all connoiseurs of manga/animes.

I\'m going to have some spoilers in the bottom.  You\'ve been warned.I usually don\'t watch ANY pre-00\'s anime.  I hate old art.  Don\'t ask me why, since I\'m a 80\'s baby.I had started this anime a few months ago, didn\'t make it past the first episode, so I put it on my drop list.  I feel kind of bad about that.  I saw it as a suggestion from another anime, Ayashi no Ceres.  So I decided to give it another go after seeing the review about ""restoring faith in the romance genre."" as Ceres kind...of made me want to punch something.  Moving on.The characters seem pretty one dementional when you first watch it.  This is one of those anime\'s that you go back to the first episode after you finish the last, just to see the huge difference between the characters.  So obviously, the character progression is pretty dang good.  The H made me want to punch him in the face for the longest time.  Then the Hh made me want to punch HER for the longest time.  In the spoilers section I\'ll explain why.The romance in this series was kind of.. meh.. at first.  I wound up thinking to myself. ""not this again..."" Then things change.Keep in mind, this is an anime that passed by the manga, so the ending in the anime isn\'t the same as the manga.  There\'s a different story line between to the two. (Think of Fullmetal Alchemist) I actually found the anime ending to be much more palatable than the manga, if that makes some sense.  However, the manga\'s story overall is much better.  I recommend reading it.  There\'s a lot left out of the anime, even going back to episode one.SPOILERS:I was disappointed with the idea of Tsukushi getting with Tsukasa.  I knew that\'s what was coming just from reading the reviews here, and seeing who the Hh spent the most time with.   At first.  After Tsukasa confesses to her (which that\'s one hell of a ride, I must say), Tsukushi annoyed the hell out of me.  The typical twist of having her first crush, Rui, return after his failed affair with whatsherface made me headdesk.  I mean, it LITERALLY came directly after his confession.  I get that there has to be some drama and confusion, but why not let H and Hh\'s relationship develop in some way before he came back? The island arc was painful to watch.

I get that there has to be some drama and confusion, but why not let H and Hh\'s relationship develop in some way before he came back? The island arc was painful to watch.  This is where my desire to punch HER comes from.  She acted like an asshat.  I guess that\'s what makes this anime so good. :D', 'I honestly didn\'t know what to feel once I finished this roller coaster ride. I kinda sat there for a few minutes staring at the screen in a daze.Well I\'ve thought about it. This one is gonna be a long one, fairly fitting due to the fact that this romance drama (emphasis on the word drama) is 51 freaking episodes long.Then let\'s get to it.Story: 8The story, on the outside, seems fairly cliche. A commoner by the name of Makino Tsukushi gets herself into a rich school in an attempt from her family to bag herself a rich guy to bring them out of debt....Makino manages to get in some trouble with the notorious gang of the school, the F4, however she declares war on them as they are unfair and she wants to set them straight. Later on, though, she falls in love with one of their members, Rui Hanazawa.Pretty cliche.The story does take an interesting turn in terms of love interests, though that\'s all I\'ll say.Each arc in the show is also written based off of fairly realistic scenarios, and the bullying was hard to watch at times, knowing that kids can be as cruel as that.The last arc of the show, however, almost made me quit. More on that later.Art: 6Now, I haven\'t watched very many old shows such as this, so I don\'t know how fluid the animation should be or how pretty the art is.However I know enough to know that the animation in the later half of the show is extremely lazy and poor.The art itself is fine, I liked the character designs and the art style.I will NOT let this show get away with that lazy animation though.There are so many reused shots in the show later on, and it is incredibly obvious. There is also little movement and the show seems very cheap at that point. The animation was fine in the beginning half, nothing special though. So what happened?Sound: 5Sound is nothing special, at all. Just like the animation, the tracks in this show are repeated so many times that it becomes a joke at some point. I couldn\'t get invested in some scenes because the same track was being repeated for every other dramatic scene in the show! I would\'ve liked some variety! The voice acting was pretty good, some voices really grated on my ears though, and the characters with those voices showed up fairly often.The opening and ending credits songs are nothing special and I\'m probably not going to remember them. They only change the ending theme and it\'s near the end of the show... So I hope you like the opening theme.Characters: 7Alright this is going to be the longest part of the review.Let\'s start with Makino Tsukushi. Makino is a strong female protagonist that cares deeply for her friends and her family. She takes no attitude from anyone and is willing to fight back in dire situations. She does what she wants and generally unforgiving of ""evildoers"".I liked Makino\'s character.... At least for the first 30ish episodes.I don\'t know why... But for some reason... Her personality takes a COMPLETE 180 from what she used to be. Yes, she is still a strong person. However, she had a REALLY bad habit of running away from all of her problems and consistently getting herself into more trouble doing so. It got... REALLY annoying. Her drastic change nearly made me drop the show.Next up is Tsukasa Domyouji. He is the hot-headed leader of the F4, known around the school for how violent he is. Tsukasa was my favorite character. He goes through the most development and becomes a genuinely sincere and caring person, and he was the sole reason I finished the show in the first place.Rui Hanazawa is boring, cliche, and mostly uninteresting. I mean, he\'d offer some good advice for Makino every now and then, but that\'s it.The last of the F4 is Sojiro and Akira, and while they don\'t get as much development as Makino, Rui or Tsukasa, I found them funny and likeable.There aren\'t really any other characters worth mentioning, most of the cast was outright despicable and Makino\'s friends were pretty likeable.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this anime a lot. I loved the fresh breath of air that it was written more realistically than other romance anime. There were times when I was frustrated due to Makino\'s stupid decisions, but I was content while watching it.However, I will not let this review end without talking about that last arc.The last arc is the most melodramatic, useless arc I think I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. It starts with the introduction of Shigeru. I won\'t spoil anything, but the last arc takes a huge dump on everything I liked about the show, and this is the arc that trashed Makino\'s character for me. There was so much useless drama that could\'ve been solved had Makino just done SOMETHING about it!I\'m not kidding around when I say I have never been more infuriated while watching something before. The show was unwinding itself right before my eyes, and it was a huge mess.I hope you take this warning to heart, it is 13ish episodes of pure torture. It was an absolute chore getting through it.Overall: 7Regardless of the last arc of the show, I enjoyed this anime. I liked the more realistic look on members of different social statuses falling in love and the consequences of that love, and the consequences of one\'s actions. However, this show is heavily drama based. There is little humor/light moments in this show, so I recommend this show for anyone who is a sucker for that stuff.

Prior to this I watchedThe entire series of Marmalade boy and when I saw the animation and synopsis of this anime I was expecting something in the same vein some lovey dovey drama.Well it was…and then some.AnimationI’m not gonna be soft on this, animation was poor but not terrible. With these pre-2000 anime’s the story seems to make up for the poorer animation and for the most part it did....SoundOne of the strongest points for this anime. With these drama anime’s I will avoid the Jap dub and go for the English dub to save time, well the voice actors were excellent as well as an obvious updated dialogue, some of the profanity and general conversations where obviously updated compared to the original dialogue. General music was quite decent as well, funny “Happy Days” opening.StoryThis story is just one big addictive rollercoaster. As I said before when I started watching this I was expecting Marmalade Boy 2, instead I got Marmalade boy meets GTO. Whan it comes down to is a shojo-love anime with bullying, swearing and psychological warfare which was unexpected, Impressive, Annoying and Addictive. I found myself hooked on this love story which was more realistic in most ways and surprisingly unrealistic in others…I mean when it was all over I really didn’t know what to say except “this anime will definitely entertain and frustrate”.CharacterCharacters go hand in hand with the story, they WILL surprise you one way or another but I had to remind myself this is a shojo because being in this girls head all the time (Tsukushi) was really gonna drag this character rating down to a 1. Apart from her the other characters varied from funny to hateable, I will give them credit because these characters are realistic with their personalities but as people they where mostly just bad people…yes just bad people when you watch it you will understand.EnjoymentEnjoyment…for me was high because I was surprised at the direction this story took. I was expecting people going on dates talking about how much they love whoever and whatever.Well instead I got to laugh at people being bullied, scheming, manipulating, hilarious dialogue and lots of girl-fights. Unfortunately there was the expected love triangles and love drenched monologue so that brought the enjoyment down, especially coming towards the end of the series.ValueValue is a very difficult one to call because although I was entertained and enjoyed this anime for the most part it was a little stressful to watch (lol yes stressful). I’m not a shojo guy I just like real-life dramas from time to time and this kinda fits that bill but I do think this anime was a bit confused in itself. Some of the things that happen in this series really can shock and frustrate you but in saying that I can tell this anime is one I won’t soon forget. I guess what I’m saying is I enjoyed it overall, it just left me dazzled a bit which was quite unexpected!Planet Tyro Rating: Solid BPlanettyro.com SoundOne of the strongest points for this anime.

The show is fairly generic and the 2 boys the main character wants are suitor number 1- Forceful and degrading and suitor 2- Kinda a d definitely aloof but he\'s the \'mysterious type\'.I\'m not gonna lie to you. I don\'t know why I\'ve watched as much as I\'ve watched. It\'s got some charm to it, like the main character is consistent with her personality and isn\'t just a perfect sweet angel, but the show...definitely has it\'s problems. There was a lot of sexual assault being down played (thanks japan) and the bullying gets really extreme and you have to wonder, ""WTF are the teachers doing at this school?"" They have moments where you see punching and kicking played for jokes- I\'m not even talking about that when I talk about abuse and bullying. Just, keep in mind if you\'re younger that if you have a partner that acts like either of these 2 guys, you need to leave. It was cute at first to see 2 kids figuring out they had feelings for each other, but watching someone force themselves onto another person, kissing or no, isn\'t ok. And it was really hard to watch.I can\'t recommend it, but I can say PLEASE CHECK OUT THE INTRO it\'s REALLY well done! definitely has it\'s problems.

But if you look past that, you can find where the gold lies.The characters are what make this anime so enjoyable. As a romance anime fan who's seen a good amount of shoujos , I have to say it's hard to find a main character as strong and independent as this one. She doesn't care for what others think about her, and stands up for what she believes. What makes this even better in my personal opinion is the voice actors, to tell you the truth, honestly I loved the...English voice actor for the main character. She sounds like a normal girl, and fits the character perfectly. The other main characters were given a good amount of depth, were likable, but nothing too special that I enjoyed or have to say.The story for this anime felt iffy especially the ending. I'm not saying it was bad, but the ending! It was so out of the blue it reminded me of the ending in dusk maiden of amnesia. The pacing was good, and I'm happy that this show is 50 episodes long.

There are four guys in that school who are feared by everyone; they are the richest and everybody does what they say. If you are hated by one of them you're are hated by the entire school. That's what happens to our heroine. She stands up to one of the four guys, while they were bullying a friend of hers, thus getting on their bad side, and the bad side of the entire school.The art...in this anime was not very pleasing.

That's not all though, she develops a crush on one of the guys. Leading into more humiliation.I believe most of my dislike for the anime is towards Makino's personality. One minute I feel like I've got a good grasp on her character, another she goes off and does something that makes no sense. At the moment I have only watched eight episode and there is still no development to Makino's character. She keeps on making the same mistakes.I am not planing on picking this series up again any time soon. in this anime was not very pleasing. I could not get into the story line.

Makino might be poor but damn if that will get her down!  There are a bunch of bullies at your elite school, you say?  Makino's response to such things is similar to today's 'bring it on.'  This series isn't pure comedy though, it's got plenty of romance and drama to keep it interesting.  This series is best done in a few long sittings instead of short blocks of episodes or 1 DVD at a time.  Seeing what happens...next is very addicting. next is very addicting."", ""Wow, this was a doozy. I watched all 51 episodes that were 25+ minutes in length (plus ads!) in 3 days. So I have a lot to say about this show.The name Hana Yori Dango or Boys Over Flowers might sound familiar. The manga it was based on is one of the most popular—or at least the most adapted—of all time. There’s the anime, a J-drama, a Taiwanese drama, another separate J-drama, a K-drama, a Chinese drama, and an upcoming Thai drama. And I’m still probably missing one. The adaptations never stop! This version wasn’t even the first one that I’ve ever seen. I’ve heard...a lot about the K-Drama and watched a couple episodes of the Chinese drama (it goes by the name Meteor Garden).The basic plot is always as follows: A poor girl is on scholarship to a super fancy, elite school but gets on the bad side of the F4 (or something similarly named)—the four most gorgeous, rich, popular boys at school. She is initially bullied by them, but a couple of them fall in love with her over time.In this version, the main character is named Makino Tsukushi. She falls in love with Hanazawa Rui first because he is the only one of the boys to show her kindness. I say that very loosely. He’s not a knight in shining armor; he does the bare minimum by showing her some human decency. Her biggest tormentor is the richest boy and defacto leader of the group, Domyoji Tsukasa. Domyoji is a total monster, but he eventually falls for Makino and becomes the other main competitor for her heart. The other two guys serve more as lackeys than love interests. There’s nothing between them and Makino. There are some other significant characters that pop in and out of the story, but the primary focus of the plot is on this love triangle and its development over the course of these characters’ time in high school.I’ll be frank, this is one of the most problematic anime I’ve ever seen. There is just no concept of consent. It’s honestly disgusting. If you watch the show you’ll immediately pick up on it. I’m not sure if things were written this way because it’s set in 1990s Japan or because the people committing heinous acts are so privileged that it’s seen as “not a big deal.” Probably a bit of both. Oh, and I do mean heinous. This isn’t one of those sweet “the main character finally gets a kiss in the last episode” shoujo stories. They talk about sex on this show. Like, a lot. And there are multiple attempted rapes. Makino is the victim of countless assaults, both sexual and physical. The amount of bullying she endures is actually insane. The show is supposed to be a rom-com, but I’d liken some of the events that transpire to those found in a horror or psychological show.It definitely grew on me over time though. The length of the show allows you to get to know and become invested in the characters—no matter how horribly they started off. Once the major bullying subsides and we enter the more romance focused section of the show, it becomes much more tolerable. I actually started to ship some people in spite of their stomach churning history. Because of this character development and time investment, I almost rated this show an 8. Then… I reached the ending. I won’t spoil anything, but I was left thoroughly disappointed. We are given a resolution to the love triangle, but it felt rushed and I don’t think some characters' feelings were ever properly confessed. All the buildup was for naught.To end my review on a positive note: The entire show did feel very nineties. It’s definitely interesting to watch now that the nineties are back in style. In this version and in many other adaptations (even though they often change the names), the equivalent of Domyoji’s character is easy to spot because of his naturally curly hair. He also has a very distinctive sense of style. His friends make fun of him for it, but his look would propel him to the height of e-boy popularity today.

Starting with episode 10, I was already attached to the heroine and I wanted to see what will happen next.Now, I said I was invested, so I had to KNOW what was the full story, so I read the FULL manga ( I was so disappointed).

The series starts off with a young girl named Tsukushi who lived with her family that was really poor. Her parents decided for her to study at a high class high school to find a rich hubby so they wouldn\'t have to worry about money problems. Romance wasn\'t easy from the beginning; especially when being caught up in a love polygon!

Tsukushi is just adorable - strong and independent, great sense for justice and has a pure heart and always ready to help the weaker. Tsukasa on the other hand is typical shojo character - rich, handsome and ... cold and spoiled. At the beginning of the series he' s just so scary and cruel, sometimes I felt uncomfortable watching his actions. I thought I would never forgive him for almost raping Tsukushi but as time passed we see him gentle part -loving, kind...and caring. May be I like him so much because he's the opposites - both gentle and harsh, spoiled kid but a strong man whos ready to fight for his love.Other thing I like in this anime - unlike other shojo series , here you can feel sexual tensio n between Tsukasa and Tsukushi. They're more believable coupple.Weak points - graphic but its normal cause it's like so old. I also thought the end was just so quick... It happened so fast I really wanted some more time for  the finale of this otherwise amazing anime. and caring.

Having read and enjoyed the manga, I want to state from the beginning that there may be some bias when reviewing the anime.Story: 9/10The anime is classified as a dream but I didn't expect the level of drama and controversy in the anime. The scenes depicting bullying, betrayal and violence were, for me, difficult to watch as they appeared so similar to what happens in reality. The only thing keeping me from giving the anime a 10/10 for story is the final episode..which I was not a big...fan of. I just thought they could have ended it a little better but it was entertaining no less. I may not have enjoyed the final episode as much simply because the 2nd last episode was, in my opinion, AMAZING. But you'd have to stick the series out all the way to the 50th episode to find out.Art: 4/10It is an old anime so I was not expecting much from the art and animation but I have to say the lack of quality bothered me a lot. My favourite part of the animation was actually the transition sequence between scenes (*with Tsukushi in the bathtub). I prefer those character designs way more than the ones they used. The only times where I could tolerate it was when the characters were highly expressive, specifically with Tsukushi, Tsukasa and Rui.Sound:5/10The sound definitely lended to the emotion in the scenes with violence and anger but overall I found most other times it was way too overdramatic. I did love the theme song though...very catchy :)Character: 8/10I really appreciated the complexity of the characters, especially with Tsukasa. He may be one of the most interesting anime characters I have seen to date, just because of how unpredictable his actions and mood are. The other main characters are pretty well developed, with the exception of Akira and Sojiro which I believe could have benefited from more developing and background. When you're supposed to like a character you love them, but when you're supposed to hate them you really DESPISE them...they did a great job but man it scares me how many bad people attended Etioku Academy lolEnjoyment: 9/10Despite my complaints about the art and sound, really those are things that you can adjust to while watching the anime.

When I first watched it, I got through 13 episodes, but quickly got bored by the lack of movement between the main characters, Makino and Domyoji. When I picked the show back up again, I had a bit of a slow time getting back into it, but managed to finish it in just over a week. I have a lot of feelings about this show. Despite the slowness, and the devastating normalization of problematic relationship dynamics, this show was still pretty enjoyable. Do I think it should be 51 freaking episodes?...Hell no. A lot of this show is recaps from the same episode or the previous episodes, which gets really obnoxious when you’re trying to binge and haven’t forgotten anything from the previous 10 minutes. Tsukushi Makino’s obsession with Rui Hanazawa is incredibly boring, considering the fact that Rui doesn’t have a personality until the last ~15 episodes. In those last episodes, Rui really becomes a good friend to Makino, and you really are happy for him. Seeing him get a happy ending was really rewarding as a viewer. Domyoji’s mother is just one of the meanest characters I’ve seen in anime. I definitely think the manga of this show would actually be decent, considering all of the storylines are spread out from high school into college and I believe even after college?

"Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman.",https://myanimelist.net/anime/50425/Fuufu_Ijou_Koibito_Miman,"['The synopsis of ""More than a married couple, but not lovers"" suggests that this show probably won\'t be anything deep, but rather light, enjoyable, relaxing rom-com. For real - how can so ridiculous concepts like ""marriage practical"" be treated seriously? This premise, however, seems to be pretty original, comparing it to other similar shows. The closest matches are probably Nisekoi and Koi to Uso (forced marriage/pairing), but none of these shows treated this theme in this type of way.[Story - 7]I appreciate the original take when it comes to marriage practical theme. Even if it seems funny, or even stupid in the synopsis, it works...pretty well in the show at the end. It allows the anime to take the path, many rom-com viewers are seeking - ""enemies to lovers"". The show isn\'t boring at all, even after a few episodes, which is pretty common for this type of anime. Each episode consists of something either funny or exciting for the viewer. It\'s really enjoyable. As far as I like the whole concept of the show, I also dislike it at the same level. This approach to the story makes the relationship between characters a bit meaningless and forced. Let\'s be real - Jirou and Akari pairing is pretty exotic, and most likely would have really low chances, without this forced pairing. I much more like the shows, where the relationship goes naturally. There are also a lot of lewd scenes, and in some moments, the show looks like Ecchi. There are also unbearable for me, ambiguous scenes, between Shiori and Jirou. These are not only cringe-worthy but also really tiring to watch - especially when it is repeatable (holidays - beach and restaurant scenes). The chemistry between many characters is weird and forced at times. That seems to be a positive thing in some ways, to show the character development in later episodes.[Art - 7]The colours in the show are vivid, bright, and really saturated, making the atmosphere nicer, and the show more interesting. Most of the time colours are matched correctly, and the art looks really good. In some scenes, the hue is really aggressive, and it may appear oversaturated, which causes the opposite effect from the planned.[Sound - 8]Not much to mention there. Music doesn\'t play a major role in this show. The opening is just okay. Ending on the other hand is a masterpiece. I loved it from the first time I heard it![Characters - 6]The characters are really generic. The first episode and the viewer can already think ""I saw that somewhere already"". And obviously, those characters are widely copied in many anime, but the first suggestion that comes to head? Nisekoi. The main character is madly in love with his childhood friend. He starts to spend much more time with the main heroine, that is totally not his type. As they know each other better, it seems they are clicking quite well. MC starts to realize his feelings for the main heroine. Nothing new. MC is surprisingly not bad, and in some ways likable. It\'s still far from the really good male MCs, but I didn\'t feel the cringe, by looking at his actions. It\'s a good exception from the usual boring, useless rom-com MC. Side characters? Zero development, zero significance to the story. Basically, everyone besides Akari, Shiori, and Jirou ""is just there"" and that\'s it. Their personality is almost non-existent. The only side character viewers are about to know a bit better is Tenjin, and it\'s still really a surface knowledge level (and maybe that is better?)[Enjoyment - 9]I won\'t lie, this show is one of those I really enjoyed while watching it.

Is it a dumpster fire, or something that absolutely is worth its name upon that symbolizes something else?In AniManga, we have seen our fair share of trash, or even dumpster fire shows over the years promising something different but with the outcome already written on the wall, and Jim George\'s quote of ""It’s not how you start that’s important, but how you finish!"" rings true for all works. This is especially important for works that people have waited eons to get an anime adaptation, and for me, that show is mangaka Yuuki Kanamari\'s Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman. a.k.a More Than a Married...Couple, But Not Lovers.Rom-coms are gotten quite stale over time with the advent of works that pave the way for influences, say in the late 2000s and early 2010s with shows like Toradora! and Nisekoi that are still beloved classics to this day. It\'s only in recent years with shows like Koi to Uso a.k.a Love and Lies, Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend and the most recent Kakkou no Iinazuke a.k.a A Couple of Cuckoos that truly draw the line for rom-coms inventing something new, but ultimately falling short at the finish line of their wayward cycle of messy love triangles (or rectangles even) predicting what the seasoned Average Joe has already spelled out the disasters with many theories as possible to predict how this ""illogical"" drama would end. And this show, based on the manga of the same name, is no exception to this rule.Notice that I DID say that the finish line is just as important as how things start, and this show for one, ups the ante on the one show that has already proven itself to be a failure, just like the manga it was based on: Koi to Uso. But unless you\'re a seasoned AniManga veteran, you would have no idea what Koi to Uso\'s setting is like, and I forgive you since the anime aired 5 years ago, with the manga only reaching its conclusion at the start of the year. The former\'s story plot featuring a futuristic Japan where low birthrates are a serious liability for the nation, so much so that the government introduces a system to encourage successful marriages by pairing adolescent high school students according to whoever they are assigned to, and serious repercussions await those who defy the arrangement. This is the case for the male MC having an infatuation on his classmate and long-time crush, who knew that getting her would take a leap of encouragement and boldness, even against the girl that he\'s assigned to being interested in his illicit romance. And you can take what Koi to Uso offered and plaster it into this series, only beating it in the sense that it\'s a school-required curriculum to pass before graduation, a perchance at the make-believe married life that similar to said former series, and the pairs are chosen at random.In fact, I would go as far as to say that the mangaka took most of the inspiration from the series, and elevates it in his/her way so much that it actually blends a lot of what makes the rom-com genre great to begin with: Toradora!\'s way of the main oddball couple helping each other attain their crushes and Nisekoi\'s insistence that as much as the male side of the second couple is a supporting character, but being that of the main character being spineless. This is true for Jiro Yakuin, who is almost in the same vein as Nisekoi\'s Raku Ichijo and Koi to Uso\'s Yukari Nejima, being all that innocent in front of the girl he likes and has a crush on her for the longest time: the shy and kind-hearted Shiori Sakurazaka. But being the awkward introvert with self-esteem issues (that akin to a certain Hitori ""Bocchi"" Gotoh), he doesn\'t feel confident in making sure that his attempts to reach Shiori will ever plan out. This is where the gyaru Akari Watanabe comes in: being assigned to Jiro instead of her crush that is the popular school idol Minami Tenjin, both have a hatred for one another but have the same objective: like Toradora!\'s Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, help each other to be assigned to the crush of their dreams by way of the tactics bringing the antics, which in this case, is the earn enough points to switch their partners.The irony? Having a mismatch like this requires you and your partner to get intimate with each other and barring the hope that the other person does the same to his/her partner that the same plan would be achieved, this is much easier said than done. Both Akari and Jiro putting their differences aside, may have for better or worse, deepened their relationship with one another, turning their hatred into love and causing confusion on conflicting feelings of whether those exact feelings are true or not. It\'s a given that the OTP a.k.a One-True Pairing exists for a reason, and as much as people ship the expected Jiro X Shiori and Akari X Minami, love can be blind-sided in the favour if one person curries feelings for the other, and thus says so for the ongoing source material that ever so tries to pair the ""match made in heaven"" couple that it really questions people from time to time if the person they are going for, IS the one that they really want to spend their life with. And that is some messy business to be dealt with when all is said and done.Jiro\'s VA Seiichiro Yamashita does a knockout job trying to replicate Jiro\'s image from the manga, and his character being Kage no Jitsuryokusha a.k.a Eminence in Shadow\'s gigachad Cid Kagenou, I expect nothing less from his standout performance being just the awkward person in the room and acting innocently boisterous on just about anything that ticks him, such as the case with Akari\'s VA Saori Oonishi. In fact, having Saori Oonishi be Akari does give her character more weight and significance in this crossing web of emotions as she tries to help the secluded Jiro stand out a bit more and be brave about his emotions, while simultaneously not forgetting that she has to target Minami as well, with the support of her best friends Sachi Takamiya and Natsumi Ohashi. The one surprise that I wasn\'t expecting to have Seiyuu Saki Miyashita play as Shiori, and after playing main characters for shows since 2018, she found her stride with Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru. a.k.a The Detective Is Already Dead\'s Siestal, coming back for one full force as the pretty and lovable Shiori, the waifu character bait strikes two-for-two. And of course, how could I forget Minami Tenjin, and VA Toshiki Masuda really captured the sense that he is the school\'s flower boy, the handsome dude that all girls want to date him.For the relatively new studio that is studio MOTHER, it has been quite the wild ride with the studio\'s record only being in production assistance for Arifureta when Asread. was just killing the original source material\'s adaptation, but thankfully it wasn\'t the case here. With manageable pacing that I\'d say is not too fast in hiding those story elements while providing a touch of glimpse with its almost overdone colour palette, the production values look great, even if director Junichi Yamamoto doesn\'t have much under his resume biography of works which range from the weird to the unkempt. For a standalone effort, this was pretty much what I was hoping for in the manga receiving a good adaptation, and yes, for sure it was, with a lil\'bit of omission from the manga as few as possible. I just love the colours presented here, it is a nice contrast and gives the bright ""pop"" that adds so much personality to the show, and it was a heck of a job well done.The OST, simply wonderful, and I wouldn\'t have it any other way. Liyuu\'s OP is good, but Nowlu\'s ED is even better. What a dazzling of magical pumps and beats, this is some incredible song composition that has a chill vibe to elevate the setting of the anime. Definitely one of the best EDs of the season and the year overall.It comes as no surprise that the anime adaptation has respected the manga considerably, and I am more than elated that it turned out just as great as the source material was in its beginning stages. Would love a Season 2 to this, but as mentioned in the beginning, it comes with the caveat of the manga faltering just the same as any other rom-com story with ""un""-necessary padding. Still though, what we got was really just spectacular, and as a manga reader, I can finally take this off my bucket list of hopeful adaptations.A great job well done, even if it\'s redeemable trash, folks. Couple, But Not Lovers.Rom-coms are gotten quite stale over time with the advent of works that pave the way for influences, say in the late 2000s and early 2010s with shows like Toradora! and Nisekoi that are still beloved classics to this day. It\'s only in recent years with shows like Koi to Uso a.k.a Love and Lies, Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend and the most recent Kakkou no Iinazuke a.k.a A Couple of Cuckoos that truly draw the line for rom-coms inventing something new, but ultimately falling short at the finish line of their wayward cycle of messy love triangles (or rectangles even) predicting what the seasoned Average Joe has already spelled out the disasters with many theories as possible to predict how this ""illogical"" drama would end. And this show, based on the manga of the same name, is no exception to this rule.Notice that I DID say that the finish line is just as important as how things start, and this show for one, ups the ante on the one show that has already proven itself to be a failure, just like the manga it was based on: Koi to Uso. But unless you\'re a seasoned AniManga veteran, you would have no idea what Koi to Uso\'s setting is like, and I forgive you since the anime aired 5 years ago, with the manga only reaching its conclusion at the start of the year. The former\'s story plot featuring a futuristic Japan where low birthrates are a serious liability for the nation, so much so that the government introduces a system to encourage successful marriages by pairing adolescent high school students according to whoever they are assigned to, and serious repercussions await those who defy the arrangement. This is the case for the male MC having an infatuation on his classmate and long-time crush, who knew that getting her would take a leap of encouragement and boldness, even against the girl that he\'s assigned to being interested in his illicit romance. And you can take what Koi to Uso offered and plaster it into this series, only beating it in the sense that it\'s a school-required curriculum to pass before graduation, a perchance at the make-believe married life that similar to said former series, and the pairs are chosen at random.In fact, I would go as far as to say that the mangaka took most of the inspiration from the series, and elevates it in his/her way so much that it actually blends a lot of what makes the rom-com genre great to begin with: Toradora!\'s way of the main oddball couple helping each other attain their crushes and Nisekoi\'s insistence that as much as the male side of the second couple is a supporting character, but being that of the main character being spineless. This is true for Jiro Yakuin, who is almost in the same vein as Nisekoi\'s Raku Ichijo and Koi to Uso\'s Yukari Nejima, being all that innocent in front of the girl he likes and has a crush on her for the longest time: the shy and kind-hearted Shiori Sakurazaka. But being the awkward introvert with self-esteem issues (that akin to a certain Hitori ""Bocchi"" Gotoh), he doesn\'t feel confident in making sure that his attempts to reach Shiori will ever plan out. This is where the gyaru Akari Watanabe comes in: being assigned to Jiro instead of her crush that is the popular school idol Minami Tenjin, both have a hatred for one another but have the same objective: like Toradora!\'s Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, help each other to be assigned to the crush of their dreams by way of the tactics bringing the antics, which in this case, is the earn enough points to switch their partners.The irony? Having a mismatch like this requires you and your partner to get intimate with each other and barring the hope that the other person does the same to his/her partner that the same plan would be achieved, this is much easier said than done. Both Akari and Jiro putting their differences aside, may have for better or worse, deepened their relationship with one another, turning their hatred into love and causing confusion on conflicting feelings of whether those exact feelings are true or not. It\'s a given that the OTP a.k.a One-True Pairing exists for a reason, and as much as people ship the expected Jiro X Shiori and Akari X Minami, love can be blind-sided in the favour if one person curries feelings for the other, and thus says so for the ongoing source material that ever so tries to pair the ""match made in heaven"" couple that it really questions people from time to time if the person they are going for, IS the one that they really want to spend their life with. And that is some messy business to be dealt with when all is said and done.Jiro\'s VA Seiichiro Yamashita does a knockout job trying to replicate Jiro\'s image from the manga, and his character being Kage no Jitsuryokusha a.k.a Eminence in Shadow\'s gigachad Cid Kagenou, I expect nothing less from his standout performance being just the awkward person in the room and acting innocently boisterous on just about anything that ticks him, such as the case with Akari\'s VA Saori Oonishi.

This show is, and will only ever be, a constant string of 'romantic' moments without any foundation, nor any chemistry between the characters. There is no point.The main character is pathetic and spineless. It's hard to properly quantify just how frustrating it is watching him babble and whine and allow himself to be verbally abused and physically dominated (the main girl forcefully grabs his shirt a couple times in the first episode and he just takes it)....Bafflingly, the abuse quickly lessens, but it isn't because he establishes boundaries. The story needs to move on to the next phase, after all! There's no time to have organic relationship growth from a frigid one into something more stable! Nobody wants to see that! They want to see love triangles that never go anywhere!And by the way, on the topic of relationship growth, our protagonist likes one girl because they were childhood friends - understandable - but then he starts liking the main girl too for no reason and flip flops between them. The script says that he is conflicted between two perfect girls, so now he is. He is physically close to the main girl sometimes, therefore it only makes sense that he would fall in love with her instantly. Who cares that they share no common interests, habits, or values. They were embarrassed that they were sitting next to each other and then they blushed! WOW!The writing is just so transparent and on the nose. Every interaction our protagonist has with a girl makes him blush and wobble at the knees. Nothing romantic is happening onscreen, yet he reacts like there is. The show has to make every moment romantic even when it's not. Take out the blushes and the music and it's like a sitcom without the laugh track - you realize how awkward and out of the blue the interactions really are, and realize there's no actual reason for the characters to say or do the things they do. It's summarized as the following: The protagonist is paired off with a girl he has a general dislike for, then overnight and without any concrete reason, he starts acting weird like he has a crush on her and gets jealous that she likes someone else. There's a disconnect, as I said previously, of effects without cause - the correct beats, the correct payoffs, but without the buildup to justify them and give them meaning.The main girl leaves a VERY bad first impression as verbally abusive, rude, arrogant, vain, and physically aggressive. It's strange though because by only Episode 2 she's mellowed out considerably. There's a major whiplash to her character where she starts overly nasty then instantly just becomes a typical tsundere. After all, we need to get her into love triangles as quickly as possible! We can save time by just skipping her character development entirely! Any normal romance show wouldn't have her act like that until maybe Episode 5, after having time to get used to her situation and come to terms with the main guy. It would only be after a series of increasingly relaxed interactions that she'd realize she was feeling differently around him and try being flirty or jealous. But that sounds like a lot of not-love-triangles happening. Can't have that!Still though, despite suddenly becoming tolerable, the bad first impression the main girl gave off sticks in my mind, and when she's being kind and acting cute I'm reflexively disgusted. Beyond that change she shows no character growth, continually stuck between liking one boy because he's handsome, cool, smart, and athletic, and liking the main guy for no apparent reason other than because they're in close proximity and breathing each other's pheromones. Speaking of which...The premise is absurd but I initially gave it a pass because it's the setup for a romcom and a unique situation to put our characters through. Every second that went by though I became increasingly distressed and annoyed by it. This fake marriage apparently goes beyond simply learning to cooperate with other people you may not know or actually like - like a teambuilding exercise - but full-on is forcing highschoolers into an intimate relationship with a virtual stranger under the threat of academic failure, all while having no privacy because they're being watched by cameras. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to weird stuff in anime but this crosses a very creepy line. I do however believe a better execution was possible and would eliminate the creepy fetish factor.Don't waste your time watching this. The colours are pretty though.

I have read all the source material and was keen to see it get an adaptation.I want this to be clear, the source material is lovely, if you enjoy the genre. It\'s not for everyone but that mild tsundere secondary love interest take, is the cake for some. If you DID actually enjoy the show, please take a second and go read the source material, at this time it is only 52 chapters, you can read it in 2-4 hours.Now I have A LOT of issues with this adaptation, take everything with a...grain of salt, as some are caused from me being saddened by the actually interesting story being butchered by a company trying to make a quick buck.I\'ll try to lay it out as chronological as possible, Studio MOTHER is a new studio that has only produced 2 Series, one being this adaptation. The other being about everyone\'s favorite ""Arifureta\'s"" Season 2, OVA\'s + Movie. This show not only was awful because of the writing, but they managed to butcher it further with constant CG animation anytime something moved faster than someone shaking hands.But this review isn\'t about another series being awful, its about this shows issues, which is why I had to reference their previous mishaps.-Animation-At this time I\'ve watched the first 4 episodes of Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman, and just Episode 1, I was trying to figure out if maybe I was having issues with my eyes, or maybe the director had too many magic mushrooms on the confirmation set.The color pallet for this show is so loud AND bland at the same time its wild. They chose loud conflicting colors as the primary, then followed it up with conflicting colors in the backdrop that don\'t match and cause a really bad pull in and out of immersion that made me feel like the show went on for way longer than it did, at the halfway point, i thought they were doing the normalized ending cliff hanger.Mix this with the fact you can run the show in 1080p and 480p and it looks exactly the same, really worries me overall.Following this aspect, who cranked the contrast to 11? Like the color taste was already bad but everything looks like I\'m watching it through a flashlight.My review isn\'t going to include much about the story because well, as I said, I love the source material, that\'s the not the issue I have with watching this, if I needed to complain about the story, it would be the pacing is way too fast, and this is the same as its written in the source, its just doesn\'t seem to come across as-well, I don\'t know if that\'s bad choreography or just it translated bad on screen but, it just didn\'t give remotely the same taste.Will I keep watching it? For sure, I love this series, its really enjoyable and has its ups and downs for its specific genre. Do I think it will get a S2, highly doubt it based off the studios output, if they\'re lucky the story will carry it.Manga 7/10Anime 4/10-Red grain of salt, as some are caused from me being saddened by the actually interesting story being butchered by a company trying to make a quick buck.I\'ll try to lay it out as chronological as possible, Studio MOTHER is a new studio that has only produced 2 Series, one being this adaptation.

But at the same time the love interests...keep on ""cheating"" on their partner because they really just want to be with a different person then that they are assigned with, but even that is a lie, because they can\'t go through with it, they just want to be with Jirou.The Story plays out it 1 of 4 ways each episode,First Type: MC falls in love with Childhood friend and wants to be with Shiori.Second Type: MC falls in love with the set up ""Marriage"" and wants Akari to show sympathy.Third Type: MC gets in between the love interest and their ""Marriage"" for either his or for childhood friend.Fourth Type: MC gets embarrassed somehow and is interrupted mid romantic event.Basically somewhat like ""Rent A Girlfriend"" but better by far, without an incompetent MC, excessive heroines (Only 2), but it still is really slow and boring for the most part, not exactly distinctly captivating by any means.7/10, The ending for the show though is really good and really makes the ""mid"" tier rest of the show worth it.If you like my review don\'t be a stranger and give it a reaction/helpful! keep on ""cheating"" on their partner because they really just want to be with a different person then that they are assigned with, but even that is a lie, because they can\'t go through with it, they just want to be with Jirou.The Story plays out it 1 of 4 ways each episode,First Type: MC falls in love with Childhood friend and wants to be with Shiori.Second Type: MC falls in love with the set up ""Marriage"" and wants Akari to show sympathy.Third Type: MC gets in between the love interest and their ""Marriage"" for either his or for childhood friend.Fourth Type: MC gets embarrassed somehow and is interrupted mid romantic event.Basically somewhat like ""Rent A Girlfriend"" but better by far, without an incompetent MC, excessive heroines (Only 2), but it still is really slow and boring for the most part, not exactly distinctly captivating by any means.7/10, The ending for the show though is really good and really makes the ""mid"" tier rest of the show worth it.If you like my review don\'t be a stranger and give it a reaction/helpful!', 'While some may argue that Fuukoi is a Nisekoi rip off and another blue balling romcom, I wholeheartedly disagree. Not only was it one of my favourite shows of 2022, but it’s also one of my all time favourite rom-com stories.Fuukoi does have some similarities with previous romcoms like Nisekoi with the whole fake relationship gradually turning to real feelings set up, but ultimately it sets itself apart with how it handles the characters which is my biggest complaint with most gag romances. The show is pretty transparent. What you see is what you get. My main issue with these types of shows tends...to be an indecisive MC who doesn’t know who or what he wants and goes back and forth all the time. The MC in this show is open from the jump about who he wants and using the couples exam as a means of doing that, as is the main female character. While you do have a lot of common rom-com tropes in the show, I think they’re presented in an enjoyable fashion and don’t take away from the drama of the story. If anything, I think the anime has similarities with Kisekoi from earlier in the year and if you enjoyed that type of dynamic between a male and female MC you’ll enjoy this.The couples exam itself is a pretty unique idea in anime and the situations it forces the characters into are hilarious. I enjoyed seeing the MC and Akari, the main female protag grow closer and slowly realise their feelings. If I had one complaint, though. It would be the “love triangle” in the show. It’s a pretty one sided situation from like episode 4 onwards and there’s no real tension or drama because you basically already know what way the MC is gonna go. I would have liked to have seen more drama with that throughout the season. We did get a little bit more in the last couple episodes, but it felt more like a token effort than anything. If anything, there’s more drama on the female side of things with Akari chasing the guy she originally liked. I will say though, this is one of the few romcoms where I actually prefer the main girl over the childhood friend/side girl so that is a testament to how well written Akari is and how good the relationship she cultivates with the MC is.The anime does have a ton of fan service which can be hit or miss for some people, for me fan service is always a plus and I absolutely loved how ecchi the show gets. The director/staff know their target audience and how to appeal to us and I appreciate that. The weekly lewd scenarios were really awesome and I’m gonna miss them.Character designs and art are top tier for me. Akari has one of the most attractive designs I have ever seen in anime. The colour palette is gorgeous to me. It’s a very bright and punchy looking show, but I think it turned out very well. It’s a unique art style that we don’t see often.What makes me rate the anime so highly all time is that Akari and Jirou’s relationship is just genuinely fun to me. I love how despite coming from such different backgrounds they are able to find common ground, build a real bond and open up to each other. You combine that with fan service, gorgeous art and some drama and you’ve got something really special on your hands. Is this show for everyone? No. If you’re coming into this expecting Fruits Basket style writing you’ll be disappointed. This is a rom-com ass rom-com and I mean that in the most sincere way possible. It exemplifies what you’d expect from this type of show and makes for a great watch and I love it.Fuukoi gets 10 out of 10. to be an indecisive MC who doesn’t know who or what he wants and goes back and forth all the time. The MC in this show is open from the jump about who he wants and using the couples exam as a means of doing that, as is the main female character. While you do have a lot of common rom-com tropes in the show, I think they’re presented in an enjoyable fashion and don’t take away from the drama of the story. If anything, I think the anime has similarities with Kisekoi from earlier in the year and if you enjoyed that type of dynamic between a male and female MC you’ll enjoy this.The couples exam itself is a pretty unique idea in anime and the situations it forces the characters into are hilarious. I enjoyed seeing the MC and Akari, the main female protag grow closer and slowly realise their feelings. If I had one complaint, though. It would be the “love triangle” in the show. It’s a pretty one sided situation from like episode 4 onwards and there’s no real tension or drama because you basically already know what way the MC is gonna go.

People mainly criticize this show for being cliche and predictable and that's okay. People like me like to wind down and have a relaxing show from time to time and the show isn't too bad it's the normal love triangle that sometimes gives you fan service that isn't as over the top that the show just becomes fan service fluff. overall if you just...want to watch a regular teen romance full of cliches and not think too much about the story then this might be your best pick this season. want to watch a regular teen romance full of cliches and not think too much about the story then this might be your best pick this season."", 'I can understand the ""Not Recommended"" or ""Mixed Feelings"" assessment that many people give it because of the unending cliche, fan service and somewhat milk toast personality of Yakuin, but despite the negatives, its my second favorite anime of the season (behind Chainsaw Man) because its a fun story, and the colors and artwork are superb.  It reminds me somewhat of Nisekoi which also ended up with a similar MAL rating of mid-7s.Another nice thing I like about this anime is that each episode pretty much stands on its own - I am so tired of anime that drag out a particular topic across...3+ episodes. 3+ episodes.', ""“It gets better”Such a phrase is commonly reserved for multi-season (sometimes action) comedies which take a few episodes or most of a season to experiment before hitting their stride, as well as long-running shounens which tend to explode at a certain arc. That being said, it’s also often used for shows that leave a mediocre or abysmal first impression before allegedly picking up in quality according to a consensus. Chivalry of a Failed Knight, Gundam ZZ, and Symphogear are somewhat popular examples. Whether or not such an argument is convincing or even true is obviously down to preference and case by case basis, but personally,...Fuufu Ijou is a rare example of this actually being applicable.There are two tremendous barriers to entry with this series which rear their heads immediately. Firstly, the backdrop is by far the most questionable element of the series. The series is predicated on a marriage practical, a course where everyone in high school is assigned a partner of the opposite sex to live with in a dorm. Cameras survey their every move, they earn and lose points based on how well they gel with each other as a couple, and the top 10 couples are encouraged to “divorce” so that they can be paired up. Also, this is a mandatory, graded course. The logistical, ethical, and consistency-based issues with this entire idea are numerous. It’s an albatross around the series’ neck, a shadow that underscores just about every single interaction in the show. No matter how cute the romance is, no matter how much character chemistry the main couple and supporting cast all have, you have to really get past and ignore said backdrop for it to not have a dramatic effect on your enjoyment.Even if you can put up with all that and not be immediately driven away from the series, the first episode has other issues beyond introducing the broken marriage practical concept. The pacing and editing are rather rough and abrupt, only ceasing to be an issue around episode 3 or 4, barring the occasional abrupt end to some episodes throughout. Both are virginal gamer dweeb MC (Jirou) and our brash, confrontational gyaru MC (Akari) are a bit difficult to put up with at first, especially together. The typical tropes one would expect like an even more bitterly virginal 4th wall breaker best friend and the typical childhood friend with a crush on the MC are all unflatteringly tossed in, the former of which starts off incredibly annoying. There really is a lot going against the show from the start.In spite of everything, Fuufu Ijou quickly manages to wind up as a cute wish fulfillment romcom with a surprising amount of fun and skill. Jirou and Akari quickly develop a fun chemistry together as the show transitions from the more cliche conflicts to surprisingly touchy and insecurity-driven ones even as early as episode 4. Jirou doesn’t expect anyone to love some horny teen loser like him who would just bring a popular girl like Akari down, while Akari feels over reliant on others and her self-esteem is absurdly fragile.  Their insecurities and unwillingness to reconcile with their budding feelings for each other vs their feelings for their crushes are mostly nice to see, even if there are a few hijinks that probably go a bit too far and could use some rearranging. Even the annoying meta humor provided by best friend Kamo has its fun moments, with uproarious and dedicated references to Duel Monsters, and the fact that his fucking name hasn’t been properly introduced even 4 episodes in. There’s always a wrinkle to the usual or annoying ideas past episode 1 to help cushion the blow or surprise the viewer as things quickly tighten up and become more interesting. The second half has this in spades, especially as the admittedly gaudy vocalizing of what they expect from teenage boys and girls to typically feel and do further informs their insecurities. It does make it all the more frustrating just how close to saying how their insecurities and current issues are a product of their developing feelings for each other, but there are some engaging payoffs to everything by the end, even though it’s only adapting a fraction of the material.The show isn’t immune from the aforementioned pains. While Jirou’s self-deprecating virgin monologues become more bearable, they’re still a little too frequent. Furthermore, the level of monologuing in this show is still annoying, and while it is refreshing when things go a little faster or differently than expected, there’s still some anxiety present given how the show does sometimes just go for the annoying idea flat out. The show is also too overbearingly blunt, thanks in no small part to the misunderstandings and an unceasing swarm of monologues, even if the resolutions and progression can sometimes be worth it. Part of why might be the exploration of both Jirou and Akari's personal insecurities, which drives practically every action and interaction of theirs. Plus, as bad as the backdrop is, it adds a sense of both inevitability and uncertainty to their destination, regardless of who they end up with, should they be with anyone at all by the time they swap partners. Of course, as this anime adapts what is projected to be about ⅓ of the manga, only so much progress can be made, but the partial journey is more engaging than expected.Another reason the show goes down smoother than expected is how the visuals help the material along. As bright as it is, the light pastel color pallet really does suit the show, and given how the backgrounds have the same aesthetic sensibilities as the character artwork, everything just compliments each other. It’s not like, say, Arifureta (the 2nd season of which Studio MOTHER helped out with before the release of this show) where absurdly bright character colors are contrasted with regular greens and browns to make the eye-searing colors stick out far too much. Fuufu Ijou actually has a uniform aesthetic, and a distinct one at that. There are also some neat visual gags and edits that punctuate some of the comedy, especially with the Final Fantasy and Duel Monsters references. The first scene of episode 1 certainly has dodgy CGI, but the show doesn’t employ that much past that, even with the buildings and interiors. Given how most modern anime look, that fact was absolutely refreshing. Additionally, outside of episodes 9-11 which make up one singular arc and defined timeframe, every episode sees Akari with a new, distinct set of nails. The show definitely has its wonky and flat artwork moments, the editing can be a little rough, and there are scenes that could stand to have a little bit more actual animation in them. Even still, for a modest production, there’s certainly some real charm given to the look of the show and its fun little details and intricacies. While director Junichi Yamamoto had only directed small music videos, OVAs, and smaller scale ONAs/ONA series, he and director Takao Kato did a generally solid job.That being said, the music was honestly the least engaging part. There are a few decently evocative and dramatic tracks, but otherwise, Yuri Habuka’s OST kind of just exists. It does what it needs to do, occasionally does it well enough to slightly stand out, and leaves as if it was never there in the first place. The super cutesy Liyuu OP “TRUE FOOL LOVE” isn’t personally appealing either, and the main ED, “Stuck on you” by Nowlu is a decent smooth nocturnal pop song, it’s her ep 12 ED, “Shallow” that sticks out as a particularly pleasant song. There isn’t a whole lot else to say about the show’s music, unfortunately. It’s competent, but there’s little in the way of anything memorable.In spite of everything going against it, Fuufu Ijou is a decent and likable wish-fulfillment romcom It’s frustrating that the backdrop and incessant monologuing hold it back because this show is almost legitimately good. It may be tropey as hell, but when it’s executed with just enough finesse and with enough surprises and moments of character exploration, is that really so much of a bad thing? The fanservice may be both too constant yet too tame for the most part as well, but rarely is it particularly distracting given it’s done within the headspace of the male MC. While it’s marketed as a seinen, it’s not a bad romance for teenagers to be introduced to and even slightly challenged by regarding certain kinds of social expectations they place upon each other. Still, if you’re even remotely well-versed in romcoms and love triangle stories, and your standards for them are a bit stringent, this is a show you can take or leave. If you’re craving for more, you might find something worth your while, provided you can get past some of its awkward rough edges. It probably won’t be anyone’s anime of the year or anything, but it’s a little nicer and more interesting than one might expect.

Well ngl i was wrong, this isnt mature. Sometimes it\'s borderline ecchi but it\'s not really different from a shounen slice of life.It\'s been a while now i review those romance animes/mangas and it becomes increasingly boring and hard to find inspiration while writing because it\'s just a taste of deja vu for me. Like a feeling that everything i write for 75% of those animes could be switched with other animes...and so on. It\'s always the same flaws, the same stories, the same characters...Nevertheless, i\'ll do it. Well let\'s start with the characters. The MC is bland, generic indeed it\'s your basic SOL romance MC with a bland look, a bland personality, the same shy thick headed boy we get in all those animes. Nothing to see, nothing to say because ""nothing"" is the best existing word that refers to this army of MC clones that mangakas created.Akari (pink haired girl) is portayed as a pretty yes-life girl who aspires to go out with the handsome boy of the high school. She starts the anime being a selfish unbearable spoiled brat who openly mocks the MC then in just 15 minutes she becomes a girl who flirts with him without accepting it. Like often in those animes, we discover that she\'s more than a selfish girl and it turns out that she\'s kind, sweet, funny and maybe nymphomaniac seeing how she behaves with a boy who isnt even her crush. But I guess i shouldnt be saying that though. All in all, she\'s just weird and should be avoided at all costs for any normal boy out there. In my opinion, this character doesnt make any sense at all. I mean obviously girls in those animes dont make any sense aswell but at least their behaviour is understandable. Here, she\'s portayed as a virgin kind girl without any experience but sometimes she just straight up behaves like a prostitute you know. I dont want to spoil anything but some scenes are borderline sluts. Her behaviour is strictly made for fanservice, she\'s kind and virgin but she\'ll behave like a drunk girl with a boy she met in a club even though she\'s been knowing the MC for 3 days. I mean, how would she be a virgin if she behaves like that it doesnt make any sense. Either you do a full virgin cliche girl either you embrace the fact this is a seinen and you show a more realistic girl with experience but a mix of both is a no go.Shiori (MC\'s childhood friend) is the shy girl who doesnt like to stand out. She\'s been in love with the MC since 1942 (well that\'s false but you guessed it, it\'s been since they\'re kids) but because of her shyness and her lack of luck, she has never been able to convey her feelings to an extent the MC believes she is deeply friendzoning him. Let\'s not lose our time, she\'ll probably end up alone being regretful about how her stupidity made her lose the heart of a simp that has been following her in hope of love since they\'re kids aswell.Truth is that we see a girl like that in 80% of those animes, it\'s getting boring but they continue to provide us with those top notch girls that end up heart-broken.That is exactly why this anime is random and doesnt deserve (for me) more than a generous 6/10. Random MC, weird irrational girl, a cliche childhood friend that will eventually end up like every others... Well that\'s not appealing.But maybe there\'s a chance the story goes farther to transcend us, modest anime fans !Haha lol no. They spend 95% of their time at home, sometimes they end up in some cliche situations and that\'s it. Like everytime in those animes, there\'s not deepness to increase our affection to the characters by showing us their hardships (apart from their sexual life). It seems like they\'re always talking and thinking about relationships. Even when the MC hangs out with his friend, they talk about girls. What do they want to do ? idk what are their passions ? idk Who are their parents ? idkwell truth is that it\'s even less developed that the standard romance anime. At least in other animes, you get to see a mother, sometimes a father, a sister and so on. In this anime, we dont care ! and i will explain you whyBecause this anime is a slut anime that doesnt say its name. If you dont know what is the slut genre, well it\'s animes/mangas without any story because the only thing that matters is that characters end up doing sexual things. The plot conveniently helps them.The only difference here is that you can replace sexual scenes by fanservice scenes. Boing breasts, breasts that touch the MC\'s back, scene in which a girl simulates a sex scene while she\'s cooking with the MC (God it was awful to watch).I\'m not going to talk about art etc... cuz there\'s nothing to say really.All in all, who should watch this thing ? Well if you\'re only interested in a generic anime full of fanservice with girls but you\'re not brave enough to watch a hentai you\'re in the right place. This anime will probably be one of the best romance anime you\'ll ever see because it goes really far in fanservice. That\'s all and so on. It\'s always the same flaws, the same stories, the same characters...Nevertheless, i\'ll do it. Well let\'s start with the characters.

If you dont know what is the slut genre, well it\'s animes/mangas without any story because the only thing that matters is that characters end up doing sexual things. The plot conveniently helps them.The only difference here is that you can replace sexual scenes by fanservice scenes. Boing breasts, breasts that touch the MC\'s back, scene in which a girl simulates a sex scene while she\'s cooking with the MC (God it was awful to watch).I\'m not going to talk about art etc... cuz there\'s nothing to say really.All in all, who should watch this thing ? Well if you\'re only interested in a generic anime full of fanservice with girls but you\'re not brave enough to watch a hentai you\'re in the right place. This anime will probably be one of the best romance anime you\'ll ever see because it goes really far in fanservice. That\'s all', '1/10A nationwide high school program that ""prepares"" you for marriage by forcing you into a domestic relationship with a random person? Seems like it wouldn\'t work. So I guess it\'s a good thing that if you do things that appear to be marriage-worthy (read: generate ecchi scenes), you will be graded well. Why would you bother? Because the highest graded couples can trade partners.That\'s right, the best plan an entire nation can supposedly come up with to prepare people for marriage is, ""pair random *minors*, monitor them on camera, and force them to put on a happy, loving façade for those around them, and then...dump that person for the one with whom they really want to have a relationship."" What a trash premise for an excuse to make an ecchi show.Also, every couple appears to be heterosexual. What about...? Ah, right, that doesn\'t happen in Japan. Hot garbage. dump that person for the one with whom they really want to have a relationship."" What a trash premise for an excuse to make an ecchi show.Also, every couple appears to be heterosexual.

The romance in the anime is genuinely interesting and enjoyable to watch and makes you really think about what way the protagonist will shift towards.Art: 9I have to say that for a romance the animation is pretty good, obviously, you shouldn’t expect any super high production, but it definitely is good...enough to support the amazing art design this anime brings.

The rest of the cast is also good, and while I dont personally like Shiori, there is nothing really wrong with her writing, and honestly, she does a solid job moving the plot forward.Story: 8While I do think the initial premise is a little dumb, the anime does a great job of keeping you entertained and interested in where all these characters will end up, or shall I say who they will end up with.

Heck, I’m in!I couldn’t believe how I fell in love with this show.Since the last movie of Karakai Jouzo no Takagi-san, I was yearning for another cute romance to watch. I accidentally stumbled in this show and it is the best accident I’ve ever had. I was not expecting grand will happen since I thought that it would be just another romance like Sono Bisque and Shikimori-san. This show is very sweet and cute to watch. It made me felt on why I fell in love with romance animes from the start.The story is what I’m not expecting it...to be. I didn’t watch the trailer or read the synopsis. But I got a glimpse of an idea of a setting that would be focused on marriage. Heck, it’s about marriage but in a practical course. It’s a nice setting because it can be necessary for the students in high school years on how will they behave in case they would be married in the future. Koi to Uso was like a fixed marriage so it’s a different story. What I like about the story is the alliance moment between the two characters. Jiro wants to be partnered with Shiori, while Akari wanted to be partnered with Minami. So they made a goal to reach for the top 10 to switch their partners but through the course of the series, one of them might get fall in love. It made me remember Toradora, which is one of my favorite romances animes.The good thing is, there’s no such thing as NTR here. Each episode and moments are funny and entertaining. The comedy in this show made me giggle every time. Sadaharu can be somewhat similar to Sunohara in Clannad. The romance in this show can make you thrilled and feel the fluffiness of what romance had in the first place. Every episode is so good that it can leave you wanting more. The ecchi is somewhat great but it is not the main selling point of the show. It didn’t bother me that much because Akari is a gyaru but a good character. It’s inevitable to have ecchi moments in romance animes and it can be entertaining. I thought if Sono Bisque was just like this and more focused on the romance and its message, it could be one of my favorite romcoms. The funny part of that moment is they are both shows from the Seinen demographic. You can see obviously that Sono Bisque is somewhat a wasted potential due to the excessive ecchi moments and a misleading interpretation of romance.I love all the characters in this show. It’s not going to have you screaming at the characters, but it will have you rooting for them. This is the first time that I like a gyaru female lead like Akari and she made me understand her emotions throughout the story. She is so beautiful, alongside Marin and Shikimori. The Character Development of Akari warms my heart, I used to dislike this girl at first but after watching the episodes of this show, I concluded that I love her Personality and Character Development the most. Shiori's Character Development is not that well developed from what I can see, but we all know how much development she has it will never lead to a happy ending for her. Childhood friends mostly never win and that's a fact. Unless the author will do something that makes us in awe. The character development of Jiro is great too but he can be dense at all times. It’s not bad because most people aren’t psychics, to begin with. The other characters are so lively and full of energy. They are well-presented and fun to hang out with. Jiro and Akari have chemistry as a couple. I want him to root for both of them but Shiori is sometimes annoying. But that something happens when you low-key reject the person that likes you. You’re too late to realize your feelings for him/her.I fell in love with the art style and animation. It seems Blue and Pink are the main colors of this show. The color palettes are so beautiful and eye candy to watch. The animation is good as expected from other romance animes. Akari keeps on becoming hotter throughout the series and it’s a good thing. Every detail in the background scenes is very capturing to the eyes.Gosh, the sounds. I didn’t like the OP and ED that much, but the soundtrack is beautiful and warms my heart. It made me remember the soundtrack of 5-toubun no Hanayome. The music is suitable for every moment in this show. It can make you feel the romantic vibe that this show has to offer. Forgettable? I think not. The best? One of the music that’s pleasing to the ears.I highly recommend this show to audiences and fans who want to enjoy solid romance animes. You might fall in love at first sight, even though the story is somewhat predictable. I’m captured by its title and I surely will pick the manga to see what will happen to the story. It has the potential to be one of those romance animes that’s so sweet and you might enjoy. The show has typical romcom cliché moments but it can keep you on the edge of your seat. Although it’s not perfect, it’s worth watching!As for the last note, let’s not deny the following statement. The word “Pretending” is always going to be “Official”.Story: 8/10Animation: 9/10Characters: 8/10Sound: 9/10Entertainment factor: 10/10Enjoyment: 10/10 to be.

The visual style of the work also stands out for talking to Akari's personality, more cheerful and exuberant, but that was just a possibility, after all, the work preferred to be concerned with other types of interaction and in other parts of Akari.To begin with, the initial...pace of the anime is flawed, it appears to be rushed, but not because it speeds up events, but because instead of continuing the events, they chose to play scenes and more scenes that had no connection to each other one on top of the other, clustering disconnected scenes that together meant absolutely nothing. In the second half this ends up changing, there is a real story, but that doesn't make it interesting.An important factor to note is the existing points system in the double course, the fact that it is possible to switch partners when both reach rank A not only creates a common goal for Jirou and Akari, allowing both to work together , as it also starts to create an unknown in the face of the relationships between them, the need to act to earn points in order to move up in rank merges with true affective relationships between the characters, creating the doubt of whether it was an act or a true feeling in any and all actions between them. As I said before, history sucks, so, as expected, this factor is not well used, the system itself, when pairs A and B change pairs, the score is added, is problematic after all, at a certain point the difference in scores goes be so big that rank A will be stabilized, without changing the position of the pairs, but I won't even go into those merits.Well, now the icing on the cake, the thing that makes you question whether you're watching a romantic comedy or a h*****. Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman makes it clear from the beginning that he is more concerned with creating scenes with a sexual content than developing some minimal narrative, so all the work has to offer are dubious angles and libidinous situations. Akari visibly works as a doll for appealing scenes, but even so she manages to be better than Shiori, who when she wasn't serving as any existence to stop the main novel, served to deliver the scene with the whipped cream and the sandcastle , which in addition to being disgusting, were not even careful to give them any meaning, they simply happened, not that this will make these scenes good, but if you are going to do shit, at least do it well.In case it wasn't clear this work is bad, I'm sad to say that because I nurtured expectations in it, but despite having positive values with the uncertainty of the veracity of the actions, as already mentioned above, and the insertions of game scenes that served to to illustrate Jirou's current situation, these positive values were forgotten, after all, the concern of the work was another and unfortunately it required appealing content to work, since concrete quality did not exist.(Sorry for any mistakes, the text was translated by Google Translate)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman é uma típica comédia romântica com um polígono amoroso básico, mas apresentando o diferencial de já colocar os casais juntos desde o começo, possibilitando assim que o romance e a interação afetiva entre os personagens fosse desenvolvida desde o início, tornando ela parte da história e não apenas uma conclusão. O estilo visual da obra também ganha seu destaque por conversar com a personalidade da Akari, mais alegre e exuberante, mas isso era apenas uma possibilidade, afinal a obra preferiu se preocupar com outros tipos de interação e em outras partes da Akari.Para começo de conversa o ritmo inicial do anime é falho, ele aparenta ser rushado, mas não pelo fato de acelerar os acontecimentos e sim porquê ao invés de dar continuidade para os acontecimentos, optaram por jogar cenas e mais cenas que não possuíam conexão entre si uma em cima da outra, aglomerando cenas desconexas que juntas não queriam dizer absolutamente nada. Na segunda metade isso acaba mudando, passa a existir uma história de fato, mas não por isso ela vai ser interessante.Um fator importante de observar é o sistema de pontos existente no curso de casal, o fato de ser possível a troca de dupla quando ambas atingirem o rank A não só cria um objetivo em comum para o Jirou e a Akari, permitindo que ambos trabalhassem juntos, como também passa a criar uma incógnita perante as relações entre eles, a necessidade de atuar para ganhar pontos com o intuito de subir no rank se funde com relações afetivas verdadeiras entre os personagens, criando a dúvida de se foi uma encenação ou um sentimento verdadeiro em toda e qualquer ação entre eles. Como já dito anteriormente a história não presta, logo, como esperado, esse fator não é bem utilizado, o próprio sistema de quando as duplas A e B trocarem de par a pontuação ser somada, é problemática afinal em determinado momento a diferença de pontuação vai ser tão grande que o rank A vai ficar estabilizado, sem ocorrer troca posição das duplas, mas nem vou entrar nesses méritos.Bom, agora a cereja do bolo, aquilo que te faz questionar se você esta assistindo uma comédia romântica ou um h*****. Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman deixa bem claro desde o começo que ele está mais preocupado em criar cenas com teor sexual do que desenvolver alguma narrativa mínima, logo tudo que a obra tem a oferecer são ângulos duvidosos e situações libidinosas. A Akari funciona visivelmente como uma boneca para cenas apelativas, mas mesmo assim ela consegue ser melhor do que a Shiori, que quando não estava servindo como uma existência qualquer para travar o romance principal, serviu para entregar a cena do chantilly e do castelo de areia, que além de serem nojentas, não tiveram sequer o cuidado de dar algum sentido para elas, simplesmente aconteceram, não que isso vá tornar essas cenas boas, mas se for fazer merda, pelo menos faz bem feito.Para caso não tenha ficado claro essa obra é ruim, fico triste em dizer isso pois nutri expectativas nela, mas apesar de possuir valores positivos com a incerteza da veracidade das ações, como já citado acima, e as inserções de cenas do jogo que serviram para ilustrar a situação atual do Jirou, esses valores positivos foram esquecidos, afinal a preocupação da obra era outra e infelizmente demandava de conteúdo apelativo para funcionar, já que qualidade concreta não existia. pace of the anime is flawed, it appears to be rushed, but not because it speeds up events, but because instead of continuing the events, they chose to play scenes and more scenes that had no connection to each other one on top of the other, clustering disconnected scenes that together meant absolutely nothing.

Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman deixa bem claro desde o começo que ele está mais preocupado em criar cenas com teor sexual do que desenvolver alguma narrativa mínima, logo tudo que a obra tem a oferecer são ângulos duvidosos e situações libidinosas. A Akari funciona visivelmente como uma boneca para cenas apelativas, mas mesmo assim ela consegue ser melhor do que a Shiori, que quando não estava servindo como uma existência qualquer para travar o romance principal, serviu para entregar a cena do chantilly e do castelo de areia, que além de serem nojentas, não tiveram sequer o cuidado de dar algum sentido para elas, simplesmente aconteceram, não que isso vá tornar essas cenas boas, mas se for fazer merda, pelo menos faz bem feito.Para caso não tenha ficado claro essa obra é ruim, fico triste em dizer isso pois nutri expectativas nela, mas apesar de possuir valores positivos com a incerteza da veracidade das ações, como já citado acima, e as inserções de cenas do jogo que serviram para ilustrar a situação atual do Jirou, esses valores positivos foram esquecidos, afinal a preocupação da obra era outra e infelizmente demandava de conteúdo apelativo para funcionar, já que qualidade concreta não existia."", 'Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman. is one of the new anime in this last season of 2022. I said this before, but I\'m going to repeat it: this is my favourite season of the year. While I was searching in the database here, I saw this title and decided to give it a try.This show is some rom-com you have already seen before, but the way the emotions and characters feelings are delivered struck a good chord within me. We have Yakuin Jirou, the typical unpopular high schooler, that suddenly sees himself living with Watanabe Akari, a lively ""yankee"" female student; this happens due to...a ""married-life program"" the school has, where the students learn how getting married is like. However, our two MCs have other love interests, that are Sakurazaka Shiori (Jirou\'s long time friend) and Minami Tenjin (the most famous boy in campus). That\'s the beginning of a romantic plot with deceit and heartbreaks.As I said in the paragraph above, the characters writings are somewhat a bit different than a typical rom-com. Sometimes, I think about the infamous Kuzu no Honkai, due to the indecision the students have and the ""using you to fill the void""; however FIKM doesn\'t choose the somber and depressive approach. It\'s colorful mostly, but with some kind of mellow atmosphere. We have two freshmen that feel divided by the love they share for their significant others, but the feelings they grow for one another rise little by little. Still, when night comes they can\'t ignore their neediness.The slow approach the series takes may be a bit annoying sometimes, but I take this as just a common rule by the writer. The premise is wacky and unrealistic, but does it even matter? This is when FIKM acts ironically and even sarcastically. The reality where the Japanese government just doesn\'t care anymore.The art is beautiful and lively, with the characters silhouette contour being from any color but black. I haven\'t seen anything like it since No Game No Life artistic choices. The sound is pretty good, we have ""True Fool Love"", a happy opening that shows the expectations to have love corresponded. The ending is ""Stuck On You"", a beautiful smooth song, that depicts the wish of true love and night loneliness, as shown in the Ed clip. It\'s the deceit after breakup, or the disillusion in a dark midnight.Overall, this is an anime which I\'m truly enjoying so far, even with its pacing issues and some predictable moments. Might read the manga after season ends.Thank you for reading. a ""married-life program"" the school has, where the students learn how getting married is like.

I won't say the rest as it would count as spoilers but you get my drift.The story itself is more of a VERY situational rom kind of com slice of life where the school has a dumb programme where students at random have to be paired up with another of the opposite sex. If you have any knowledge of the real world you can see how...this already wouldn't work. then have them do couple things but not to the extent of the full blown couple things to gain points to pass some other dumb stuff which includes being able to pair with another student of their consenting choice. yeah very dumb.As you can tell two opposite kind of people pair up and it doesn't turn out well and then eventually something else happens.The story itself held no decent structure and sounded more like a hypothetical kind of scenario which someone came up with, the pacing itself was ok but if anything was stretched out a fair bit with mostly fan service moments and by fan service just slightly provocative situations happened. which leads to connections being made but ultimately  its just two students of the opposite sexs spending time together which would eventually lead to the inevitable.The art style was nice to look at for the characters while the scenery was more bland at times with the music being meh.If you're looking to watch this I'd say look at your options on what else you have in the rom com category which you haven't watched yet, preferably something which has an ending with closure as this doesn't have an ending where you know who ends up with who as they want a second season for financial reasons.So if you're looking for rom coms I'd say watch Plastic memories, Love is War, Toradora, Mayo Chiki or Dimension W. this already wouldn't work. then have them do couple things but not to the extent of the full blown couple things to gain points to pass some other dumb stuff which includes being able to pair with another student of their consenting choice. yeah very dumb.As you can tell two opposite kind of people pair up and it doesn't turn out well and then eventually something else happens.The story itself held no decent structure and sounded more like a hypothetical kind of scenario which someone came up with, the pacing itself was ok but if anything was stretched out a fair bit with mostly fan service moments and by fan service just slightly provocative situations happened. which leads to connections being made but ultimately  its just two students of the opposite sexs spending time together which would eventually lead to the inevitable.The art style was nice to look at for the characters while the scenery was more bland at times with the music being meh.If you're looking to watch this I'd say look at your options on what else you have in the rom com category which you haven't watched yet, preferably something which has an ending with closure as this doesn't have an ending where you know who ends up with who as they want a second season for financial reasons.So if you're looking for rom coms I'd say watch Plastic memories, Love is War, Toradora, Mayo Chiki or Dimension W."", ""Yeah, so after constant bombshells last week, I am disappointed that this season's finale extensively wraps up nothing. If anything, this episode just reaffirmed the new status quo. I also understand why it was appropriate to end the season this way. If the show tried making any massive steps forward, then the episode would have ended unsatisfyingly no matter what since there was no way that we would've been able to hit another emotional progression point within the span of one episode. The series arguably already blew its load last week regarding dramatic revelations and character development. Still, that doesn't mean that there wasn't anything...here.This episode was mainly about Akari and Shiori, even though much was from Jiro's perspective. Everyone is in a different place at the end of the season compared to how they were at the beginning. Shiori is learning to be much more forward and fight a bit more for what she wants. Akari is getting in tune with her desires and chasing after something that is far less guaranteed than she initially thought. Jiro is finally starting to have his feelings waver and is constantly letting his insecurities get in the way of finally crossing that line that keeps presenting itself to him. After watching so many bad romantic comedies this year alone, it's nice that the show has definitive progression markers. While the show skews too much to Akari's side for there to be any actual romantic tension and unpredictability, I like how this episode ends. When the beautiful insert song plays as Shiori and Akari race to the romance shrine, Shiori passes by two kids playing in a park while Akari passes by two people kissing each other goodbye. But then they both run neck and neck past a couple just getting married and various other families at different stages in their life. Both started from different places in their relationship with Jiro, but both are fighting for the same thing, and at least at this point in the story, you could argue that they're on equal ground in Jiro's mind.The show was about Jiro and Akari getting closer so they could move on with other people they had feelings for. But now things are different, and considering the very last shot of this episode was that goal being realized, it doesn't feel like a victory. The status quo is so irreversibly different that I sit here begging to find out what will happen next. I took up this show as a joke, and my expectations were so deep in the ground you couldn't even see them, but I ended up walking away from this with such a satisfying sense of investment. This is the kind of show that validates you for giving it a chance despite how things look on the surface, and I am desperately hoping that season two comes out soon. here.This episode was mainly about Akari and Shiori, even though much was from Jiro's perspective.

It reminds me of a combination of ""My First Girlfriend is a Gal"" and ""Love and Lies."" With a touch of No Game No Life coloring.To put it simply students have to take a fake marriage exam to act as a married couple with a partner the school sets them up with. Our main protag had his eyes on his childhood friend, but get paired with a pink haired gyaru who doesn\'t like him either. But as the episodes progress you can guess that something starts developing between them while the childhood friend gets jealous.This anime can really rile up...the feelings as the main protag interacts with potential love interests, and that\'s usually what makes it cute, though it\'s always unfortunate that by the next episode it seemed that they went back to square one like those feelings didn\'t happen between those two people, but it wouldn\'t be interesting if the main protag knew what to do lol.Overall: I like this anime. Interested if there will be a season two. And I\'m team Akari on this one lol the feelings as the main protag interacts with potential love interests, and that\'s usually what makes it cute, though it\'s always unfortunate that by the next episode it seemed that they went back to square one like those feelings didn\'t happen between those two people, but it wouldn\'t be interesting if the main protag knew what to do lol.Overall: I like this anime. Interested if there will be a season two. And I\'m team Akari on this one lol', 'I love and hate this anime. It\'s a true guilty pleasure for me.The characters tend to be irritating, the plot is not very ambitious.Still, I enjoy every episode of this anime. I don\'t understand that but the plot is so ridiculous that I got into it.Characters are teenagers that don\'t understand their feelings, that\'s how I explain their weird behaviors. They have mixed feelings about the people they love.I would recommend this anime to people that like:- when characters are forced to live together- watching teenagers that don\'t understand their feelings- typical school romances that are so ordinary that you start liking them :DBut if...you are looking for a more ambitious romance like ""golden time"" or ""Horimiya"" this anime is not for you. you are looking for a more ambitious romance like ""golden time"" or ""Horimiya"" this anime is not for you.', ""This show is certified garbage. MC can never be more pathetic than he already is.He can't express his feelings for his childhood friend, he cannot even express his feelings for his wife. The way he just begs his wife for forgiveness when he hasn't really done anything wrong is everything I despise in a man. No redeeming traits, no likability, no confidence and indecisive.Nobody is honest with their feelings and everybody is just wallowing in their sadness because they can't be with the people they desire, it's barely a romance and more of a test of the audience, to see if MC finally...has balls to do something. Absolute joke of a romance. has balls to do something. Absolute joke of a romance."", 'I felt like romance anime has been stepped into wrong direction for a while now. Every ""romance anime"" nowadays are mainly comedy with romance as a side dish. Those that actually counted as romance anime are either have no relationship development at all (known as ""romance subtext"") or didn\'t know how to balance romance with other thing (e.g. Horimiya). That\'s why for the past exactly 100 romance anime that I watched, there\'s none that actually satisfy me for romance purpose. Until I watch this anime.For the first time, I actually got what I\'m looking for. A romance anime that actually a romance while maintaining decent...aspect of drama, comedy, fan service. This anime is also one kind of anime that make you want to fall in love. I will called it as ""fluffy"" anime. An underrated thing inside romance genre that lot of people overlook. Does it work though? Does it make me want to fall in love? Yes, it does. Sort of.Fuufu Ijou\'s anime is overall okay-ish with a bit of disappointment. I\'m not talking about source material, that thing is great. Fuufu Ijou is currently one of the very few manga that I\'m still reading, that alone should confirm that I seriously love it in some way. However, the anime adaption didn\'t do justice to series.The concept of Fuufu Ijou sound stupid (although unique) when you look at the surface. That\'s the weakest point of this series in the beginning too in my opinion. However, the story of relationship development between Jirou and Akari made up for it. Well, sort of. It\'s not perfect relationship development by any mean. In fact, I would say it\'s worse than average. However, the best we got in this ""fluffy"" genre is Tonikaku Kawaii and that have no relationship development at all in my opinion. So at least, okay-ish relationship is better than no relationship development.However, I believe that the real magic of Fuufu Ijou is it gap moe. Gap moe is what make Fuufu Ijou shine as gyaru of this series is always trying to be ""lovey-dovey"" with MC. Well, in sort of Tsundere way. Guess what, the concept of Fuufu Ijou is the magic behind this gap moe. Having gyaru that becoming lovey-dovey is of course, a strong gap moe. It gap moe is surprisingly effective and giving itself free pass for a lot of thing that it missed and somewhat making me want to fall in love, the main reason I watch romance in the first place (Seriously, none of romance anime that I watched actually archived this and I watch hundredth. This thing is great for that).Animation is good and studio is pretty faithful with manga for the first seven episode. I must admit it\'s beyond my expectation as a manga reader. Especially episode 7 which almost everyone will say that it will be peak of Fuufu Ijou\'s anime adaption, which it did. studio MOTHER deliver it so well. It\'s honestly mind-blowing because I thought that studio MOTHER will messed that up. After episode 7, we thought that we\'re safe now from any disaster adaption.... right?Episode 9 is where everything starting to be little bit off.  Character in the background isn\'t moving and animation seem little bit worse but that\'s not the end of the world. Episode 10 is where it become obvious that studio is probably running out of budget. Every background character aren\'t moving at all. Not to mention that fanservice seem to be little bit much. It\'s now clear that we\'re driving to the worse direction episode by episode starting from Episode 8. Storyline has been cutting out like crazy and animation is clearly worsen episode by episode. This is becoming disaster after what we thought that we\'re safe from it. It seem like they pour all budget on episode 7 already.Episode 12 is where it starting to do justice more for anime adaption. Despite original ending, it was good original ending and also necessary one. However, I believe this is little bit too late to recover all production issues.Music choice in anime adaption is what I questioning the most. How can you have one of the least likable and most generic opening, both animation and music, while having one of the most banger ending. Again, for both animation and music. It\'s hard to believe that it\'s made by same studio for same series. Unbelievable. Especially when considered that opening in the first thing that people gonna see and might be the first thing that people will judge it series.Overall, disaster adaption. It was great until episode 7 but quality has been dropped since then, both animation and directive choice. It went downhill all of sudden. I (and lot of people in community) believe that studio might actually running out of budget after episode 7.Despite disaster adaption for the last 5 episode and one of the worst opening in my opinion, I still enjoy it a lot. Enough to make me immediately finding all limited edition boxset for it manga and empty my wallet for one whole month. However, I believe that studio could have done a lot better job and story could have better than this. I will still recommend this anime to almost everyone, despite the fact that it have major issue.

It turns out that this series is a romanticisation of wish fulfillment for single male (allo) readers since it\'s obvious that Jirou is a self-insert male protagonist who has become my most hated character from this series. In fact, the toxic behaviors of Jirou & Akari manipulating each other unconsciously can be a turnoff given how the sparkly color coordination is an obvious sign that their romantic development is being romanticized to superficial, unhealthy levels. Also the writing development on Minami makes him become a plot device instead of him being an actual character.More Than a Married Couple, but Not Lovers may not be to your liking if you\'re unable to stand the features I\'ve mentioned above, and/or if you feel upset that it somehow directly insults that being a virgin, especially written as an otaku stereotype trope, is a childish thing to be; not to mention, the ""teasing the virgin"" joke gets repetitive and tedious.The only good thing is that it doesn\'t feature ace characters which I\'m glad this doesn\'t apply to the male lead\'s best friend whom you won\'t like his voice screeching vibes of a persistent busybody, and that he would be a misrepresentation of being an aroace.I believe this anime series is recommended for those who want to experience ""a rom-com made during the Y2K era"", or those who want the kind of escapism where the stupidity of falling for the wrong person who happens to be the OTP and misunderstandings keep on happening like it\'s the most natural thing to do. The only thing that I could think of as its salvation is the animation quality being made with a ""good enough"" level.More Than a Married Couple, but Not Lovers can only be enjoyed for an allo audience who desire to watch for the fanservice of the female lead being a sexy, cute waifu and a bumbling otaku male lead who tried his utmost best to figure out why he\'s falling for the female lead instead of his cute childhood friend.

To be fair, most romcoms have basic plots anyway, I guess that the fake wedding twist and how...far it\'s developped in this story is kind of creative, however it does bring a tad of questions regarding morality if we wanted to be nitpicky.So, why should you watch Fuufu ?+ Quite eventful for a 12 episodes season of a romcom+ Except for this whole ""wedding practical"" thing, the story feels coherent, aswell as the characters\' reactions+ It\'s probably subjective, but the art, the visuals are different from what we usually see ( I don\'t know the technical terms ) but the result is a colorful anime that feels unique with its design+ Well as you might expect, Akari is your typical lovable gyaru waifu, and is a good enough reason to give this anime a tryWhat are the things that don\'t really work in Fuufu ?- Jiro, the male MC fits the ""loser"" archetype, not in every way, but you know, it just feels like a lazy choice that we\'ve seen a hundred times before, and it\'s a bit frustrating because he could have been a ""better""/more original character with a few adjustments- As usual, some scenes/dialogues felt a bit too cringe, while it\'s not really hurting the show nor its rythm, it\'s simply a bit boring to see those predictable scenes that end up being not funny at all- This anime isn\'t really about character development, I don\'t personnaly consider this as a drawback, but I know some people might expect this and will be disappointed if that\'s the caseThose ""negative"" aspects of the anime are somewhat subjective, and it didn\'t prevent me from bingewatching Fuufu, but it\'s to help you get a better idea of what this show is about. The last thing I\'d like to talk is the fanservice, keep in mind that this show has quite a fair amount of fanservice scenes ( and to that extent, I find the pegi 13 rating quite surprising since those scenes are rather explicit lmao ), some viewers will like/love it, others won\'t enjoy or hate it. The scenes are sometimes well introduced in the story and help build some credibility in the feelings, the state of the relationships between characters, but most of them are ordinary and not really needed.TL;DR :To sum it up, Fuufu is a lovely romcom, the alchemy between characters simply work, you won\'t be able to see the time fly by while watching it ( only 1 episode out of 12 felt slower/less interesting than the rest ), and I highly recommend it to any viewer who likes romcom. Whereas the plot isn\'t incredible, this anime draws its strengths in other fields, such as a good cast of characters, nice visuals, good comedic moments, a good soundtrack etc... The outcome isn\'t perfect, some scenes are underwhelming with poor fanservice or dull dialogues, but overall, it was a pretty solid experience, Akari best waifu ! far it\'s developped in this story is kind of creative, however it does bring a tad of questions regarding morality if we wanted to be nitpicky.So, why should you watch Fuufu ?+ Quite eventful for a 12 episodes season of a romcom+ Except for this whole ""wedding practical"" thing, the story feels coherent, aswell as the characters\' reactions+ It\'s probably subjective, but the art, the visuals are different from what we usually see ( I don\'t know the technical terms ) but the result is a colorful anime that feels unique with its design+ Well as you might expect, Akari is your typical lovable gyaru waifu, and is a good enough reason to give this anime a tryWhat are the things that don\'t really work in Fuufu ?- Jiro, the male MC fits the ""loser"" archetype, not in every way, but you know, it just feels like a lazy choice that we\'ve seen a hundred times before, and it\'s a bit frustrating because he could have been a ""better""/more original character with a few adjustments- As usual, some scenes/dialogues felt a bit too cringe, while it\'s not really hurting the show nor its rythm, it\'s simply a bit boring to see those predictable scenes that end up being not funny at all- This anime isn\'t really about character development, I don\'t personnaly consider this as a drawback, but I know some people might expect this and will be disappointed if that\'s the caseThose ""negative"" aspects of the anime are somewhat subjective, and it didn\'t prevent me from bingewatching Fuufu, but it\'s to help you get a better idea of what this show is about. The last thing I\'d like to talk is the fanservice, keep in mind that this show has quite a fair amount of fanservice scenes ( and to that extent, I find the pegi 13 rating quite surprising since those scenes are rather explicit lmao ), some viewers will like/love it, others won\'t enjoy or hate it.

There were times when I cringed through this, it is a Rom-com after all, but it’s not the too ‘painful I have to look away’ type of cringe.Despite the bonkers plot, the characters, their feelings and interactions were quite realistic and nothing come off as feeling forced.It’s by no means a masterpiece but it was a very enjoyable watch, don’t let all the negative reviews...from the people that don’t like romance anime stop you from watching.

Students are compelled to cohabit with a partner, simulating a married life under one roof. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Jirou ends up living with Akari, who coincidentally has feelings for Shiori\'s romantic interest. The central narrative focuses on Jirou and Akari\'s quest to achieve an A rating, which allows them to...change partners.

What truly elevates this anime is its well-crafted characters. Each character is endowed with distinct personalities that foster a strong emotional connection with the audience. This series falls into the category of a classic love triangle anime, occasionally sprinkled with ecchi elements, making it a suitable choice for those in search of short and sweet love stories.Story: 7/10 - While the narrative doesn\'t break new ground, it is well-executed within the confines of the genre.

The anime is still super good and a must watch for Romance lovers like me. It has a similar concept compared to koi to uso but this is 50x better. Studio mother did choose an interesting artstyle and I like it with the storyline. The first thought of mine while I was watching the first ep was that it might become a harem or turn into something like rent a girlfriend but I was wrong. I would say that Akari is...a well liked girl and deserves the overall love from the community, on the other hand jirou is the usual introverted and insecure personality MC. The character development of these two has my kudos and the supporting leads also have a big impact on these two. I don't think there is a lot of realism in the story but that's what is expected from this rom com and it makes it very interesting to watch. Idk if a lot of people would dislike this but as far as ik there are ppl who do but mostly this anime gets a positive rating from all.

If you do, then you're in for yet another excruciating experience.Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman is a perfect allegory of how to produce a mediocre anime: an abstract story about high school pupils who are forced to live with random other high school pupils as part of their practice on how to be part of a successful marriage, an interesting idea if you ask me if we're ignoring the fact that it's only used to conjoin the male and female lead who would otherwise never...even glance at one another and afterwards poof! the idea is totally flushed aside with the potential of genuineness from the show. The characters...Where do I start.. a dunce of a protagonist who's been secretly crushing on his childhood friend for over ten years only to fall for the female protagonist (who in turn falls for him instead of the boy she's crushing on for years) because she's trying to sexually assault him every two minutes of each episode, an otaku who knows nothing about nothing and 3 girls who are only there to yell the name of the female lead for helping friends, an antagonist who is the same childhood friend (who is also in love with the protagonist for years, an info I put between parentheses because the show didn't seem interested in developing it either) (oh and this is your usual childhood friend who doesn't talk, who is too shy to even say hi to her crush and only remembers the protagonist exists when another girl shows interest in him), other random characters whose role in developing the nonexistent story is still yet a mystery to me. The art, well there are 7000 colors for hair, some oil painted trees for background nothing interesting.

When two high schoolers are paired together every day as mock 'husband & wife', you can bet that some funny and even romantic situations happen.Even if the two who are paired are polar opposites, would they develop feelings for each other? Or would they each stick to their respective crushes? How would such a practical begin to change their views? These are some of the questions this show asks, and begins to answer.Please, give this vibrantly colored show a chance.Many of the characters will surely make you angry - like Jirou, with his weak confidence in himself and wishy washy attitude at times.

The show dives into the life of Jirou Yakuin, the main character, who navigates the thin line between friendship and romance in a practical experiment (apparently set up by the school) designed to encourage marriage. While Jirou\'s character can come off as frustratingly loser-ish and unlikable at times, there is an undeniable depth to his journey that sparks a peculiar interest.The character development throughout the series is decent, with various characters revealing complexities and vulnerabilities that add layers...to the story. The narrative explores themes of love, commitment, and personal growth, which, while compelling, are occasionally overshadowed by the execution that tends towards the melodramatic. Ideally, I would have liked for the characters to be more real, more often, rather than having what seems to be one character trait that mostly dominates their screen time.Cringe-inducing scenes are frequent, perhaps too much for some viewers. These moments often stem from awkward interactions and decisions that feel forced, aiming to create drama or humor but sometimes missing the mark. However, these elements might also serve as a deliberate reflection of the often messy and unpredictable nature of relationships, resonating with a younger audience navigating similar emotional landscapes.Despite its pitfalls, ""Fuufuu Ijou, Koibito Miman."" presents an interesting concept. It challenges conventional romantic narratives by placing its characters in unconventional living arrangements, prompting both the characters and viewers to reconsider what it means to be in a relationship or to love someone in today\'s society.In conclusion, while the anime might not be flawless, its intriguing premise and the genuine development of its characters are what interested me the most. The series, with its mix of humor, discomfort, and romance, paints a vivid picture of the complexities of human connections, making it resonate with those who are looking for something a little different in their anime viewing.

A compilation clip of a reaction to the overall premise. I was hesitant, but I love romance anime so I added it to my CrunchyList for when it was dubbed and forgot about it. That was probably around the time of my MHA review? I finished this show in a little over a day and I have some feelings. I loved, and I mean LOVED, this show. It’s been a long time since I’ve enjoyed a romance anime this much. It felt like having a crush on someone and keeping it a secret, something I haven’t had...to do for about 2.5 years at this point. It was so much fun. That’s my favorite part about romance anime. You feel like you’re in the relationship, you experience the agony of a slow-burn with the characters. I think the last romance anime I enjoyed this much was either “Lovely Complex” (I’ll rate it, anything to watch again tbh) or “Kaguya-Sama: Love is War'' (cannot wait for the next season oh my god). The animation was stunning. The OP does a great job of letting you know what you’re getting yourself into, with the back and forth, and I interpret it as a “what’s to come'' from a possible second season. I loved every character. Jiro is such a sweet and funny character, and his best friend Kamo made me laugh a TON of times. The LGBTQ+ character was relatable, and it was nice to see that Mei’s understanding of love was actually well-rounded. We don’t see that much in anime. Breaking the stereotypes in this show was sweet as well—seeing Akari tell Jiro off when he assumes that she’s slept around was a really nice addition. I know this show has flaws, but I can’t help it. I’m giving “More Than A Married Couple, But Not Lovers'' a 10 (Masterpiece). I will also say, when I first posted this review on My Anime List, I got called some pretty horrible slurs all because I applauded this show for having 1 gay character/moment in the show.

To start off, including  the “marriage practical” into the school system definitely catches your attention at first and makes you want to watch more to see how it turns out. As the story goes on, it gets pretty interesting but also very frustrating. To be fair, almost all romance gives you that sort of mixed feelings. The two main on-screen characters are a polar-opposite duo just like, Bisque no Doll, for example. I’d say that the anime is very close to Hajimete No Gal. Both animes have some sudden romance spark between polar-opposites consisting of...Gyaru girls and (if you eat chips at home with your overweight arse, this is definitely why you watch anime) Ecchi. I’d say that this anime slightly focuses more on the romance besides the bodies of the female characters. Although Ecchi is embedded, this anime is pretty standard but with more mature characters. Typical story line about two love birds that are still finding out what the feeling of “love” is. The MC is good compared to other anime’s MCS besides the frustrating fact that he’s stuck on some girl from middle school. Like really bro, let it go bro that sh*t was from 5 years ago man. The MFC is bad af but it’s annoying how she’s stuck on some dude that just has dyed hair man. Take the boy Jiro to the barber & give him a half-zip vest & Akari would def take mans over some Minami dude. I honestly like the anime because it’s wholesome & catered towards more mature audiences that can understand things a bit better. The only thing I would uniquely despite is how the boy Jiro is sharing fluids between Akari (who I would take any day) & some child-hood crush :|. Like bro, not only is Akari bad, but she hasn’t done anything with another dude??? If she was some irl & told me to get on my knees to bark, I’d do it over some boring wholesome girl that would politely ask me to put the dishes away after we eat… Anyways, it’s obvious that it’d be frustrating at first but I believe that once Jiro figures himself out, we’ll get that Bisque No Doll typa wholesome vibe. I would bring in the short-haired girl, but her liking to Shiori is completely irrelevant & doesn’t interfere with anything in hindsight. I love the whole personality Akari has going on, being that she’s a bit mean but wholesome & acts like she’s got the experience when it’s just to shadow the fact that she doesn’t. For now, the author is just setting up the typical “what is love” definition but after this is over, I truly have hopes in what’s to come next. Lastly, this anime has a different art style & the hue is refreshing honestly. I hope that this anime gets up to ONLY a third season just to see how things play out & it’s hard to find anime that doesn’t annoy you TOO much. I hope Shiori quits using the “let me practice kissing” rizz & realizes how cringe it is that she stops talking to Jiro. She’s definitely a homewrecker but it’s just like every rom anime so it’s expected. Thank you for reading the review if you got this far & I’d love to connect with people on this website because most of my friends don’t watch anime! If you’re looking for anime to watch after this, I’d recommend basically all the rom-coms because there’s basically not much out there compared to other genres LOL Gyaru girls and (if you eat chips at home with your overweight arse, this is definitely why you watch anime) Ecchi.

If she was some irl & told me to get on my knees to bark, I’d do it over some boring wholesome girl that would politely ask me to put the dishes away after we eat… Anyways, it’s obvious that it’d be frustrating at first but I believe that once Jiro figures himself out, we’ll get that Bisque No Doll typa wholesome vibe. I would bring in the short-haired girl, but her liking to Shiori is completely irrelevant & doesn’t interfere with anything in hindsight. I love the whole personality Akari has going on, being that she’s a bit mean but wholesome & acts like she’s got the experience when it’s just to shadow the fact that she doesn’t. For now, the author is just setting up the typical “what is love” definition but after this is over, I truly have hopes in what’s to come next. Lastly, this anime has a different art style & the hue is refreshing honestly. I hope that this anime gets up to ONLY a third season just to see how things play out & it’s hard to find anime that doesn’t annoy you TOO much. I hope Shiori quits using the “let me practice kissing” rizz & realizes how cringe it is that she stops talking to Jiro. She’s definitely a homewrecker but it’s just like every rom anime so it’s expected. Thank you for reading the review if you got this far & I’d love to connect with people on this website because most of my friends don’t watch anime! If you’re looking for anime to watch after this, I’d recommend basically all the rom-coms because there’s basically not much out there compared to other genres LOL', 'A certain Anituber once said you know how sometimes you get that one anime just feels like it was made for you? I think this show is the case for me. I am a male individual to this day who still does inner monologue squeals during moments of romantic wholesomeness or emotional scenes. Blame my older sibling for making me watch K-drama with them when I was little.This show did what Koi to Uso could not and fulfilled what felt like a certain emptiness in what I wanted to see from Love and Lies.  It was a real shame because the concept of...that story was so brilliant. But when progression starts to become like a meaningless circle-jerk like what Couple of Cuckoos or Kanokari felt like to me, we start to see the cracks. Our male lead Jirou thankfully is someone who steps up occasionally during important moments and that is honestly all I can ask for. Jirou as character feels like a ""two steps forward one step back"" type of character, while Kanokari Kazuya is a ""one step forward two steps back"" kind of individual.I love this show so much so that I have binged the show and manga in two days. The humor  gets a good laugh out of me especially  during the scenes where they just cut the music to silent. Hopefully the adaptational source being a monthly release means good pacing and storyline can continue, and that it is able to stick the landing as what another Anituber has said ""the ending is paramount"" meaning how it ends can heavily dictate how a franchise is remembered and viewed. that story was so brilliant.

I was wondering whether anime was starting to go a completely different direction, with love stories that felt more shallow and fast-paced.  I was wrong.Recent seasons of rom-com anime like ""Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"" season 2 and ""Skilled Teaser Takagi"" season 3 have left me disappointed, the former being a complete shell of the first season and the latter just being mildly underwhelming.  As such, I did not have high hopes for an anime with an...iconic long title like ""More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers.""  I was pleasantly surprised, however.To start, this show has an immediacy to it.  The main characters are instantly revealed, and the context for the events of the show are explained.  In minutes, we know which characters are going to be placed together, and the writer(s) are aware of this; I appreciated some of the immediate teasing they did with this when it came to the video games.  My only disappointment was maybe that there was not a more specific or just longer explanation given to the mechanics (such as the fingerprint doors), grading, etc.; it felt like I blinked and it was over.  In the end, the rom-com aspects take center stage, so I was not entirely disappointed with the immediacy; I do think a certain sense of belief is lost and curiosities arise without thorough mechanical explanations, however.   Thinking about it now, I understand the privacy aspect with the fingerprint door, but initially I had expected it to be more of a precaution of deterring intimacy between  husband and wife; a bit more explanation or mention of the mechanic would have helped in solidifying practical use.The first half of the show is where everything shines, quite literally.  The colors and style of this show are bright and exciting.  Similarly, the facial expressions of the main male character have a certain playful style to them, reminding me of Charlie Brown in some regards; re-watch the intro where his mouth is open as his head is tilted back to see what I mean.  The emotions in the first half are also very strong, with moments of comfort, relief, excitement, nervousness, and others that are a bit too complex to describe.  Some of my favorite moments were when the art played into emotion.  When something smells good and is comforting, transparent flowers fill the room; when someone says something sharp or jarring, animated streaks fill the empty space.  Seeing animation play into the scenes really made them feel alive; I would imagine this was something that appealed well to manga readers and was used to create more tangible feeling in the panels.Despite having many similar tropes as other rom-com anime, the first half of the show never felt boring and somehow always managed to keep an edge.  Some interesting touches to this couple included the casual use of the word ""dude,"" the ideas of marriage and partnership mixed in, etc.  I really thought the show might make a 9/10 or even a 10/10 at this point in the series, but that changed quickly.The second half of the show is where things where thing went a bit south for me.  I had trouble believing elements of the show and found myself craving more time with the two ""main characters.""  The biggest issue with believability for me was the “arc” that occurs.  I enjoyed the original setting of the show and changing location for so long felt a bit jarring; another show that did something like this and changed direction was “Classroom of the Elite” season 1, so I already had worries at the hints for an “arc.”  It ended up not being terrible, but there were three main issues for me.  The first was that not only do all of the characters wind up in the same place, which I could tolerate on its own, but not a single other person outside of the group is depicted or even alluded to.  The second complaint is that there is this cool job aspect to the “arc,” an aspect that could have shown how well the love interests work together as partners or how characters handle stress, but it is very short-lived.  Instead, the second half manages to feel a bit ragged and just combines a handful of common tropes, like beach time, food-making, dark woods, etc.  I did not even understand why the part in the woods was happening, but I knew immediately that it was going to be the same story I had seen before in several other anime.The more minor, but still serious, toll on the show was the dynamic with the characters in the second arc.  I had fallen in love with the primary couple in this story, but in the second half, the main female love interest is pushed to the side quite a bit.  Some of the interactions that were so great were no longer there.  While this was played into a bit, with the main female love interest recognizing the lack of time with the main character, it continued too long; I actually found myself a bit frustrated.  More frustrating was the fact that the main characters seem to have bonded so well in the first half of the show, but then the connection seems weakened in the second half.  The main character’s moves were very questionable to me in the next to last episode, but may also be realistic (sometimes guys are dummies); in the last episode there is a sort of silent peaceful moment between the male lead and secondary love interest that seems to support his indecisiveness, until he seems to have actually made a decision.  And then, just when it seems like things are clear, there is the final scene which made me want to toss my laptop out the window.Before coming to a close, there are a few important side notes I’d like to bring up.  The first is that the side characters of this story are great.  They really stood out and held their weight without simply being some kind of cheap gag.  The male protagonist’s best friend made me laugh quite a lot and actually showed some serious sides as well, with seeming development as the show continued.  Some interesting info was revealed about another character in the next-to-last episode.  I am very eager to see if these characters get some more screen time should the anime continue.  A few side characters may have gotten the short end of the stick, but it felt moderately balanced, given the small investment into them and the seeming continuation of the show.  My only other note is about gags in the series.  While kiss breaks or anime falls were not bad, some of the long-running jokes specific to this show, such as the video game gags,  got to be a bit stale toward the end; I wondered if the video game gags could either be left out (though I appreciated the consistency), or just a bit more innovative.OVERALL (8/10):The show had built so well in the first half that I was a bit disappointed to see where it ended.  This was one of those shows where I wish a definitive ending would have just happened, mostly because it could have, even if it didn’t cover all the manga.  The writing, characters, and progression were so strong in the beginning that I really think this could have been one of the most satisfying twelve episode series out there.  Another part of me just wishes that this show had been halted until it could be a fuller twenty-four episode series or something similar; if it had been halted, the last few episodes may have been less jarring.To end on a more positive note, I hope this show comes in strong for a season two.  I want this show to defy rom-com anime trends as of late.   I do not want this to become a less emotional story.  I do not want this to become a faster-paced story.  I do not want this show to become fan-serviced; not fan-serviced in the dirty way (that’s fine), but I do not want the series to focus on characters or gags that fans seemed to like the most and drop elements that were less popular.  Basically, I just want the series to feel like an extension of season one and not like it was created by an entirely different studio.  All that being said, I really do want the story to come to a more stable conclusion, and I would love more time with Akari and our male lead.  Fingers crossed to another season of marriage.

Overall 9.5/10 almost a masterpiece.', 'Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman (More than a married couple, but not lovers), is an anime that is set in a world where year 3 highschool students attempt a simulated marriage of sorts as a final test to graduate. Though perplexed by the idea of it at first, i dove in not expecting a lot just watching as sort of a throw - away or end-of-list type of watch just to past time. However, what hit me was something that i far enjoyed more than i could imagine.To start off this review, i was not aware of the manga nor of the airing of this...anime when it was released and prior to when i watched it, i happened to be looking through old seasons and the cover art caught my eye. I wasn\'t expecting much going into it, really was just expecting a regular run of the mill romcom anime with a flimsy protagonist caught in a love triangle with a \'gal\' and a \'sweetheart\' persee.It begins like a generic romcom would, the two main characters dislike each other, and the male protagonist (Jirou) despises his partner in the test (Akari) and is infatuated with his childhood friend (shiori). Slowly but surely things progress and without giving any spoilers i\'d say it follows a similar path to popularised romcom series like Nisekoi whilst maintaining the a similar story idea to ""Koi to Uso"".What really stood out to me about this anime was the changes in emotion, the timing, and pace of it all. I think the anime was well-paced much in contrary to many romcoms lately where it just seemed rushed and condensed way too much in the last few episodes. The changes in emotions within the character, and how it was presented by the voice actors was truly spectacular. The duality of characters, for example Akari stood out to me at the start as well as Jirou who though assumed the role of a pitiful male \'virgin\' protagonist, stepped up in situations and was at least half of a man when he ought to be. Overall, the story and characters really felt nostalgic yet at the same time fresh and interesting.The OP and ED definitely were gems of this season, especially the ED i\'d say was one of , if not the best in the season. The art and animation were decent, nothing extravagantly amazing but nothing to complain about as well. Though i did really enjoy the pop of colour in the art style which really breathed life into a otherwise possibly dull pixel.All being said, definitely worth the watch, haven\'t enjoyed myself with a romcom for a while and i\'m glad that it was \'Fuufu Ijou, Kobito Miman\' that broke my cold streak. There is definitely sufficient material for a season 2, so i\'m praying that we will get one either sometime later this year or early/mid next year given the popularity of the animation.

The art style and animation was well done with great colours and they made the characters relatable and very human. Some might say it’s a typical teen romance but let’s be honest who doesn’t love these. Overall loved it and have a great time watching it!Some times the less we expect the better it turns out so go into it with an open mind and you won’t be disappointed.

No major spoilers, but general information and tips ahead. TL;DR at the end.Regarding this show, there is a huge problem - the source material, despite being more than 50 chapters in, hasn't provided much progress. Sure, it can be justified that it will eventually mature into something more, however, that's not what people typically enjoy watching shows like these. What it is at the moment is an awkward dude who had the opportunity to experience close connection to a girl for the first time....Being such a young fellow and getting such experience makes him jump between two girls without being able to settle on one. It is relatively realistic in that regard, but at some point it just goes beyond that. You either have to have no guilt, or be oblivious to continue this way without any character growth as a human being, and I am speaking from experience. It can be justified that he's just a teenager with low self-esteem, which is logical, but only time will tell what the story will give us in the end. However, one thing remains certain - DO NOT expect a closure at the end of this show.Animation is alright, the vibrant colours remind me of NGNL sometimes, so the contrast and colour palette was good from my point of view, contrary to some other reviewers' opinions. There are many mature characters in the show and the general circumstances are relatively realistic for the most part, and portrayed in the right direction. I am glad that in certain scenarios, some of the scenes provide mature acting from certain characters like Hamano Mei.TL;DRIf you want to enjoy a lot of romantic moments that a guy experiences for the first time in his life, meeting a girl he doesn't really like but ends up liking after having to live with her (and now being unable to understand who he loves for real, just like his now-wife), this is a fun show. However, if you are coming into this expecting a closure, some kind of solution to the situation, lower your expectations. It might be a wonderful show, and will provide you with a great experience while watching, but in order to reach a conclusion, there has to be one first.In the end it's fun to watch, and you want to know more, reach an ending soon, but in the end, it will keep going up and down until the end.

I am glad that in certain scenarios, some of the scenes provide mature acting from certain characters like Hamano Mei.TL;DRIf you want to enjoy a lot of romantic moments that a guy experiences for the first time in his life, meeting a girl he doesn't really like but ends up liking after having to live with her (and now being unable to understand who he loves for real, just like his now-wife), this is a fun show. However, if you are coming into this expecting a closure, some kind of solution to the situation, lower your expectations. It might be a wonderful show, and will provide you with a great experience while watching, but in order to reach a conclusion, there has to be one first.In the end it's fun to watch, and you want to know more, reach an ending soon, but in the end, it will keep going up and down until the end. If there is ever a season 2, it might happen once the manga has finished."", ""Don't get me wrong this anime is nothing special but you may find it enjoyable in some aspects.This is not something I would recommend to any of my friends or anyone who is big into anime as this is just something that is very average and falls into the many cliches that plague the rom-com genre.  Although If you can get behind an interesting enough development of a romance between the two main leads, it's enough to watch.  It will definitely be a hit or a miss with people.Let me start out with the positives, the main heroine is actually quite likable...as the way her character is written comes off as very human although in a cliche fashion at times.  She does care about the protagonist's feelings and she can be extremely cute at times.  She is definitely the highlight of the show. While the protagonist is your stereotypical shy guy that can't speak his true emotion at times he does have common sense and knows when to take action when it is needed.  The animation does a good job as well as it doesn't feel low-budget in any way.The negatives, oh man like I said this is a very average anime. It is your very stereotypical rom-com trash but I guess it can be appealing in that way as well.  The premise of this show is so unbelievably stupid that you just gotta laugh at the sheer senselessness of this anime.  The school and students deeply care about this course like their futures are ruined if they don't pass this and it just comes off as really dumb.  The main character is so wish-washy with the two main love interests that it can really be annoying to watch.Overall if you can get past the stupidness of the show and laugh at it and enjoy it for what it is watch it if you are rom-com trash like me :)Writing 6/10Story 5/10Characters 7/10Animation 7/10 as the way her character is written comes off as very human although in a cliche fashion at times.

Throw that out and you have the makings of a decent series.Story & Characters: More than a married couple, but not lovers introduces us to Jirou Yakuin, who spends much of his time playing video games, reading manga and hanging out with fellow nerd, Sadaharu Kamo.  They share random guy talk and gossip about the various girls in their class.  Then, their class is involved in a new ""practical"", where everyone...is paired up with someone in their class and must live with them for a semester, as if they were a married couple.  Although Jirou hopes to be paired with his childhood crush, Shiori Sakurazaka, he is disappointed when she ends up being paired with the class pretty boy, Minami Tenjin.  And who does Jirou get paired with?  Akari Watanabe, who comes off as a bit of an overdramatic popular girl with a massive crush on Minami.Look, the concept of the practical is pretty silly and an easy reason for people turn off the TV (stream?) right away.  I wasn\'t really on board with the premise, but with many other romance series, I felt they could pull off character interactions in meaningful ways.  The idea of this practical was that you\'d be constantly monitored, presumably graded, and if you got to the half way point with an A, you were allowed to switch partners with someone else who also obtained an A.  So now, for the ones that have a class crush, the practical, right from the start, has some amount of goal for you.Jirou will remind audiences of Hikari from the Real Girl series, in that he keeps his thought to him and his best bud, finds others rather annoying, is a nerd and isn\'t good with relationships.  Sure, he\'s a ""little"" more outgoing, but he\'s just as dense.  It makes this series harder to watch than it should be.  I really don\'t like it when a mutual crush \'clearly\' exists and it\'s not even that he started crushing on Shiori as they started this practical - it\'s been since childhood.  The pair take some meaningful steps by the time you hit the end, but it\'s not because of Jirou.  Shiori is incredibly sweet and kindhearted, even if she\'s a bit of a klutz at times.  She tries her hardest and while she isn\'t necessarily seeking attention, she won\'t say no to it.  Akari, like Shiori, is very sweet.  The major difference is that she shows that off in different ways.  She\'s very blunt though, and when you have a series with a potential couple that aren\'t, it adds a nice mix.Minami isn\'t shown nearly as much in this series.  He\'s pretty straight forward and I\'m not even sure if he\'s aware how popular he is.  I would have loved to see a little more of him.  Sadaharu is portrayed as a typical nerd, with nerf-speech and all.  He\'s strange, but offers a nice mix.  Mei is one of cast\'s classmates.  She, like everyone has, has a super obvious crush.  It\'s never shown who she got paired up with, but I would have loved to see more scenes with her and that other person.Let\'s remove the premise of our characters being stuck together for school reasons.  The story aside that?  It\'s perfectly fine.  Characters interact with others in meaningful ways, even if character development gets stalled at times.  I actually really appreciate whoever was in charge of adapting the script because it felt very fluid with high school style talking all throughout.  Even outside school, our characters go on adventures together and have some really nice moments together.  The source material is still ongoing, but I would like to see some form of character development with Jirou.  Common anime tropes say it doesn\'t happen all that often, which gives me pause for any kind of sequel airing that I\'d find enjoyable.  (Story: 6/10, Characters: 7/10)Art: I gotta hand it to studio Mother, I really liked the animation style used here.  Sure, it looks flat at times, but the colours really pop out and keep to a decent quality throughout the entire series.  The use of shading wasn\'t top notch because there wasn\'t a ton of deep gradient work in some of the calmer scenes, but that didn\'t bother me nearly as much as I thought it would.  It looks great!  (8/10)Sound: The OST was about at a typical level here, as many romance series don\'t tend to have terribly impressive sound work associated with them.  The OP, True Fool Love by Liyuu was terrible though.  I had to skip it each time.  However, I really liked the second ED, Swallows by Nowlu.  I actually thought it was Aimer on the first listen.

(7/10)', ""I'm 3 episodes in, so take that into consideration. I started watching this after Gigguk's Fall anime recommendation. What brought mehere? A lewd Gyaru, sign me up. But after watching these three episodes I feel better about watching this anime. It's quite wholesome. Before mentioning what I think about the story, I think the art is really nice. It's unique and fresh, very colorful and poppy and takes liberties with the usual anime style that I found to be nice. It's very vibrant and saturated and bright so you know that this anime isn't going to touch the dark side. Music is nothing special...here, both the op and ed are skippable.So the gimmick here is that this school pairs a guy and a girl together to have them experience married life and are then graded on how adaptable they are to their partner. The issue here is that gyaru girl (Akari) likes the popular guy (Minami) and nerd guy (Yakuin) likes his cute childhood friend (Shiori). But those two, Minami and Shiori, are paired with each other thus making a soft-NTR vibe. Dw, this anime is wholesome so I don't think we're going to get to far into those vibes here, plus guess what? Shiori actually likes Yakuin too - who would've guessed? This issue gives me a lot of Koi no Uso and Kuzu no Honkai vibes, it's a girl and a guy who team up to help each other get the person they in love with while those two are paired with each other already. But the other half is that these two oddballs will learn and get comfortable with each other and end up liking each other even though they are polar opposites, a hot gyaru and a typical nerd. Should've expected it from the moment you read the blurb of this anime - it's typical but does make you wanna check on how these two get along.What I did like about this is that both characters are pretty competent. Yakuin is actually able to see Akari objectively and understand when she's feeling bad or scared or discouraged and tries to help. After episode one we see him already shaking off the dense MC traits a little and tries to get along with Akari. Akari is also the same - she tries to understand his dilemma with failing to ask Shiori out, and so I feel that this anime has potential to be enjoyable instead of being a dumb generic romance. Of course, I don't think this is an amazing romance anime like Golden Time or Toradora, but it had me rooting for the couple and enjoying when they got closer. So far, I'm okay with giving this anime a 7/10 for being good, comedic, meta, and enjoyable; with fanservice - if that's not your taste, then maybe avoid this since Akari is a gyaru and they animate her with that stereotype pretty hard, but her personality subverts that (which kinda is a stereotype in it's own way too).

The highs (Akari) in this show are some of my favourites out of any romance anime I can think of, but the lows (Shiori) are so infuriating that I was just left saddened and incredibly frustrated towards the end. I will never understand how in so many shows like this there is a clear, I would argue objective, worse character that for some baffling reason seems to get the main focus at the end. By worse I mean in every logical aspect, from entertainment...value (of which she had 0, negative even) to chemistry and interactions with the main character (all of which was painfully dull and an absolute chore to watch) to general placement within the story (she had 0 reason to be as prominent as she was).The main romantic conflict of this show could still have been as pivotal as it was if Shiori was entirely removed from this show thanks to Minami, I cannot think of a single reason Jirou was even still interested in her after meeting Akari. This isn\'t anything to do with ""well I, the viewer, like Akari more blah blah"" it is entirely to do with HOW JIROU\'S FEELINGS WERE PORTRAYED throughout the show.

Viewers may want to live vicariously in a fantasy world with monsters, dragons and medieval architecture, to experience the thrills of adventure.

But this anime will likely leave viewers questioning what, if any, benefits are received by watching it.This is because the show\'s premise of pitting a ""false-lover"" with a childhood friend is a premise which is hard upon the viewer.

The end result is a very unsatisfying plot with an equally unsatisfying ending which offers no resolution or substance whatsoever.Yet romantic snippets somewhat redeem this: the show does not shy away from its visceral depictions of kisses or the shades of crimson upon the characters\' cheeks.

Wouldn't say it was a waste of time but wouldn't rewatch it again.I think if you are very critical of romance anime this one isn't for you as the plot doesn't have much depth but if you are looking for an anime with some romance than it may be more to your liking.

Most of the time, in these anime, the outcome in some form isn\'t in question, but the story is in how they get there.This anime ticks...all the boxes for high quality except for one.  It\'s got good art, decent music, an interesting plot, good pacing...  everything about it makes for a decent anime.  Of course, the parents aren\'t really anywhere in the picture, but that\'s to be expected for an anime rom com (I actually hate this about anime, but it is what it is), especially because the plot kind of demands their lack of involvement.No, the one criticism I have about this anime - and it\'s a honking *huge* one - is that the plot is not only unrealistic, it\'s pretty darn near impossible.This plot follows a boy and a girl who know nothing about each other.

I\'ll just laugh.', 'so in the end the fmc ends up choosing the mc cause the hot guy dumped her? sounds like she settled for the mc when she couldnt get who she ACTUALLY WANTED thoughfrom the beginning it was about them having different love interests but throughout the story the ""hot guy"" that the FMC is in love with is just rejecting her while she\'s still chasing after him while the childhood friend we know likes the MC back.It just is a weird dynamic to me that the FMC shows signs of loving both the MC and the ""hot guy"" throughout the show. does she like them...both ? i dont understand.And near the end she says she still has feelings for the ""hot guy"" and ends up getting rejected so she decides it would now be best to finally pursue the MC.

I went into it blind with not much expectations and I got exactly that. Typical boys meet girl moment, hate each others guts, finds out that they’re partners in crime and they each have their own person of interest = you know where this is going.Not much to expect otherwise, though I do appreciate how much of a go getter the main girl is, along with the synergy between fMC and MC and how surprisingly assertive the rival is....The missed opportunity is the drama that could’ve unfolded and been explored should opportunities not be taken for granted and a certain girl becomes much more aggressive. But no…It’s practically a cliche love dispute full of stalemates and not a whole lot happening. It’s pretty disappointing tbh. If only she realized too late and gets desperate or figured it out herself right off the bat, then things would’ve really heated up. Instead we get the daily lives of a bunch of young and dumb teens being picky and indecisive about everything. It’s even more dejecting when one of them does a full 180 after things don’t work out and despite all the prior flags; even worse, the ball finally gets rolling…only for the anime to end immediately after. Like, bruh.In the end, the biggest and best thing about this anime isn’t the female MC nor the rival nor the MC himself nor the plot.It’s the MC’s CHAD FRIEND.Think  Motoyama-kun from Tsurezure Children. That one “forever single” friend who gives out CHAD love advices and has your back no matter how much they want to kill you for being the dense MC that you are. Yes, them. We all need someone like that in our lives and thank god this anime has a version of them cause the stalemate is as cheesy, cliche and disappointing as it can get.It’s otherwise a fun watch but don’t expect too much here. If you want more then go read the manga or keep looking. I’ve had my share of cheesy stalemates, love triangles, etc so I don’t think I’ll be keeping up with the manga or future adaptations.Regardless, hope you enjoy if you decide to give the anime a watch.

Cuz if you are then this is the anime for you!The whole plot hinges around this whole ""marriage practical"" assignment that these teens are given, well, it doesn\'t take a genius to figure out how that\'d go in real life, and it would not be family friendly (or sadly, romantic...), the whole circumstance around the base plot of the show is shaky at best, but lets suspend disbelief.On top of that, the whole love triangle does not really work, usually these sorts of love triangles play up the whole ""circumstantial"" REALLY HARD cuz that\'s the only...way to have a viewer suspend their disbelief, the two main characters do have some chemistry early on, even if their chemistry isn\'t the romantic kind i could not help but laugh at some of the jokes (and this means a lot coming from someone who does not really enjoy the whole teasing gyaru genre), but oh well, lets suspend disbelief and roll with the possibility that maybe the MC does NOT instantly report the female MC for being a jackass day 1.Well, the other side of the triangle is looking bleak too, the main romantic interest is the most cookie cutter female you can write for a japanese anime ever, good at cooking, looks cute but not ""sexy"", is shy but strong willed, but not when it comes to love ofc, she\'s a total fish out of water then, on top of that she has a semi-mysterious back story that gets called into the frame when needed, yeah she is as basic as it gets, and yet our protag acts like a goofball who does not understand she\'s in love!!!! But suspend that disbelief too if you will.The side characters have their moments but are actually the most normal people in the cast, when the writers wanna inject a touch of real life into the plot they use those, no need to suspend anything on this department.Okay, i have shit on this anime a lot, but the art? Amazing, like, actually good, i had a total blast looking at it, everything was vibrant, stuff feels alive, it almost looks like the same person drew everything, it was positively impressive, i did not notice any animation goofs and that\'s really good! great job....... but.... well...the erotic undertone... lets be real here, this does not feel like a normal seinen anime, it realy does feel a bit like a goofy ecchi shonen here and there, and look, i know that gyaru and all that, and her sexuality is explored more so to make her grow as a person, and that\'s super cool and i love it, but man, you could achieve the same level and impact on character development with half the boob shots, heck, a quarter... I do feel that the unfortunate design of Akari betrayed what could have been, the plot suffered from her tits being the jokes 1/5 times and her sexy looks another 1/5When it comes to the romance... i have seen better, heck, i have DONE better, the concept is so good, but between all the suspension of disbelief and the lack of development of that very plot (due to it being basically impossible to write for) it kinda betrayed itself. Teared up here and there, nothing major, I really hoped for more motive and feeling to be extracted from the gyaru that feels she really is not ""all that"", oh and the end? Shit, abolsute garbage, the setup for the end and the metaphorical meaning in it is exquisite, the end itself? DOG WATER6/10 - i will watch season 2 but only cuz i see so much damn potential on the Akari, that\'s it, MC = funny bad, Love interest = mehI do recommend it tho, this anime is a masterclass on how to avoid a near- hit way to have a viewer suspend their disbelief, the two main characters do have some chemistry early on, even if their chemistry isn\'t the romantic kind i could not help but laugh at some of the jokes (and this means a lot coming from someone who does not really enjoy the whole teasing gyaru genre), but oh well, lets suspend disbelief and roll with the possibility that maybe the MC does NOT instantly report the female MC for being a jackass day 1.Well, the other side of the triangle is looking bleak too, the main romantic interest is the most cookie cutter female you can write for a japanese anime ever, good at cooking, looks cute but not ""sexy"", is shy but strong willed, but not when it comes to love ofc, she\'s a total fish out of water then, on top of that she has a semi-mysterious back story that gets called into the frame when needed, yeah she is as basic as it gets, and yet our protag acts like a goofball who does not understand she\'s in love!!!!

If you don't like fan service/Ecchi, and cliche stuff this is not your show. If you are looking for the typical rom-com with fan service and good characters this is your show.Spoilers begin now!!Grading scale from @Mcsuper.Story 12/25The plot is cliche but with a bizarre twist related to the marriage practical thing. Overall, the story is quite predictable and honestly, it all comes down to the characters not being honest with themselves and not being brave enough to confess their feelings which is very typical for a rom-com. The most interesting...part of the plot is Akari's story because she actually gets conflicted about her true feelings now that she has to live with someone (Jiro) while still in love with Tenjin. The love triangle is entertaining and you can even feel uncertain about with whom Jiro is going to end.Art 8/10The art is probably the strongest point of the show. The animation is great in most chapters, there are just a couple that is poorly animated. The character design is really cool, they did a great job in portraying Akari's and Shiori's personalities in their design.Music 8/10The music is also good, I loved the ending theme and the OST does a good job as well.Characters: 15/20The main character Jiro is pretty annoying since he is a coward and he has almost no character development during the whole season. The other two girls have to take the initiative all the time and he can never take a single decision by himself. He does some stuff he would never have done at the beginning of the show but still, he lacked more development. The two other protagonists, Akari and Shiori, did have better development over the chapters and I like them a lot. Akari had a journey to understand her own feelings, she takes the initiative with her love interests a lot and has a great personality. Shiori does the same as well although she does a lot of nonsense things such as kissing Jiro twice and not even confessing her feeling to him. Like, how is easier to kiss someone twice than tell him you like him? The other characters are just fine, some of them are funny like Kamo but they are not relevant to the plot and they did a great at not giving them unnecessary screen time.Enjoyment 13/15Even though I had to stop the chapters several times because of the number of cheese scenes and especially cringe scenes I really enjoy watching this show XD. All the characters except Jiro are very charming.Thematic Execution 15/20They did a good job with the marriage theme and the typical love triangle between a childhood friend and the pretty girl is on point. I would've liked to see a deeper plot on how conflicts may arise between two people living in the same house but they seem to have everything under control.Final Score: 71/100 part of the plot is Akari's story because she actually gets conflicted about her true feelings now that she has to live with someone (Jiro) while still in love with Tenjin.

Has some unique elements thrown in it that are at the back bone of the story, but it's an anime, just go with it. It might have a bit of a problem at the beginning because it follows for a few episodes the same pattern, feeling like there is not much progress made, but imo it's better this...way. You can clearly see the relations being created and deepen. It doesn't feel rushed imo at all. But you still have quite some progress, which it is not that common as these types of anime try to drag on... especially when you have this kind of MC that gets flustered when talking with girls, but he's not 100% that kind of character type at least, which makes this story special. Also, I liked certain aspects that are protraited pretty mature, but that more towards the end. You still have quite a lot of the teenager jokes of staring at bewbs in an excessive manner, that gets repeated to an annoyingly level, at least for me it was, making fun of the MC cuz he is a virgin... idk man, it gets old once you keep hearing it over and over, but I got past these moments in the anime and just didn't give them much thought anymore.When it comes to characters, you have a few of them. This isn't a harem show, so there's that, thank God... The male MC is an otaku, flustered when talking with girls and stuff, you know, but he still has his moments where he mans up and does the right thing. You can clearly see the more you watch, the more he starts to stop being an extreme wimp. The female MCs are totally different. You have the gyaru, that is pretty much the main female MC, as she gets a lot of screen time and we get to see more of her than the other. She is the aggressive type, and super hyped and optimistic. She grows quite a lot during this anime, and it is portraited really well. The other female MC... well... childhood friend... we all know what that means... kinda feel bad for her, the author/anime kinda works against her at 120%, feels like the whole Universe is against her, which is kinda sad. She's also very poorly portraited imo, like they want to make the viewer not give her a chance at all cuz you just see her in a pretty bad light, especially compared to the other one.The art tho really goes very well with this type of story. Actually unique art. And the ending... one of my favourite endings. I usually skip the endings and such, but I think i listenend to the ending for like 7 episodes, which almost never happens to me.Story: 8 -- Has its good moments, but also a few cringe/bad ones. Misunderstandings are too strong sometimes...Art: 9 -- Very cool art. Loved the vibe.Music: 9 --The ending is a banger, especially with the animation. The OP on the other hand... meh.Characters: 8 -- Good characters overall, but the bias for some is strong... especially in this type of story.Enjoyment: 8 --I had a fun time watching, smiled quite a lot, but couldn't really watch a lot of episodes in one go, either cuz of rl stuff or just couldn't.Overall: 8Right now it has 7.59 from 165.345 votes Ranked #1528 Popularity #775 Members 310,911 as of 08/06/2024.I recommend this show to people that want to watch a romance type of story that makes progress, isn't rushed, has some really sweet moments, is pretty unique imo in its own way and is an easy watch. way.

The animation was pretty good, I LOVED the artstyle and the coloring. Everything looks so bright and colorful. The music was pretty good as well, but I don\'t really dig the opening tho. Aight, that\'s all the good things I can say about the anime, now off to my critics.First off, the main plot is already pretty dumb, the whole couple practical course thing was already incredibly stupid. But I thought if I ignore the plot, I\'d enjoy the romance but it was still pretty mediocre too. There was almost no real progression towards the romance,...Akari\'s starting to develop feelings for him ever since episode 1 when she was supposed to be interested in someone else at that time. Imo this is just a worst version of Toradora. The dialogue too, holy hell they\'re a mess. Always the \'it\'s nothing\', ""just joking/kidding"" after confessing something. Btw why in the actual fk does anyone ignore the fact that she wears extremely revealing clothes in school?? There are so many things that was illogical imo. Did they forgot that there is a camera in the living room? So when they were doing some sus shit didn\'t they feel weird that they\'re being watched? The fanservice too, god most of them felt unnecessary and uncomfortable to watch. There are much more things but I don\'t wanna make a whole essay for that.Anyway, I gave it a chance and I tried to like this anime but it fails to do so.

If not the bad things I mentioned below this show could easily be a 10 in my books. But before discussing the negatives, lets start what's good about this show.The concept is unique & pretty thought out. This, like many other animes, clearly reflect the Japanese society & the issues it is facing. Its not only Japanese society but many other societies are facing similar issues and this quirky concept can be a way...through..Keeping the philosophical aspect aside, the story was fun with deep hidden meaning. The character design was quite good & character development in the story was pretty good as well (though not the best).That being said the background art was just iffy.

The show was quite good in sound department in English dubbed version even the VAs have done a good job for most part (except the Shiori's voice which felt very unnatural & irritating to a point). These two things reduced 1 point from the score.The other thing that disappointed me was the pacing of the latter half of the show. It was a decently paced show in beginning but then it was a roller coaster ride. Some episodes felt like slow as hell & others were quite fast. Moreover the direction the show took in latter half was also wierd to the point of affecting the experience of the show. As for the last episode, it was just a mess. They tried to stuff way too much with little to no direction as to how they want the show to conclude for this season at the very least.This along with other minor issues reduced the score by another 1 point.That being said, I still recommend the show as its a good story overall. through..Keeping the philosophical aspect aside, the story was fun with deep hidden meaning.

One of the few love-triangle anime series without toxic characters.  In fact, they are all pretty decent and reasonable.Ok, the story has some cliche stuff on it, but I guess it\'s expected and not completely generic. I started watching it at the beginning of the season just as a distraction while I did my cardio, but ended up truly caring about the story. As I said before, the characters are actually very good and I think that\'s what got me into the series in the first place.Jiro, the mc, is a shy nerd but can take some action when...necessary and the same goes for Shiori, his childhood friend, who despite being shy and a little naive, can at least show her feelings. Akari, our pink-haired Cher Horowitz, is super charismatic and it is lovely to see her being insecure underneath her ""cool"" attitude. You really can relate to all of them.Also, it isn\'t one of those anime in which you need 76 episodes until something really happens between the characters. Besides that, I really liked to see how they all have interesting feelings and thoughts.At this point you probably have realized there\'s ecchi on it, right? Some scenes are... well, unnecessary to say the least, but I have seen waaaaaaaay worse ecchi in other series there weren\'t even supposed to be a romance. The ecchi makes sense here, specially because there are not many completely unreal situations. They are teenagers, teenagers are horny etc. etc.Is it gonna change your life? No, but it\'s denifinitely fun to watch,  which is probably the reason why we watch this kind of story anyway. necessary and the same goes for Shiori, his childhood friend, who despite being shy and a little naive, can at least show her feelings.

While the characters aren't the most original concept, they were doing well in their roles. However, I can't help but FEEL like the last 4 episodes just forced the viewer to recognize Shiori as a viable love interest for Jiro, especially after they bombarded us with so many Akari x Jiro moments.I say that Shiori is a sudden insertion of a third wheel...because, unlike Minami, she was suddenly thrown into the light around the last 4 episodes. Up until the tragic kissing scene in the clinic shared between her and Jiro, Shiori was legitimately treated as a side character. Much like Minami, she had short moments in the anime that didn't involve significant moments with Jiro that would hint at a development between the both.

Almost as if love and lies, nisekoi, and gal girlfriend. The ""you\'re stuck with girl A but you want girl B and girl A wants guy B but then slowly wants you, guy A, as does girl B"" premise, the oblivious MC, the ""main girl seems like a slut but is secretly a kissless virgin like MC"" bit, the ""weirdly oblivious MC who can\'t tell how bad like 10000 different girls want him"" bit. It seems like a recipe for...mediocrity, but somehow it\'s not half-bad. Its a well-paced, well-written show with exciting drama, and funny, likable characters. As the audience, many of his actions are utterly ridiculous because we can see the full picture, but the MC is an insecure loser, and his thought process is believable. No one is annoyingly oblivious, it\'s just no one has it in them to confess their feelings, or ask the other person what their feelings are because they\'re all terrified of rejection. Overall its a good show and will have you on the edge of your seat wondering who will break first and confess mediocrity, but somehow it\'s not half-bad.

As usual, MAL front page reviews are overly pessimistic and they come having watched a good 2-3 episodes. I\'ll be real with you though, if you aren\'t in the romance mood, ur not gonna like this one. The plot is definitely stupid, students must practice being a married couple for an assignment and are graded on their compatibility via a camera in their room, if you don\'t make attempts to get along with ur partner, you won\'t gain points. The top 10 pairings at the...end of each month get to switch among themselves if they choose to do so. I personally think the show is a 7.5-8 straight down the middle in honesty but I really enjoyed the show so I will give it a 9/10. The fanservice is a little excessive but the character designs and color scheme is really nice and I\'m not sure if I have seen an anime with more vibrant colors outside of your name. The MC can be annoying depending on your interpretation of annoying but he isn\'t kazuya (rent a girlfriend) level annoying and I actually think that he is a pretty decent MC. His best friend is hella annoying so that isn\'t great but he doesn\'t get too much screen time luckily. As for the female protagonist Akari, she starts out kinda typical romance MC but her character progression is fun to watch, also she\'s overly seductive at times and you don\'t wanna watch the show in front of family. Other than that, I think that even if you aren\'t in a romance kinda mood, the humor is serviceable enough to be a fun watch and you should grow to like the series and if you want a romance, this is a great one and the best of the fall 2022 season without a doubt. I personally loved it and it gets a 9/10 from me, will have to read manga and/or watch upcoming seasons to see if it can hit the 10. I don\'t wanna overhype shows by giving 10\'s in the first season and ""more than a married couple, but not lovers"" isn\'t  necessarily on the same caliber as other 9\'s or 10\'s I have given in the past but it was simply super enjoyable as an avid romance fan.

This show opens with typical geek protagonist Jiro being paired with obnoxious gyaru Akari for their school's Marriage Practical, a course that requires students to live like married couples, where they're graded on how well they get along. This proves difficult for Jiro because Akari treats him like trash. I wavered on the edge of dropping it after the first episode because Akari was so insufferable, but I'm glad I stuck with it.Akari, as you can probably tell from her hairstyle, is a...tsundere. I've never seen one that deres so hard, so fast, and never goes back. By episode 3, Akari goes from insufferable to adorable. The conflict for the rest of the series is less about Jiro and Akari getting along, and more about the love polygon that the two of them become entangled in. To my surprise it quickly becomes one of the better romance shows of the year. Even its premise isn't that weird when you think of it in the context of a culture where arranged marriage used to be the norm. Why wouldn't you teach teenagers how to live with a complete stranger?The main thing holding it back is a tonal issue. I'm all for fan service, but considering the innocence of the characters fumbling their way through their feelings, the show's approach to fan service can be jarringly sleazy in places. It's the kind of ecchi tone that you would expect a lesser series to take when it has nothing to offer in the story department, but this show not only doesn't need that crutch, it detracts from the strengths of its romantic drama. It ends up sitting in this awkward middle ground where it's either an unusually good ecchi show or an unusually ecchi drama.The show covers a decent amount of ground in its 12 episodes, but as per usual don't expect a real ending from an adaptation of an ongoing manga. tsundere.

It\'s kind of bland to watched it in the early episodes because the Male Lead and the Female lead is in their simp mode, but if you watched it the middle to the last the story became more watchable and the comedy is kind of fun too, plus the characters development is a very decent a proper story telling for both MC.

The story is very tender and has heartwarming parts; the characters are very well written. I don't think it's the best anime in the world, it has parts that are a bit silly, but they're not annoying. It also has some funny moments. The protagonist is by far the one who feels the best written, you can understand why he thinks that way, why he feels that way and why he makes those decisions. Even people who are bothered by ecchi should give this anime a...chance, in Summary, it was a nice experience. chance, in Summary, it was a nice experience."", ""A No Nut Marriage.More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers is more than your average love triangle rom-com, but kinda fucked up when you start to think about it.The show is about an insecure, gamer nerd begrudgingly getting paired up with a busty, pink-haired gyaru for their schools incredibly weird, invasive, creepy, dystopian, ethically questionable marriage training program where the selected couples are forced to live together in a small apartment, and seemly doesn’t take into account whether or not a student is gay or whether or not a student wants to ever get married, etc.Of course, nerd boy Jirou is...crushing on his childhood friend Shiori and gyaru Akari is crushing on the most popular-est guy in school Tenjin who also happen to be paired up together to Jirou’s and Akari’s dismay. Thus they have to work together to get good at pretend marriage and earn a high marriage score(?) so they can win the privilege to swap partners of their choosing.Now at first glance, you might think “Gosh, this is a worse version of Toradora”, but when you view the show from a psychological perspective rather than a rom-com, its premise becomes secretly genius(?).As an introverted, gamer nerd with only one, sad friend who spends all of his money on gotta waifus and cracking bad jokes, Jirou is not good at picking up social cues, especially from women, no matter how hard they shove their large breasts against his chest. Now in a normal harem rom-com where the nerd is having women thrusting themselves upon him at nearly every moment at nearly every angle, it gets incredibly frustrating to watch a dense protagonist not taking very obvious hints and acting upon them to keep the status quo. However, in Jirou’s case, he’s in a fake marriage program that presumably goes towards his academic score, in love with someone else and with someone he knows who has a crush on another guy. When you think about how psychologically damaging this marriage program could potentially be (not to mention the legal hell the school would go through if something happened to the students because of it) his indecisiveness towards Akari’s and Shiori’s advances is genuinely understandable, especially when Akari teases him or adopts a loving waifu persona for the observation cameras(?) in their apartment. It’s very obvious to the viewer that Akari starts to crush on Jirou after like, the first episode, but to him, it’s probably a mind fuck.This means that Jirou and Akari have to genuinely sit down and talk to/get to know each other properly. Misunderstandings are talked through and sorted out instead of being dragged on so it’s very understandable why the two of them would start catching feelings for the other. Despite how the rom-com story looks there’s a lot of forward momentum in its plot (and ‘plot’) between Akari, Jirou and Shiori and I came to like them as characters. The side cast is rather meh though.The art and animation are quite simple looking. I do like the garish colour pallet, but after a while, you start to realise that the simple-looking backgrounds are there to blend in the characters so you’re distracted from bare-bones they're animated (unless anime titties are involved - obviously).Overall, this show is one of my favourite states of being, incredibly horny. No one is a bigger winner at no-nut-November this year than Jirou who is a much, much stronger man than I when comes to the amount of Akari and to some extent Shiori he has to endure. If you like your horny, psychological, Big-Brother-esque social experiments disguised as a rom-com then you’ll probably enjoy this.7/10 Good. crushing on his childhood friend Shiori and gyaru Akari is crushing on the most popular-est guy in school Tenjin who also happen to be paired up together to Jirou’s and Akari’s dismay.

Yet, it deftly sidesteps and reverts to its true core—character development, love, and its expression.It's like a diluted version of Rent a Girlfriend. If you reveled in that anime's narrative, this one will find a cozy spot in your preferences.While not as wholesomely crafted as it could be, it also doesn't plummet into the abyss of terrible. Hence, my mixed sentiments!Among the rom-com offerings this...season, it stands out as one of the better choices. I can confidently say I'm content with the time invested in watching this one. season, it stands out as one of the better choices.

Although the plot is moved along through misunderstandings, ""lucky accidents"", and small confessions it doesn\'t make it feel poorly scripted (these plot devices are also pretty...standard in other romance anime).Possible CONS:- ends without choosing girl (although doesn\'t feel unresolved)- lack of interesting side characters- slightly slower pacedPossible PROS:- bright happy art style (this is personal preference)- not completely stupid MC- jiggle physics/fanservice (could be bad if others are nearby)- not a choose all of the girls harem anime (although those aren\'t bad either)My opinion: PositiveOverall I liked this anime because it was fun, it never got too caught up in ""romance slumps"" and had me siding with one of the love interests from the first episode.Other anime similar:Cohabitation romance:- nisekoi (harem + cohab + school)Marriage/close main couple situation:- tonikawa: over the moon for you(married + cohab)- horimiya (school + slice of life + vanilla romance)- rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai (supernatiural events + romance) standard in other romance anime).Possible CONS:- ends without choosing girl (although doesn\'t feel unresolved)- lack of interesting side characters- slightly slower pacedPossible PROS:- bright happy art style (this is personal preference)- not completely stupid MC- jiggle physics/fanservice (could be bad if others are nearby)- not a choose all of the girls harem anime (although those aren\'t bad either)My opinion: PositiveOverall I liked this anime because it was fun, it never got too caught up in ""romance slumps"" and had me siding with one of the love interests from the first episode.Other anime similar:Cohabitation romance:- nisekoi (harem + cohab + school)Marriage/close main couple situation:- tonikawa: over the moon for you(married + cohab)- horimiya (school + slice of life + vanilla romance)- rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai (supernatiural events + romance)', 'Another stereotypical, formulaic, largely unoriginal and predictable rom-com and male fantasy type show where not one but two unrealistically cute young ladies fall for or even fight for the protagonist who lacks personality a little. The romance is developed in a more compelling manner than average, and the predictability as far as the conclusion goes could\'ve been avoided more if the thumbnails and character designs hadn\'t made it painfully clear that Akari is the ""main character"" and therefore the suggested real love interest.For once, the childhood crush wasn\'t chosen, and whilst that was frustrating to watch for a reason or two that I\'ll mention, as...a story, it was pretty cute how Jiro and Akari spent all that time together and their romance was really developed more than usual in shows like this.With that being said, let us not act as if the premise makes any sense. While it\'s quite interesting to make teens live together as married couples - obviously a potent basis for a romance anime - it\'s not like it\'s realistic. The rest of the lifestyle in Japan seems to be presented as exactly the same as in reality in this show, and so the idea that a high school would implement these pushy regulations, force heterosexual couples to do this and whatnot is totally out of the question. The idea is literally to do cutesy or even advanced stuff such as kissing and sex in order to get points, and the couples get to live all alone in a designated dorm for this purpose. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.Aside from that, my only big issue with the show (since I\'ve grown not to mind all the cliches of a show like this that I can still enjoy) is probably how unrealistically clueless the MC is, which kind of ruined the narrative. From early on, it is painfully obvious to everyone except the protagonist himself that Shiori likes him, and eventually Akari too. I think this writer seems to misunderstand. Being a kind of weird loser and a virgin (which he seems to make a recurring joke) doesn\'t make a person totally oblivious to the world around them, to people\'s feelings etc etc. There are absolutely no questions to be asked the way Jiro does, when a girl literally kisses you, the other girl invites you to dates in her free time, so on and so forth. He\'s just being unrealistically idiotic, to the point where the whole narrative doesn\'t work.In that, the show is sort of different to most - the ""crush"" obviously likes the MC from the very beginning. Since she is quite cute, the way the story pans out can be a little frustrating, but nevertheless it\'s the story that the writer intended to tell and that in itself doesn\'t make its quality worse. But when you combine it with the aforementioned issue, how ridiculous Jiro\'s thoughts and actions are even when all the signs are there, the whole storyline loses most of its charm. The show almost seems desperate to make Jiro oblivious enough in order to stretch his relationship with Akari out until they can get together.While he is not as bad as other protagonists at talking (to girls in particular), he is not great either, and that is always a little frustrating to watch for any reasonable adult. Please just communicate and make things clear, especially when you are that confused and anxious, instead of stretching out issues like this which just comes across as a little shallow from the perspective of good writing of compelling characters and stories. He even does it at times, which makes all the other times he didn\'t feel even worse - clearly, those you talked to last time didn\'t mind it, so you can talk again.Therefore I feel that most of the basic ideas that keep the show going and the plot progressing are largely nonsensical - the unbelievable premise with the married couples itself, and Jiro\'s unbelievable obliviousness.Ignoring that, then the content shown is not too bad. The romance, specifically with Akari, is cute and takes up most of the screen time. Her being made to fall for him was executed sort of believably, then her actions and the way she practically portrays her feelings and acts around him are compelling and probably more realistic than average. I do wonder about her quality as a character, although she sort of represents a certain type, she does evolve into much more than that and feels, overall, like a real enough person, that is also spicy enough to be at the forefront of a romance show.On the other side, the way Shiori acts towards Jiro is also pretty realistic for the type of person she is. Probably the best aspect of the show is how these two relatable yet different types of girls act in different ways believably around their crushes with the same goal. On the other hand, the dynamic between Jiro and Shiori falls a little more flat as a sort of stereotypical cutesy shy relationship between people that like each other. It\'s pretty vanilla and really by the book, aside from how hard Shiori tries which is cute and sort of unusual - making Jiro and the story even more disappointing for me. Considering those attempts it almost feels kinda forced that they don\'t just end up together, as mentioned.The two characters are probably not that complex, since almost everything that defines them inside the show is their feelings for Jiro and Tenjin, and of course their personalities. We don\'t know a whole lot about either Shiori or Akari, and of course it makes sense we don\'t see their families considering the premise, but for the purpose of characterization, we really don\'t know them aside from from the perspective of having a crush on Jiro (and the way their personality is shown extensively through that side of things). In that, they\'re a little flat, although still better than expected in a show like this - pretty realistic, with compelling actions that don\'t feel too robotic or scripted, rather, a believable integration of emotion within the reasonable mindset of a real teenager. More so than the usual rom-com, at least.Of course, they are a little stereotypical still and tools to execute this story through their love for the protagonist, and whilst I\'ve given them their props for being of slightly higher quality than the average love polygon girls, the content overall is pretty standard.Jiro doesn\'t have much else to be analyzed either aside from what\'s been said already. He has the whole gaming/virgin thing going on, but it\'s not really great characterization considering how much of an overdone gag that is in this show and how little depth it realistically gives him. The writer is trying to make it seem as though Jiro is just ""that kind of guy"" that would realistically misunderstand girls like that, and he\'s a gamer and whatnot, but as mentioned, it\'s just too much to the point it\'s nonsensical. So no points there. Although the reccurring ""Virgin-kun"" appelative was pretty funny.Kamo is obviously the funniest character by some distance and source of most of the writer\'s comedic attempts, I assume. The fourth wall breaks were decent, and whilst I didn\'t laugh out loud that much, he always got a good vibe going on. Obviously he has no value as any sort of original or deeper character with any meaning of representing any relevant human theme, just a shallow comedic tool.Tenjin is, well, stereotypically ""cool"" and always only blurting out calm and cliche lines, which is obviously his purpose but it\'s more in the realm of unrealistically robotic than anything.The conclusion is worth questioning, I thought it\'s pretty self-explanatory that Jiro chooses Akari after that date and not being able to confess to Shiori but then she gets brought back into it and doesn\'t lose the race to the shrine, insinuating that the fight for Jiro is still going. It\'s okay even as an open ending still of course but I wonder if that should be the way to go if there\'s not going to be a 2nd season.Forgot to mention - it seems the demographic is ""Seinen"", which is largely just misleading, in that this show is in no way more mature or too different in style to most shounen rom-coms I\'ve seen.Overall, it\'s impossible that I would give it more than an 8 based off the category alone. Practically no show is unpredictable in that regard, in fact I would say this goes quite by the book considering the main love polygon theme. The main reasons it gets a rating above the usual average 5-6 I give are its slightly more believable and different characters that also act in more compelling ways thus creating an overall decently cute romance. In turn, the main reasons it doesn\'t join the elites of its category are the ridiculousness of its premise and of its main character, whose obliviousness renders everyone\'s heartfelt actions towards him totally pointless and ruins the realism of the narrative too through how nonsensical it ends up being. a story, it was pretty cute how Jiro and Akari spent all that time together and their romance was really developed more than usual in shows like this.With that being said, let us not act as if the premise makes any sense.

I don\'t necessarily dislike the Anime, in fact I actually really enjoyed it to the point that I never missed an episode as it aired weekly. But, as is the case with an awful lot of Anime, the manga was superior. Much so in this case. But I enjoyed the Anime so much that it got me to pick up the manga and I am for the most part an Anime only type person.I actually...found the plot quite interesting despite it\'s strange premise. The story revolves around a new concept at a Japanese High School called ""the marriage practical"" were students are paired together as one boy and one girl to, as the name suggests, pretend to be married in an attempt to better prepare young people for marriage in the future. Our protagonist, Jiro Yakuin, is an introvert with feelings for his childhood friend, Shiori Sakurazaka, but lacks confidence and relationship experience. Jiro is paired up with Akari Watanabe, a gyaru girl with feelings for the super cool, Tenjin Minami. Jiro and Akari are conflicted with being paired together but quickly attempt to be the best married couple they can be owing to a rule that allows them to exchange partners if they perform well enough in the practical. Both decide to help each other get closer to their respective love interests. As you would expect, as the story progresses Akari and Jiro start developing feelings for each other with creates a conflict in their existing feelings for Shiori and Tenjin.I found the story to be genuinely sweet and I felt that Akari stole the show. Watching her come to terms with her feelings leads to some genuinely sweet moments. The chemistry that develops between the characters is also super enjoyable to watch. There is a lot of fanservice which can be frustrating depending on the situation. With Akari I felt it made sense given her character but in the scenes with Shiori I felt it unnecessary.Compared to the manga a lot of good content was cut out and the final episode even has a big chunk of original scenes to better serve as a  season finale rather than a faithful adaptation. The art was also very inconsistent and I do wish that the art was more consistent with the manga. I enjoyed the art style studio Mother was going for but there were times that the art looked sloppy. The only criticism I have towards the manga as opposed to the Anime is that the manga has much more intentional fan service which lead me to roll my eyes at times.I do recommend that you watch the Anime though but I strongly recommend that if you haven\'t already done so that you read the manga. I hope that we see More than a married couple return for a season 2. found the plot quite interesting despite it\'s strange premise.

Offering an easy on the eyes romantic comedy that ended up being the one show I watched immediately when it was available.  It's not a perfect series, but the budding relationships between our main characters was a joy to watch.  Akari is best grill of the year, fight me.  I loved every second of her teasing, half serious attempts at prodding romance out of Jirou, and vise-versa when Jirou would end up teasing Akari to the point of uncomfortability.  The fan-service is grade A stuff...and kept me hooked all season.  The cliffhanger at the end of the season will keep me eager to see the second season, and who will win the game of love, Akari or Shiori.Animation 8/10-  The colors are bright and inviting for a romance.  The fan-service is done really well, showing off Akari at her best.  Some characters are rather generic though.Sound 7/10-  The OP and ED are pretty good.  Akari VA is really good.  Shiori is a bland, so her VA conveys that kind of character, which is unfortunate.Story 6/10-  The story about marriage between 2 students as an assignment is a good premise, but by the end of the season, they are on summer break, so the story becomes a bit of a beach episode/slice of life anime, which isn't bad, but isn't focused.Characters 8/10-  The budding relationship between Jirou and Akari is addicting to watch.  Both being opposites, it's enticing to see how close they get despite their differences.  The side characters and their mock marriages are something I hope the anime delves into in season 2, as most all the characters are intertwined in each other, either as friends or mock spouses, whilst having crushes on others around them.  Shiori isn't a bad character, but if I had my choice between Akari and Shiori, there really is no competition, it's Akari all day, and twice on Sunday.Enjoyment 9/10-  As mentioned before, it was the one show I absolutely had to watch the moment it was out.  It's not a jaw dropping series, but it was my trash taste of the week.Overall, Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman is a very easy to digest series, that resembles the feelings I would get when watching dating shows from the early 2000's.  Enjoyable to dive into once a week, always leaving you wanting more.  Season 2 can't come fast enough.  I'd recommend this to anyone who's easy to please with their anime tastes, who enjoys romance anime. and kept me hooked all season.

If you\'re ok with that and enjoy love triangle stories, then this will work for you.STORYThe story follows essentially two ""married"" couples where the main couple\'s members are in love with the members of the other couple. The main couple are an otaku and a popular girl, Jirou and Akari and the other couple are Shiori(Jirou\'s childhood friend and crush) and Tenjin, the guy Akari has a crush on. The married course the characters...are required to take part in is not very well explained. There\'s a quick guide to how it works and then you\'re just thrown into the love triangle shenanigans for the rest of the show. At first I thought it would be some month long because how could it go on for longer than that, but at some point near the end it\'s revealed that this entire show has been taking place over a period of 4 months and will continue after summer break I guess. That\'s pretty insane and you constantly have to suspend your disbelief over this entire premise.ARTThe art for the show is very vibrant and colorful and generally looks good throughout the entire production.CHARACTERSThe characters are all fairly recognizable archetypes and generally don\'t gets tons of development. Jirou is the typical otaku character who is unsure of himself, second guesses his own feelings and all the signals he gets from the girls, and is generally an idiot most of the time. Akari is the popular girl who thinks she\'s too good for Jirou at the onset, likes to wear revealing clothes and acts like she\'s experienced in love, but in reality she\'s putting on a front and is actually hesitant about love. Their relationship is about 90% of the show and it\'s hard to root for them. Akari acts like she wants nothing to do with Jirou and actively insults him, but then actively teases him sexually even though her goal is to get with the other guy. It doesn\'t make any sense. Of course, over time, they develop confused feelings for each other. Shiori and Tenjin are given far less development with Tenjin getting the least amount of anyone. Shiori and Jirou of course are childhood friends who secretly love each other, but both don\'t think the other does, are worried about confessing to the other and it drags on for the entire show.FINAL:Overall, I have very mixed feelings about the show in general. Some of the comedy works well and mostly comes from side characters or ecchi situations, so YMMV on those. But the progression of the characters and their relationships are somewhat frustrating. Akari and Jirou do not work very well as a couple at all. He\'s nice to her, so I get why she\'d develop feelings for him over time, and he\'s certainly attracted to her, so it makes sense that he\'d develop some for her, but the constant teasing and takebacks from Akari of any true emotional connections they make; get really frustrating. He\'s constantly questioning her motives and openly acknowledges and gets mad at her about them, but then she\'ll make some manipulative comment to excuse it and he always relents and lets it go. It\'s annoying as she\'s essentially gaslighting him constantly, but he just lets it happen, continues to be a spineless idiot and lets her walk all over him. It\'s weird because the gaslighting isn\'t played as purposely manipulative or malevolent, it\'s just something she keeps doing for no reason apart from the writer forcing the love triangle to happen. It feels like the writer really wants you follow their relationship as the one that is meant to be, but their relationship and how they interact constantly makes me wonder how they ever could. It\'s not built on a good foundation and they just don\'t really have much of a connection apart from his attraction to her body and him being nice. Things do develop more seriously between Jirou and the two girls, so he ultimately has to sort of choose between them, but it never gets there. He remains somewhat oblivious to everything as I guess they want you to grab the next dozen or so volumes of the source material.In the end, I give it a 6 due to some fun stuff here and there and the art. are required to take part in is not very well explained. There\'s a quick guide to how it works and then you\'re just thrown into the love triangle shenanigans for the rest of the show. At first I thought it would be some month long because how could it go on for longer than that, but at some point near the end it\'s revealed that this entire show has been taking place over a period of 4 months and will continue after summer break I guess. That\'s pretty insane and you constantly have to suspend your disbelief over this entire premise.ARTThe art for the show is very vibrant and colorful and generally looks good throughout the entire production.CHARACTERSThe characters are all fairly recognizable archetypes and generally don\'t gets tons of development. Jirou is the typical otaku character who is unsure of himself, second guesses his own feelings and all the signals he gets from the girls, and is generally an idiot most of the time. Akari is the popular girl who thinks she\'s too good for Jirou at the onset, likes to wear revealing clothes and acts like she\'s experienced in love, but in reality she\'s putting on a front and is actually hesitant about love. Their relationship is about 90% of the show and it\'s hard to root for them. Akari acts like she wants nothing to do with Jirou and actively insults him, but then actively teases him sexually even though her goal is to get with the other guy. It doesn\'t make any sense. Of course, over time, they develop confused feelings for each other. Shiori and Tenjin are given far less development with Tenjin getting the least amount of anyone. Shiori and Jirou of course are childhood friends who secretly love each other, but both don\'t think the other does, are worried about confessing to the other and it drags on for the entire show.FINAL:Overall, I have very mixed feelings about the show in general. Some of the comedy works well and mostly comes from side characters or ecchi situations, so YMMV on those. But the progression of the characters and their relationships are somewhat frustrating. Akari and Jirou do not work very well as a couple at all. He\'s nice to her, so I get why she\'d develop feelings for him over time, and he\'s certainly attracted to her, so it makes sense that he\'d develop some for her, but the constant teasing and takebacks from Akari of any true emotional connections they make; get really frustrating. He\'s constantly questioning her motives and openly acknowledges and gets mad at her about them, but then she\'ll make some manipulative comment to excuse it and he always relents and lets it go. It\'s annoying as she\'s essentially gaslighting him constantly, but he just lets it happen, continues to be a spineless idiot and lets her walk all over him. It\'s weird because the gaslighting isn\'t played as purposely manipulative or malevolent, it\'s just something she keeps doing for no reason apart from the writer forcing the love triangle to happen. It feels like the writer really wants you follow their relationship as the one that is meant to be, but their relationship and how they interact constantly makes me wonder how they ever could. It\'s not built on a good foundation and they just don\'t really have much of a connection apart from his attraction to her body and him being nice. Things do develop more seriously between Jirou and the two girls, so he ultimately has to sort of choose between them, but it never gets there. He remains somewhat oblivious to everything as I guess they want you to grab the next dozen or so volumes of the source material.In the end, I give it a 6 due to some fun stuff here and there and the art.', '""More than a Married Couple, but Not Lovers"" is a captivating drama that delves into the complexities of human relationships, specifically focusing on the unique dynamics between two individuals who share a deep connection beyond the confines of a traditional romantic partnership.

Anyways, my opinion on this is that the ending is so disappointing, shiori likes destroying the vibe, what more can i say? I highly doubt people like this anime because of that one character ong where the fuck is season 2 and i fucking need Akira and Jiro to be lovers like fuck you shiori for that kiss like dude, and the ending just ends in a cliffhanger, yes nothing happened instead just pray like i bet shiori is praying for akira to die so she can take jiro....The animation is good tho but still, Not recommended. The animation is good tho but still, Not recommended.', ""Im really torn on if I like this show or if it was just alright. The beginning of the show was mid but as time went on, and the characters/story developed it became way more enjoyable.There's one big thing that I don't like about this show. That being the sheer amount of sexual innuendos and sexual scenes in this anime was off putting. I'm not one to be attracted to animes whom have a lot of lewd scenes so this was on the verge of just being uncomfortable to watch. Especially after episode 9. That kitchen scene was scarring.The way the story was written...to slowly develop the relationship between Akari and Jiro and the relationship between Jiro and Shiori was executed very well. There was the whole Akari/Jiro, and Shiori/Minumi matchups where Akari and Jiro decided that they needed to get top 10 to switch partners because obviously Akari's true love interest was Minumi and same with Jiro and Shiori. As time in the practical went on, Akari and Jiro grew closer and Akari started to fall in love with Jiro. I think Jiro always had a little thing for Akari but he was so hellbent on Shiori that he never noticed until Akari started showing signs that she liked Jiro. The relationship between Jiro and both Akari and Shiori developed pretty similarly in speed. Towards the last few episodes, that's when the story really picked up pace and started throwing curve balls. In the final episode where Shiori and Akari raced to the temple is like a metaphor of them racing to Jiro's heart. It was definitely a bittersweet ending but it was the best way they could've ended it. to slowly develop the relationship between Akari and Jiro and the relationship between Jiro and Shiori was executed very well.

This anime is a weird one, i watched all the episodes straight so it is all clear in my memory;- Starting with the positive points;The female protagonist is charismatic (gal) and the male protagonist is an introverted and common person, this is a very common model for the script and works well in the development of the story, there are some truffles in the middle of the story that will definitely make you laugh,...and this positively breaks down some parts where the story would be boring;The design is kinda unique, the background look like some cartoon/comics stuff, and is very diferent from what we see normaly, the characters model is normal, the background is what calls the attention. This was very well managed in terms of takes, very uncommon for the actual patterns, the OP and ED is also very diferent (good in my opinion). To summarize, this one have good angles (the background and the musics make a signifcant diference!!);- Moving on to the parts that I didn\'t like at all, it focuses on the development of the narrative;Firstly, the situation in which the story unfolds seems very far from our reality (this is not an isekai, but for you to tolerate some things, you need to overlook some proposals from the script, such as ""why would a school/college have a subject for the daily life of couples"", this doesn\'t make sense and why have a f****** marker at the wall, counting all the actions you have as a couple), if you accept this suspension of belief, then you will have no problems seeing this;Secondly, the conflict that should move the narrative is a bit weak, the protagonist is left in a limbo where there seems to be no development in anyone\'s relationship, the same for the female protagonist, 2 months here seem to be 2 week, unless If you consider ""contact"" as development, And if there is any difference between the beginning and the end, it was probably not done in a way that contributed to the plot, but so far, it\'s not much different from generic stories that are normally produced;I wouldn\'t recommend watching this with people around, the fanservice is excessive, every episode has some ""provocative"" stuff, and the script uses this as a climax to make the development happen;Finally, whether you should watch this or not, I think you can give this one a shot, it\'s not every day that we come across an anime with such a different background design, and although the plot is weak as a whole, you\'ll hardly find points in that you\'ll be bored, a little annoyed perhaps, but just follow the three-episode rule and you\'ll find out if this is right for you.OR: 7/10 and this positively breaks down some parts where the story would be boring;The design is kinda unique, the background look like some cartoon/comics stuff, and is very diferent from what we see normaly, the characters model is normal, the background is what calls the attention.

This show had me binging it it was so good. It was really funny and light-hearted. It had an interesting plot with the main two MC’s liking other people at first but then falling for each other in the end. This show had the perfect amount of spice and it was just so enjoyable to watch. The only reason this show did not get a higher score is because it left us on a cliff-hanger of who the male MC is going to choose between, his childhood crush, or the popular girl he never expected to fall in...love with. I honestly hope the latter. Season 2 better come soon because I need to see how this show ends and I need a kiss. High spice love with. I honestly hope the latter. Season 2 better come soon because I need to see how this show ends and I need a kiss. High spice', 'A slice of life anime that will exceed one\'s expectation. Who knows .. it might even get you to tune in and ask for more.Here\'s to hoping for Season 2!I\'d say overall this anime is pretty good. A school where all students need to pass a preliminary course inorder to graduate. Graded by properly fulfilling the roles of pretend ""husband"" and ""wife"".Japan\'s work culture is a given, elite hard working individuals. At the same time innovative, so adding this course to their school system is plausible and the same time practical.

Verily in that are signs for those who reflect.” -The Holy Qur\'an, Surah Ar-Rum, Verse 21This romance anime in particular really feels like a breath of fresh air between all of them romance animes, especially the ones that somewhat featured gal characters, such as Hajimete no Gal or Kimizero, which were both ass, like, Kimizero legit featured ""a crunchy hoe"" and Hajimete no Gal\'s male MC was ""a faggot like Majnoun to...die for a pussy"", if you know what I mean.

The fact that it also somewhat tackles how human relations form makes it feel more natural, and thus stand out. How does it tackle how human relations form? Well, let\'s get started with the story then, shall we?So basically, there\'s this ""marriage practical"" thing that rolled out as a lesson in a school, and you ain\'t graduating for shit if you fail that lesson. For this lesson, a random boy and a girl gets ""matchmade"" i.e. they get chosen to live together as a couple and our male MC, Jirou Yakuin, wants to get paired with his childhood friend, Shiori Sakurazaka; and our female MC, the fucking bombshell Akari Watanabe, wants to pair with her crush, Minami Tenjin. Yet their fates are sealed in a different way. Jirou matches Akari, and Shiori matches Minami. Remember that quote from Surah Ar-Rum in the beginning? The one that goes like ""...He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them.""? Considering this, Shiori wasn\'t the one who Jirou could dwell in tranquility with, as she REALLY is inconsistent with her words.Take what she said to Jirou in the first episode for example. ""I feel nervous around other boys."" yeah bitch you were legit having the TENJIN TASTE OF DEEZ NUTS in your fucking mouth on your first day with Minami. I\'m telling you, this bitch be some Yui Kashii level skank.Well, our bombshell Akari on the other hand, is actually the innocent one, despite being the one who\'s more sexually-charged. She\'s seen to be a little clueless about love, as she can be seen talking about Minami as ""peak of humanity"" and blushing like hell around him; whereas with Jirou, she doesn\'t give a fuck about her appearance, she doesn\'t give a fuck about what he sees, she really doesn\'t give a fuck. ""What is this if this isn\'t love, huh?"" She doesn\'t know, and later realizes that this isn\'t love, but rather, some pointless infatuation. That\'s at least some positive on our side.Our boy Jirou ""can\'t walk because of [the weight of] his balls"", as they say. He can be seen kissing Akari on the lips on the first episode, which is some crazy development in this genre. This ain\'t something his friend, Sadaharu Kamo, can dare.Like, he be so down bad that he be working part-time on summer for some rolls on a fucking gacha game, him playing gacha games is one thing, but him working for that?

Unfortunately, you wont even know how much of a waste of time it is until the last episode, so I just feel obligated to warn people despite usually not liking to write spoilers.You'd think people put into something as drastic as pretend marriages and co-habitation as part of their education system should learn something from it and eventually stop being completely awkward, introverted and uncommunicative with members of the opposite sex, or at least with their specific partners, or their crush for whom they claimed to be putting their effort in this wacko system. But this here mofo has a special...surprise for you. He'll keep giving you false hope, of course, to keep you watching throughout the season. Then in the last episode he'll hit you with the realization that he's still denser than any other romcom protagonist, ending completely the same as he were in the first episode, and all the episodes from before were completely wasted on him.I want my money back. I want my time back. I want my emotions (mainly anger right now) back.It's a real shame, cos some other aspects of the show were somewhat good. Unlike the MC, the FMC showed growth and character, for example. The artstyle of the show was nice, with some print-like moire patterns instead of true gradients. The artstyle of the ending credits was completely different and very cute. The music was good. The whole show could've been good if not for the retard MC, or even just with a different last episode.It also has some other negative aspects, more forgivable than my main pet peeve above.For one, the unique and supposedly central plot element of the fake marriage system is completely underplayed and underutilized. Not only forcing young people to form couples and live together, but also robbing them of their privacy and constantly monitoring them and scoring their actions and behavior - can you imagine how different a society with such a system would be? But we see no effect of any kind in the show. The system is only used as an excuse to put the two main characters together and nothing else. Even other students seem mostly unaffected and unphased by it, barely giving some occasional comment about it. For example Best-friend-kun somehow continues to be your typical loner romcom side-character despite supposedly also taking part in this marriage system.And speaking of other students, they are treated almost as non-existent. Even Rival-kun who is initially expected to have a somewhat central part in the story essentially bows out of the fights and might just as well not have been shown at all. The show's world ends up having only MC and his two girls in it. surprise for you. He'll keep giving you false hope, of course, to keep you watching throughout the season. Then in the last episode he'll hit you with the realization that he's still denser than any other romcom protagonist, ending completely the same as he were in the first episode, and all the episodes from before were completely wasted on him.I want my money back. I want my time back. I want my emotions (mainly anger right now) back.It's a real shame, cos some other aspects of the show were somewhat good. Unlike the MC, the FMC showed growth and character, for example. The artstyle of the show was nice, with some print-like moire patterns instead of true gradients. The artstyle of the ending credits was completely different and very cute. The music was good.

Between the ""Fan service"" bordering on soft porn every five seconds and the oversexualization of the female characters, you couldn\'t truly enjoy the anime. It\'s really frustrating because I was looking foward to watching it and to top it off they gave no hints to the anime being like that to this extent, not the trailer or the tags (which should have had ecchi). Just when I thought the anime world was finally changing and you could actually enjoy animes without them being just another horny man\'s fantasy it seems we are...still far from the ideal. The only reason I kept watching till the end is because I hate leaving things halfway and not knowing how things end. But it was major mistake because the ""main couple"" didn\'t even end up together because the mc just decided to not choose and keep both girls pining for him.

Fucking Abunai Sisters made more sense because of how nonsensical it was. This show drops the worst premise then asks you to roll with it and take it seriously.

Then, only if they are the best couple can they can break up? What the fuck???

Things would be spicy in school, the tea would be spilling nonstop, and it would genuinely be really entertaining to watch the gong show unfold. Sadly, in this anime, this “spicy” premise of the marriage practical felt merely like a farce, and didn’t contribute much to the story other than the first few episodes. After that, it turned into a very generic romcom, but so, so frustrating to watch. Time after time I find myself pausing the episode just to facepalm and...groan at how stupid it all felt. At least the bright colour palette looks good, just don’t watch it in a dark room unless you want to ruin your eyes.STORY:The premise of the marriage practical felt very dumb for a school to do, but the fact the show didn’t even use that premise a whole lot after the first few episodes really irked me. In a nutshell, high school students are paired up with people of the opposite gender and must live together and live as pretend married couple, getting monitored and graded in the process. It’s quite immoral, the fact that you’re getting monitored in your own house by your own school, while they expect the groups to do “married couple” things. The romcom elements feel like Toradora to some extent, as the two main characters Jirou and Akari like other people at the outset, but grow closer as the show goes along. Such an original show this is, but just to be even more tropey, let’s throw in a childhood friend trope as well.It’s quite frustrating watching this show, because nothing notable happens for most of it other than random ecchi scenes, and whenever there’s a chance to make things a bit spicier, it just doesn’t happen most of the time. It’s simply a show built on ecchi scenes and misunderstandings.ART:It does look good, with the bright colours, and the animation is definitely the highlight of the show, though it’s a bit too bright sometimes, so make sure you watch the show in a well-lit room or only during daytime.MUSIC:The ED was very good, otherwise, not much notable music to note here.CHARACTERS:The characters are one of the most generic cast ever, and honestly, the side characters were more entertaining. Jirou is such a boring character, your typical protagonist who daydreams about romantic situations, but when there is one in front of him, he turns into a tomato and grows weak in the knees. Akari has some good moments, when she’s a bit more vulnerable around Jirou especially, though her initial first impression for the viewer leaves her looking like a very annoying and arrogant character, and she becomes more and more generic as we went along. Shiori is your typical shy childhood friend character, and I guess I just have a soft spot for childhood friends, since I always root for them to some extent, but she made it quite hard to cheer for her with how inconsistent her character was. Sometimes she’s indecisive, and sometimes she’s so bold.As for the good characters, only Sadaharu comes to mind. He carries the comedy aspects of the show, and honestly carries the show on his back. All his moments are so out of place, but I laugh anyways.ENJOYMENT:I constantly paused the episodes to facepalm and sigh, so you can get a sense of how frustrating this was for me.THEMATIC EXECUTION:With some good background shots, any big moment in the show is executed effectively, but those felt so far and between. As for how the whole marriage practical is concerned, it was very disappointing to see how that whole theme became obsolete as the show went along.OVERALL:Just your typical trashy romcom hijinks, that could have been much more. The relationships could have been more interesting, the drama could have been way spicier, and the characters felt so flat throughout the show. The premise just felt like a huge mask behind what was just a generic romcom.

Hoshiai no Sora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37972/Hoshiai_no_Sora,"['This show truly has the definition of ""don\'t judge a book by its cover"", because it ain\'t just a sports anime, but one that is rife with the daily affluences of family drama and matters that\'s spread all over it. And knowing director Kazuki Akane on this show\'s influence taken mostly from his creation of ""Noein"" and planning this original story for over a decade, I\'d say that while this has caused A HELL LOT of backlash, like Satoshi Mizukani\'s Planet With, the end result is truly the icing on the cake, whether you\'d decide to take it literally or not, I believe that what...Akane-san wanted out of it, he truly accomplished it to its feet with his unorthodox method of storytelling.You must be wondering why the title literally says ""Stars Align"", but it\'s Kazuki Akane\'s way of foreshadowing that no human is ever perfect, and we\'re like the stars of the sky, when life beats us down harsh, the common interest in question (soft tennis) aligns us in the thread of fate, that is adolescent trauma (which happens to be his favourite theme). Being grown-ups, the world that they know is never a bed of roses, so the harsh reality of families growing through the different pangs and uncertainties must know how to counteract on their very own. While the school/soft tennis club part is there to help expose and alleviate their true natures of the sufferings going through with parental disabilities, or expectations as simply you would call it, all kinds of nature are laid in bare sight. What these adolescent teens (i.e. Maki, Toma and the others) must do is not to take that emotional attachment and let it be the ridiculing point of their lives, but rather, no matter how much understanding others may have on their struggles, it\'s the reconciliation that leads to the amalgation of their feelings and work it out to experience their joy (which again, is in the soft tennis club) as an output.And to this point, all the dysfunctional boys in the Shijo Minami Boy\'s soft tennis team, budding artist but introverted and bullied Kanako Mitsue, and Kinuyo Kasuga the student council president, all face different but similar parental dysfunctions that affect them both physically and mentally, but not without some help from the same outside community that was once split but now bonded with understanding and acceptance, to push past their fears and limitations to be the best they could be. Even the worst of issues have a silver lining that despite how much relentlessness was given, any amount of joy would overcome the overglaringly terror and rebuild it into something special. All were alone, but the least of forgivings were not enough to separate each and every single member to reunite and conquer these harsh battles together.Studio 8-bit\'s visuals have never looked so better, especially with the soft tennis matches that seem to glide by every so often with the amount of exceptional precision and realism. While the overall stance is decent, the character designs are one that pops out in the slew of recognizing who\'s who and what\'s what, being that informative for reasons I cannot fathom, but with the puzzle pieces put together, paints a canvas that excels better than my initial thoughts about what this could be. Light-hearted visuals but not without the more serious moments (a.k.a parent-child arguments) make this one of those shows that stand out for reasons.And speaking of the music, I do enjoy the music and sounds of the show, with some realistic voice acting in the parental issues and OP and ED (of which the former comes VERY often), playing into sound design of the show that\'s just well done IMO. Always been a fan of Megumi Nakajima\'s music and this OP shows, while the ED\'s music is also good, and the dance...let\'s just say that copyrighted material needs to be attended to foremost.More than just a realistic drama-ified anime, Kazuki Akane\'s Hoshiai no Sora brings one important point to start and end its story: ""Wherever you are in life, everyone goes through thick and thin, and it takes two hands to clap, so grab a partner that can help spur each other\'s life forward and achieve things you couldn\'t have imagined you\'d accomplish."" Love it or hate it, Stars Align truly will forever be misunderstood under Akane-san\'s direction, but for those who got the gist of it, make your life count, and keep moving forward.

From deep characters to an enrapturing story, this original has it all.STORY: 9The story of Stars Align is centered around a middle school boy named Katsuragi Maki. He moves schools and gets convinced by his friend to join the school\'s failing soft tennis club because of his athletic ability, despite never playing soft tennis before. From there, it seems like it will become a generic sports/drama, but there is a darker side to the story which reveals itself after the ending of the first episode, and the show starts touching on conflicts...many people are afraid to talk about. On the outside, Katsuragi is a normal student who is part of the soft tennis club, but on the inside, he is a helpless boy, trapped by the trauma of his past.ART: 7The art style of this show is decent. The animation and drawing are perfectly fine, yet nothing especially stands out. However, I really enjoy the character design. The bright backgrounds are also very nice-looking, and the OP is animated very well. The ED is also very funny, with rotoscoped dance moves that *cough* ""may have"" been stolen without the creators\' permission *cough*... nonetheless, I enjoyed it.SOUND: 8Speaking of OPs and EDs, I really enjoy the sound of this show. The OP and ED are both very good, and the OST is also enjoyable to listen to. The sound design is also decent, and listening to this show is very satisfying with good stereo headphones. The voice acting is also very good, as they hired very capable and established voice actors.CHARACTER: 9One of the best aspects of this show is the characters. 8bit was able to craft a variety of interesting characters, from the assertive Katsuragai and Shinjou to the shy Taiyou and Mitsue. The character development is incredible. Each character in the cast has their own unique quirks and troubles. From questioning their own identities, having family troubles, being antisocial, and more, many of the characters are relatable and much of the show is spent developing these characters. I guarantee most of you (regardless of sexuality, race, or situation) reading this review will be able to connect with at least one of the characters in this show. The amount of care put into crafting these characters is apparent, and as I mentioned before, the character designs are amazing.ENJOYMENT: 10I really enjoy watching this show. The rollercoaster of emotions I go through in one episode leaves me thinking about it for a while after I watch it. From the rebuilding of the soft tennis club to the darker themes present, I can honestly say that so far I have enjoyed every minute of Stars Align.OVERALL: 9As I mentioned before, I really do think this will be the best show of the season. Stars Align is the show I look forward to most the whole week. The combination of the deep story and the amazing character development makes me want to recommend this to everyone. Give this show a try, and make sure you watch the post ED scenes. I promise you you won\'t regret it. many people are afraid to talk about.

That’s because it takes a realistic approach towards competitive athletics, in ways that most shonen won’t accommodate.  That’s not to say that shows like Haikyuu!! are bad — in fact, I rather enjoyed it — it’s just that they usually give the main protagonist a special advantage that would otherwise not exist in the real world.  Also, the plot usually follows a predictable pattern, in which the team uplifts itself from obscurity to unquestioned greatness.Hoshiai no Sora, on the other hand, gives the impression that this...tennis team will improve over the course of twelve episodes, but will, most likely, experience more setbacks than victories.  In addition, the characters are proving to be quite complex, with emotional, social and physical barriers that are hindering their forward progress.Toma, for example, is struggling with his role as team captain, and can’t seem to motivate his teammate or get them to rally together.  This is causing him a great deal of frustration and stress, which is leading to physical outbursts.  Combine this with his poor relationship with his mother (who shows little-to-interest in him), and he’s an extremely troubled character.  Maki is becoming overwhelmed by his responsibilities at home, and his abusive father is not making his life any easier (quite the opposite).  That being said, his unwillingness to be a ‘loser,’ despite his difficulties is inspiring, but his lack of sensitivity towards his teammates ‘loser mindset’ is cause a rift in the soft tennis club.As for the rest of the team, it seems as though many, if not all, of them are socially or emotionally oppressed individuals, that feel maligned by the other sports clubs, and student body as a whole.  Thus far, their awkwardness and socially repressed personalities are realistic, and it will be interesting to see if they allow the ridicule of others to influence their behaviors, or if they’ll gain the self-confidence to blossom into self-confident individuals.Hoshiai no Sora’s animation is simple.  That is not meant to be disparaging, however.  That’s because the animation beautiful compliments the solemn atmosphere of the show.  Sometimes, a rich color palette can take the viewer out of the experience, preventing them from fully empathizing with the characters.  But when the colors are muted, if you will, events seem more grounded, allowing the viewer to establish a deeper connection with the characters on screen.Needless to say, I’m thoroughly enjoying the events of Hoshiai no Sora, and believe it’s the hidden gem of the 2019 fall season. tennis team will improve over the course of twelve episodes, but will, most likely, experience more setbacks than victories.

But when the colors are muted, if you will, events seem more grounded, allowing the viewer to establish a deeper connection with the characters on screen.Needless to say, I’m thoroughly enjoying the events of Hoshiai no Sora, and believe it’s the hidden gem of the 2019 fall season.', 'You have heard of “monster of the week”, now get ready for “bad parent of the week.”What was that final episode, anyway?Really, what was that?Before talking about the anime in general, I just have to say that the final episode is one of the worst things I’ve ever watched.Now, let’s begin....Drama is something that has been walking side-by-side with the sport’s genre for a long time. It’s the most common element used to drive the characters’ motivations and fuel their development.Anime such as Ashita no Joe, Touch, Ping Pong the Animation, and many other well-regarded sports anime all fit in this category, and what do they all have in common that Hoshiai doesn’t? The answer is that, at their core, they are still sports anime, and the sport has a reason to be there. It serves a purpose that couldn’t be fulfilled otherwise.Hoshiai didn’t needed to be a sports anime. In fact, strip away every instance of sport this show has and replace it with something like a cultural club or something and the results are not very different.Edit: news got out that the show was meant to be 25-episode long. While that does answer why many plot points were not resolved, it\'s unlikely this will ever get a second season, and even if it does, the points I made here remain the same for these 12 episodes. What is done is done and +13 episodes wouldn\'t take back what happened during this ""first half.""The show has eight main characters. That is alarming enough given it wants to dramatize all of them in just 12 episode, while still holding into the soft tennis aspect, but it seems the show wasn’t satisfied with just that and decided to dramatize the side characters too.It is as if the only way it knows how to make those characters fit into the story is to put them in some kind of predicament. However, it doesn’t even do that right because it’s more worried about setting up dramas so it can have a moment of tension during the episode, rather than solving those issues in a compelling way. It’s like a mystery show holding its mysteries’ resolution until the final episode, while introducing more and more mysteries as the story goes by for the sole purpose of holding the viewer’s attention, since it doesn’t know of any other way to do that.I will give credit where credit’s due, though. The characters are well written enough to stand on their own initially; they have unique personalities and unique traits. However, none of that matters when the show only uses them to incite drama. They are like punching bags only waiting for the blow to give the audience some kind of conflict.The term “forced drama” has never been more fitting. The show is desperate to make the viewer feel some kind of tension, but setting up soft tennis matches, creating interesting rivals or compelling and well-written conflict is too much work, so it relies on the cheapest tricks in the book to do so. And believe me, it goes beyond the “bad parent of the week” everyone talks about.The conflict is generally the same. Almost all the kids have bad parents who do not approve of their behavior and want to dictate how their children should live. The show tries to pass a message about that, but fails miserably when every single drama feels so incredibly forced.Unlike the main characters, the parents (which in a way are the “villains” of the show) are one-dimensional and stupid characters. Every word of dialogue that comes out of their mouth feels like it were generated by a computer that had a very basic idea of how these characters should be. They are purposely selfish without any given reason and end up being literal plot-devices meant to create drama. And when the show does the same thing for the 5th time (that is, introducing a bad parent), you just kind of don’t care anymore.The only bad parent that could have been interesting is the main character’s father, which was completely forgotten after a certain event and never mentioned again. However, even he felt like a generic one-dimensional villain that you could find anywhere. He is bad because he has to be, and that’s it. It’s like that with EVERY bad character. This is beyond lazy writing, it’s offensive.The drama itself is terribly handled. Some dramas take a whole episode while others take ¼ of one, with absolutely no set-up whatsoever. The characters are hardly affected by it and they only act as if it matters when it’s meant to create more conflict. Said conflict also doesn’t matter because most of the time it’s inconsequential. Episode 9 is probably the worst offender when it comes to this: Nao traps Shingo’s sister in a room for absolute no reason and everyone just laughs it off. It’s not brought up ever again and Nao is fine and dandy in the next episode.Some dramas are also completely forgotten, like the matter with Yuuta’s mother or the family conflict of the student council president. Some are resolved in a very rushed and cheap way that makes you wonder why they even exist in the first place.I can’t put into words just how desperate the show is to get some kind of reaction out of the audience.And then, at the end of the anime, almost NOTHING that was brought up was resolved.The show is also trying to pass a message about social matters, but it fails at that, too. It obviously tries too hard at it, taking me out of the experience. When a character talks about a delicate topic, it feels like they are reading a self-help book about it rather than giving their perspective as a teenager.If that was not enough, it can’t even do soft tennis matches well. The opponents are mostly uninteresting. Coincidentally, the only interesting opponent got like that after he stopped being an opponent, showing just how one-dimensional the show is trying to make its villains look like. I feel like it’s doing it on purpose, honestly. The matches are very cheaply written too, following a formula of having the character adapting to the play-style of their opponent, but taking forever to realize obvious things, only dragging the match to pretend there is conflict.On the technical aspect, the show started beautifully and declined to a depressing state. The animation gets so inconsistent it’s hard to ignore. Character models sometimes look off and there’s an intense reutilization of animation during the tennis matches. Enough to be noticeable.To put it simply, it gets ugly. It’s a shame when the first episode had such a consistent production and fluid animation.There’s a constant overutilization of songs, too. The opening theme is played constantly in key moments, making me desensitized to it when I should be feeling sad or happy. The theme with the piano is also overused during the matches, playing non-stop as if the show only has that one song. It’s not bad, it’s just tiring and lazy.You might hear that Hoshiai no Sora “got bad” or “went downhill” after a couple of episodes, but I disagree. I honestly believe the show had problems right off the bat. It’s just that the culmination of drama with little to no resolution became more evident as the series went on.Before I end the review, here are a few arguments I have read defending this show:-In real life, not all problems are resolved, so it’s okay for the show not to solve everythingThis is not real life, this is a work of fiction created by humans (although in this case a computer algorithm might as well have created it) and it’s meant to tell a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end. This rule also applies to the subplots. There’s absolutely no reason to bring up a conflict if it’s not getting resolved or doesn’t play a role in the main story, and, as I said before, many things in Hoshiai are almost inconsequential, and even when they are consequential, it’s meant to force the plot to go in a certain direction, making it even more forced.-This was never a show about sports, it’s primarily about dramaBut it still has a sport. Putting it aside and rushing the games is still lazy.-The character don’t appear affected by their family drama because they don’t want to show itThat is true to some extent, but it doesn’t excuse ignoring said dramas altogether, while having characters feel bad when it’s convenient.Hoshiai no Sora is a show that has desperate desire to create conflict, alongside one of the cheapest and most dishonest writing I’ve seen, created one of the worst shows I’ve watched this year. It forgets the unnecessary plot points that the show itself had introduced, and rushes others. It tries to send a message, but it feels like it’s lecturing you about it. It fails at everything it attempts. There’s not a single redeeming quality besides the decent production of the first episode. There’s not a single thing to take out of this show, except maybe a good involuntary laugh.Had it been a comfy slice of life soft tennis anime, maybe the end result would’ve been better.Saying I didn\'t enjoy it would be an understatement though. This gave me good laughs.Thanks for reading, and forgive my poor writing and bad English. Drama is something that has been walking side-by-side with the sport’s genre for a long time.

I just had a feeling I exaggerated too much.STORY:The boy\'s soft tennis club faces dissolution due to the lack of results and skill. Desperate for new members with athletic ability, Toma Shinjo leads a recruitment drive and come up empty. He approaches the transfer student Maki Katsuragi, but Maki declines not wanting to join any clubs. Toma follows Maki around not giving up on recruiting him and Maki agrees under the condition that he gets paid. Well, it is a sports anime. Expect flaws, the story overall is quite a...cliche. Believing they would soon put on a twist. I further on have really nothing to say except for it is fine. Not unique or really exciting. It\'s your typical sports anime, oops I forgot it focuses on Drama. My bad, well, it really handles the dramas quite well. But too much abusive parents isn\'t surprising or dramatic anymore. Further information about the characters is within the Characters Section.ART:8Bit\'s art is quite too simple though cute. Even when the characters are serious in playing, I sometimes find it cute. Nothing really stands out. A bit wanky at some scenes. Though as for 2019, it lacks a feeling of improvement. It\'s um, bland at felt like flat. I\'m really hoping they would soon improve.SOUND:The OP is beautiful, quite catchy. It really tells off that what you are watching is a sports anime, deriving from rackets. The ED serves as for me, a comedic role that I cant just skip but watch. The teamwork between the OST is fascinating. Great job.CHARACTER:Okay, at first I really liked the character\'s background stories. Which were seemingly different from each other. But as soon as the story progresses, you get a feeling ""Tch. Another abusive parent\'s background story"" like that. I was okay with a few people having abusive parents but don\'t overdo it. I felt like it was cliche. The originality really came down, I think the only different yet interesting one was Kaori\'s backstory. If you don\'t know what it is, it\'s about an argument between Kaori\'s grandmother and her mother fighting for a silly purpose. Which for me, I found realistic and original. My reaction when seeing another abusive parent was ""Oh. Didn\'t see that coming. Tch."" with a rather annoyed tone.ENJOYMENT: - 6/10STORY - 7/10ART - 6/10SOUND - 8/10CHARACTER - 6/10ENJOYMENT - 6/10OVERALL - 6.8/10I am quite disappointed, I hope the future episodes fix the situation I\'m feeling right now. cliche.

In today\'s anime industry, much like it is in Hollywood, we are bombarded by endless numbers of adaptations of already popular franchises as they help to guarantee a level of financial success. Hoshiai no Sora is a 12 episode  passion project written and directed by Kazuki Akane which was originally produced for 24 episodes before it was then told it could only air 12. This is incredibly clear from the phenomenal production values, and its unique approach to the sports drama genre but also in that the show does not end at episode 12.Traditionally in sports...anime, the sport in question is the centrepiece of the characters\' lives. Even in Run with the Wind, it is not long before running becomes the most important thing in the character\'s lives. Sports anime in general are no different than shounen anime in that they act as fantasy escapism for viewers to vicariously live beautiful, youth-energetic, rose-coloured high school lives with action, adventure, and camaraderie. In many sports anime, we never even see the parents of these children let alone be involved in their children\'s lives.Hoshiai no Sora is unique in that it portrays a group of young middle-schoolers whose life situations are what is being explored and the relationship between these characters in the sport are a consequence of this. This is a mature show that seeks to show what real friendship and camaraderie is and how school and sports can be the refuge from the domestic situations at home. What is most impressive about the show is the dialogue - it is not cheesy, it is not contrived, it is not overly-laden with shounen tropes of eyerolling-inducing cheers of ""With the power of friendship, we can literally do anything"", it is an accurate portrayal of how children may react and respond to tough situations and how friends can truly help each other.The themes explored in this show are wide and also mature - not seen in most anime in this genre. It would be a spoiler to discuss any of these further but it is worth noting that a sequel is in the works and that this show was made to be 24 episodes long (and indeed they had already produced an ep 13)! Some may find the lack of conclusion to be unsatisfying but personally for me, the pacing of this show was perfect and any attempt to rush a conclusion would be ill-fated.The animation is brimming with attention to detail. The way each character is animated shows their own unique quirks and personality traits and right from the beginning, we can see differences in the way characters play soft tennis. Even, the ED oozes more passion and animation than some entire anime. But it is the cinematography and camera work that makes this show stand out. This show does not rely on stills and Powerpoint-esque presentations to show its action. We see action, impact, and reaction and the camera angles are readily used to amply the excitement and dynamism of the action in a way that regular TV cannot. Hoshiai no Sora takes advantage of the anime medium and takes no shortcuts.The soundtrack by jizue is one of the best OSTs of 2019 not least because it captures and amplifies the emotions in the scenes, in the way drama and sports OSTs should, but also because the sound is different enough such that it is attributable to Hoshiai no Sora. To design and tailor a soundtrack to as show means the audience should be able to associate it with the specific scenes in this specific show where it is played and jizue nails it.When Fall 2019 started airing, I surely did not believe that I would be blessed with another character-driven realistic sports drama so soon after Run with the Wind. However, I was blessed with something greater. An anime original that is brimming with confidence in its approach, its production values, and its willingness to explore adolescence in a genre that is oversaturated with what are nothing more than battle shounen wearing the disguise of a sports jersey. And for that I am grateful, and I truly recommend this to any fans of authentic character dramas, and hope the stars align once more to provide us with the sequel we deserve. anime, the sport in question is the centrepiece of the characters\' lives.

Parentage, and especially motherhood, is often portrayed as a thing of love, and care, and protection, all of which are qualities understood to be innate, healthy, and of course, natural. This is not the case. Well, most of the time it is, because, as they say, stereotypes come from somewhere, but nevertheless, such is not the always the case. Sometimes parentage can be malicious, dangerous,...and scary, and\xa0it can ruin people’s lives before they’ve even begun. Hoshiai no Sora, despite its outward appearance as a benign sports anime, is a show about the deep seated psychological atrophies and torsions which cause the innocent love of parents to go sour, and more importantly, it is also the first show I’ve seen with this subject matter which manages to portray such a delicate issue in a way which isn’t so misguided as to be offensive, so if not for the hours of soft tennis it unapologetically wasted my time and its own time with, I sincerely thank this show for being able to depict something none other in its genre has been able to correctly, nor this cathartically.Our hero Maki Katsuragi is a no-bullshit little nihilist who joins his school’s soft-tennis club—a notoriously negligent and satirically self-aware club—not for precious middle school memories, but for cold hard cash. Like a badass. But in actuality, Maki is only requesting to join the team under these conditions as a front. Knowing his Gary Stu, god-like, anime self-insert protagonist abilities in soft-tennis are indispensable to the dramatically hopeless team and doubly knowing the desperate team captain, Touma Shinjou, will do anything to get his hands on such a valuable player to revive his long-dead team, he exploits the situation to get the income under the guise he doesn’t care and will only participate for money, when in reality, the poor kid is really just desperate himself to secure any money he can to help his single working mother make ends meet. It’s a pretty real setup, but it gets really real when you learn the principle reason his mother’s own salary is insufficient is Maki’s father, his mother’s abusive ex-husband, is making routine visits to their apartment when only Maki is home to steal whatever of their money he can, because despite his dastardly attitude, Maki’s history of being beaten by this guy for as long as he can remember has him totally shut down whenever he’s present.Seeing Maki so pitiable is a poignantly stark contrast to the snarky bastard he is at school, and it so perfectly illustrates just how fundamentally abuse can permanently eat its way into its victims psyches, especially when they are young and dangerously impressionable. Seeing Maki, the nonsensically overpowered isekai protagonist who one day found himself in a show about soft-tennis, crumble like a house of cards at the mere sight of this scumbag really sells the implications of what he’s done to him to the viewers, and more importantly, what people in real life actually have to go through. However, what makes it truly well written and worthy of praise is how much it does NOT do what every other psychological horror-comedy anime does and actually portrays this terribly serious relationship as one made up of reality. The scenes are only after a lull in the action; should you catch on, there’s this absolutely chilling break in dialogue; the color palette layers itself with this oh-so-subtle drab overtone you don’t even notice until it’s too late; and right as it happens the camera shudders—and, oh—the cinematography! The cinematography is brilliant! The sudden shaking slams on the breaks, and the camera grinds its movements to a halt as if it’s just as horrified as the poor child cowering in the corner, cutting only to show flash-cuts infused so ingeniously with panic or perspective shots so ruthlessly ratcheting up the already towering levels of immersion present in these glorious scenes by literally putting us in his shoes. And you see him hit ‘em, and kick ‘em, and berate ‘em, and tear the apartment apart to steal what little they have to take, and he’s crying, and trembling, and cowering and—uuuuhh—it’s just the BEST!Seriously, though, it’s the manner in which the damage is so correctly ingrained into Maki’s personality in a way with speaks to real life—much unlike most shows incorporating the likes of abusive parents who’re merely out to pander to the edge-fandom as painstakingly bluntly as they can—is what makes it so affecting, convincing, and tactful. That said, Maki is by no means alone. The team captain I mentioned, Touma, lives in a household wherein his father avoids his mother out of reticence, and his mother avoids him out fear all the while unfairly pampering his other brother. Their transgendered team manager, Yuuta—on top of being relentlessly bullied at school for being outwardly gay—lives in a household wherein he has to work with his sister to hide his crossdressing from his mother, whom is of the belief once she dramatically discovers his habit that he’s a freak and she’s a failure as a mother by way of his development. Their team member, Itsuki, was born to a Mother who poured boiling water on him as a crying baby, leaving him with a horrific scar spanning his entire backside and a dangerously volatile trigger for violence. Their other team member, Nao, lives in a household under strict control by a world-class helicopter parent whose crushed him under so much stress he’s become a pathological liar. Getting ridiculous yet? Because I could go on, wether it be the adopted Rintaro or the destructively spoiled Taiyou, apparently any character they bothered naming in this show has some degree of unhealthy parentage under their belts, and in retrospect, only so many of these cases actually got it right—and that’s only if you can buy into the fact such an abundance of said cases could even occur under such a massively coincidental set of circumstances in the first place.Simply put, Hoshiai no Sora is, as a whole, what I would call bluffing. I devoted a paragraph to praising the directorial deftness on display in scenes depicting Maki’s abuse, because not everyone gets that degree of harsh and intricate realism and is thereby nowhere near as believable or smartly written from a critical standpoint. I can’t really speak to Yuuta’s portrayal, because while I suffer from as much body dysmorphia as any other clinically depressed autist, I’ve never actually had gender identity issues. But I’ve been screamed at, slapped at, struck at, and everything in between which these poor kids have to no end, and frankly, I don’t think they’re developed in a way someone with my experience can really believe in in good faith. Itsuki is violent, because he was abused. Okay, my sister turned violent too, and she fell out of relationship after relationship because her and her men always seemed to be in a rush to hit one another. But despite getting the same treatment she did, I didn’t turn violent, and no matter how many years those bitches throughout school would gang up on me, I never once even thought to strike back. Clearly, it takes more to go violent then to simply have been hurt by your guardians in the past. Nao is a pathological liar, because he was put under pressure. Okay, I devolve into a pathological liar whenever a conversational partner decides to pry into my personal life, and I often even suffer from cognitive dissonance having built year long personas with different colleagues and family members all based on lies which don’t align as they were fabricated in the moment on nothing but panic. But despite getting the same treatment I did, my sister didn’t go crazy, and no matter the fact she went to a private school which placed its own extra dosage of pressure onto her separate from my mother’s already bountiful amount, she never once broke down. Clearly, it also takes a lot more to go crazy then to simply have been pressured by your guardians in the past. Do you see what I’m getting at with these examples? What surface level developments the show offers are not the only ingredients to these special solutions, and the fact the show portrays it as if it is shows a certain level of ignorance in its writing and conceptualization—even if the show is obviously coming from a place of genuine artfulness and good intentions. There is so much more nuance to these phenomena of developmental psychology then is shown or discussed by the show I cannot wholeheartedly buy into the idea—despite its wealth of dramatization—any one of these kids, no matter how seemingly unfortunate, are ever going to end up like my sister, who went through rehab before she was able to graduate college and was knocked up by a drunkard who would become so unhinged she and her newborn son had to flee back to my parents house for safety, or end up like me, whose thrown myself into traffic, thrown myself off an overpass, overdosed on antidepressants and sleeping pills, and cut myself so violently and for so long the skin color of my left forearm is now different from that of my right. I’m not trying to justify my opinion by exploiting the fact my real life sob story is worse than the ones Akane Kazuki came up with, because he very well could’ve come up with ones a lot worse—its fiction, after all. I’m just trying to make the point the subtle ways in which these children are affected by their parents’ scarring behavior may or may not be as accurate as they needed to be in all cases, seeing as I actually have had the misfortune of knowing how at least two people really did turn out in the real world.But if this show is so thoroughly touching, and not to mention directly personally relatable, why aren’t I telling you it’s the best anime ever made, even with its lack of necessary intricacy? Because despite its contemplative value being through the roof, its experiential value is at best milquetoast and at worst hellishly tropic and boring. Yes, those scenes I mentioned before were all expertly directed, and yes, the show does work wonders with its subtle tone shifts in color palette and sound design, but outside the moments where Akane Kazuki came in and got to work with his own two hands, the show can be a serious slog. Now the heavy stuff’s over, and this review gets to fizzle out slowly and monotonously like the the show itself did and talk about soft tennis. All that meaningful intrigue I just talked about—believe it or not—is mere garnish to the show’s actual plot: a run of the mill, stock brand, dime-a-dozen highschool sports story. This show isn’t Haikyuu, Run With the Wind, or Welcome to the Ballroom, where the character arcs are weaved through the sport, nor is it One Outs or Baby Steps, where the sport is used to tell a progressive narrative, nor is it Ping Pong: The Animation, which seeks to tell a wholly symbolic and nearly spiritual coming of age story through the sport. It’s just a show about interpersonal drama with healthy theming, which also just happens to have another totally separate story about soft tennis running along side itself. Their progression as a team, their unification as members, and their whole entire underdog story—which is all done quite well, by the way—is completely and totally irrelevant to any and all emotional investment you as a viewer hold in the story, and I simply cannot wrap my head around why they put so much focus on it. This was a show which had me glued to the screen half the time and having it mindlessly playing in the background with me doing work at home the other half of the time—if not outright getting frustrated with it and ratcheting up the playback speed. By the time episode ten and—worse yet—episode eleven rolled around, I started to panic. With so many loose ends hand-waved for the sake of banal episode-long sports anime matches all the way to the finale, which is in itself another match of soft tennis, I had to start looking out for news on this show getting renewed, because while I don’t know if its getting a second season or not, I know for a fact if we didn’t spend so much time playing soft god damn tennis, it wouldn’t even need one! And who knows if this studio could even make a season two any time soon with so many more productions slated for this coming year when the show looked so surprisingly gorgeous?The one and only saving grace to the overabundance of soft tennis in a show which was really about way more interesting things at its core—even if an ultimately weak saving grace in comparison—was the outstanding production quality. Be it beautifully lavish, obviously well-researched, life-like character movements, ambitious camerawork maintaining flawless anatomical accuracy, or expertly airy hand-drawn clothing physics, Hoshiai no Sora is an absolute feast for any sakuga nerd, and I find it seriously impressive coming out of this studio. But now that I’ve said how pretty it is, I must be the bitch I am and pick it apart at least a little bit, because while it may rightfully knock the socks off the average viewer, this is no infallible production. First and most obviously, the lavishness and fluidity of the animation is not consistent and mainly focused in the fist handful of episodes, with some speed-lined, single colored backgrounds and panning over stills coming around episodes six and seven, but most would assume this the case anyway. What I really want to talk about is how thick this show is with referencing. Last year, a show about badminton called Hanebado! aired out of studio LIDENFILMS, a studio as historically shaky as 8bit themselves, but to the surprise of the world over, this show was—at least for the most part—heartstoppingly gorgeous. The mind blowingly ambitious shot compositions kept up with by equally jaw dropping sakuga was only describable as an animation celebration. That said, this production quality was inevitably too much to handle, and many of the nonchalant practice matches ended up being fully rotoscoped, and there was one non-rotoscoped match in particular which aired radically unfinished in episode seven. Overall, it was impressive, but as the ambition of the production started tripping up the staff’s footing, the mechanisms keeping it running became blatantly clear. Hoshiai no Sora falls victim to much the same fate. While there is no rotoscoping, they do reuse animation, trace photographs for dense backgrounds, trace live-action dance choreography for their ending animations, and more to the point, they trace CG references. In the first few episodes, everything was hand drawn, but as the show chugged along, I started noticing the background athletes being subbed in by stationary CG models. At first it was as innocuous a development as it was an expected one, but it didn’t take me long to notice the girls’ team playing on the court behind our boys doing full movements, and what oh what were they doing but the same exact fluid motion the characters do in their pretty animations.Without press releases, verified quotations, interviews, or production documentaries, I cannot say what this show really aimed to be at heart, but I can say what it felt like. It didn’t feel like an Inio Asano manga or an Umino Chika adaptation, nor did I feel it to be the next Masaaki Yuasa’s Mind Game, or the next Tomihiko Morimi’s Tatami Galaxy, or the next Mamoru Oshii’s Angel’s Egg, any of which are obvious to anyone who can relate to be creations birthed from intensely personal experiences and convictions. Rather, it felt like the work of a man looking in on the hardships of others and—out of honest respect and a splash of scholarly interest—creating a story he felt to both explore and honor the trails and tribulations they’ve gone through, whether or not he truly understood the can of worms he was cracking open himself. It’s an ode to abuse and a reached hand out to those who’ve suffered from it, and while anyone like myself whose also had the misfortune to’ve undergone some of this in their own lives as well will probably find his understanding of the issues and their effects to be more than a little incomplete, I personally think they should all agree with me when I say his sentiment was in the right place, and his creative direction of the concept was skillful enough to be laudable as art and tactful enough to be genuine as cathartic media…even if he stupidly thought it a story best told via monotonous soft tennis.Thank you for reading. and scary, and\xa0it can ruin people’s lives before they’ve even begun. Hoshiai no Sora, despite its outward appearance as a benign sports anime, is a show about the deep seated psychological atrophies and torsions which cause the innocent love of parents to go sour, and more importantly, it is also the first show I’ve seen with this subject matter which manages to portray such a delicate issue in a way which isn’t so misguided as to be offensive, so if not for the hours of soft tennis it unapologetically wasted my time and its own time with, I sincerely thank this show for being able to depict something none other in its genre has been able to correctly, nor this cathartically.Our hero Maki Katsuragi is a no-bullshit little nihilist who joins his school’s soft-tennis club—a notoriously negligent and satirically self-aware club—not for precious middle school memories, but for cold hard cash. Like a badass. But in actuality, Maki is only requesting to join the team under these conditions as a front. Knowing his Gary Stu, god-like, anime self-insert protagonist abilities in soft-tennis are indispensable to the dramatically hopeless team and doubly knowing the desperate team captain, Touma Shinjou, will do anything to get his hands on such a valuable player to revive his long-dead team, he exploits the situation to get the income under the guise he doesn’t care and will only participate for money, when in reality, the poor kid is really just desperate himself to secure any money he can to help his single working mother make ends meet. It’s a pretty real setup, but it gets really real when you learn the principle reason his mother’s own salary is insufficient is Maki’s father, his mother’s abusive ex-husband, is making routine visits to their apartment when only Maki is home to steal whatever of their money he can, because despite his dastardly attitude, Maki’s history of being beaten by this guy for as long as he can remember has him totally shut down whenever he’s present.Seeing Maki so pitiable is a poignantly stark contrast to the snarky bastard he is at school, and it so perfectly illustrates just how fundamentally abuse can permanently eat its way into its victims psyches, especially when they are young and dangerously impressionable. Seeing Maki, the nonsensically overpowered isekai protagonist who one day found himself in a show about soft-tennis, crumble like a house of cards at the mere sight of this scumbag really sells the implications of what he’s done to him to the viewers, and more importantly, what people in real life actually have to go through. However, what makes it truly well written and worthy of praise is how much it does NOT do what every other psychological horror-comedy anime does and actually portrays this terribly serious relationship as one made up of reality. The scenes are only after a lull in the action; should you catch on, there’s this absolutely chilling break in dialogue; the color palette layers itself with this oh-so-subtle drab overtone you don’t even notice until it’s too late; and right as it happens the camera shudders—and, oh—the cinematography! The cinematography is brilliant! The sudden shaking slams on the breaks, and the camera grinds its movements to a halt as if it’s just as horrified as the poor child cowering in the corner, cutting only to show flash-cuts infused so ingeniously with panic or perspective shots so ruthlessly ratcheting up the already towering levels of immersion present in these glorious scenes by literally putting us in his shoes. And you see him hit ‘em, and kick ‘em, and berate ‘em, and tear the apartment apart to steal what little they have to take, and he’s crying, and trembling, and cowering and—uuuuhh—it’s just the BEST!Seriously, though, it’s the manner in which the damage is so correctly ingrained into Maki’s personality in a way with speaks to real life—much unlike most shows incorporating the likes of abusive parents who’re merely out to pander to the edge-fandom as painstakingly bluntly as they can—is what makes it so affecting, convincing, and tactful. That said, Maki is by no means alone. The team captain I mentioned, Touma, lives in a household wherein his father avoids his mother out of reticence, and his mother avoids him out fear all the while unfairly pampering his other brother. Their transgendered team manager, Yuuta—on top of being relentlessly bullied at school for being outwardly gay—lives in a household wherein he has to work with his sister to hide his crossdressing from his mother, whom is of the belief once she dramatically discovers his habit that he’s a freak and she’s a failure as a mother by way of his development. Their team member, Itsuki, was born to a Mother who poured boiling water on him as a crying baby, leaving him with a horrific scar spanning his entire backside and a dangerously volatile trigger for violence. Their other team member, Nao, lives in a household under strict control by a world-class helicopter parent whose crushed him under so much stress he’s become a pathological liar. Getting ridiculous yet? Because I could go on, wether it be the adopted Rintaro or the destructively spoiled Taiyou, apparently any character they bothered naming in this show has some degree of unhealthy parentage under their belts, and in retrospect, only so many of these cases actually got it right—and that’s only if you can buy into the fact such an abundance of said cases could even occur under such a massively coincidental set of circumstances in the first place.Simply put, Hoshiai no Sora is, as a whole, what I would call bluffing.

The subjects treated in this are profound, serious and can be a real lesson for some of us. Hoshiai no Sora is both a ""happy feels"" and ""sad feels"" anime.It is rare for me to be attached to the characters, especially in a random anime where I really don\'t know the characters. But I really want them to grow and to defeat the demons of their life.Hoshiai...no Sora is finally the middle ground I was looking for in an anime, meaning that in the same episode, you will be happy and sad.The ""big"" weakness of this anime is the sport part, which is sad since its an sport anime, but honestly,  you will quickly realize that it is not the most interesting part.Also, I really this ending, which displays the characters through dancing, really nice. no Sora is finally the middle ground I was looking for in an anime, meaning that in the same episode, you will be happy and sad.The ""big"" weakness of this anime is the sport part, which is sad since its an sport anime, but honestly,  you will quickly realize that it is not the most interesting part.Also, I really this ending, which displays the characters through dancing, really nice.', ""Honestly, before episode 8 I would have given this anime at least a 9/10 for overall, but for some reason EVERY kid in the show has abusive parents. It was fine when it was just a few, but at this point we're literally just bouncing between parents either abusing their kid or talking about how awful the child is while the other parent (usually a good one) just turns a blind eye and passively agrees with them.It was a good show, but for some reason they decided that every character needed a backstory with a broken family where they're abused by their parents. "", ""The promotional poster of Hoshiai no Sora (Stars Align) caught my eye even before the show began airing.“Even in an ever-changing world, only the starlit sky will not change”.As a coming of age story, Hoshiai Sora teaches an important lesson about how we humans change, how we evolve, and how we grow up in an ever changing life. We live in a society dubbed as a modern era of controversy, where we communicate through our feelings but often causing trouble unknowingly. It’s part of growing up. Everyone makes mistakes in some way or another. It’s what makes us human. In this original anime, you...can say that making mistakes is part of the common norm, a very common fact that needs to be accepted.We all have to start off somewhere. Rome wasn’t built in a day after all and for someone like Maki Katsuragi, he enters the show as a transfer student and tennis beginner. Transferring to a school presents challenge on its own as he is the new kid in the neighborhood. Shijou Minami is a school where there’s a population of complex teenagers, driven by social anxiety while trying to forge a future for themselves. Maki faces a similar situation as he tries to build a future for himself in a seemingly stressful life. After reuniting with his childhood friend Touma Shinjou, he joins his school’s soft tennis club. This is where his daily adventure begins. But before we look into his school life, one shouldn’t forget about how he lives at home.Hoshiai no Sora may be a coming of age story but it adamantly adds a bold amount of drama. The first few episodes tells a harsh reality as we see the behavior of abusive parents. It’s actually a common norm in this show, so much that you’d think adults in their world are socially incapable of building a lasting relationship with their children. Watching this show tells how harsh reality can really be, especially for those who suffered physical or mental abuse. It’s a sensible subject that makes Hoshiai no Sora feel so real. But back to Maki’s situation, he faces abuse from his own father. An early example includes his father taking his savings while inflicting abuse on him. Maki’s fear is evident as he doesn’t report his situation to authorities but actually resorts to lies. By showing such a reality, we can definitely feel sympathetic. No one should have to come home and fear their own father. Abuse also extends to other characters such as Itsuki Ameno. The physical burn scar is a symbol of abuse by his own mother when he was an infant. Life is really tough when reality hits such way, isn’t it?Luckily, characters in the show are able to get back up when life knocks them down. The soft tennis club serves as a way for them to escape reality and build their character. Maki and Touma grows as part of their daily life activities and begins to show more signs of confidence. United by their common goal to win, the soft tennis club serves also serves a social hub for our characters. Daily issues may be common but they strive to resolve them together. At first, trouble seems difficult but as time goes on, the club becomes a unity of trust, commitment, and value. It’s so important to see how characters connects with each other in order to accomplish goals. As the captain, Toma leads the team with his commanding presence and takes soft tennis seriously, more than anyone else. It’s a difficult task for him as many of the other members slacks off that puts the club into tight budget. But on their way of success, the members begins to show more commitment. Watching this group grow will feel stressful at first because of how imperfect they are. But the more I watched the club, the more I realize how relatable these characters are. Hoshiai no Sora has characters fall into life stressful quagmires, but the soft tennis club serves as a beacon of light.And thanks to the soft tennis club, you can bet that characters begins to grow out of their shells. Maki is the most evident example as he finds the courage to stand up against his abusive father when Touma is threatened by him. It’s a powerful example of a boy who is able to overcome his personal demons to protect what he treasures, the important relationship he has built with his friend. Touma’s own problem at home traces its roots to his mother, a person who seems emotionally abusive towards his son. It’s like a stomping on his confidence until he begins to prove himself as a capable captain of the tennis club. However, not everyone suffers from parental abuse. Rintarou Futsu is a rare case of having loving parents despite being adopted. In sharp contrast compared to the main characters, he lives a happy life with them. And because of this, Rintarou is fundamentally a nice person and serves as someone who others can easily trust in. When you see the anime showcase characters this way, it’s also easy to tell how parents can have influence on their kids.By the time you’ve watched a decent portion of the show, it’s easy to see the amount of sensible subjects. The anime explores issues dealing with adult fear, parental abuse, and even sexual orientation. Yu, the manager of the club, is the most prominent example. Because he is homosexual, Yu attracts bullies and abuse, even from his own mother. It’s situations in the show that can be hard to watch if you find his circumstances relatable. And as I’ve said before, this anime isn’t shy about being controversial.But despite all this drama, we do have light comedy that has shifts its mood tone. A few examples includes Maki’s brutal honesty who sometimes says things that can be unintentionally ludicrious. There are also running gags about how certain characters looks feminine, so much that there’s even an episode with crossdressing. On the tennis field, competition may be tense but some of the strategies employed by the club are laughable. When you add more of the cherry character personalities of other club members, it can be quite a lighthearted anime. And the more you watch Hoshiai no Sora, the more you’ll realize that the show isn’t truly about sports competition. It’s about characters growing up.Director Kazuki Akane’s early work has little to no similarities with this anime so it’s rather refreshing to see him take on this project with his tone of storytelling. The character designs takes on a soft touch with simple art style. Most noticeably however, it’s the character expressions that stands out the most. Between the main characters and various abusive parents, it show how real the anime can really get. Watching the characters' speech mannerism is important as it allows us to judge on their character personalities. Finally, I do want to mention that this show has one of the most catchiest and stylish ED theme song of the year. The dance movements and choreography is exceptionally eye catchy despite some characters out of synch. It’s hard not to dance with them.At a pace of 12 episodes, this show dealt with drama on a level that I wasn’t prepared for. I came to watch this show for soft tennis but got treated with doses of drama in an emotional coming age of life. But that’s what makes this anime stand out so much. The daily adventures of the soft tennis club reminds us the reality of life, where we all have to face problems at one way or another. can say that making mistakes is part of the common norm, a very common fact that needs to be accepted.We all have to start off somewhere. Rome wasn’t built in a day after all and for someone like Maki Katsuragi, he enters the show as a transfer student and tennis beginner. Transferring to a school presents challenge on its own as he is the new kid in the neighborhood. Shijou Minami is a school where there’s a population of complex teenagers, driven by social anxiety while trying to forge a future for themselves. Maki faces a similar situation as he tries to build a future for himself in a seemingly stressful life. After reuniting with his childhood friend Touma Shinjou, he joins his school’s soft tennis club. This is where his daily adventure begins. But before we look into his school life, one shouldn’t forget about how he lives at home.Hoshiai no Sora may be a coming of age story but it adamantly adds a bold amount of drama. The first few episodes tells a harsh reality as we see the behavior of abusive parents. It’s actually a common norm in this show, so much that you’d think adults in their world are socially incapable of building a lasting relationship with their children. Watching this show tells how harsh reality can really be, especially for those who suffered physical or mental abuse. It’s a sensible subject that makes Hoshiai no Sora feel so real. But back to Maki’s situation, he faces abuse from his own father. An early example includes his father taking his savings while inflicting abuse on him. Maki’s fear is evident as he doesn’t report his situation to authorities but actually resorts to lies. By showing such a reality, we can definitely feel sympathetic. No one should have to come home and fear their own father. Abuse also extends to other characters such as Itsuki Ameno. The physical burn scar is a symbol of abuse by his own mother when he was an infant. Life is really tough when reality hits such way, isn’t it?Luckily, characters in the show are able to get back up when life knocks them down. The soft tennis club serves as a way for them to escape reality and build their character. Maki and Touma grows as part of their daily life activities and begins to show more signs of confidence. United by their common goal to win, the soft tennis club serves also serves a social hub for our characters. Daily issues may be common but they strive to resolve them together. At first, trouble seems difficult but as time goes on, the club becomes a unity of trust, commitment, and value. It’s so important to see how characters connects with each other in order to accomplish goals. As the captain, Toma leads the team with his commanding presence and takes soft tennis seriously, more than anyone else. It’s a difficult task for him as many of the other members slacks off that puts the club into tight budget. But on their way of success, the members begins to show more commitment. Watching this group grow will feel stressful at first because of how imperfect they are. But the more I watched the club, the more I realize how relatable these characters are. Hoshiai no Sora has characters fall into life stressful quagmires, but the soft tennis club serves as a beacon of light.And thanks to the soft tennis club, you can bet that characters begins to grow out of their shells. Maki is the most evident example as he finds the courage to stand up against his abusive father when Touma is threatened by him. It’s a powerful example of a boy who is able to overcome his personal demons to protect what he treasures, the important relationship he has built with his friend. Touma’s own problem at home traces its roots to his mother, a person who seems emotionally abusive towards his son. It’s like a stomping on his confidence until he begins to prove himself as a capable captain of the tennis club. However, not everyone suffers from parental abuse. Rintarou Futsu is a rare case of having loving parents despite being adopted. In sharp contrast compared to the main characters, he lives a happy life with them. And because of this, Rintarou is fundamentally a nice person and serves as someone who others can easily trust in. When you see the anime showcase characters this way, it’s also easy to tell how parents can have influence on their kids.By the time you’ve watched a decent portion of the show, it’s easy to see the amount of sensible subjects. The anime explores issues dealing with adult fear, parental abuse, and even sexual orientation. Yu, the manager of the club, is the most prominent example. Because he is homosexual, Yu attracts bullies and abuse, even from his own mother. It’s situations in the show that can be hard to watch if you find his circumstances relatable. And as I’ve said before, this anime isn’t shy about being controversial.But despite all this drama, we do have light comedy that has shifts its mood tone. A few examples includes Maki’s brutal honesty who sometimes says things that can be unintentionally ludicrious. There are also running gags about how certain characters looks feminine, so much that there’s even an episode with crossdressing. On the tennis field, competition may be tense but some of the strategies employed by the club are laughable. When you add more of the cherry character personalities of other club members, it can be quite a lighthearted anime. And the more you watch Hoshiai no Sora, the more you’ll realize that the show isn’t truly about sports competition. It’s about characters growing up.Director Kazuki Akane’s early work has little to no similarities with this anime so it’s rather refreshing to see him take on this project with his tone of storytelling. The character designs takes on a soft touch with simple art style. Most noticeably however, it’s the character expressions that stands out the most. Between the main characters and various abusive parents, it show how real the anime can really get. Watching the characters' speech mannerism is important as it allows us to judge on their character personalities. Finally, I do want to mention that this show has one of the most catchiest and stylish ED theme song of the year. The dance movements and choreography is exceptionally eye catchy despite some characters out of synch. It’s hard not to dance with them.At a pace of 12 episodes, this show dealt with drama on a level that I wasn’t prepared for. I came to watch this show for soft tennis but got treated with doses of drama in an emotional coming age of life. But that’s what makes this anime stand out so much. The daily adventures of the soft tennis club reminds us the reality of life, where we all have to face problems at one way or another."", ""Tired of watching all those isekai or comedy anime? Wanna actually watch an anime that’s close to real life? Then Hoshiai no Sora is that anime for you! But please let me tell you this. Don’t view it as an anime. Don’t just look at it as a fictional story. This isn’t for people who only watch anime to “escape” from real life. Watch it as if it’s actually happening in front of you, as if it’s happening in reality, as if the characters are people you know, as if you’re a third party observing what they are going through. If you can do that,...then watching this will be very worth it.Before I begin, I’d like to point out that this review will focus on what happened in the anime rather than how it happened. What I mean is that I won’t focus on things like character development or story pacing or stuff like that, since I’m not good with those aspects of stories. I’ll be talking about what they said and what they went through. This also may contain some spoilers.When I first saw a PV for this show, I thought that maybe this would be like other sports anime. Almost all the sports anime I’ve seen has had drama in its run, and Hoshiai no Sora is no exception. But when I watched it; boy, was I wrong. What makes this anime different from other sports anime is that the drama is a more realistic reflection of the problems that happen in real life, and the sport the characters play isn’t the main focus of the anime, rather, it is a catalyst for the characters to help one another with their problems as they go through life. The first episode already had something major happen, which made me instantly love the anime (Don’t get me wrong, though. I hated what happened.).Basically, the anime is about a soft tennis club on the verge of disbanding, until a new member shows up and helps make the club better than it was before. But don’t let the cute and clean art style fool you, as there are deep themes involved in the characters’ lives, and the characters try to go through them with the help of one another while at the same time trying to win a competition to save their club. The different problems that each character has are what make the show realistic.One of the major themes that is seen in the anime are family problems. Almost everyone in the team has a problem with their parents, and there’s a whole episode that focuses on families. First, we have Maki, and from the very first episode, we can see that he has a major problem with his father, who was very abusive since he was born. Then we have Nao, who has what we can call a “helicopter parent,” as we can see that she doesn’t support what he likes and makes decisions for him thinking that it is for his own good. Basically, almost all of them have family problems, and the tennis club is there to bring them together for each other’s support.Another theme the show tackled, which was something I liked, was sexuality and gender identity. In the second episode, one of the characters, Yuuta (a guy), was discovered by Maki to have liked another guy. This scene made me like the show even more, as this gives us some LGBT+ representation in anime where the supporting character isn’t judged or made a big deal out of, or used as a major plot point. In another episode, due to some circumstances, Yuuta and Maki end up talking about gender identity, and it is revealed that someone Maki knows is actually transgender, which gives us good trans representation in anime. This scene is probably one of my favorites in the series, as Yuuta mentions that he doesn’t know what he identifies as, and Maki says he doesn’t have to rush. It’s okay to take time to figure yourself out. What matters the most is being able to discover who you are and what you want to be, and it doesn’t matter how long it takes to do so. This really hit close to home, as I am also part of the LGBT+.Some of the characters of the show that I think are worth mentioning are Maki, Yuuta, and Mitsue. I have already talked Yuuta before, so I will be talking about Maki. He’s a 14 year-old middle school student who just moved back to his hometown and started studying in the school where the story takes place. We see that he is very active, he uses the stairs instead of the elevator, and he also does basically all of the chores. We then also notice that he has insane reflexes, and Toma (his classmate) also notices this and asks him to join the tennis club. After certain conditions, he accepts and that moves the story forward. What I like about Maki is that he’s one of the mature ones in the group. Because of what happened in his youth, he’s able to see the important things in life, and he’s able to talk about it with his friends. I think it’s even better given how young he is, because a lot of us when we were his age didn’t really care much about doing good things or not, we just did what we wanted to do. Maki does things his way, but with a goal in mind. Him being there helps improve the tennis club, and in a way, slowly helps relieving his friends’ emotions from all of their problems.Next, I’ll be talking about Mitsue’s character. When we first see her, the first thing we might think is that she’s a cynical jerk. I thought that way as well. But as the time passed by, I realized why she became that way. Her parents are unsupportive of her dream, and people online diss her for it, so who wouldn’t be cynical? While some of her actions aren’t good, they are understandable. The reason she was a jerk to the tennis club was because they were enjoying what they liked when the people around them don’t support them, when she was also going through the same thing. While she was a jerk, she still supported them, as she still went to some of their activities even if she said that she didn’t want to. And by the end of the anime, we can see that she really is to start rooting for them; she is more supportive to them and actually starts drawing soft tennis drawings, and she starts to ignore all the hateful comments thrown at her from art, which I think is a good development for her.Another thing I liked about the show was how they implemented some things that a lot of people worry about, but for others it doesn’t seem like a big deal. An example is when the club was in one of their activities and everyone was talking to each other and having fun except for Toma. Yuuta noticed this and asked Toma about it, and Toma replied that he isn’t good at slipping into groups and having fun. I also felt this, since I’m not that much of a social person as well.At the end of the day, even if there were tons of drama, it’s still a sports anime, and the sports did not disappoint. Even if the sports weren’t the focus of the anime, the show was properly able to explain the techniques and rules soft tennis has. The animations of the sports scenes were fluid, and it was really exciting to watch. The closest I have with playing soft tennis is badminton (the players have to use rackets), but I think I can say that everything here related to the sport is pretty spot-on. The sports peaked at the final episodes, and they were amazing as well.All in all, I think that was an amazing anime, especially with it being an original. They were able to talk and discuss about different problems that people go through in real life, and they were also able to execute the drama with the sports perfectly. I’ve noticed that people think it’s weird that they just placed some drama here and there without any build-up. But that’s how one would see it if they just viewed it as an anime. If one were to view it as a reflection of real life, however, not just a normal show, they’d be able to better understand why. You don’t just know someone in real life then they’ll slowly gives hints about their problems and then BOOM, that’s when you feel some emotion for them. In real life, you wouldn’t be able to know who has what kind of problems, and people you know that don’t seem to have any problems with their lives might end up being hurt because of them. You shouldn’t expect some build-up before that happens. But I guess that’s my opinion, since other people care a lot more about that aspect of the showI guess since I viewed it like real life rather than just the regular anime (probably one of the rare times I’ve done this), I thought it was amazing and pretty realistic. I was even able to learn about new topics that I didn’t know of before, like postpartum depression, and also some soft tennis techniques (not that I’ll ever use them though, I'm not that sporty). Although it ended with a major cliffhanger, with everything that happened here, I can say that this anime has rightfully made it to my favorite Sports and Drama anime, and if there’s a 2nd season, I’d definitely watch it. But this anime probably isn’t for those who watch sports anime just for the sports or cares too much about how much drama there is in an anime. then watching this will be very worth it.Before I begin, I’d like to point out that this review will focus on what happened in the anime rather than how it happened.

It can ruin a job, a movie or even an anime considering the rate at which the repetition happens. Sadly, in this anime, the repetitive drama was one of the worst things I saw in an anime.When it comes to sports anime, I tend to judge it based on 2 main ideas: The sport\'s part and the human interaction/plot part. So I\'ll do that here.First one is the sport\'s part, it gets a 3/10. As a tennis fan watching these games, I felt a lot of cringe. The rules are kinda the same but the excution is...bad. I can understand for example a player trying to touch the ball before it falls to the ground the first time but no one ever just jumps at the first ball like it\'s a bomb that would explode if it touched the ground. I could understand that the characters didn\'t care about the sport but they were in the club for a lot of time to not know the very very basic stuff.Also, using the same animation over and over again to make it seem like there was a big rally going and how the rallys were actually happening in the anime were so stupid.The idea of making every match end 4 3 or 4 2 to make it seem like it was close was also annoying. Why not let an underdog win if you want to make it exciting?I\'m really generous giving the sport\'s part a 3/10 tbh.Now to the 2nd part which is the characters. 3/10.""My parent/s hates me so I\'m sad"". This is legit 100% the drama. Not a single character has good parents iirc. Having a character who lives a shitty life because of a bad parent or 2 is ok but when this is almost every character in the anime then something is wrong here. This is just playing on the fan\'s feelings and sympathy in the dumbest way possible.There is the MC who is so wise, accepting and has the answer to every problem you face. The annoying female girl that is too edgy for the world yet is sometimes made as the victim despite starting a fight for no reason. The LGBT guy that has to be there for the anime to be inclusive even thought he helped like once in the entire anime. There are lots and lots more of bad characters filling the show up from the start to the end. This was just bad to watch simply because of the characters\' interactions which were just bad.There were legit 2 characters I liked to see that had reasonable drama, the red haired guy and his sister. I think those were the most acceptable ones tbh.Overall I would give the anime a 3/10. Really disappointing for an anime that had a very good start to it yet failed so hard. Considering how the anime went, it may get a second season but idk how it is going to actually be better than this one or even give a saving grace to this.Wouldn\'t recommend it. bad.

Everything in it made me feel happy. From the drawing of characters to the Tiktok dancing at the ending animation, I loved every bit of it - except for the cliffhanger ending because, unlike most anime, Hoshiai no Sora is not based on a manga - it is an anime original series.Now, basically, it is a sports anime and it focuses on the developments of a boys' soft-tennis team and how their lives change when a new member called Maki Katsuragi joins them. If you only look at it as a sports anime, I believe...it is up there with my previous personal best sports anime, Tsurune. However, as some other commentator here also says, it goes beyond being  sports anime.I have watched countless slice of life anime and Hoshiai no Sora/The Stars Align was the first one to include so many society-level and family-level everyday problems in it. Through the 12 episodes of the show, we see divorced couples, a father who extorts money from his ex-wife and kid, an overbearing mother, helicopter parents, a father who hurts his child and doesn't even consider what he has done, a mother who actually hates one of her children, an adopted child, a young man confused about his gender preferences - and all these in a very believable, very real-life-like storytelling. It shows how following a sport may make kids feel better, more confident, and how it canalizes them to establish good, solid friendships.I recommend this anime series with all my heart. it is up there with my previous personal best sports anime, Tsurune.

You got the idea, and it\'s up to them all to fulfill their duties, in Hoshiai no sora, nothing is fulfilled.We are embarking on a journey with dramas, which is a subject that should be a fair approach to the theme, starting with introductions, building and finally ending, even a drama without ending it can still be considered fair enough, because it had its introduction and its exploration, is a way of balancing delicate subjects that in fiction, an introduction drama and an ending can be unsatisfactory for some, but it has a way of balancing, but take all the things I\'ve introduced so far, throw them in the pan and wait for the damn script to be done, because that\'s what this anime does.Hoshiai no sora is a story of forced drama and completely irresponsible for what it introduces, it begins as a stage preparation to then present its characters and its damn drama, I defend to some extent as a first episode that has the right to be impactful and show what will be dealt with, but the rest after that is the same sensation of throwing a bucket of cold water every 5 minutes, because this anime has no consistency what it wants to address, just pushes scenes that only serve as cheap shock value in every episode, and sustains it as a way of feeding the viewer, God ... That\'s no way to make a drama. Dramas are meant to be impactful to the characters and the viewer, and they need considerable screen time for the viewer to absorb the situation, think about it and conclude their perspective, but before episode 2, without any hesitation we are already introduced to a conflict in the first seconds, completely forced and without any context of the character and situation, there is no usual construction of the character for us we care enough about him, the director delivers and says you need empathy, otherwise the anime introduced stupid dramas like Mitsue\'s being bullied (wow ... Two bully in the same episode just to recreate a scenario of both characters alone ... Not a little forced, is it?).I wish this was the last complaint if the crap in the next episode didn\'t introduce me A THIRD BULLY, which only served to irritate the soft tennis todoroki and show how sad its past is, and all done with 0 harmony, just inserting at the last second, and after yet another episode shock value we are presented with a horrible development, living proof of how victimistic this anime is in a supposed ""fight"" situation that should result in both sides, it completely ignores Itsuki\'s side, just to emphasize a hasty development of the person he is ... Completely ignoring any act of consequence that should have here. The next episode of continuity in the training plot and characters, introducing some and ending an episode with the same cliffhanger crap, can\'t this anime make an episode solid? It seems that everything needs to end in horrible things or injustices, which most of the time are not explored, and this is used over and over again in several episodes in a row, usually cliffhangers being the outcome of several episodes would be understandable if this series were mystery or some police plot, but it is not, she uses a script trick several times and this is all lazy and predictable.Not even the soft tennis aspect is addressed here, this story doesn\'t decide whether to be a sports anime or escape sports, introduces basic things about soft tennis and then focuses on dramatic episodes or screen times that contain it, it\'s an inconsistency that disrespects any objective means directed at a sports media product, it develops nothing, much less its message, primarily to whom is that message? What kind of dad will watch this anime and change its behavior? None because they don\'t have to stay up late watching a flawed soft tennis drama looking for a job.The protagonist of this anime is just Gary stu\'s tenth definition of the sports we\'re already used to, we might call him soft tennis Superman, it\'s stupid to see that he always has an answer to everything, making a character collision inconsistent Often, as always, it saves the team from decay, any sort of problem it solves, and its narrative function is that, while Toma is meant to be another child suffering from an incomplete drama. All the characters here are artificial and have an introduction of dramas and lousy characters, you are nothing at all here, there is no harmony, they introduce me to a fucking pair of soft tennis twins that we later found out to be the typical shounen opponents, and of course all of them are a blockade for the protagonists being tall, all the characters sink deeper into the narrative, it seems the script begs you to always care about them, I can\'t see any passion between the creator for his own project here, he just throws a lot of random problems at his characters and does nothing to make it happen, and when he has an outcome they are forced, only to watch Nao genuinely happy after ignoring his mother, dealt with in a way. simplistic way that the whole drama journey was useless and unconvincing. useless presentation of secondary characters who take too much screen time, all that class president building is minimally unnecessary and useless, I don\'t care about this character, so why should I see more of her without her having about 5/5 time in 5 episodes? We could explore some drama here ... But no, let\'s work on this girl that we can only sum up in aristocrat.This anime\'s matches are disgusting to watch, man this is one of the worst camera jobs I\'ve ever seen, not only that as lighting, it seems like I\'m in the same fucking day when I see a match and the camera in return for it makes you want to throw up every time they get the ball, Hanebado could be bad but the camera movement was good, here it looks like a guy stuck the camera to a soft tennis ball and decided that they should act that way. But returning to the expected drama in one episode we have a consequence being completely ignored from the previous episode, a drama being inserted, AGAIN BY ABUSIVE PARENTS, this shit is getting me tired, it seems like every week they want to introduce me to a new one and all of them being artificial, and what does anime do to exploit it or solve it? Nothing, the director is unaware of the word ""family dialogue"" that if possible could already progress the plot in such a way that you could observe an overview of the situation.Still about the episode he introduces me to a conflict between Mitsue, a characterization of Touma\'s friend, a characterization of Mitsue herself and ends the episode making a cliffhanger... I don\'t know how anyone looks at this script and says that he is solid, so many things being introduced and pacing does not contribute to any of this, this anime does not need so much stupid drama, I think even the worst romance this year did not have such a ridiculous pacing like this.I want to make room for this paragraph to talk about how bad episode 9 of this anime is, introduced Shingo\'s sister who conveniently gets lost because the characters are dumb and instead of making Mitsue follow the girl, they give the excuse for most useless character having to do the work and bear the consequence, if Mitsue feared the child would go to the roof, why the hell did she run to warn everyone? Consistency of character, you know, and with the unfolding Nao that was totally shaken by his mother ends up finding Shingo\'s sister, and here this anime managed to introduce one of the most forced and ridiculous scenes of the year, out of nowhere Nao begins to see the Shingo\'s sister as a problem blocking everything and lock the room ... Lazy and completely idiot, what kind of reaction is that? If it were to become a shaken character why at the announcement of the game he was not before? Shingo\'s sister was still sleeping right in the ward ... Lazy again, with the end of this part, Maki with his superhero ability realizes that Nao was to blame and saves Shingo\'s sister, Nao begins to blame himself and cry, while everyone around you is laughing ... What kind of reaction is that? No one noticed his suffering? Character reaction and consequence ... Then we have a super robotic dialogue between the protagonists about Nao\'s parents and parents themselves, over time the episode introduces us to Tsubasa who also has an abusive father ... Creativity, and in that same Tsubasa and his father quarrel, Tsubasa hurts his wrist and just runs away from home ... Which already makes it a lazy narrative convenience just to give DRAMA, and right now Shingo is leaving home to train, he sees Tsubasa, Tsubasa try to run away and Shingo decides to HOLD HIM ON HIS FUCKING HIS FUCKING BITCH that sucked at the forced convenience of the club, this is an involuntary comedy show every epic episode, tell me what Shingo\'s sister\'s conflict was for other than giving more details of Nao\'s family? For practically shit, it was so pointless that even the consequence of Nao being a liar was made.Why does this anime, instead of further antagonizing family figures, not show a second perspective or a really sad and shaken parent? In 11 episodes, not even the most important aspect between problem perspectives worked, and when it comes to everyday problems it\'s always good to see a more humane side of the situation, even if we don\'t agree with the actions, at least one perspective is there to support it. every basis and idea of \u200b\u200bdiscussing a daily problem as a theme, but this anime once again does none of it, just tries to push like every adult (except the teacher) here is a bad person with characteristics of a psychopath. To give you an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat I\'m saying, the familiar and minor problems this anime has introduced but haven\'t solved so far, and we\'re nearing the final episode:Maki\'s Dad (unresolved)-Touma\'s mother (unresolved)-Mitsue and something about drawings (solved?)-Rentarou (unresolved)-No and his mom / dad (unresolved)-Don\'t be a pathological liar (unresolved)-Tsubasa and the abusive father (unresolved)-Shingo and his non-biological mother (unresolved)-The chubby girl and her family (unresolved)-The very concept of soft tennis (unresolved)-Yuu regarding your mother (unresolved)-Touma and that mini jealousy inserted by Maki have enough prominence (was made in the previous ep and unresolved)Even if you tell me it can be completed in a second season, then why put a cliffhanger on an end of episode if the anime doesn\'t resolve to give at least 1/5 of Yuu\'s situation? Even if he has a season 2, then why insert 1000 dramas and not split them by season? Because it would be a more advisable and much fairer construction of script, it can complete several in a second season, but it has set a loaded plot in a bad way.About the final episode:This final stretch was disgusting, for skies that lousy production, they recycled the same shit about 10 times in the final match, it hurt my eyes because I felt in a loop that didn\'t go anywhere, there\'s no strategy in this anime, everything just depends on last minute momentum, please if you watch this for production value take any screenshot of the last episode and notice the whole background changing places at every point, character twisting in static images, errors of exchange of faces in the characters, seriously it\'s horrible how much even our main characters suffered from it, I\'ve never seen a storyboard get so messed up, you don\'t feel any harmony with the soft tennis match, the episode still tries to generate a repulsive drama from twins, but what impact on narrative do they have to have this conflict? Why should I care? The anime fails completely in character humanization, and so much so that this is forcibly inserted, we have 15 seconds just focused on those twins that make no difference, and the end of this anime is completely giant shit, didn\'t complete any plot that was established, introduced drama over Touma without any conclusion, Why the hell did Toma\'s mom start laughing like a shounen villain on the phone? I\'ve always said that the parents of this anime are portrayed as villains of Sword Art Online, but damn it makes it even funnier, and then turned Maki into a character from School Days, that final sequence was hilarious and so ridiculous, completely thrown and forced, I don\'t know how anyone looks at this script and pronounces the word ""solid"". because it is not, everything here is forced and artificial, even if you planned this series for 24 episodes, you don\'t treat your characters like trash and make a despicable ending, there are good kinds of ""bad ending"" in fiction, some of it built in a way, that has a strong base and that indicates it, making it unique, but here there is none of it, as I said, this series is a story that only if It focuses on pure shock value rather than continuing the narrative.About the productionThe direction of this anime is poor, frankly it doesn\'t have a shred of identity being shaped throughout the episodes, at least different camera angles that aren\'t merit either and a particularly very lively scene, but you have scenes like 3 FUCKING MINUTES OF FLASHBACKS OF TIME, and we\'ve watched them all and know how it got there, all unnecessarily to take up screen time in a futile way. This anime has one of the ugliest arts I\'ve ever seen, take any frame episode 8 and especially episode 11 that clearly should have been neat, compare all the scenes, not only in art but the animation of this anime is poor, at first they were good sakugas but it all boiled down to recycled scenes, recycled angles, the same recycled models... And all of this making the characters off model, I can make a folder in Imgur of how many times the anime has had it, it\'s no pleasure watching this type and the soundtrack here is nonexistent, there is only one piano track and one insert song THAT IS THE SAME SHIT OF OPENING MUSIC, for every moment the anime tries to introduce it I feel like throwing up, even moments that do not live up to the situation, are received by this song.this story feel me sick and has many inconsistencies and plot problems, dramas inserted in an indecisive way, the director does not know how to work on any theme that has been put in, let alone his characters, purely ""bad"" parents who repeat themselves in the script, would be important put a fresh perspective on them and show that some are even human for their child\'s concern, but the director chooses to make them villains of Sword Art Online, it\'s not an educational dialogue about a representative community that will make this anime something well, this story is completely dishonest with the viewer, the same applies when we are 3 episodes without a trace of Yuu and his mother\'s problems... They don\'t even work out the consequence, this anime can even disrespect the viewer himself, Jesus... He owes several explanations and solves nothing. escape, well ... You got the idea, and it\'s up to them all to fulfill their duties, in Hoshiai no sora, nothing is fulfilled.We are embarking on a journey with dramas, which is a subject that should be a fair approach to the theme, starting with introductions, building and finally ending, even a drama without ending it can still be considered fair enough, because it had its introduction and its exploration, is a way of balancing delicate subjects that in fiction, an introduction drama and an ending can be unsatisfactory for some, but it has a way of balancing, but take all the things I\'ve introduced so far, throw them in the pan and wait for the damn script to be done, because that\'s what this anime does.Hoshiai no sora is a story of forced drama and completely irresponsible for what it introduces, it begins as a stage preparation to then present its characters and its damn drama, I defend to some extent as a first episode that has the right to be impactful and show what will be dealt with, but the rest after that is the same sensation of throwing a bucket of cold water every 5 minutes, because this anime has no consistency what it wants to address, just pushes scenes that only serve as cheap shock value in every episode, and sustains it as a way of feeding the viewer, God ... That\'s no way to make a drama. Dramas are meant to be impactful to the characters and the viewer, and they need considerable screen time for the viewer to absorb the situation, think about it and conclude their perspective, but before episode 2, without any hesitation we are already introduced to a conflict in the first seconds, completely forced and without any context of the character and situation, there is no usual construction of the character for us we care enough about him, the director delivers and says you need empathy, otherwise the anime introduced stupid dramas like Mitsue\'s being bullied (wow ... Two bully in the same episode just to recreate a scenario of both characters alone ... Not a little forced, is it?).I wish this was the last complaint if the crap in the next episode didn\'t introduce me A THIRD BULLY, which only served to irritate the soft tennis todoroki and show how sad its past is, and all done with 0 harmony, just inserting at the last second, and after yet another episode shock value we are presented with a horrible development, living proof of how victimistic this anime is in a supposed ""fight"" situation that should result in both sides, it completely ignores Itsuki\'s side, just to emphasize a hasty development of the person he is ... Completely ignoring any act of consequence that should have here. The next episode of continuity in the training plot and characters, introducing some and ending an episode with the same cliffhanger crap, can\'t this anime make an episode solid? It seems that everything needs to end in horrible things or injustices, which most of the time are not explored, and this is used over and over again in several episodes in a row, usually cliffhangers being the outcome of several episodes would be understandable if this series were mystery or some police plot, but it is not, she uses a script trick several times and this is all lazy and predictable.Not even the soft tennis aspect is addressed here, this story doesn\'t decide whether to be a sports anime or escape sports, introduces basic things about soft tennis and then focuses on dramatic episodes or screen times that contain it, it\'s an inconsistency that disrespects any objective means directed at a sports media product, it develops nothing, much less its message, primarily to whom is that message? What kind of dad will watch this anime and change its behavior? None because they don\'t have to stay up late watching a flawed soft tennis drama looking for a job.The protagonist of this anime is just Gary stu\'s tenth definition of the sports we\'re already used to, we might call him soft tennis Superman, it\'s stupid to see that he always has an answer to everything, making a character collision inconsistent Often, as always, it saves the team from decay, any sort of problem it solves, and its narrative function is that, while Toma is meant to be another child suffering from an incomplete drama.

For those who are looking for a shonen sports anime with your typical summer camps and special moves and growing the team and lots of matches against strong teams and rising to the top, this isn't really a show for you.The story itself is something that captivated me from the get-go. It was something different, and something very captivating as slice of life animes are typically very appealing to me. The...characters are all very unique and have their own dramas going on with their lives, each of them having very upbringings and lots of problems going on in their respective houses, hence drama. The way the characters have grown from the beginning of the show through the main character, Maki, has been very enjoyable to watch. The way it explored psychological aspects of school students and the understanding it takes to see why the kids act the way they do blew me away. Unfortunately due to issues with the production studio, this anime currently remains half finished, as what was initially supposed to be a 24 episode anime got cut in half, and the director decided instead of rushing to finish, they would play out their story and finish whatever they could by their story.The music and artwork in the anime is very good in my opinion. I loved their choices for opening and ending songs, and the art really captured what was happening in each scene, with each scene exhibiting very normal stuff and drawn so well that you could easily absorb yourself in their world.Overall, enjoyment of this anime was very high. As I said at the beginning, this is a drama anime with sports mixed in, not the other way around. Many people might be left disappointed by the fact sports is its hook, but not me. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and would recommend it easily for someone looking for a school drama anime. The way it is able to capture the drama in the families of kids in school is quite incredible and still progress forward, juxtaposing fun moments with sad and tense moments, is quite incredible.

An ensemble characters that are unworthy and lazy, trained and motivated themselves to be better to an extent that none of them would have expected. Adding some preliminary matches, hardships, friendships and loses then we would have another exciting sports anime to look forward to.But, no. The story diverges from the main training and shounen plot into tackling issues that are actually happening but no one is comfortable...enough to address them. Especially not in this kind of trope, as the situations involving the relatively darker side of other’s childhood is too real for us to be bothered with. The feeling of watching as a bystander and not being able to do anything is simply too infuriating and to be frank, it just shows us how helpless they are, we are. And, I’ve never been so amazed by how well this is all executed.Rather than playing some sad backstory over slow piano sounds, it directly brings us closer to the characters through the way they see the world, how they have lived their entire life completely different than others and how they try to emerge from it. Overprotective parents, supportive parents, ignorant parents, aggressive parents and more are laid bare for us to see. To build that emotional attachment to each of the characters that can only be felt by truly understanding their life and witnessing their struggle.Then, the story further advances by adding in passion into the mix. Their hard work, their laughter and their frustrations are blended into the chance they have all created together. To make that ridiculed boy soft tennis club surpass all understatement thrown at it. To acknowledge their rivals and improve even beyond their limits. To accept themselves as who they really are. And evoking one of the most common emotion we all have, happiness. Because even in the gravest situation, they were never alone, as cliche as that be.The art and animation is by 8bit which is decent with the flow of matches involving tense situations handled smoothly. The songs, especially the ending is quite delightful with a relaxing pace to it.Overall, Hoshiai no Sora is like a dreamy story that has the burning fire a sports anime excels in creating, with a twist of realistic drama that keep you on the edge of the seat. It only marks the start of their journey, because as they struggle more and overcome challenges, amazing things will happen.As the Stars Align together. enough to address them.

To build that emotional attachment to each of the characters that can only be felt by truly understanding their life and witnessing their struggle.Then, the story further advances by adding in passion into the mix. Their hard work, their laughter and their frustrations are blended into the chance they have all created together. To make that ridiculed boy soft tennis club surpass all understatement thrown at it. To acknowledge their rivals and improve even beyond their limits. To accept themselves as who they really are. And evoking one of the most common emotion we all have, happiness. Because even in the gravest situation, they were never alone, as cliche as that be.The art and animation is by 8bit which is decent with the flow of matches involving tense situations handled smoothly. The songs, especially the ending is quite delightful with a relaxing pace to it.Overall, Hoshiai no Sora is like a dreamy story that has the burning fire a sports anime excels in creating, with a twist of realistic drama that keep you on the edge of the seat. It only marks the start of their journey, because as they struggle more and overcome challenges, amazing things will happen.As the Stars Align together.', 'This is too good for a 12 episodes I wish I can watch more episodes especially an original anime like this. It`s really rare to see an anime without any source from the manga why can`t it be any longer than this? I want more damn! I love this anime.This is one of those anime you get excited to wait for a whole week because all of it is cannon and good. The way the character develop and the genre of sport anime is rising not to mention this is the almost the same sport as the ""Prince of Tennis"" well this is not a...fantasy-like anime compared to POT but this anime deserve to air a little bit longer. fantasy-like anime compared to POT but this anime deserve to air a little bit longer.', ""So I have read some honest reviews, but something about this anime hit home for me. I understand its not directed toward the sport and the sport is kind of a side note. However, these background stories hit right on the target of a huge issue students and families face. There were several aspects that this story could have absolutely taken a focus to and this leaves a lot of open ended question to the actual audience. Yet, in the end this also leaves it up to the audience to use their own head to get the picture of what's going on. I personally got...super close to this anime due to the fact me and several of my other athletic friends went through similar instances that this anime is portraying and it took what's just an anime into a realistic image of what is actually happening in reality.Either way the characters in this anime hits the dark side of families hard on the head and in the end it really portrays a good image of the worst that can really happen in a family.I really liked that aspect and it always gave me shivers of the times things like this happened to myself or my friends.People can think what they want, but I have to say this is a great twist to the normal sports genre and really adds a little spice to the mix.Thanks for listening and I would love to hear your thoughts to this pushing issue as well.The DM's are always open for talk! super close to this anime due to the fact me and several of my other athletic friends went through similar instances that this anime is portraying and it took what's just an anime into a realistic image of what is actually happening in reality.Either way the characters in this anime hits the dark side of families hard on the head and in the end it really portrays a good image of the worst that can really happen in a family.I really liked that aspect and it always gave me shivers of the times things like this happened to myself or my friends.People can think what they want, but I have to say this is a great twist to the normal sports genre and really adds a little spice to the mix.Thanks for listening and I would love to hear your thoughts to this pushing issue as well.The DM's are always open for talk!"", 'At first, Stars Align seems to be a particularly well-told version of a pretty standard sports story. The underdog team of kids who just want to have fun playing tennis together! The one kid who could be the savior of the team and make them actually competitive! Camaraderie! Friendship!It works out especially well because of the lovely character design, animation, and musical score all coming together. It’s fairly slow and gentle, but the animation absolutely brims with life. The characters speak and move with their whole bodies, not just their mouths or limbs as needed. Their body language communicates their comfort with each other, giving...the impression that the team is a cozy way for them to spend time together, even if they’re not particularly fussed about competing.

That and sports. It\'s sad in a good way, a bit melodramatic, pretty cute at others. The Bluerays are gonna look awesome, the tv version has small botches in a style that lends itself to sakuga and tons of emotion.------Fans of sport anime are a weird beast.I\'m not saying they\'re stupid but it usually takes a few years for them to realize how things are. Remember how Kuroko no Basket...was considered identical to Haikyuu even though one just makes up superpowers on the spot while the other one has long slow arcs building tiny victories based on flawed characters. You can also look at Prince of Tenis\' dominance over the genre for almost a decade, the love for Tsubasa\'s remake even though everything it does has been abandoned as the genre progressed, or the common idea that the genre is a shonen when most of its tropes come from shojo. As you can see, I\'m extremely pedantic about this topic and I\'ll remain that way for the rest of the review.Hoshiai no Sora uses the sport as a comparison point with the drama. I feel that even mentioning that there\'s drama is a big spoiler, the first time we jumped from happy boys being sort of cringey in a good way to violent parental abuse it felt like the most beautiful kick to the face I took since Sangatsu no Lion. But every review mentions it so there\'s no point in hiding it. Those reviews have this weird idea that sport anime has to be this math problem that can be done a single way, usually with an underdog, a training camp, senpai\'s sacrifice, one big loss, side characters explaining basic rules for the millionth time (what is this ""goal"" event you speak of? are you telling me points are tracked? how uncool is to punch the other player in the nuts? what is this ""passing the ball"" sorcery you speak of? and so on). I\'m sorry to say that Hoshiai no Sora follows another sport anime style and that\'s a good thing you should learn to enjoy for your own good in life. If you think this isn\'t a proper sport anime then I guess Ashita no Joe, Ace wo Nerae o Big Windup aren\'t either. And now you\'re the elitist, but a really weird one.In a spokon sport is an end in itself. Ippo is happy because he has boxing, boxing is good because it makes him happy, sometimes sad but that\'s part of being happy. In an otome sport anime sports are a medium for pretty boys to be pretty, the way sweat falls is more important that how did he move 30 feet in half a second. In a sport drama sports are a tiny spider thread that buda sent to save you from hell, it will break at the slightest mistake and best case scenario Joe is gonna get a warm meal this week but probably just alcoholic rants.Some reviews say that sports are secondary to the plot. That\'s like saying firefighters are secondary to arson, I\'d say they\'re pretty important but I get your point. You won\'t get anything epic out of this anime, no one is gonna get metaphorical ghosts holding them up or a single instant of victory changing their lives forever. You\'re gonna get sad kids being justified in their sadness, trying to do something about it, maybe getting a tiny bit ahead in life, trying to help each other and clearly failing to solve the underlying issue because they\'re kids and not even adults can actually do that much.Complaining that this isn\'t doing a genre the way that you decided on your own it has to be isn\'t a critique, it\'s a really bizarre form of schizophrenia. was considered identical to Haikyuu even though one just makes up superpowers on the spot while the other one has long slow arcs building tiny victories based on flawed characters.

Going through most of the staff who worked on the character designs, art direction, and also the director just in case revealed very little to what I was feeling. I could see some semblance in some of their other works, but those are the ones I have yet to watch. While the ones I have watched from some of them look far different than this show....The closest comparison that I can think of is that it kind of looks kind of like Mamoru Hosoda’s work. I guess it’s mostly for the simple but appealing character designs, but it kind of can also be seen the background designs, color pallet, and the animation. I would even say that it has a very movie quality to it, but obviously downgraded enough so that it’s more suitable for tv. But outside of my nostalgia senses I would still consider the visuals to be overall good and appealing to everyone, the story on the other hand…As in the synopsis, Stars Align starts off as a story about a new Student being recruited into the Soft Tennis Club. Soft being the keyword as there’s not much hard on attention placed on the sport compared to other shows with sports in them as well. The sport and the matches do take a considerable chunk of time from the show, but they are not the central focus. There’s no hot blooded matches, no intense rivalries, no amazing techniques(maybe strategies,but not that much), and no grand competitions. The highest stake that the sport has is that the club might close due to the student council not wishing to put a budget into a club that does very little. Even then it’s not much of a looming threat, and more so something that is stated a few times just to acknowledge that it’s still a thing.What the show is more focused on is the personal and at times interpersonal circumstances that this group goes through. The most noticeable ones are the club members relationships with their parents. The two that are presented the earliest are of the main duo, Maki and Toma. Maki, the new student, lives with just his mother. As it turns out the father is abusive and extorts money from them via Maki when the mom is away at her job. On the other hand Toma, the leader of the tennis club has a strained relationship with his mother. This leads to Toma not believing he is as good as his brother, who also played tennis, and also leads him to have a sort of complex that leads to him having  fits of anger. The other club members also have their own child-parental conflicts from controlling parents, passive aggressive parents, being adopted and so on. I would go into more detail with them but there isn’t much which leads to the core problem with the show.This shows has an abundance of things it wants to do and has only so little time to do them. It wants to go into the lives of all the club members and what they’re going through, it also wants to focus on some non-club members as well, and it also wants to have some tennis matches have some sort of substance to them. This leads to the show only being able to not really go that far with any of them. It really touches the surface on almost all of the subjects that it brings up. The example I will bring up is the kid who becomes the manager for the club, forgot his name. The reason he becomes the manager is that he is gay and has a crush on Toma, and by being the manager he is able to support him. It’s obvious he won’t confess his feeling because Toma is seemingly not gay. Then it goes more into it by having the kid being maybe into cross-dressing and having a conversation with Maki about transgender-ism. Later on the Kids mother kind of finds out about him cross-dressing in a disapproving manner and that’s it. It never goes into depth with any of it which leads to much of it feeling vapid and forgettable, which in turn affects the characters in the same way.I really do believe that this show had what it took to be a really good show. However it’s stopped by having a mean case of window dressing. You can see the components at play at many moments in the show, but they are also so far removed that they aren't able to play a crucial part in the big picture, and end up being redundant. At most, I thought this show would only be average at best, but at every turn more stuff was added to a show without resolving what was already there. With so much feeling underdeveloped, I can only think of this show as a sad disappointment. The closest comparison that I can think of is that it kind of looks kind of like Mamoru Hosoda’s work.

It was able to use a lot of softer tones while still keeping a rich palate overall. The character designs were charming as well, and I thought it fit the anime very nicely. All of that sounded really boring, so I'll get to the good stuff now.I think the thing that drew me to this anime more than anything were the characters....Their stories individually were so, so interesting. I thought the structure of focusing on each character's personal lives at some point or another was fascinating because it made it all feel authentic to how it can feel to be in middle school and the effects that has on you and your family. I did think that maybe it was a bit much to have each character experiencing a problematic home situation, but at the same time, it does carry its own type of realism in it.The story as well as everything else in this anime was a bit weird to watch, but not at all terrible. I enjoyed that sports anime side of things because the plot used those situations very well to contrast the darker themes that can be found elsewhere in the anime. That being said, it was difficult to figure out where the focus was supposed to be for the story. Don't get me wrong, the idea of focusing so heavily on the characters individually while also bringing them together through a collective activity like soft tennis was really interesting to watch. However, it could've been done a lot better. The season could've been extended to really pay the proper attention to each element rather than giving many of them an episode or two each. As I said, the sport aspect did provide light moments, but it also wasn't balanced all that well within the rest of the plot. I felt like I could understand the weight of these boys' home lives and how difficult some of them were, and I was hoping that I could also find importance in soft tennis as well. Typically, sports anime will do a really good job of making the sport feel like it has stakes and weight so that it's more tense and ultimately fun to watch, but Hoshiai no Sora didn't quite hit that mark.Despite those issues that I had with the anime, I still truly enjoyed watching it, and I love the characters. It wasn't afraid to bring up heavy topics and discuss them, it didn't shy away from the darker parts of parenting, and it showcased strong friendships really well. It didn't develop itself as well as it could've, but it's still really fun and heartwarming to hang out with these guys. I'd definitely recommend this if you're interested because it didn't disappoint me. Their stories individually were so, so interesting.

The fact that the team behind this show got backstabbed explains why the series ended in such a dark note. But to be honest I completely love that dark ending. It´s the perfect display that there are not ""Happy endings"" in real life. You can have the happiest day, week or year in your life but there is always a tomorrow in which everything is possible.(Spoilers ahead)The premise is simple ""A soft tennis club is facing dissolution because of the lack of results"". In contrast with shows such...as ""The prince of tennis"" or ""Captain Tsubasa"", the main characters do not care about this sport or even the club. But at the story progress, we realized the students use this club as a way to be far away from their families. Physical, verbal and mental abuse, traumas, scars, overprotection and a contender for the worse mother in any show are part of the daily lives of these students.What people completely ignore is the fact that these students are teenagers, maybe 14 or 15 years old, they are in the worse period of life with their families making them feel miserable at any point, bad moments can happen at any time and no one can predict them.The team, at first, lack of talent is impossible to ignore. The club starts to work harder after the arrival of the main character who constantly call each member out. What makes this more real is the fact that, even after working so hard, they still lose, all of them, each one of them got better, but weren´t able to win.The arts and sound are 10, and that is not enough. The opening is so calm, with some hidden hints, while the ending is so funny and impossible to avoid.I can say without a doubt that I completely enjoy this anime, and it´s really sad how underrated it is. I said this before, but the fact that a lot of people complain about the drama shows how ignorant they are about real life. Family abuse is very common, it happens, just pay close attention to what your friends or classmates say and you will realize it. Bullying is also very common, and the producers know this, they know that no one came through this world without no harm.Finally, I have three things to say:1) Sorry for my English.2) If you want to watch an anime with displays of how sad and difficult life can be, this is your show,  a show where anyone can relate to the characters and their problems.3) Ignore the comments, this show is worth watching.Thanks for reading until here. as ""The prince of tennis"" or ""Captain Tsubasa"", the main characters do not care about this sport or even the club.

While production was cut short and we'll probably never get a 2nd season I think it's really amazing for what it is/was. Call me a masochist, but I really loved the drama and angst between the team and their parents. I really like how we got a focus on each of the families and how toxic parents can be. I really wished there was a completion of this story, but for what the studio managed to do I loved the idea and the production! Animation, Music, Characters 10/10 from me! "", 'I started watching the show when it was over halfway into it\'s runtime. I knew what I was going into, I knew this wasn\'t going to be just any sports anime. However, I didn\'t think I\'d get this attached to this show this quickly. I\'m very biased of course, I\'m a sucker for drama, and I find a strange sense of comfort in crying over shows, so it\'s no wonder this kind of show would be right up my alley.The story premise is very simple: There\'s a failing club who needs to stop being a failure ASAP, there\'s a new kid in school with a...skillset very fitting for this club, and with enough begging and money from the captain, the kid joins the club and helps them improve their game. In these 12 episodes, we got to see the team improve, we got to see them prepare and strategize and we got to see how far they\'ve come when we see them actually play.Of course, there\'s the side stories, there\'s the personal character arcs, but I will discuss them more when talking about characters, as I feel that ""story"" refers to the main plot. Despite only accounting for half of the story planned for the series, it manages to be self-contained and get through all the important plot points between the start of the episode and the end of the tournament arc without feeling rushed. I feel like the simple story compliments the complex characters quite well. 10/10Not gonna lie, what sold me on watching the show was the art. The artstyle, the character designs, the animation, it was all so pretty to look at, it just hooked me right in. I like the pastel colors the art usually has, which turns into much harsher tones with much more dramatic contrast in more serious scenes. I also love how depending on the scene, the transition between scenes can be either extremely smooth or very drastic, and it just adds so much to said scenes. The art in this show is just flawless, what can I say. 10/10The soundtrack is amazing, there isn\'t much to say here, but the sound design in this show is hands down the best I\'ve seen ever. The way the music can suddenly stop to create this tense feeling, the way the OST just enters into a scene perfectly. Each sound effect, each stop, every action is just complimented by the perfect sound. If I could, I\'d give the sound 11/10, but that\'s not an option, 10/10 it is.Before I discuss the characters, I will say something which I took into heavy consideration when evaluating the character writing: as of now, the show is only halfway done. It was planned for 24 episodes, but because it was cut to 12 late into production, the team working on it decided to release half of the story they intended while planning on a sequel in the future. As such, it makes sense for there to be many unfinished character arcs, along with it feeling like there were too many backstories for a 12-episode series. Because it wasn\'t intended for 12 episodes.I love all the kids on the team, I love the team\'s coach, I love Maki\'s mom, I love Mitsue and I like the president of the student council. One thing that many shows lack is realistic characters, but this show is one of the rare few that has very real characters. I know a Touma in real life, I know a Yuuta in real life, I know a Joy and a Taiyou, and I don\'t mean that as in I know people with these names, I know people whose personality is very close to one or more of the characters. The show introduces us to the main casts\'s personalities within the first 2 episodes subtly yet in a way most people can understand. You can basically break down every member of the team into one word. However, as the show goes on, and we learn more about the characters, we explore their different sides and learn about why they\'re even in this club. And that\'s where the problem begins.Remember how I said the show wa cut in half? This is the part where it\'s most prevalent. There simply wasn\'t enough time to go through everyone. The first 5 or so episodes had a major focus on Maki, our main character, and had we not been hinted with greater arcs for the other characters, you could\'ve convinced me that it was supposed to be this open-ended 12-episode series. But there was focus on other characters. Nao had the majority of his arc covered from what I can tell, but Touma\'s and Tsubasa\'s arc barely even started, with Taiyou and Mitsue only getting hints of future character stories, and that\'s not even talking about other characters who had established their stories! Had this been a stand alone series with no indication or hopes for a second season, I\'d give a 7 at best for the amazing writing but the lack of closure, and a 5 at worst. However, taking into account that there will be a sequel, and the characters will most likely get their closure, I\'m rating the characters as 8/10.The biggest issue this show has (other than the character problem caused by the current lack of sequel) is that it\'s extremely depressing. Many people claim the show to be overly dramatic to the point of it feeling unrealistic, mostly because it appears as though basically every character has trouble at home and it\'s very unlikely for there to be this many kids with issues gathered in one place. This section is basically where my bias for drama and sad stuff comes in, because I personally enjoy it quite a bit for different reasons.To me, having this many nutcases gathered in one area is normal. Anime conventions exist. Now seriously, people with similar traits simply attract. They all have different reasons for joining the soft tennis club, and I think they have such good chemistry because they understand each other\'s circumstances so well. One character is insecure about a certain aspect of themselves? The team makes sure they feel valid and safe. A character is put in an uncomfortable situation because someone doesn\'t really understand that they\'re making them uncomfortable? The team will call out the guy and fend him off. I feel like this wouldn\'t be possible had they not had that unity over their personal hardships, and their character dynamics are also amazing to watch as a result, adding to my enjoyment.I will say that sometimes this show can get TOO real. At certain points, I could relate with a certain character to an uncomfortable degree, and I had something resembling a panic attack for two minutes. I would definitely put some trigger warnings on this show, but I think a viewer can tell for themselves whether or not this show is for them after the first episode. 9/10Overall? This show is amazing, has great potential, will solve most of it\'s problems simply by having those other 12 episodes Studio 8bit planned on released eventually, Maki said trans rights, 10/10 for me skillset very fitting for this club, and with enough begging and money from the captain, the kid joins the club and helps them improve their game. In these 12 episodes, we got to see the team improve, we got to see them prepare and strategize and we got to see how far they\'ve come when we see them actually play.Of course, there\'s the side stories, there\'s the personal character arcs, but I will discuss them more when talking about characters, as I feel that ""story"" refers to the main plot. Despite only accounting for half of the story planned for the series, it manages to be self-contained and get through all the important plot points between the start of the episode and the end of the tournament arc without feeling rushed. I feel like the simple story compliments the complex characters quite well. 10/10Not gonna lie, what sold me on watching the show was the art. The artstyle, the character designs, the animation, it was all so pretty to look at, it just hooked me right in. I like the pastel colors the art usually has, which turns into much harsher tones with much more dramatic contrast in more serious scenes. I also love how depending on the scene, the transition between scenes can be either extremely smooth or very drastic, and it just adds so much to said scenes. The art in this show is just flawless, what can I say. 10/10The soundtrack is amazing, there isn\'t much to say here, but the sound design in this show is hands down the best I\'ve seen ever. The way the music can suddenly stop to create this tense feeling, the way the OST just enters into a scene perfectly. Each sound effect, each stop, every action is just complimented by the perfect sound. If I could, I\'d give the sound 11/10, but that\'s not an option, 10/10 it is.Before I discuss the characters, I will say something which I took into heavy consideration when evaluating the character writing: as of now, the show is only halfway done. It was planned for 24 episodes, but because it was cut to 12 late into production, the team working on it decided to release half of the story they intended while planning on a sequel in the future. As such, it makes sense for there to be many unfinished character arcs, along with it feeling like there were too many backstories for a 12-episode series. Because it wasn\'t intended for 12 episodes.I love all the kids on the team, I love the team\'s coach, I love Maki\'s mom, I love Mitsue and I like the president of the student council. One thing that many shows lack is realistic characters, but this show is one of the rare few that has very real characters. I know a Touma in real life, I know a Yuuta in real life, I know a Joy and a Taiyou, and I don\'t mean that as in I know people with these names, I know people whose personality is very close to one or more of the characters. The show introduces us to the main casts\'s personalities within the first 2 episodes subtly yet in a way most people can understand. You can basically break down every member of the team into one word. However, as the show goes on, and we learn more about the characters, we explore their different sides and learn about why they\'re even in this club. And that\'s where the problem begins.Remember how I said the show wa cut in half? This is the part where it\'s most prevalent. There simply wasn\'t enough time to go through everyone. The first 5 or so episodes had a major focus on Maki, our main character, and had we not been hinted with greater arcs for the other characters, you could\'ve convinced me that it was supposed to be this open-ended 12-episode series. But there was focus on other characters. Nao had the majority of his arc covered from what I can tell, but Touma\'s and Tsubasa\'s arc barely even started, with Taiyou and Mitsue only getting hints of future character stories, and that\'s not even talking about other characters who had established their stories! Had this been a stand alone series with no indication or hopes for a second season, I\'d give a 7 at best for the amazing writing but the lack of closure, and a 5 at worst.

But still most people see it as a rushed story, which in some parts it is.

The entire dynamic...felt rushed and there were some points where I felt like this was a waste of time watching. But the story while being rushed and confusing at some points keep you entertained, it doesn't only focus on how the boys team is a laughing stock compared to the girls team, but highlights a problem that each of the members of the boy's team has to deal with in their home life.I give the sound a art a 10 because oh my god the art and the music more specifically added to all the moments of the story and made them better. The music reminded me of Haikyu in a way that the music helped strengthen the story and the viewers enjoyment.Overall I would say this anime is a must watch, I just hope it gets another season. felt rushed and there were some points where I felt like this was a waste of time watching.

It was able to balance the sports aspect as well as the drama very well. All the characters in the main cast were well fleshed out and developed. Overall it is a very solid show but my main criticism revolves around the drama aspect of the showNow the drama is one of the main aspects of the show which is more focused on the sport in the overall narrative. Each character in the main cast have some issue/drama in their personal life which most likely involves their family. The show introduces...these issues but neither develops them further or concludes them and because of the large cast it can sometimes feel overwhelming. Only both the main duo Maki & Toma see some development but could've handled better. If the show had a longer episode count I'm sure all of the drama would've been fleshed out and better paced. Now if the show didn't introduce drama for each character the supporting cast would not have been interesting the slightest.On a positive note the characters. Each character in the soft tennis club exclusively feels very realistic and their dynamic is very entertaining to watch and that is where I found most of my enjoyment of the show. Sure I did find the drama each character dwelled in interesting which did service the narrative in some way but the soft tennis aspect was what told the story. Seeing a cast of characters progressively give a shit and learn the values of sport was so wholesome.Quick note the ed was banging.Animation wise. The animation is simplistic in design but with this simplicity, we have more fluid animation and this can be seen with the soft tennis matches.

I've heard that Hoshiai was originally supposed to have 24 episodes, but was cut down to 12, and you can definitely tell that the story is meant for a much longer anime. It's one of those where, the more episodes you watch little by...little you learn more and more about each and every character. But because the anime was so short, some of the things that were briefly addressed about certain characters over the course of 12 episodes had been left hanging at the end. Plus, the fact that the ending is an open ending just left me with further questions.As a sports anime, I think this was okay. Soft tennis (to me at the very least) doesn't sound like a very exciting sport, and if it was any other circumstance I probably wouldn't have watched this, but because there were implications of a much darker (and sometimes almost sinister) theme to the story I was able to stick around. I found it wholesome and heartwarming seeing the boys grow into better and more motivated players who work together with one another. When watching sports animes I typically always find myself getting attached because of the growth of a certain or multiple characters,and this anime was not different in this aspect. I still got attached and enjoyed seeing the boys become better friends and teammates, and then on more than one occasion felt fear and concern for them.I really loved Maki as a character. He is just great.If anything, I think this is a great Season 1 to Hoshiai with a heck ton of potential, that is if it gets continued which I really really hope it does. Whether that be through anime, or manga, or a light novel, there are so many things I would love to know about the story and the backgrounds of the characters that the anime does not cover.Overall, I would recommend this. It's nice to see more sports anime that tackles heavier themes while still getting its audience excited about a certain sport. little you learn more and more about each and every character.

It is exactly that, but the sports part of the story acts as a complement to the unique family problems that ALL the members of the club face at home which is obviously unrealistic (abuse is real, but happy parents are too), but since that\'s literally the theme of the anime so you just have to roll with it.While the main theme are the social issues underlying each...member in the soft tennis club, they don\'t gloss over the sport itself with more emphasis on strategy and tactics, instead of brute force (think One Outs). Taking a look at the main character, Katsuragi, he reveals to be talented at soft tennis despite never playing before and is an incredibly perceptive person. Not to mention he can cook, do chores (because his mum has to work) and is very close to being a Gary Stu EXCEPT that he knows this and isn\'t modest about his skills at all. Contrary to most sport MCs he is clever, manipulative, has a terrible personality, but is also a great leader. He uses this to his advantage throughout the anime to get his way partly for comedic purposes and mainly as the key strengthen the club effectively through planning and strategy. What I love most about him is how by using his brain a little more than others, he can identify the strengths and weaknesses of his team, his opponents and most importantly himself. He takes action on his own instead of waiting for a sign from God/before its too late, and is the main instigator for moving the story forward. Now he isn\'t omnipotent with this wisdom (its mostly that the people around him are kinda dumb), and it is very clear that he lacks experience in soft tennis; nevertheless, sports isn\'t about winning or losing for them and I loved watching the matches because it was very clear that each of the four pairs of characters had their own distinct style of play.I admit, I was only able to define the character by their type of abuse at home. Aside from the 8 club members, there is also the male manager and a girl who hangs around for no reason at all (recurring joke) with their own problems. In regards to these domestic issues, there are several problems with the way they were presented because it seems like they attempt to have you sympathise with them even though the person themselves aren\'t great to begin with and pretty much get away with almost anything just because they\'re abused (like the girl who started a fight then got comforted for being ""bullied""). That\'s only the worst problem and there were very little instances worth complaining about but I\'ll list the good things that came out of it:- when friends in each pair help each other with personal problems it strengthens their teamwork, and highlights the importance of being partners/working together- gives you a realistic insight on several kinds of domestic abuse, each of them are unique situations with some more severe than others- how the characters DON\'T deal with this problem. You might relate to the characters a whole lot, but that\'s why you don\'t feel sorry for them because each conflict only furthers the impact on the characters negatively and promotes their bad points/ugly side (feelings of helplessness, mental issues etc.).I\'m sure there are correct ways of resolving these issues but in reality, people don\'t (notice I mentioned realistic insight). Of course the characters don\'t do nothing at all, but sometimes certain problems have no (ideal) resolutions and you endure them until you become an adult which leaves one question:Is there a resolution?No. Not at all. The sports aspect finishes nicely but no one\'s personal problems reaches a \'real\' ending. Some characters have their own inner resolves though. Personally I don\'t like anime without resolutions and I especially don\'t like anime which end on a cliffhanger but it really works with this one (in fact it was a very satisfying cliffhanger). Now I don\'t mind a 2nd season but I am already quite content with what I\'ve seen so far. We\'ve seen several instances of complications and I would be surprised if any of them got resolved in 12 episodes. But like I said, sometimes there are problems with no resolutions and there are people that will never change. Rather than a romanticised ending where family talks and then make up (obviously talking about the less severe cases), Hoshiai no Sora only demonstrates the reality and difficulty of feeling ""out of place"", how you should act in these situations, (there is one scene in episode 8 which describes perfectly what I\'m talking about) and it applies to just about all the characters.About the art and sound, both are great. I love the animation, especially together with the ending song which is the main reason why I started the anime.  Its not groundbreaking music but decent enough. The art style is also very light and fluffy in a calming way.The best part about Hoshiai no Sora is the unpredictability. I binged watched this anime and was kept at the edge of my seat the entire time. Despite each character having unfortunate backgrounds, it is for the most part a happy anime that involves themes relating to friendship, teamwork etc. and the synergy between the members of the club who share similar concerns and accept each other may be of inspiration. member in the soft tennis club, they don\'t gloss over the sport itself with more emphasis on strategy and tactics, instead of brute force (think One Outs).

When it first started airing it seemed like it was going to be one of the best shows I'd seen in a while. Boy, was I wrong!!!The sound and art are excellent. I see a lot of people complaining about the art style being too simple or soft, but I think it works quite well considering the mood and subject matter of the show.bUt ThE sUbJeCt MaTtER.The show would have been absolutely stunning if the subject matter was handled with any kind of grace.

If an episode was dedicated to each character's tragic backstory, there would be a 12 episode series. However!!! Throw some soft tennis into the mix and suddenly there's no time.

It\'s incredibly easy to ignore as ""just another sports anime,"" but it\'d be incorrect to call it as much. The story involved is how they are connected through the sport rather than the sport itself. It\'s a driving point and a reason each of the different characters has breakthroughs for their characters, including in Yu and Mitsue.The story suffers somewhat from pacing issues in a few episodes, largely the last ones, but it has been revealed since that the series was initially meant to be 24 episodes and the studio cut mid-production. This issue makes...me feel it\'s not the masterpiece it could have been and I hope we get to see the rest in the coming seasons.Hoshiai takes a different approach to the overall sports genre in a way I can appreciate— The story was easy to get invested in and it\'s one of the few, rare animes I was capable of getting multiple people to binge watch and become attached to. I think that speaks volumes for the character development and story it wanted to give us despite its downsides.This was also the first time I truly saw myself in a character. It\'s corny, sure, but Hoshiai captivated the fleeting image of youth and the darker side\'s of family dynamics/growing up quite well— What it wants to express about a character and their story does well, even if we never get to fully see the resolutions (Thanks 8bits)....But actually, there\'s a nice realism in that fact as well. Life is messy, there is no perfect resolutions, and not everything will be tied up. So even if Hoshiai doesn\'t get its second cour, I still believe it delivered the idea it wanted to as best it could. Certainly, however, it is a story that suffers based on a forced lack of time.Despite this, it\'s still a story that will remain close to my heart for a long time to come. me feel it\'s not the masterpiece it could have been and I hope we get to see the rest in the coming seasons.Hoshiai takes a different approach to the overall sports genre in a way I can appreciate— The story was easy to get invested in and it\'s one of the few, rare animes I was capable of getting multiple people to binge watch and become attached to. I think that speaks volumes for the character development and story it wanted to give us despite its downsides.This was also the first time I truly saw myself in a character. It\'s corny, sure, but Hoshiai captivated the fleeting image of youth and the darker side\'s of family dynamics/growing up quite well— What it wants to express about a character and their story does well, even if we never get to fully see the resolutions (Thanks 8bits)....But actually, there\'s a nice realism in that fact as well. Life is messy, there is no perfect resolutions, and not everything will be tied up. So even if Hoshiai doesn\'t get its second cour, I still believe it delivered the idea it wanted to as best it could.

I\'m not really a sports anime fan but I\'ve seen my fair share of them. There\'s always a goal which the team is trying to reach, in this case I think it was portrayed quite well and doesn\'t seem unnecessary. I very much like how the story brings many communities together and supports them.As for the art, I think it\'s pretty and kinda suits the...anime. I\'m personally more into, and used to, rougher types of art styles so this wasn\'t really my cup of tea. The animation itself was smooth.I think the ending song is catchy but the opening on the other hand was a bit bland compared to it. Otherwise I really liked all the sound effects.I really liked the characters, there are so many different personalities mixed together and it works. You get to know the characters well and connect with them, because of that I think that the way the anime portrays them is very well done. The characters are open minded and positive most of the time so that\'s something I liked.I enjoy the anime very much and am always looking forward to new episodes coming out. The balance between the story and the characters is good, there isn\'t too much focus on either part.(Feel free to come criticize and give critique on this review in my private messages.) anime.

I went into this completely blind with a vague sense that it has something remotely to do with tennis.2. I have dabbled in and enjoyed various sports anime as well as dramatic anime.3. I will be giving my honest opinion of the story regardless of the positive/negative traction this anime initially received when it was still airing.Personally, I feel as though Hoshiai no Sora was received far...too harshly. It can be argued that this anime was not so much a sports anime but more so a drama that hid behind the guise of youths doing their best to achieve their goals. Contrary to what some may say, I personally enjoyed each character introduced. However, because there were so many characters it was easy for the story to feel as though it was neglecting resolutions.  In some ways, the anime did fail to truly conclude any sort of conflicts introduced in the story. Still, I found this anime to have done its job properly. I\'d also like to give props for this anime for doing something different. I won\'t jump on the whole LGBTQ+ or raising awareness of abuse bandwagons because, from what I\'ve seen, the anime has been praised enough for its attempts to introduce such topics without feeling too forced. Though the dark aspects of the anime may seem random or like hidden Easter eggs, still I felt that the inclusion of such topics to raise awareness was done as harmlessly as it could (though it still seemed to have fallen short of some people\'s expectations, I felt that it was done in a way that made it have a closer sense of what it would feel like to be in such hopeless situations).The anime\'s portrayal left various conflicts unresolved, but with that I hope that there is some sort of OVA or second season to round out the conflicts. I felt that the anime overall did a good job at introducing things, but surely with the amount of time and expenses needed to maintain anime it was only a matter of time until it felt rushed or for the low budget to show. People were clearly unhappy with two major factors with this anime: the unresolved conflicts and the Kirito-like (Sword Art Online) main character of tennis. Again, this anime felt more like a drama than a sports anime and that isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. It is unfair for a new person to suddenly be good at something, but I do think it is realistic to say that there are some people who simply have good sense in certain things. Of course, it wasn\'t entirely realistic, but I do think it was needed for a seemingly mature and empathetic character like Maki to appear as the fixer upper or else there would be no catalyst for the rest of the cast to deal with their own problems. This anime is dark, but it does its best to find the light in things by having tennis as an outlet. It isn\'t until the characters are so heavily motivated by something that they start to face their personal problems at home. I would love to see the resolutions to these abusive conflicts that very much exist in real life and were captured in this anime. You may ask yourself ""why is this happening"" at times, but I think it\'s a unique characteristic of Hoshiai no Sora that exposes that these issues very much exist. They are personal problems that a lot more people deal with than what we think. I believe the lighthearted message the anime was trying to express by focusing on the doubles of tennis is that you don\'t and shouldn\'t have to do things alone. Though there were many cliffhangers left, I do think Hoshiai no Sora was worth watching. too harshly.

But oh BOY this anime proved real quick it wasn\'t your usual sports anime. If anything, them being in a soft tennis team was just what brought those kids together and gave us the sad stories revolving around them.We\'ve got a bunch of kids, all struggling and having problems on their own. And as this is in Japan, Asia, we all know that school and parenting over there is different than our typical western parenting....The school system itself is much tougher and if you\'re bad at school, you\'re automatically a bad person. I loved that all these kids who got parents you\'d wish no one to have found their way into soft tennis. Even if at home life sucks, even if your parents straight up hate you and your hobby, once you\'re together with your friends and play this game, for these moments, all is well.There\'s different types of problems at home portrayed. We\'ve got the crazy mom who only cares about good grades, the abusive father who compares you to the ""better"" brothers, the mom who regrets having had another son. There\'s also the poor mother and kid who does everything at home, the adopted kid, there\'s also a very nice representation of lgbtq! As an lgbtq member and ftm myself, the episode where Maki suddenly talked about Shou and how he\'s also ftm, the way they handled this talk and mentioned that it\'s okay to be who you are? I teared up. Yu, poor guy/person, isn\'t sure if he\'s really non-binary, but he doesn\'t think he could live as a girl, nor keep on living for the rest of his live as a boy. But Mami is most supportive towards him the whole show and keeps saying that he\'s got time to figure it out.The show handles all these topics in such a mature manner, but still in a way kids their age would act. It was very refreshing.If there\'s just one negative thing I can mention, it\'s that it was cut short to 12 episodes from 24. The last episode was..very dramatic. Almost too dramatic all of a sudden, but they did plan for 24 episodes so it will get cleared up eventually. He did say he\'s definitely going to finish this anime!!Animation: 8For the art style itself, I liked it. It\'s got almost a minimalistic feel to it. It\'s not very vibrant, but rather soft colors. They did think about making characters eyes blink even when they\'re not the one talking, and that\'s something I always look out for because it\'s a nice feature for me~ The only thing that was a bit sad where when they were in a tennis match. Compared to other sports anime, where the sport is the main focus, it is clearly lacking ad not that well animated. It\'s a bit boring to watch almost, but since that\'s not the main focus of the show, it\'s fine.Sound: 8The opening was a bit boring, I kept skipping it. A nice song and all, but visually it didn\'t give that much, so to me it felt like a wasted minute. The ending though, I loved it so much, even know I keep looking it up on youtube! The song is great, very fitting with the show, and the animation gets a solid 10/10, very fun! For the rest of the soundtrack, I never felt that anything wasn\'t fitting, but I also can\'t recall anything specifically, nothing got stuck in my head. Went well with the show, but nothing extraordinary.Character: 9Thetes quite a lot the 12 episodes didn\'t mention yet. There\'s still a lot to unpack which I\'m hoping for the next 12 episodes to tackle! There\'s also the school council president who keeps appearing every now and then, and she seems to have a very interesting story from the little glimpse one episode showed, but there wasn\'t mentioned anything further. There\'s also a few others of the boys from the soft tennis team where I\'d like to know more about. But from the things we DID get to know until now, I\'m not disappointed in any way.Enjoyment: 10I have to keep reminding myself that this isn\'t the end, the anime was being made thinking that 24 episodes were in the making. Then it was cut short. It was a good decision that they didn\'t rush it and squeezed all ideas into the 12 episodes. And I did read online interviews that we really are going to get the rest, it\'s just not sure when yet. This anime wasn\'t your usual crazy rollercoaster that makes you scream from beginning till end, but a great ride you wanna go on and invite friends to enjoy together. I teared up, I laughed, I had my shocked moments. I\'ll definitly re-watch this one soon and I hope more people will give it a try!

Though this anime is certainly centered on the sport of soft tennis, it deals with a number of other topics in a relatively mature way. A big contributing factor to my score of 7, however, is the fact that, despite the impressive way the show deals with topics like gender, sexuality, familial/parental conflict, and abuse, it is simply not long enough to adequately discuss or resolve each character's situation. That isn't to say that each issue needs to be resolved, but rather, the way each issue is brought up, it...seems a disservice to leave so many things without any sense of hope or conclusion. This review is being written before the show's conclusion, of course, but it is difficult to imagine anything beyond the sport itself reaching a satisfactory end.The nature of this anime falling into both the sports and drama genres is unique and appealing, and so far, I have genuinely enjoyed watching it. The art is pleasant, the characters are unique, and the drama aspects are realistic on an individual basis (including physical and emotional abuse, helicopter parenting, gender identity, etc.). It also has a lot of the best elements of many popular sports anime, including prodigious players, teamwork/team bonding, and the underdog rising under pressure. However, I fear that a 12-episode season wasn't enough to do the idea enough justice. seems a disservice to leave so many things without any sense of hope or conclusion.

It's simply amazing how the creative team managed to get the watchers feel so involved (and hype) for such personal, small scale conflicts.The story is presented as a slideshow of our revolving door of central characters, each taking up a mini arc consisting of an episode or two. These arcs run concurrently and sometimes intersect with each other. The surface core narrative, as typical of a sports anime, involves trying to get a downtrodden team to win some grand prizes or another. What makes the execution...stand above and beyond the typical sports anime is how few conventional tropes it uses. There's no secret technique that helps our team turn the table instantly, no training montage that inexplicably turns an amateur into a pro in ridiculously short time frame, no wizened mentor with atypical teaching style that turns out to work regardless...Only an athletic guy with a grasp on how to read people. In fact, the endurance training montage FAILS the one time they explicitly mention relying on it. Teamwork, unconventional tactics, and psychological warfare are what allow our little guys to punch above their weight, and it's this devotion to realism that makes every match so engrossing for there is no plot armor or DEM BS.Of course, none of this would mean a thing if the there isn’t stake in the match for us audience, and it’s here that the show really shines. Without going into too much spoiler, the existential stake we learnt of at the beginning is not the focus of the show, rather, it’s the characters who made it enjoyable to watch.Art direction: 7, perhaps 8/10At the end of the day, production constraint hits some anime harder than others. Even a beautifully animated masterclass like Yuri on ice had to reuse footage, so that part is unavoidable here. The problem lies in the fact that with only 2 major matches, the animators don’t have a large variety of stock footage to use. This results in scenes that are cut and paste from a minute earlier showing up. Some 3D models in the background also stand out jarringly, though one is unlikely to notice this unless especially nitpicky. An emphasis on watercolors with fadeouts in key scenes make the whole thing have such a soft feel, almost pastel aesthetic. Reminds me of Wandering Son, too. That said, what reused footage there is is all gorgeously animated, and the running shots in the 3rd episode alone should bump Art to at least a 7.Sound: 6/10Sound direction is OK, not much to note other than how satisfying the sound of softball hitting the racket is. I could listen to it all day, which I did binging this show.Character: 10/10, full stopIn 12 episodes, there are basically only 2 major matches, with the rest of the time spent on showing the characters dealing with their lives outside of the clay ground. Nobody acts in a blatantly unrealistic way, and this really helps sell the social commentary of the anime. Hoshiai shows us the trial and tribulations of dealing with helicopter parents; the uncertainty of being LGBT in conservative Japan; what it feels like to live under someone’s shadow; the long-lasting trauma of abuse… These are obstacles between them and the field, so every swing of the racket feels like a victory earned for them. In no uncertain terms, the anime shows its audience how despite their flaws, these kids can achieve much greater if only their environment allows – a message both empirically and morally true. It’s so, so refreshing to finally see students act like humans with actual depth that they are instead of caricatures written by those who fantasize about high schoolers: Sex objects constructed to be harem candidates with personalities to match, introverted losers who are inexplicably popular, power fantasy baits…Hoshiai’s cast are teenagers being hurt by the world around them and find solace in similarly hurt people. Each of them has long tried to deal with their pain on their own, but only by opening up to their true companions did they grow as people. Witnessing the soft boy protagonist threaten homicide to his fear to protect his friend, then breaking down in his friend’s shoulders later; or seeing the 2 bullies macho dudes crying about how they can’t tag-team together in the big match; or how the team console a girl who was recently ganged up on by some bitches even though she’s technically outsider…makes me tear up. This, in my view, is why each swing of the racket feels like a small, personal victory for both the cast and the audience. stand above and beyond the typical sports anime is how few conventional tropes it uses.

I'm sorry,...but I just find sports boring in any form.What this results in is spending a lot of time with the boys of the soft tennis club (Some more than others), which gives them a chance to be fleshed out as people, rather than just being built off of basic archetypes.However, since some of the other characters do not get as much screen time, due to this being a short 12 episode season rather than the originally planned 24 episode season, there is also a large amount of lacking and wanting more from the writing and characterization, which especially rears its ugly head in the last three episodes of the season, and especially so on the sudden cliffhanger ending (Which I won't get into but let's just say it leaves a lot to be desired and did knock off a point from my overall final score).The art is pretty low budget in a very large majority of the scenes and shots, with several instances of heavily noticeable, cheap CG. I feel that the use of budget animation and art could have very easily been eased with a slightly brighter color palette, but I can also understand how that may have taken away from the realism that the series aims for.Overall, do you crave a sports anime that focuses more on characters above action?

Do not expect a fully completed story, but do give this series a shot, and just hope that we get an actual conclusion to the story and aren't just stuck on a rushed cliffhanger for all of eternity."", ""Just like how some people may perceive Orson Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons as an unfinished product with lost potential due to studio interference, Stars Align finds itself in a similar predicament. Stars Align became the victim of production issues when its originally intended 24 episode run was cut down to 12. Even though it only tells half a story and there are countless unresolved plot points, it's undeniable that what was presented from Kazuki Akane's vision was masterful. The fluid animation during the tennis matches, Akane's delicate handling of topics such as gender and sexual identity and domestic violence, the boundless empathy for his large...cast of characters, the heartwarming camaraderie between the cast, the amazing soundtrack, etc.. all allow me to look past the abrupt ending and appreciate this work of art for what it is cast of characters, the heartwarming camaraderie between the cast, the amazing soundtrack, etc.. all allow me to look past the abrupt ending and appreciate this work of art for what it is"", 'I thought it was excellent anime, I loved how each character had their own tragic home lives but Soft Tennis brought them all together and it was used as a coping tool and in a sense it was therapeutic for them.

However, the series manages to explore deeper connections between the charactersand their personalities; i.e Maki and Toma are victims...of domestic violence - Maki's abusive Fatherleeches money from his Mother whereas Toma's Mother loathes him and at one point during his infancy, he had hot water poured onto his back by his Mother leaving him with permanent scarring. Their personalities supplement each other because they understand each other's domestic hardships.Furthermore, Stars Align explores bullying and its roots through Kasuga who was born into a wealthy family with many internal conflicts which may have fueled her passively aggressive personality. This series also manages to explore a Rintaro's exposition to being adopted which adds fuel to the flame and stirs the plot a bit more. Overall, I'm expected a heated sequel since that ending left a large cliff hanger with Maki and his abusive Father...Art & Sound: 7/10 8/10I noticed a few action scenes where CGI was heavily relied on in the character figures but it wasn't bad comparedto a few series that fully implement CGI characters. I enjoyed some of the transitions that were used in the series such as the fading shot when Maki's abusive Father approached his apartment. Art & Animation were pretty good, I still don't understand how this series flew under the radar with that many fans enjoying Haikyuu, this series is similar but doesn't have an obnoxious and greedy MC like Hinata.The Outro Song is amazing, it suits with the dancing outro... One of the best mixes of choreography and sound design in a non-idol/dancing Anime I've seen in a while! Enjoyed the background Soundtracks and character VA.Character: 8/10I didn't hold high expectations for this series in terms of character development since sports series tend to revolve around a power duo which makes the other characters in the team more or less redundant to the plot however, the drama that occurs between the main characters of the High School Soft Tennis Club allows each character to have their back story focused on. Love triangles, unrequitted love and oblivious love are subtle in this series but I think the sequel will elaborate on this between the Main female and the homosexual male character(s).Overall,  I think this series is worthy of an 8/10; I don't have much experience in drama but watching this was fairly an intense binge of a sports drama. of domestic violence - Maki's abusive Fatherleeches money from his Mother whereas Toma's Mother loathes him and at one point during his infancy, he had hot water poured onto his back by his Mother leaving him with permanent scarring.

I watched the whole thing in like two days, which probably doesn't seem that impressive because it's only 12 episodes long but I haven't managed to binge a show like that for a long time. As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this show.Story: 9/10The story of Stars Align gets pretty deep at times. Hell, the vast majority of the characters have some kind of family-related emotional baggage. Considering the amount of depth each character has, it might seem like it'd be difficult to link them all together into a short but cohesive story but Stars Align does this...extremely well while still managing to sprinkle in some actual soft tennis gameplay on top of that.Art: 7/10The art style for Stars Align is, how do I say it, pretty average. I've seen plenty of anime with similar art styles. It's nothing special however that doesn't mean it's bad. I really like the art style for this show. It doesn't need to be anything fantastic because the story props the show up well enough by itself. Also, the animation during the soft tennis sequences is *chef's kiss*.Sound: 8/10I'll be honest, I didn't really pay attention to the sound while watching this show. However, I did think about it and I did think that the sound was used well. The use of music to accentuate the emotions that we, as the audience, are supposed to be feeling. So yeah, in my opinion, sound is used well in this show.Character: 10/10I think that the writers of Stars Align did an amazing job of characterising everyone. As I mentioned previously, the vast majority of the characters on the Shijo Minami team have some kind of family issues and the writes did an incredible job of making these problems and the character's reactions seem real. Each of the characters feel like someone who could really exist in any Japanese middle school and the friendships they have with each other feel grounded in reality, making it enjoyable to watch the boys interact.Enjoyment: 10/10As you can probably gather, I really enjoyed this show. Hell, I've enjoyed it the most out of any show I've binged in a while. Everything about this show absolutely hooked me. It's only been two days since I was introduced to this show but I'm already so attached to the story and characters. This show got me feeling things I wasn't prepared to feel but hey, I'm not complaining. If you take the time to watch this show, I guarantee you that you will get at least some enjoyment out of it.Overall: 9/10Stars Align was absolutely incredible and well deserving of the high rating I gave it.

You meet a misfit Soft Tennis Team that struggles both with one another and in their own personal lives.This anime does not shy away from touching on a wide range of social issues such as gender expression and domestic violence to helicopter moms and pressures of public life. Stars Align shows compassion and understanding through tackling these topics, for better or for worse.There are complaints that the anime has too many characters suffering with issues in their personal lives. Though I find that this is...a strength of the show. The show is about these social issues, it's entirely fine for all the characters to receive unique backgrounds.Now this is also partly a sports anime and with it comes competition and sports montages. I think this was done very well and I found the action highly engaging to watch.Admittedly I may have a soft spot for this anime as I am a former tennis player who left the sport from burnout and stress.

I thought I was just going to watch some lighthearted tennis action of saving a club. WRONG, it's much more.Hoshiai no Sora, or Star align is about a soft tennis club with a bunch of loser club members. They've never won a game in two years or more. The student council president decided if they don't win a single game in the tournament, they need to disband. Desperate, they recruited someone with good athletic reflexes. Thankfully Maki, the transfer student, was convinced to join.As we follow their club, we see how...they work hard and do improve. However, it also shows the realistic side of people. From the games they manage to win, to family life, to personal issues. The scores and methods of playing are realistic. The family lives and personal issues are realistic.I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into it too deep. Basically, if we're not in abusive relationships, we forget it's out there. There's so many different forms and types of people out there, we forget. This anime shows abuse in many different shapes and sizes, whether physical or mental.It also discusses the issues of LGBT which I fully support. Instead of the typical gayness, they bring in the issue of transgender, which hasn't been a big topic especially in anime.I'd say give it a chance. This is an anime where you actually want to pay attention to the opening and ending songs. Look them up yourself with the lyrics and you won't regret it. Beautifully written songs and if they had more time, I bet the story would be great too.IMPORTANT!!!Turns out, the production team have been working for over 2 years, but the team was backstabbed and told they could only send out 12 episodes. With not enough time, they had to either cancel it or cut their 24 episodes down to 12. That's why so many issues are left in the show and it seems really unfinished and rushed.

Going into this anime has you absolutely floored. Everything that happens is the opposite of what you would expect, and it's hard to try and break away from the story after the first episode.Hoshiai no Sora is something different. It's so in your face with it's themes that it's gratifying--a far cry from what we continually see in other shows were we have vague internal dialogue and decision making. With this show there are no holds barred, and it's honestly the greatest thing. It isn't the first show we see with representation...in certain subjects, but it's the first show I've seen with those subjects being so prevalent and important, a keystone to the character's morals rather than just a novelty.That being put aside, I want to talk about the art for a little bit. I'm just..in awe by it all, really. Studio Eight Bit killed the game with this one. The contrast between the story's complex elements and the animation style makes it, honestly. In moments we expect to see an immensely expressive face, we instead see the soft features of a middle school student, but in a way that doesn't leave us underwhelmed, in fact, we want to see more.Getting into the meat of the whole issue surrounding this anime, though. The only reason I don't give it a big whopping ten is because the story is not finished. People who aren't die hard nerds probably aren't aware of the conflict surrounding Eight Bit and the director of the show, Kazuki Akane. Be sure to check out his twitter for official statements and more details on it all, but the long and short of it is that Hoshiai no Sora was meant to have a twenty-four episode run. Not twelve.Kazuki Akane has promised the viewers of Hoshiai no Sora that he will complete his story somehow, luckily enough. So far there aren't any updates other than that, though.Finally you've reached the end. All I'm going to finish off with is saying that this show is highly underrated, and that if you have the time, please try and give it a watch with an open mind, especially towards the end of the series when everything is fast-paced due to Eight Bit cutting down the production length.Have fun watching, friends! in certain subjects, but it's the first show I've seen with those subjects being so prevalent and important, a keystone to the character's morals rather than just a novelty.That being put aside, I want to talk about the art for a little bit.

However, nearing the end of the show more complications arise without any of the past complications being resolved. So it left the viewers with more confusion and leave a sort of bad taste.Another gripe that some may feel is that they did not achieve any spectacular results for the sport part of the anime.

At the time of this review, the series does end on a cliffhanger and there are prospects of a film, or something else, to continue and clean up all the loose threads.

It's on the verge of being disbanded and while trying to save its future a new team of troubled kids join to persevere. The club allows each student to...have a break from reality and their troubles at home. It allows them to express themselves and to gain more confidence in who they are.There is one episode that deals with gender identity and has a lengthy conversation about a side character that is trans and their experience with transitioning and one of the main characters coming out as questioning non-binary.Even though the series does end on a cliffhanger, what these characters were put through is very emotional and you can see that their arcs are still ready to be explored. It can be very hard to watch at times, and for tackling such heavy topics more deftly than I would have thought I'd recommend others to give this a chance. have a break from reality and their troubles at home.

It isn't realistic and it is very dramatic. All things I would argue were intential and are strengths of the show.The sports anime can either be funny, realistic, serious or very dramatic.

How the two overlap is interesting to watch and the main team cast are flawed while maintaining a likeable humanity.The downsides to the show are it's edge-lord open ending and the lack of development for the home-life scenarious as dividing screen time between both the home, school and soft-tennis courts for a whole sports team was definitely a push for 12 episodes.That said, the character development is meaningful and the show leaves me with a weighted sense of awareness that what can seem simple on the serface isn't always what it seems and life gets really complicated, really fast, especially when you're just a kid.I recommend this anime if you like teen drama and sports anime.

Sadly we only get to see half of the true story. Final episode brings shocking ending then some questions are left unasnwered, much as you wish for second season.This anime is still a mainly drama focus theme instead of sport focus theme, yet they excel none in either catergory. Sport serve as glue in helping stick the boys together. If music coporate the dramatic scene were good enough and each character story had more screentime, this anime would be a honed pearl comparable to visual novels."", ""I really enjoyed this anime, but I know it wasn't perfect. I feel like it's not for lack of trying, and that it's clear the writers had an idea of what they wanted this to be, but I just think it wasn't possible in the 12 episode format. It's almost as if they have all these well-thought-out and interesting characters and stories, but they weren't prepared to sacrifice any of the themes for the sake of fully developing a few. I've seen a few reviews saying it's unrealistic for all the characters to have problems, but I don't think it is, I just think they...needed more time. It's obvious maki's story was the one they focused on the most but even that one seemed underdeveloped at the time. This is all very negative for my overall 8, but in the end, I wasn't going into this anime looking for perfection, and I still loved it, the art is cute in a typical slice-of-life style, episodes are appropriate paces, the scenes seem well set up, and the character dynamic was realistic and enjoyable. The characters though underdeveloped seem to be well-rounded, and even though there are a few moments of importance I felt could have been done better, it takes away from my enjoyment. I also don't see this get the credit it deserves for the use of sound, because despite it being relatively simplistic, it was amazing. The sound was able to set up an atmosphere, keep the audience's attention at keep moments, express characters' emotions, and remain unintrusive. So is this show everything it set out to be? No. Did I thoughtfully enjoy it and would watch a second season in a heartbeat? Yes. needed more time.

Not for everyone, I guess, but it\'s a refreshing kind of sports and slice of life mix.It addresses modern topics (domestic abuse, gender and sexuality, amongst a few others) in a very respectful and natural way that I have yet to see from other popular, seasonal animes. (Disclaimer: not claiming seasonal animes are bad in any way, it\'s just a different feeling.)The animation is fluid and entertaining to watch, specially in the soft tennis parts, and I commend the artists for how they draw character\'s expressions. The music gives...it a final touch, and it really shows the people working on it know how to play with sound cues to tell us a story.In general, I found Hoshiai no Sora an enjoyable experience.

I started this back when the first episode had aired and I didn't exactly know what to expect. After half way through the first episode I just thought simple sports anime taking place in middle school, I probably wouldn't enjoy it too much but I don't mind finishing it anyways. By the end of the first episode my mind was completely changed, I was completely caught off guard and intrigued at what...there was to come.I tend to rate the anime I watch out of how much I enjoyed it, not so much technical aspects and things and so for that I give Hoshiai no Sora a solid 8. I really did enjoy the twists and turns and roller coaster of emotions it had brought me on as it covered a lot of heavy hearted issues that aren't seen often in settings such as middle school. Soft tennis, the sports aspect of the anime is used almost as a blanket of comfort, like an escape for each of the characters who struggle in their home lives and their personal minds. Soft tennis becomes more than just a sport, but a place where they can let their troubles go and feel less of a burden on trying to figure out themselves in an age where it's easy to become trapped as you are not old enough to stand your own and are quite dependent on your family, even when your family is quite abusive.The story does a really good job of discussing issues ranging from abuse, neglect, and gender identity all while normalizing mental health and mental strain. However, unfortunately, due to the limited number of episodes (a truly unfortunate matter as it was initially meant to be 24 episodes before it got axed too early, honestly it's really sad how the production team got the rug pulled under their feet after 2 years of hard work), the anime struggled to fully flesh out each of these topics. This made it a little choppy and had it feeling a little unfinished, but that's just it, it was in fact, unfinished.I do believe with the 12 episodes it was given, I would suggest trying it out anyways to get a feel for the potential that this anime has. It may seem unrealistic as seemingly every kid on the team has some sort of issue, but I find this is more reality than most believe. We never really know what is going on in the home lives of our peers, and it is a very real possibility that a lot of kids in middle school into high school struggle with. Although choppy, I think this anime does very well in depicting the personal struggles that kids go through around that age, and their will to take a risk and tackle such issues is commendable.

"", 'although stars align is dubbed as a ""sports anime"", its more of a ""slice of life"" type of show. there are some sporty scenes of course, though they don\'t get you as hyped like haikyuu or free! does. but the way this show mixes drama and sports together is perfect. because of the drama, this show personally hits really hard in ways where i could relate to a lot of the characters and that\'s what i loved most about it. every episode had you wanting to know more about the characters and what they were going through. stars align is one of the most relatable...anime\'s i\'ve ever seen.overall rating: 9character rating: 9enjoyment: 9story: 8 anime\'s i\'ve ever seen.overall rating: 9character rating: 9enjoyment: 9story: 8', 'SPOILER WARNING:First of all, for the lazy people out there, a TLDR will be at the end...Okay, so, the anime has a very slow start to it, and I had to force myself to watch it without looking at the synopsis because I\'m not that into sports anime. Low and behold, the sports part to it doesn\'t actually have much action in it, a little funky animation, but tbh overall not that bad.The story focuses on the main character, Maki (using his nickname cause who has time to remember their long ass names) who just moved back into his home town. He transfers...into the school the story focuses on and gives off a vibe of a very nonchalant, mind-my-own-business person. He gets confronted by the Soft Ball Tennis Captain in order to be recruited, to which he was denied, but eventually accepted. They made a deal and a bit of the MC\'s past is revealed.Turns out that the MC\'s dad is abusive, his parents split up due to this fact, and although they split up, the dad still visits from time to time to basically steal money from them. The mother works constantly and possibly determines the risk of aggravating her ex-husband too risky, and so she lets him steal money. The moments where the trash husband would ""visit"" had me going for the first half of the show, since, I\'ll be real honest here, nothing real interesting was actually happening.The story progresses and it turns out that pretty much all of the tennis\' members\' parents are literal trash bags besides a few. Some kids are adopted and one is struggling with his identity. Those parts were a bit ehhhh, but since I\'m into the whole depression, sad, angsty side of anime, I was all for it. My personal opinion, and may very much differ for someone else.Now the part that made me rate this show higher than I would\'ve and lower than I would\'ve, is the last episode. Maki\'s tennis partner\'s (ngl, forgot his name) mom just told him that she was going to divorce her husband because she can\'t stand the failure that is her son. Like I side, most of the characters\' parents are actual trash bags. Anyways, after that, when Maki gets back home, he sees that his mother is not. And that worries him. He sees the envelope used for paying his dad on the table, ripped open and empty. This alights rage in him, not just any rage, cold rage. He goes out and purchases a nice long knife from a store before heading out to his dad\'s apartment. There, he stands in front of the door, and a thought runs through his mind persistently, ""We\'ll never be free while he\'s still alive."" AND THE FREAKING EPISODE AND SERIES ENDS THERE. I HATE CLIFF HANGERS AND THAT JUST BROKE ALL LAWS OF COMMON HUMAN DECENCY.TLDR: The anime didn\'t really know what it wanted to be. The sports sequences weren\'t all that interesting and the drama was way too dramatized (but I liked it since it was dark). The MC was also a little too perfect, with a few flaws, and I\'ll admit a pretty depressing backstory (in terms of slice of life). The series was pretty slow, but the little moments made it better. Overall, not bad, but it ends with a cliff hanger, which just makes it a little worse. into the school the story focuses on and gives off a vibe of a very nonchalant, mind-my-own-business person.

At first glance, this may seem like a basic sports anime about tennis. Well it\'s not. Don\'t get me wrong, a huge aspect of this series is about a group of boys trying to revive their tennis team, but the characters also deal with many hardships in their personal lives. This includes bullying, abuse, transphobia, mental health issues, and more. The LGBTQ+ representation is quite good. The main character also explains what it\'s like to be transgender in a very informative way. This anime also ends...on a huge cliffhanger. There\'s no explanation of what happens afterwards. There\'s no season 2, and not even a manga. There\'s simply a short 2 minute ""movie"" about the characters two years later. I couldn\'t find a version of it with English subtitles. Overall, very good anime :) on a huge cliffhanger. There\'s no explanation of what happens afterwards. There\'s no season 2, and not even a manga.

I also think the lgbt aspects were handled amazingly which is very rare for most anime. I do wish the story got to complete itself instead of being cut off halfway through but I also wish the main character was written differently. He just kind of shows up and is naturally good at everything from tennis to helping people process their issues and he's not very bad at anything at all. (spoilers ahead) The...only troubles he really faces are with his father and thats obviously out of his control and not a flaw to his character. The most character he was given was in the last few minutes of the show when he bought the knife and decided he wanted to kill his dad with it, the rest of the show was just him being perfect in every way. I loved all the other characters though, I think the girl's issues with bullying and how she handles it could have been gone over more but I think it only got brushed over because of the abrupt end of the series, everyone on the team who wasnt the main character had really well written personalitys and arcs in my opinion and I hope the show eventually gets a second season so we can see more of them and watch the main character do anything besides being perfect at everything all the time. only troubles he really faces are with his father and thats obviously out of his control and not a flaw to his character.

You are left with a terrible cliffhanger that frustrated me to so many levels, because I was hoping to get some closure...It's not for everyone, definitely. It touches some (a lot of) topics that many people might not like or be really interested in... but it definitely gives you this way of looking at things with humour, drama, and a lot of motivation, haha.Love this, I would've put a Masterpiece 10 if the story had ended.

I don't think amazing art was the goal.  This anime is like a dark Prince of Tennis or Yowamushi Pedal. When I say dark I mean that it has too many elements of real life. It is all messed up, but tragically the reality for many who come from a broken home life. I've known that of those types of abuse. Seeing it puts it in another light that I would not have been able to imagine. I kind of hope there is...a second season and the cliffhanger doesn't go through.

I am no stranger to viewers or readers disliking an anime or manga that I liked, after all, I liked King\'s Game (although I can see why people think it\'s bad). The truth is this anime (excuse my language) pissed me off.Let\'s break this into 5 sections:- Animation:- Passion:- Story:- Pacing:- Execution:ANIMATION: To start, Star\'s Align (Hoshiai no Sora) animation is good. It was the main reason why I chose to watch it in the first place. Its animation created an overall vibe of Serene and Peace. It\'s so calming and...peaceful to look at. I feel that this animation had the potential for more. The story wanted to go into a darker route (this will be explained later) and because of its fluffy and calming look, they could have used it to create a more chaotic and disturbed look. A popular example would be Madoka Magical, but I think that Miracle Man is even more fitting. Outside of its wasted potential, I think that ANIMATION gets a...8.0 star rating!STORY: What is this anime about? You already understand that, if you don\'t take a brief look at the synopsis for me. That synopsis explains the plot of most great Sports anime. An underdog fighting for their place in the world. Junior High kids struggling with the darker side of Middle School. Teenagers and bonding and stuff! The anime did all of this stuff... They did. They introduced us to each of their problems. 12 episodes and I can tell you for certain... That it was all nonsense.The plot aspect makes sense. 8.0 out of 10.0 just for that. (MASSIVE SPOILER ALERTS: YOU CAN SKIP PAST THIS PART TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU DON\'T WANT TO READ) **The truth is, many of us deal with abusive fathers or being adopted or not fitting in, or having a bad mother (let me tell you, every character but two has a bad mother) I can relate to the mother issues. The problem with this anime is that it introduces every character\'s problems and doesn\'t even know where to go with it. The fact that every one of them has a horrible home life and hates being at home because (they\'re adopted) is convoluted on its own. Why? Why does everyone have to deal with some form of abuse? This anime is about Soft Tennis, and yet they put more effort into painting everyone\'s life as shitty than they do with games. Why did I watch one (set) of the characters playing, then fall into a slideshow of them losing?5.0 star rating!PASSION: This is the one thing that I wanted to see. This anime does not care about the sport that the story revolves around. Soft Tennis is a little-known sport, the same as Racquetball. You can recognize it, but not very many would choose Soft Tennis or regular Tennis. In a sense, Ping Pong (Table Tennis) is more well-known. My issue, my biggest gripe with this story, is that it shows no passion whatsoever for anything to do with Soft Tennis. The marathon scene (is what I\'ll call it) In that scene, they play music, they put close-ups on the character\'s faces, and they use IMPACT FRAMES! I feel nothing. There was no build-up. Nothing set that scene up, or the scene before that. A slight spoiler, if you wanted to use this scene as ""Maki officially joining the team"" maybe build up to it more. In a sense, they did... But it was EXECUTED poorly. Maki should never have fit in. Not only that, but the Tennis Club should have been bigger. You don\'t have to focus on all of them right away, that was an issue the anime had without the extra characters. But at least use more characters, and more time to make Maki an unwanted member. It would have felt forced, but so did their method of making Maki this smug prodigy without much going for him outside of that description. This is actually the thing that I\'m most hung up on, but I wrote CHARACTERS before this (even though it\'s after) and I\'m burnt.4.0 star rating! Unless it\'s about abuse storylines, then it becomes a 10.0 star rating! Because they love that...CHARACTERS: I think that Maki has potential. I can accept his family issues the most, they drive home that feeling of fear and abuse. It would also help the narrative and plot push forward. My favorite characters in this anime are Yuta, Kinako, and Shinjo. The others, aside from maybe Arashi, could be removed and it wouldn\'t affect me, it may even drive the story further. Ameno is a one-off jerk with murderous tendencies. I watched the entire anime, and I still don\'t understand what his problem with Maki was about. Outside of that, he isn\'t memorable in the slightest. Soga is a character that I kind of like after hindsight (couldn\'t stand him when watching) and is the loudest and least likely one to back it up. He sounds violent, like all the time, then that DARK HOME LIFE plot kicks in and they literally sideline his character... As if he wasn\'t the most vocal of the bunch. Shingo was irrelevant and a poor man\'s Soga who wasn\'t interesting one bit. I liked Kinako, her problems were the most realistic, and her character was as awkward as her issue. But man, aside from them forcing her into the plot, she was unneeded for most of the scenes... Unless they wanted to explain rules that were already explained before. Yuta had the plotline that I wanted to see the most. I mean, hiding your sexuality, being in love with one of the cast members, and being in charge of the Soft Tennis team while being an easy bully target has its potential. Such waste that he was thrown to the side. Shinjo has the most sports-related issues, with the problem with his mother (unneeded truthfully) constantly living in his legendary brother\'s shadow, and his brother reminded me of Ace (One Piece). But his home problems and backstory weren\'t clear at all... I could gather the basic things, but they didn\'t even try to go further into it. I THOUGHT THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD! That alone is a plot point. Kinuyo was painted as the clear antagonist. She wanted that club shut down, she held high standards, she wasn\'t likable, and she came from a rich family. She was focused on slightly at the beginning of the story, not a main character but a building presence. Then they give her her own episode. It was unneeded. You won\'t need to care for her before or after. Her entire character changes, she becomes (essentially) nice, and then she RARELY shows up. And don\'t bring up Futsu with him being adopted. That was poorly EXECUTED, a decent premise, but poorly executed. I mean, kids are adopted. Being raised by loving parents and them clearly loving you AND then feeling unwanted is something that adopted kids do. Some were adopted into families just to be shunned by other members of the family, or have this feeling of ""I don\'t fit in."" or get abused by their family. He didn\'t have any of that. Might as well just pursue the ""Gon route"" and place the burden on him. The parents did nothing wrong, and the story doesn\'t seem to care outside of ""Don\'t mention this to Maki"" either. Make him solely want to pursue his biological parents. They\'re teenagers, and even small children can make these decisions. Funny enough, I relate to Nao\'s story on a personal level. We have very similar mothers. I just don\'t like him as a character and I don\'t want to get into the reasons why. Outside of Shingo and Ameno, he\'s part of the ""worst""6.0 star rating!PACING: They had 12 episodes. I just mentioned 11 characters with problematic backstories, we should include the adults brought into this anime, and the fact that they have to blow their way through a Soft Tennis tournament. The anime\'s ending was meant to build for the next season, with ALL of them having a darker end to Season 1. They don\'t pace this anime well. I understand that pacing is an issue, so I won\'t dig into them. But if they were expecting a Season 2, maybe leave some of these issues for Season 2. Half of these characters\' backstories didn\'t need to be explored so early. And all of them didn\'t need a dark story. My lord.5.0 star rating!EXECUTION: 4.0 star rating!The truth is, most of my gripe is because they tried to make a Sports anime but they really wanted to make a ""Tortured coming of age anime"" The sports aspect was unnecessary and carelessly took time away from what they wanted to write. I do, however, recommend watching this. You\'ll get something out of it. peaceful to look at. I feel that this animation had the potential for more.

The marathon scene (is what I\'ll call it) In that scene, they play music, they put close-ups on the character\'s faces, and they use IMPACT FRAMES! I feel nothing. There was no build-up. Nothing set that scene up, or the scene before that. A slight spoiler, if you wanted to use this scene as ""Maki officially joining the team"" maybe build up to it more. In a sense, they did... But it was EXECUTED poorly. Maki should never have fit in. Not only that, but the Tennis Club should have been bigger. You don\'t have to focus on all of them right away, that was an issue the anime had without the extra characters. But at least use more characters, and more time to make Maki an unwanted member. It would have felt forced, but so did their method of making Maki this smug prodigy without much going for him outside of that description. This is actually the thing that I\'m most hung up on, but I wrote CHARACTERS before this (even though it\'s after) and I\'m burnt.4.0 star rating! Unless it\'s about abuse storylines, then it becomes a 10.0 star rating! Because they love that...CHARACTERS: I think that Maki has potential. I can accept his family issues the most, they drive home that feeling of fear and abuse. It would also help the narrative and plot push forward. My favorite characters in this anime are Yuta, Kinako, and Shinjo. The others, aside from maybe Arashi, could be removed and it wouldn\'t affect me, it may even drive the story further. Ameno is a one-off jerk with murderous tendencies. I watched the entire anime, and I still don\'t understand what his problem with Maki was about. Outside of that, he isn\'t memorable in the slightest. Soga is a character that I kind of like after hindsight (couldn\'t stand him when watching) and is the loudest and least likely one to back it up. He sounds violent, like all the time, then that DARK HOME LIFE plot kicks in and they literally sideline his character... As if he wasn\'t the most vocal of the bunch. Shingo was irrelevant and a poor man\'s Soga who wasn\'t interesting one bit. I liked Kinako, her problems were the most realistic, and her character was as awkward as her issue. But man, aside from them forcing her into the plot, she was unneeded for most of the scenes... Unless they wanted to explain rules that were already explained before. Yuta had the plotline that I wanted to see the most. I mean, hiding your sexuality, being in love with one of the cast members, and being in charge of the Soft Tennis team while being an easy bully target has its potential. Such waste that he was thrown to the side. Shinjo has the most sports-related issues, with the problem with his mother (unneeded truthfully) constantly living in his legendary brother\'s shadow, and his brother reminded me of Ace (One Piece). But his home problems and backstory weren\'t clear at all... I could gather the basic things, but they didn\'t even try to go further into it. I THOUGHT THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD! That alone is a plot point. Kinuyo was painted as the clear antagonist. She wanted that club shut down, she held high standards, she wasn\'t likable, and she came from a rich family. She was focused on slightly at the beginning of the story, not a main character but a building presence. Then they give her her own episode. It was unneeded. You won\'t need to care for her before or after. Her entire character changes, she becomes (essentially) nice, and then she RARELY shows up. And don\'t bring up Futsu with him being adopted. That was poorly EXECUTED, a decent premise, but poorly executed. I mean, kids are adopted. Being raised by loving parents and them clearly loving you AND then feeling unwanted is something that adopted kids do. Some were adopted into families just to be shunned by other members of the family, or have this feeling of ""I don\'t fit in."" or get abused by their family. He didn\'t have any of that. Might as well just pursue the ""Gon route"" and place the burden on him. The parents did nothing wrong, and the story doesn\'t seem to care outside of ""Don\'t mention this to Maki"" either. Make him solely want to pursue his biological parents. They\'re teenagers, and even small children can make these decisions. Funny enough, I relate to Nao\'s story on a personal level. We have very similar mothers. I just don\'t like him as a character and I don\'t want to get into the reasons why. Outside of Shingo and Ameno, he\'s part of the ""worst""6.0 star rating!PACING: They had 12 episodes. I just mentioned 11 characters with problematic backstories, we should include the adults brought into this anime, and the fact that they have to blow their way through a Soft Tennis tournament. The anime\'s ending was meant to build for the next season, with ALL of them having a darker end to Season 1. They don\'t pace this anime well. I understand that pacing is an issue, so I won\'t dig into them. But if they were expecting a Season 2, maybe leave some of these issues for Season 2. Half of these characters\' backstories didn\'t need to be explored so early. And all of them didn\'t need a dark story. My lord.5.0 star rating!EXECUTION: 4.0 star rating!The truth is, most of my gripe is because they tried to make a Sports anime but they really wanted to make a ""Tortured coming of age anime"" The sports aspect was unnecessary and carelessly took time away from what they wanted to write. I do, however, recommend watching this. You\'ll get something out of it.', 'Waring to those who have yet to watcha and are looking to watch this show, there are possible triggers and it does deal with sensitive topics.Honestly, if you are watching this and hoping for an anime revolving around sports, this maybe isn\'t the one you wanna watch. I would say that this story is more centered around the drama and slice of life tags. The sport part is mainly used as a way for the characters to escape their everyday lives.

And I wouldn’t normally have a problem with the level of drama going on in this series, if say, we were actually talking about a class of delinquents which suddenly started playing soft tennis because a new teacher suddenly came in and used soft tennis to the path of redemption.Except, we’re not talking about a class of delinquents, so the fact every single player on the team has some kind of dysfunctional parent isn’t just not justified within the narrative they’re trying to tell, it’s also unrealistic that every...single one of these kids found their way to the soft tennis club let alone.Actually, every single player on the team having some kind of dysfunctional parent isn’t quite right, as there is one for whom we never see the parents of and another for whom the question of dysfunctional parent is questionable, yet it feels to the viewer like it’s every parent due to the pacing, which—The pacing for the drama is definitely to fast paced for the twelve episodes we’re given and is the kind of drama expected of something that would be paced out for double the number of episodes. It’s not the kind of pacing one would want for the first twelve episodes of a twenty-four episode series either.Yet, those are only two of the problems with the drama.Specifically, I found myself fact checking, with the urge to do so starting with Maki’s mother bringing up a restraining order against his father and how she was struggling to  do so followed by his father showing up and claiming he had unlimited visitation rights, which to me didn’t add up given his history of abuse—abuse which we learn very early on was directed at Maki....And so I fact checked.I fact checked and learned that Maki’s father would have very limited visitation rights over in Japan as he is the non-custodial parent. These rights are also hard to enforce for non-custodial parents who aren’t abusive like Maki’s father, yet involve meeting in a place near where the child lives and not where the child lives. Yet, all of this is thrown out the window for Maki’s father to create drama, while we’re also supposed to believe that.And despite there being record of Maki’s father abusing him, that it’s difficult to secure a restraining order despite having a record with the police and being willing to secure a restraining order, the latter of which is contrary to the norm, yet this drama was still going on in Maki’s life, to the point the viewer finds themselves coming to the following conclusion.The drama is done for drama’s sake only. That, or for fleshing out the characters to which it is the only thing used to flesh out the characters.It also doesn’t help either that there is a very anti-adult message going on in the series, with adults doing the thing the drama calls for them to do rather than doing the logical thing the adults would do. It doesn’t help that the way the soft tennis boy’s team is treated is also questionable when one stops and thinks given how Ryouma is an alumni whose time is no distant memory, so why the boy’s team gets the worn out gear and the lack of time on the court doesn’t actually make sense.…Except, of course, if one considers that Maki is in fact a Gary Stu.Drama which shouldn’t exist—in other words the soft tennis club being in the straights it is despite Ryouma having not been that long ago a champion which would make the school put some kind of effort into the team—exists so Maki can come in and save them. And save them he does, being good at the sport simply because he can be.Mind you, as I talk about this there are a lot of sports anime for which there are characters who are like Maki—that unexpected genius. It’s how they’re presented in the narrative that matters, that determines whether they end up being a Mary Sue/Gary Stu, which is why focus on the sport in a sports series is so important—it helps to make these characters believable.In other words, one of the methods characters in sports series are built up is through their growth in the sport they are pursuing, so the extra drama isn’t actually needed to help flesh out the characters, except for when the narrative calls for it rather than the writer trying to hit all the drama tropes expected for a sports anime.

These types of slice of life anime tend to get overshadowed by big shonen anime, but personally, they’re often the ones I end up enjoying the most. It’s a short show with a simple story but nevertheless very interesting.  As soft tennis is being introduced to the main character Maki, it is also introduced to the viewers, and that is well-done. Before watching the show, I had no idea this sport even existed, but without doing any research on it, I understood the basics...just by watching. That’s because the rules and the moves are introduced gradually and are kept very simple, we don’t need to know about complex technique. Still not once have I felt like the sport was explained to me directly. It’s rather well-done and I thought it would be relevant to raise it.Beside the sport, the show actually deals with abusive parents and social pressure, showing the consequences of that on teenagers. The relationships between parents and children depicted in the show are very interesting and are not as uncommon as one might think. Let’s dive into some of them:Katsuragi Maki – Maki is a great character. He was raised by a violent father and an abused mother, which is a not so uncommon situation, alas. The children of an abusive parent tend to have one or a mix of these personality traits: they can mimic the abusive parent and themselves become abusers, they can act as a victim, letting themselves be targeted by bullies, not being able to stand for themselves, and they can be over-protective with the people they care about. The latter often happens when the child is not the only one to suffer from violence (one of their parents is being abused too, or their siblings). In those cases, the child is going to feel like they have to protect their abused parent/younger siblings… and sometimes even dare to step in to stop the abuser. Maki has this type of behaviour. He easily spots people who are in distress and offer them his aid. He also tries to hide the money his mom leaves for his dad and don’t tell her about his dad’s visits. He wants to protect her from him and from suffering. The only thing about Maki that makes me ponder is the way he seems self-assured and not afraid to speak up, as children of abusive parents tend to be less confident and more withdrawn. Though I am not an expert on the matter, and don’t know anyone around me who suffered from that (thankfully).Shinjou Touma – Touma is not loved by his mother. We can see that he constantly seeks for his mother attention and recognition, when he is being very angry at her, making scenes, or when he desperately tries to tell her that he won several matches. It sometimes happens that a parent “loves” one of their children and despises the others. They usually abuse the children they don’t love while putting the one they love on a pedestal. It’s very likely that these parents don’t actually know how to love a child at all and are just enjoying creating envy and competition for their love among their children. In the case of Touma, I thought at some point that Touma would get angry to see Maki getting so good and so popular among the team, kind of taking his place in the spotlight, and reliving what he goes through at home with his brother. But no. It would have been interesting though.Asuka Yuu – I was so pleased to see a queer character in an anime that is not a yaoi. I feel like homosexual characters in anime/manga are either there for fan service or because the anime revolves around that (I see you all the girls out here binge reading yaoi) or they’re just not represented at all. I might be wrong though because I haven’t read/seen that many manga/anime. One thing that I found interesting about Yuu questioning his identity and gender and the role of his gender in his life (does that make sense?) is that this need to put a label on yourself is one of the issues of the LGBTQ+ community. And I agree with what Maki says, one doesn’t need to put themselves in a box or be pressured to fall under one of the already-established-LGBTQ+-category. Gender is a social construction and most of the time people don’t have a problem with their sex but with the way their sex is considered and represented by society – their gender. “Make up is for girls, but I like wearing make-up, therefore, am I a girl? Not necessarily, maybe you’re just a boy who likes to wear make-up.”Tsukinose Nao – Nao has an overprotective mother, and as it is said in the anime, being overprotecting to the point that you project your dreams and desires onto your child is a form of abuse. The problem is that the parent does not consider the child as an independent person with their own life, personality and goals but as a part of themselves or as their belongings. It’s a very toxic behaviour that is not that much criticized because after all, the parent is just caring for their child, right? No, being overprotective is damaging for the child who might feel smothered and guilty of never being good enough or not being able to meet their parent’s expectations which eventually results in them having low self-esteem and self-confidence. Also from what I have witnessed in my life, when the children are freed from their overprotective parent(s), they tend to be limitless and have dangerous behaviour, as an answer for having been frustrated for so long and/or they can develop anxiety and fear of the outside world, seeing everything as a potential threat. The show makes it clear : no matter the relationship between people, parents -children or lovers, no one belongs to anyone.Kitsue Kanako – At first, she got me a little bit confused because she would spend her time hanging with the boys without them even asking her to be here. My introverted self was quite uncomfortable. But towards the end I understood her better. She didn’t have any friend, and Maki was the only one really nice to her so she just sticks with him because she has no one else to turn to and loneliness feels heavy. I like that even though she is a side character and seem to do nothing but follow the guys around, an other side of her is shown, her goals, her interests, her fears, her feelings. She not just watches the boys train and play but uses this as an opportunity to practice her drawing skills, she wants to become an artist though that job is not regarded as a “real job” or at least a proper job, she is scared her parents won’t let her do this, or people will consider her as dumb for choosing that path. Also she has the awkwardness of an introverted and I relate lol.There’s more to say but I’ll stop here. The end let me confused. *spoilers to come* It’s not uncommon that parents or children victim of abuse kill their abuser. It can be either during a fight, when they feel like their life is in danger and if they don’t act now this is it for them or sometimes it can be premeditated. It’s a choice they are willing to make as a very last resort, the only way for them to protect themselves and their family. But it killing is not something trivial. And what got me confused is Maki’s smile on his face when he’s about to take action. It feels weird and out of place, as it killing his father was pleasurable, it is probably going to relieve him from a tremendous weight, but will never free him from the trauma he got from 15 years of being abused. Anyway, this is way too long already but I’m looking forward to seeing how the story unfolds in the second part of the season.Also I think the show lacks a little something. The author seems to keep their distance with the characters. Their emotions lack depth and intensity. We need more close up shots, more exaggeration. In order to convey emotions to the viewers, animated shows have to exaggerate the characters emotions, maybe push it so far that it's almost a caricature. Still obviously one has to know when to push it and when not to. One last thing is that all the boys from the soft tennis club have dysfunctionnal families, resultin in the show to spread itself too much, and it's going to be difficult to deal with every character's situation in just 24 episodes. Maybe it would have better to just pick like three characters and focus on them. Quality is better than quantity. This show has a great potential and some of the topics that it covers are rarely dealt with in anime so I’ll give it that. just by watching. That’s because the rules and the moves are introduced gradually and are kept very simple, we don’t need to know about complex technique.

This show has a great potential and some of the topics that it covers are rarely dealt with in anime so I’ll give it that."", 'i gotta say i was OBSESSED with this show as it was coming out. the ending was absolutely devastating for me and shook me to my core.I\'m a sucker for angst and pain so this was right up my alley honestly. The overall plot definitely had space to grow. This is a nearly episodic show where they explore a new character and background most episodes. The art was amazing in this show, and the opening and closing were both very strong both artistically and soundwise. The soundtrack for this show was quite solid and the opening and ending songs both bop.Where this show...lacks in story, it makes up in characters. Since each episode you learn about a new character you get really attached to them. However, this show ended prematurely and most of their issues never really got sorted out. This did make me drop the rating a little. This show does deal with heavy themes such as abuse, bullying, and homophobia/transphobia.Overall, while I personally enjoyed this show a ton for the angst factor, it does fall short in many ways. The ending came out of nowhere and could\'ve been built up a lot more. It was shocking rather and disjointed and couldn\'t have been predicted. It felt like an ending that was slapped on (which it kind of was because the show was supposed to be longer), kind of like the ""and they all lived happily ever after"" or ""and they all died"" trope regardless of all the untied ends. I would recommend this show for people who enjoy constant pain (maybe fanfic readers?? idek...). it\'s not for everyone, but i thought it was one of the better shows of the season. lacks in story, it makes up in characters.

It is an average school and everyday sports club genre. But with their own personal problems interfering with their lives and their softball tennis club, it is tough to focus to stay in a mental state, and it is based on how it is in the real world and only focusing on their daily lives than sports; it would give me shocking moments. That is just how it is in the real world, sadly. The ending...on the last episode was like a wtf moment?!

Most of the top sports anime (I’m thinking Haikyu!, Ookiku Furikabutte, Run With the Wind) are about competition, teamwork, and striving to be the best, and though they do delve into the personal lives of the players, they rarely delve into dark places. Stars Align is different: it shines a light into the realities of growing up as the kids navigate abuse, bullying, queerness, parental incompatibility/control, social anxiety, adoption (I could go on).The animation quality is spectacular, the soundtrack perfectly crafted, and the characters are nuanced,...lovable, and relatable.The sad thing is that the anime is incomplete as the director Kazuki Akane had intended the anime to run for 24 episodes, but it was cut short late in the process by the production company to 12 episodes.Praying for its completion. lovable, and relatable.The sad thing is that the anime is incomplete as the director Kazuki Akane had intended the anime to run for 24 episodes, but it was cut short late in the process by the production company to 12 episodes.Praying for its completion.', ""I've never watched sports anime for sports. It's always been for the characters and story. I've never been athletic or showed much interest in sports, so I rarely gave sports anime a try but I have managed to fall in love with a couple (Haikyuu was the gateway drug)Stars Align had been on my radar for a while and I was not disappointed by it. It had a great representation of LGBTQ+ people and as a Non-binary person myself, I really appreciated that.I know some reviewers have complained that every character seems to have some sort of trauma or abuse in their lives,...which I personally didn't have a problem with. Instead of cramming all the trauma and abuse onto a couple of characters, they spread it out, showed what different types of abuse and trauma looked like in different people.There course some flaws, such as I think the pacing was a little off at times and sometimes the matches bored me but I think that's just a personal preference more than anything else. I did think the tennis scenes were a little repetitive, but that's the case with most sports anime I've watched.I also think the people giving it 1 star are being a little harsh. Yes, it's not perfect, but I don't think it totally failed or bombed at what it was going for. I think with more episodes, it could become a really well-rounded anime. They cut it from 24 episodes to only 12 so that makes sense.

I came across Stars Align and upon viewing knew that this wasn't a normal sports anime.I like the setting, characters, how the boys team isn't good and so they get hand-me-down gear that the more successful girls soft tennis team has...used. The art in the show is very consistent.Stars Align is trying to address deeper social issue and there is nothing wrong with that but, every character in the anime seems to have something or the other going on for them. I understand that life isn't perfect, I know that from first-hand experience just like most everyone else. We all have our struggles but, the way the show portrays it is just that every character has a different social or identity issue with themselves or that is forced upon them by their family. It's not that I don't like it, growing up in India I have seen what tiger or helicopter parenting does to someone but, it took a long time for a friend of mine to come out of that situation and for us as friends to gain his trust so he could share his struggles and burdens with us. When you want to cater or address that many social issues with all the side characters, you have to pace it in a way that conveys their struggle. Some of their troubles were believable and some just weren't, I would say that the problem isn't that the writing is poor and is unable to convince us rather that the writers were given too short of a time to deliver all these emotions to the audience and failed at some, rightfully so.While it addresses all these social issues and tries to be grounded it also does the exact opposite in the sport aspect of the anime as the main character Maki who hasn't played a sport in his entire life, who upon his introduction is shown to have good stamina because he prefers to use the stairs instead of elevators (which is a good and healthy habit that I employ occasionally) but, does that mean I can pick up a tennis racket and be a genius at it, NO. Even if I were to suspend that disbelief with it being an anime and all, where does Maki learn tennis and doubles team strategy? He just started the sport, they could've at least given the strategy and picking the doubles team to Toma, because he has spent time on the court and played with the other members for a longer time than Maki but, Maki just had to do everything. I picked up Badminton after a decade of playing it as a hobby myself and I've been able to improve my skills on the court better (playing every weekend) but, my strategy is pretty much crap and my doubles partner keeps me in check with what to do so we don't clash on the court. Ok, so maybe Maki isn't as stupid as I am but that still doesn't land well when the anime wants to portray such grounded realism with the problems all the characters are facing in their everyday life but, becomes a full-on sports anime on the court. I would say that all out sports anime do a better job even though they are very cliche and cheesy but they at least show the characters spending most of their time in the court and just not becoming a genius after touching the ball, racket, bat, etc.Having said all this and realizing that this is now my longest review on MAL for an anime, Stars Align is worth watching.

I don't particularly enjoy sports animes, but maybe that's why I ended up enjoying this one so much.Of course, there are many scenes of soft tennis being played, and technical explanations, as I would expect from any sports anime. But, the thing that stood out to me is the awesome character development.The main character, Maki, lives in a loving home despite being terrorized by his father who's divorced from his mother. He clearly has childhood trauma and continued trauma relating to this relationship. He finds comfort and strength through...his teammates and newfound passion for the sport. It's beautiful to watch that develop.The reason I don't have any problems with the slow reveal that every single player on the team has problems as home is because that is COMPLETELY REALISTIC. In middle and high school, I personally didn't know many people who had a wonderful and loving home life, and who used school activities and time with their friends to find a place of comfort and self expression.

Do not kid yourself with this series, this is not a sports anime. It is a drama that wears the skin of a sports title.

The art style is pretty basic in nature, so do not expect anything spectacular or breathtaking.if you are looking at this title because you want to see a sports anime: APPROACH WITH CAUTION ', ""I am writing this review after completing all 12 episodes, watching one per day.### Story ### (5.0)It becomes clear throughout this series that (soft) tennis is only the background context. It's a somewhat twisted drama. I'm sure many like me have started this show with the wrong expectations.There are two distinct universes in this show: school and not school. When the protagonists are at school, the show is about what you'd expect from a typical slice of life with a bit of stuff you'd see from full-on sports anime. It's cheerful, silly, and inspiring, save for that one bullying scene. When the protagonists are...not at school, however, it's the polar opposite. Especially when each character has to come face to face with a parent that doesn't seem to love them. There's disagreements, abuse, even some blood.I can't really comment on how realistic or exaggerated these bad parent-child relationship conflicts are compared to real life, but seeing nearly all of these characters being driven to a corner was beyond the line for me. The dark parts of this story weigh heavier than the light parts. I can certainly understand mentioning societal issues like non-binary gender and LGBT+, but overall I found the message of the show to be confusing.I had hoped that the show wouldn't end on a bad note. The last few episodes, where the group really gets to play tennis, got my hopes up, but the very last sequence of scenes was like a stab at the heart. Need I say more?### Art: Animation ### (7.0)The animation is average all around, be it dialogue or action. I wish there was more action when the protagonists are playing in a match; we are just shown a few transition frames with score counts in most cases. I'm guessing it wasn't the focus though.### Art: Design and Quality ### (7.5)The artwork here focuses less on details and more on color palette. The light scenes are pretty much all sunny with a blue sky. The dark scenes are pretty much a grim atmosphere. Considering the story, I'd say it works well in their favour.### Sound: Music ### (6.7)Not much to note here. Much of the same soundtrack plays throughout the show. It's light and fluffy, not really dramatic at all.### Sound: Opening and Ending Songs ### (7.0)The show maintains one opening and one ending song as expected. Both songs are decent, playing at crucial or pivotal times in the show. The accompanying animation for the ending song represents each character's personality in a dance-off, kinda amusing to watch.### Sound: Voice Acting ### (7.0)The voice acting is pretty good, if not a bit stiff. Each voice actor suited their respective character nicely, with tame levels of shyness, fear, arrogance, and happiness.### Character: Development ### (7.0)From the beginning, the protagonists have distinctive personalities that have yet to escape the bubble of shyness and reluctance. Their changes in self esteem and having fun throughout the show is realistic and better than average I would say. Unfortunately, there are bad relationships between our protagonists and their parent(s): being the unfavored child compared to the siblings, being too distant, or a case of conflicting ideals. What's more unfortunate is that those parents do not change as much as our fellow protagonists.### Enjoyment ### (4.0)As the show went on I found it harder to look forward to watching the next episode, mostly because of my concerns with the story.### Overall: Final Thoughts ### (6.0)Stars Align seems to be an experimental show with two unlike themes mixing together to make a somewhat watchable slice of life drama with a sports context. It's an original anime with no sign of a continued story. The positives of this show are no match for its negatives, but however threatening it may seem, it has allowed me to appreciate the healthy relationship I have with my family and my friends. not at school, however, it's the polar opposite.

Considering the story, I'd say it works well in their favour.### Sound: Music ### (6.7)Not much to note here. Much of the same soundtrack plays throughout the show. It's light and fluffy, not really dramatic at all.### Sound: Opening and Ending Songs ### (7.0)The show maintains one opening and one ending song as expected. Both songs are decent, playing at crucial or pivotal times in the show. The accompanying animation for the ending song represents each character's personality in a dance-off, kinda amusing to watch.### Sound: Voice Acting ### (7.0)The voice acting is pretty good, if not a bit stiff. Each voice actor suited their respective character nicely, with tame levels of shyness, fear, arrogance, and happiness.### Character: Development ### (7.0)From the beginning, the protagonists have distinctive personalities that have yet to escape the bubble of shyness and reluctance. Their changes in self esteem and having fun throughout the show is realistic and better than average I would say. Unfortunately, there are bad relationships between our protagonists and their parent(s): being the unfavored child compared to the siblings, being too distant, or a case of conflicting ideals. What's more unfortunate is that those parents do not change as much as our fellow protagonists.### Enjoyment ### (4.0)As the show went on I found it harder to look forward to watching the next episode, mostly because of my concerns with the story.### Overall: Final Thoughts ### (6.0)Stars Align seems to be an experimental show with two unlike themes mixing together to make a somewhat watchable slice of life drama with a sports context. It's an original anime with no sign of a continued story. The positives of this show are no match for its negatives, but however threatening it may seem, it has allowed me to appreciate the healthy relationship I have with my family and my friends."", 'For starters, this is NOT a sports anime. This is an abused - kid anime masquerading as a sports anime. I\'m not sure why the sports aspect is even in it unless its creator threw that in in hopes of getting more viewers due to how popular sports animes are, because the sports aspect is cursory at best. They cover forehand and backhand strokes and follow - through and ... that\'s pretty much it?? And though a couple of the characters make the expected declaration about how they love ""soft tennis"" (regular tennis except played with a soft, squishy ball) more than anything, the amount...of time spent on actual games is far less than most sports animes.But the lazily covered sports stuff takes time away from fully exploring the abused - kid aspect of the show, which seems to be what the creator really wanted to cover. Aside from the 2 main characters, each member of the team\'s abusive family situation is introduced sufficient to get the gist and that\'s it; nothing is ever resolved ... and it ends on a quite shocking related cliff - hanger. There will be no more of the show; it didn\'t get a second season, although the creator said he would like to put online what he planned to have happen in season two. So if you do decide to watch, be aware there will be no resolution whatsoever for any of the upsetting abusive situations any of the characters find themselves in.The creator of this show also made Noein, of which I am a huge fan, and though Noein has lots going for it, the main descriptor I\'ve always used for it is ""deep."" It\'s metaphorical, it works on multiple levels, it beautifully and thoroughly explores many themes. And ... the same cannot be said for Stars Align. It is not deep. What you see is what you get. There is no deeper meaning to anything that happens; they play tennis, they hang out together, and they get abused. That\'s it.Yet despite all of that, I kept watching, and I missed getting to watch it when it was over. It\'s not a show I would recommend to anyone since nothing happens and nothing is resolved, so what was it that kept me coming back?The main thing is the characters, particularly the main character, Maki. He seems like a jerk when you first meet him, and then when you see what his home life is like, he suddenly makes perfect sense. I still take inspiration from the main character in Noein, Haruka, who - faced with an impossible situation and almost certain death - nevertheless bravely does what can be done, keeps on going, and never lets her heart grow cold; she feels fully and loves freely. Well, Maki is pretty inspiring, too. Despite his own impossible situation, he pours energy into everything he can affect. He thinks outside the box. He has many skills, which he fully utilizes. He is undeterred by rejection and hatred. He is not susceptible to the kind of us vs them thinking that limits others. It is always interesting watching him interact with others. Most of the other characters are fairly one - dimensional, but he is fascinating and unexpected. There are a few other interesting characters, too, especially a rival from another team whom Maki befriends, and their only fan, a tsundere girl.The animation is ugly and uninspiring. The games played are unrealistic and predictable, such as a new player miraculously winning every point right up until the final point of the game; it feels like it was taken right out of the boilerplate sports anime playbook. This is no Haikyuu, making you vitally interested in the minutiae of a sport you don\'t care about through its creators\' obvious passion for the sport; even the characters that make up the soft tennis team hardly seem to care about soft tennis. (The initial premise is that they\'re an embarrassingly bad team who don\'t seem to care at all about improving.) The whole show seems to be a clumsy mishmash of vague concepts tossed together randomly, like a bad fanfic by someone who romanticizes child abuse and just keeps adding abused characters without any plot or resolution. (There is definitely a LOT of shipping baked in.)

The team's captain, Toma Shinjo, recruits a new student named Maki Katsuragi to join the club under condition of paying him. As all the members of the soft tennis club improve their skills and learn more about each other, all of them have their own family problems that affect them in various ways.Stars Align is a bit of a mixed bag in trying to be both a sports anime and family drama that delves into...a variety of issues that effects the boys of the soft tennis club. But before dabbling into the rather divisive latter element of the series, let's get into the sports element of the series as that is actually pretty straightforward to dabble into. Like many sports anime of its ilk, Stars Align is focused on the improvements of the performance of the soft tennis team. At the start of the series, the majority of the team doesn't take participating in the sport seriously and this negatively affects their reputation among the school. This greatly frustrates Toma, who is determined to do his best in playing the sport and recruits Maki to help him get the rest of the team to take practicing more seriously and develop the confidence to improve themselves. The improvements of the other team members are gradual throughout the anime's run and Stars Align does a solid job at showing off the soft tennis team's efforts start to pay off by later in the series.Now onto the family drama element. To attempt sticking out from other sports anime, Stars Align explores the family lives of each of the members of the soft tennis club and all of them have their personal issues with family affecting them in some form. Attempting to mix this focus in with a sports anime is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the series believably explores a variety of issues that affect teens in some form within Japanese culture. Issues such as family abuse, adoption, divorce, parental pressure, and gender identity are explored within the series and each member is affected by one of these issues in some form when the series explores their family lives.On the other hand, the family drama has a bad habit of getting in the way of the developments of the soft tennis team, as it often felt added in just for the sake of drama. It seems a bit too convenient that all the team members happen to have their own family issues affecting them. The attempt at trying to blend Stars Align's focus on both slice-of-life sports and family drama causes the story direction to get quite muddled at points, most notably in the show's second half when more of the soft tennis club member's family lives get explored within the series. For a 12-episode TV anime, trying to focus on so many characters within such a short episode length doesn't work too well within this series and it especially doesn't help that the series doesn't have the time to resolve the personal family issues that it chose to focus on.The final episode of Stars Align features a rather dark twist in its ending that leaves things inconclusive following the light-hearted mood shown with the soft tennis team participating in a tournament. This sudden twist feels quite anti-climactic and clashes badly with the more somber and dramatic moods depicted from earlier episodes. To my understanding from some recent news I've heard, Stars Align was originally planned to be a 24-episode series, but the production committee of the series chose to cut the series length in half. Because this news got to animation studio 8 Bit well into their production of the series, they didn't have the time to restructure the anime's plot into a 12-episode format thus having to leave the series as it was up to that point. What makes this behind-the-scenes issue especially bad is that Stars Align is an original series and not based on any ongoing source material thus there's no way for fans of it to be able to see what happens with it beyond the anime, regardless of their thoughts on its premise. Whether or not a second season comes along to continue Stars Align's plot will likely come down to the show's popularity with fans and developments in the production of a possible follow-up.Overall, I suppose my thoughts of Stars Align is quite mixed. The developments of the soft tennis club are solid to see unfold. But while the attempt to explore personal issues with the family lives of th the club members is an admirable one, it often gets in the way of the team's developments feeling added on just for the sake of drama and the show's 12-episode length was just not enough to devote focus on the personal issues of so many characters, even with the recent news that came out with the anime's production issues. Setting aside the messy behind-the-scenes situation and the inconclusive ending, your mileage will likely vary with how well you warm up to the mix of slice-of-life sports and family drama offered with Stars Align. a variety of issues that effects the boys of the soft tennis club.

Because I felt kinda disappointed at the end. I\'ve watched the firsts 7 episodes straights because the show had a good rythm, but it lost it during the last episodes, that are either too slow or too rushed (especially the ending)I am somewhat frustrated because it began really nicely and thought there was finally a show that deals about serious subjects such as abuse, bullying and LGBTQ+ characters but is also ""plot focused"" (on sport events).I think this show had some good ideas but...in the end they were poorly executed. I read somewhere that there had to be 24 episodes at first but then they decided to make only 12 so it can explain this brutal ending. Maybe it lacks of ""normal"" supports characters (who have no tragic background or shitty parents to deal with)So, I\'m not gonna blame the story writters for daring to make something new, but I hope there will be more slice of life animes which deals with serious issues and with more character development.Also, I am sorry if my review is hard to read but english is not my mother tongue.

I started my year off with this 12-episode anime series about the sport of Soft Tennis, popular in East Asia but virtually unknown elsewhere. I'm not really one for sports series because they tend to follow the exact same structure almost universally, but this one's really interesting because it basically takes the entire team of middle schoolers and peels back the layers to show the quite broken or complicated family lives each one of them has. There are some really mean parents in this show!It covers all sorts of topics like depression, neglect, abuse, poverty, and all that stuff that Japanese dramas...often handle really poorly... and I won't say it did an amazing job here, but it was sometimes so over the top that it sort of worked. Unlike certain other shows I wasn't ever actively put off by it, at least, so it's no Angel Beats or anything.Much more interesting to me was the fact that the story features, with great care in every case, character types that are often completely ignored in Japanese animation (or animation in general): an overweight character (not maligned in any way), half-Japanese character (which you almost never see in anime), and even a nonbinary character (which you NEVER see in anime). Just representing these types of people in a story that has nothing to do with them... it really, really leaves a positive mark even if it doesn't affect the quality of the show in any way.And unfortunately it's just a sports anime so it's not exactly anything groundbreaking.

Faced with a laughing stock club with a dwindling set of members, trying to balance the books and ashamed of how this 'sore thumb' club sticks out compared to the girls soft tennis club, the student council gives them an ultimatum - win a match at regionals in the summer or the club gets disbanded for good.Toma Shinjo is the president of the club,...and despite his own potential and work ethic he can't get anything to work. Until he meets a new transfer student he knew back in junior school who he finds, when he manages to catch a stray cat dashing around the class, has outstanding reflexes. As what he sees to be the only way out for the club, he begs this boy, Maki, to join. With no intent on joining (and living in a single parent household where his mum works long hours, he has to dedicate a lot of time to helping with the chores, shopping etc.) he jokingly suggests Toma pay him and he'll join. To his surprise Toma accepts. Somewhat hesitantly, Maki joins the soft tennis club and from then on its the long journey of kicking the club into shape in the space of a few months in the hopes of saving it from the brink of death.We quickly find it's less so about tennis, and more so a character study about fraught family relationships and the impact that can have on vulnerable adolescent boys.Toma has a rocky relationship with his mum, who seemingly no matter what he does sees him as a disappointment compared to his older brother, who used to compete in tennis nationally. Tennis isn't about fun for him- it's about winning and being someone to be proud of when expectations on him are stacked up to the ceiling. Maki, who becomes Toma's pair, gets the most focus - at the end of episode one we find that him and his mum are plagued by his physically abusive and now divorced father for money every few weeks. The mum works long hours for little money- with the father muscling in to skim away money they dont have, the family lives in borderline poverty. As they move house semi-regularly to try and avoid the father (all spoiled due to Japanese laws that allow biological parents to legally apply to find the residence of their children even if they do not have custody), Maki learns to build a front that everything's ok. He's cocky and confident but reserved and detached, and very good at acting like everything's ok, but it's a story of that front cracking open and opening up about his traumatic past and difficult life, and also finding an actual hobby in tennis that makes life something other than work/schoolwork/chores/sleep.The supporting cast, bar practically none, have some sort of unhealthy relationship with at least one of their parents. In the interest of dodging spoilers, i'll go over some of the most interesting ones and err towards ones covered earliest in the show. One boy is trying to come to terms that he's adopted, as he reevaluates his relationship with his parents after he finds they aren't his biological family. Another is protective to the point of abusive, attempting to domineer and keep control of her only child in any way she can even to the point of trying to bully him away from the tennis club he grows more and more to love. One of my favourite characters in the show is an aspiring artist that secretly has a moderate following of fans online, as they sort of put on a brave face in real life while they have to navigate the toxicity of an unsupportive mum and of their own fanbase, responding cruelly as their interests and style changes drastically to what these fans first followed their page for.One of the worst things about the show is that it tries to juggle a character arc for all of these characters and more and leaves development for each lacking. As these stories tangle and trip over eachother, nothing gets concluded satisfactorily. In addition to Maki and Toma, it's trying to give a character arc and develop each member of the entire club (at least 8 people), along with two non-players in its orbit, certain key family members important to them, and establishing personalities for key rivals in other schools' clubs. If that wasn't enough, it attempts to resolve all these plot threads simultaneously rather than giving you the time to digest a few at a time. All this in a one cour show. It's a Herculean task, to say the least.It pays a price on the telling of practically each of these character stories. A plotline about an lgbt character gets promptly forgotten completely after the episode it briefly features in. Whilst Maki is compelling and believable and is given enough screentime and development to be satisfying, its hard to say that for any other characters unless their arc is intentionally brief and succinct for example with Itsuki (whose arc is centralised into a chunk in a single episode, and feels finished).The show was planned to run two cour and, supposedly, relatively late in the game was only given clearance for a single cour, so that helps explain the situation somewhat. But for most of the characters I felt attached to their situation and invested in their story only for it to develop only part way, and that feels quite disappointing when, for a few of the reasons listed below and its uncomfortable and non-prime-time TV friendly forefronting of domestic violence its quite unlikely it will ever get a continuation to resolve things.In the sections it does actually focus on tennis, there's plenty to criticise. For an anime about a tennis club playing, it doesnt actually explain much in terms of the intricacies of the game. Though i learned a lot about some aspects of the game - strong servers are scary, stamina pays off in the ends of longer games, in doubles pairings are hugely important (in terms of being on the same wavelength and communicating, but also accommodating the other players' playstyle and personality and playing to their strengths, and you can abuse the weaker link even if one player seems indomitable a team's only as strong as its weakest link etc), the importance of the mental game and how you can throw even a challenging opponent off-balance by nudging them in the right way (and how gimmicks can gain real results by catching an opponent unprepared and putting them on tilt) - these points are the sole things it ever communicates about the games that get played, and it breezes past everything else in between.Whilst it's good at expanding upon that chosen handful of the intricacies to higher-level play and at explaining the absolute basics, it forgets to establish much of the inbetween. Beyond brief platitudes to the roles of the front and back player and a repeated emphasis on smashes and volleys as confirmed ways to win points capitalising off of errors, as a complete novice to doubles tennis coming into the show i still come out not much wiser on the in and out rhythms, win conditions, roles, movements and shape of a point, a game, and a match of doubles should look like at the show's close. While part of that blame can surely he pointed towards the animation problems i'll detail in the following paragraphs, its also a problem with the show's understanding or at least conveyance of how the game is played to an audience that doesnt have at least some experience in doubles tennis prior.For a sports anime, it's also quite a confusing how its animation is such a weak point. This is usually the easy bit, and something you'd expect to see down pat, particularly in a shorter runtime than your average sports-shonen. It's difficult to find the tennis compelling when the animation looks so shoddy. Though a handful of shots look great, theres a lot of shots that blatantly gets reused, uses very limited animation or just looks lazily made. It infringes on the pacing of the games as it can make it difficult to interpret why someone's winning or losing when there's not much animation budget to spare to animate many of the points in each game. When you do get more than a brief still with a score change layered over it, most actually animated points rely on enough reused animation there's little room for nuance in communicating the improving talents of these supposedly radically improved talent this club develops.In the scenes and episodes the show focuses more on the people than the tennis, the show can pivot off of the broken leg of its limited animation and onto its stronger foot - the candid view on its characters' mental health through harsh family situations that arent handled much in most anime (and certainly not in its genre), and its portrayal of the unspoken atmospheres of the club changing throughout the series as bonds strengthen, talents grow, results turn around.As for other things worth praising in the show, there a few aspects worth mentioning. It's art is very very pretty, and some of its backgrounds are gorgeous (I'm thinking of the riverside walk the gang take to and from school). The pastel colours and simple backgrounds take a leaf from Wandering Son's book, and are some of the biggest reasons I jumped into the show in the first place. The soundtrack is nothing to go crazy over and occasionally suffers from its best tracks getting overused, but it's generally quite a good fit for the show and has a few bops (including one surprisingly math-rocky track I quite liked). The OP is a beautiful track that really captures the wounded but proud, fighting vibe that its communal cast effuse through the show. The ED is, hands down, the best animated part of the show, and is brimming with personality as it shows pairs of its characters dancing each with their own measure of style, bombast, stamina, timing and interest.Hoshiai no Sora was a show I was expecting to love after one episode and came away somewhat disappointed in after thirteen. But having listed all those quite biting points of contention as strong flaws against it's name, I'm surprised I still liked it enough to give it a 6/10. In so many ways, something that's such a mess for most of its runtime is something I shouldn't be so kind to. And that's partly why I'm writing this review - despite all of its glaring faults, the show has heart. It's fascinating, and I hope despite knocking it down a few pegs, it comes across I think it's totally worth your time if you can stomach it's occasionally gratuitous portrayal of domestic abuse and want a sports anime out of the ordinary or a decent character study. and despite his own potential and work ethic he can't get anything to work.

Obviously, all sports anime show us that sports is a great way to channel your energy and frustration into something healthy, and that it’s a good way to connect with people. So far , so good. It’s a formula that a...lot of (good) sports anime follow, so why mess with that. Plus, the animation is clean and quite dynamic.As always, what kind of sport it is doesn’t even really matter. In sports anime ,we care more about the characters, their relationship with each other, their team spirit etc. But it’s exactly the relationship between the characters where the show falls apart for me for a bit.Each episode focuses more or less on one member of the club, but the anime only has 12 episodes. So they introduce someone’s life to us, some of them really messed up. Then something (bad) happens and then it kinda just…ends. We’re all familiar with that concept from older sitcoms where every conflict is resolved within the ~20 min. episode, but here, some pretty serious stuff is shown as something that just ‚is there‚ a if they were saying: ‚hey, look at this character, btw his parents don’t treat him well‘ and then another member talks to him for like 3 minutes about barely the issue and then they play tennis again.That makes it really hard to actually get to know any of the characters, let alone care about them.One thing that I liked about it, though, was the episode on LGBT+. One character is questioning his gender, and the dialogue between him and his friend was very satisfying. You barely get to see actual LGBT+ themes outside of Yuri/Yaoi, and you don’t get to see this in a sports anime (although, if I may say so, all sports anime are low key gay)TL;DR: this anime could have been much, much better if it wasn’t just 12 episodes, so they could have taken their time in introducing their characters better. It would have worked if they focused on the friendship between Maki and Toma, but trying to tell (difficult) stories about the whole cast in a limited number of episodes is just going to be chaotic. Even the sport itself as a positive force in their lives feels more hinted at, I feel the show is lacking in portraying the importance of it, they just talk about it a little (they might as well not play at all if you ask me…)I still think that it can be enjoyable at times, it all depends on your personal expectations and standards, of course. lot of (good) sports anime follow, so why mess with that.

Until further, she got better and I find her interesting somehow.Aside from her, the characters are reasonably realistic. But some of them got out of hand to be completely jackass, so there is a minus for me here, and they made further eps look blatantly family issues, which are straight up downfall to the show.To say about the ending, it's bad and they forced feed us with unnecessary craps put together. It's good enough to end the show right...after they celebrate their matches, instead it's dark and grimy with kids traumatized and shitty parents put together slaughtering their children mental heath. I hate it! And what the hell Maki trying to kill his dad? Whaaat? Is that all you can come up to end the show?Overall, 6/10 is my max bet for this odd family issues show, it has a place to be a gem sport dramatic show, but they just filled with the nonsenses. I hate how it turns out, especially the ending. What a dissapointment! after they celebrate their matches, instead it's dark and grimy with kids traumatized and shitty parents put together slaughtering their children mental heath. I hate it!

After the first match won I didint care if they won or lose. A lot of the anime felt repetitive with the constant practicing, but that's where the diverse characters shine. The drama is good, but it feels completely random and comes at random times. Like how almost all of the bois have bad parents. The ending after the tournament is awesome. If there was a sequel I might watch it really good anime just some bad scenes that should be important. (I heard on tiktok...that they wont be making another season bc it's too dark:< that's upsetting) that they wont be making another season bc it's too dark:< that's upsetting)"", ""The reason I decided to watch HnS is because I've heard it's LGBTQ+ friendly (and I'm always looking for that, especially in anime/manga), and the clips from the show that I've seen involving the protag supporting a non-binary character to be who they are, and talking about a transwoman who he sees as family were very inspiring. So I sat down, watched it, aaaand... it's melodramatic as heck.I expected a show that focused more on the drama than the sports which I wanted, because I'm not exactly crazy about sports in general, but... I didn't think the (melo)drama would be so bad. Actually no,...the stuff with Maki and how his abusive father affects him is fine, but when almost all the kids have parents that are abusive or twisted in some way, it becomes ridiculous. It's not even handled well.The stuff with Nao was especially bad because he decided to have a change of heart out of nowhere. Most of the characters had weak arcs, like Rintaro's arc that led nowhere as far as his selfesteem issues goes. I liked how they handled Yu, they are probably the best character in the show other than Maki. The problem with Maki is that he's a bit of a super human who can do almost anything and everyone are amazed by him, which isn't the case with Yu, so in the end, I would say they are probably the best and most realistic character in the show.The biggest offender is that ending. Like, I get it, sometimes life isn't sushine and rainbows, and sometimes one can have a great day only to have found out that they lost their job or someone they knew suddenly died... life sucks like that. But this isn't life, but a STORY, and a story needs a conclusion. You can't end the story this way and expect that anyone would be satisfied with it. If it was based on a manga or if it was getting another season then fine, but it's an anime original and no s2 in sight, so why not end it properly when they had a chance? Even a happy, cheesy ending would work better than what we actually got.If this show did get a s2, or an ova, or a movie, I would watch it, but only because the ending left me frustrated, not because I'm excited for more.I don't feel like I could recomend this show. The drama isn't well written enough, the sports stuff isn't that exciting and the main characters keeps abusing the same trick to try to win, and while the art style is cute, the animation isn't that great. As far as a drama focused sports series goes, Ping Pong is WAY better and more memorable, so I recomend that one instead. the stuff with Maki and how his abusive father affects him is fine, but when almost all the kids have parents that are abusive or twisted in some way, it becomes ridiculous.
